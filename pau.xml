In recent days Trump has warned Iranian leaders that there will be "hell to pay" if they crack down on the protest movement but has otherwise adopted a wait-and-see attitude.

"I have let them know that if they start killing people, which they tend to do during their riots … we’re going to hit them very hard,” Trump told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt on Thursday.

Human rights groups have alleged that security forces have killed and injured numerous protesters.

But in an interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity on Thursday, Trump only referred to demonstrators being "stomped on" in huge crowds and security forces "shooting the hell out of people" in the past.

The protests are the latest in a series of major demonstrations that have rocked Iran in which the U.S. has spoken up on the side of the opposition.

Trump said he was not inclined now to meet Reza Pahlavi, the exiled crown prince and son of the late Shah of Iran, a sign that he was waiting to see how the crisis plays out before backing an opposition leader.

“I think that we should let everybody go out there and see who emerges,” Trump said. “I’m not sure necessarily that it would be an appropriate thing to do.”

Pahlavi, who lives near Washington, has used social media to call for continued mass demonstrations. In a post on Friday, he called on Trump to get more involved in the crisis with his "attention, support and action."

"You have proven and I know you are a man of peace and a man of your word. Please be prepared to intervene to help the people of Iran," he said.

Earlier this week, a U.S. intelligence community assessment said that the protests were not big enough to challenge the leadership of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, according to a source familiar with U.S. intelligence reports.

But U.S. analysts were watching the situation carefully. The source said: "Prior to the last 24 hours the protests were broadly concentrated in cities where opposition to the regime has always been a thing. Moving to strongholds (like the Supreme Leader's hometown of Mashad) is the significant development."

"We don’t comment on matters of intelligence. As the President has stated repeatedly, if Iran shoots and violently kills peaceful protesters, ‘They will get hit very hard,'" said a White House spokesperson.

The CIA declined to comment.

Iran's unrest has come as Trump is preoccupied with his ouster of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and has been floating the possibility of acquiring Greenland by purchase or military force.

Trump ordered U.S.-led bombing raids on Iranian nuclear facilities last June and has warned he is prepared to do so again if Tehran tries to reconstitute the program.

Asked about his message to the people of Iran, Trump said: "All I can say is you should feel strongly about freedom. There's nothing like freedom. You're brave people. It's a shame what's happened to your country. Your country was a great country."

Alex Vatanka, the director of the Iran program at the Middle East Institute think tank, said Trump appeared to be waiting to see if the protests could succeed in destabilizing Iran’s ruling clerics before he decides to make good on his threats to intervene.

Trump “wants to be on the winning side, but he prefers a quick win, not a win that requires a lot of investment and holding hands, certainly not in the Middle East,” said Vatanka. “To him, that's just against everything he stood for as a politician, going back to when he first ran.”</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 20:25:54 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/K5PDLBPO7VJZFO3GLRLGGNZZHA.jpg?auth=720b77d9e151515c53ea3191cd7005b7a237652c696682a94ef1085b6386f72a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukrainian nationals aboard seized tanker Bella-1, ambassador says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/ukrainian-nationals-aboard-seized-tanker-bella-1-ambassador-says-2026-01-09/</link><description>Jan 9 (Reuters) - Ukraine's ambassador to the United States was quoted as saying on Friday that Ukrainian nationals were among members of the crew of the Russian-flagged tanker Bella-1, seized this week by U.S. forces.

Olha Stefanishyna, quoted by the Interfax Ukraine news agency, said Ukrainian diplomats were in contact with U.S. authorities to ensure consular access to the crew members.

"The embassy has the situation under control and is using all necessary means to maintain contact with the Ukrainian citizens," Stefanishyna was quoted as saying.

The Bella-1, recently renamed the Marinera and registered as a Russian vessel, was seized in the North Atlantic this week.

The U.S. has seized five ships in recent weeks as part of efforts to curb Venezuelan oil exports. The Olina was seized in the Caribbean on Friday.

The Russian Foreign Ministry said on Friday that the United States had released two Russian crew members from the Marinera, expressed gratitude to Washington for the decision and pledged to ensure the return home of crew members.

Russia's Transport Ministry said on Wednesday it had lost contact with the Marinera after U.S. naval forces boarded it near Iceland.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 20:26:12 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Beyond the seized oil tanker Marinera: Growing fleet reflags to Russia</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260109-seized-marinera-fleet-russia-trump</link><description>The United States announced on January 7 that it had “seized” a Russian oil tanker with links to Venezuela as it sailed across the North Atlantic. This news is the latest twist in a drama that began late in December in the Caribbean.

The United States announced on December 21 that it would pursue the oil tanker, then known as the Bella 1, for trying to get around the blockade they imposed in mid-December on oil tankers under sanctions entering or leaving Venezuela.

The Bella 1 has been subject to US sanctions since June 2024 because of its apparent links to Iran and the Lebanese Shiite group Hezbollah . Maritime company Windward reported that the tanker had been participating in trading with Iran and Venezuela since 2021. Windward also tracked multiple instances of deceptive shipping practices.

TankerTrackers , a site specialised in maritime transport, reported that the tanker was not carrying oil when the United States began its pursuit. Analysts say that it was likely going to Venezuela to pick up oil.

The US suspected the Marinera of being part of what’s called a dark or shadow fleet. These are fraudulent or unregistered vessels that smuggle goods that are illegal or subject to sanctions.

American authorities claimed that the tanker, which was flagged to Guyana, was “falsely flagged”. If a boat is stateless or flying under a false flag, then it is not protected under international law and can be boarded. The United States used this legal argument to seize two oil tankers in mid-December as well as the oil tanker M/T Sophia on Wednesday.

The Coast Guard said that they initially attempted to intercept the Bella 1, but it continued on its path.

American authorities interviewed by the New York Times said that the crew of the recently christened Marinera had painted a crude Russian flag on the side of the ship. An officer on the ship also made contact with the Coast Guard via radio to say that the ship was now flagged to Russia.

The oil tanker also now appears in the Russian maritime registry , under the name Marinera, with its home port listed as the Russian city of Sochi. The database Equasis also indicates that the ship’s owner and manager live in Russia.

The Russian government then sent a formal demand for the United States to end their pursuit of the ship, according to the New York Times .

An American official told the New York Times that the United States still considered the ship “stateless” because it was not flying a valid flag when it was approached for the first time by the Coast Guard.

The oil tanker then headed northeast, setting out across the Atlantic Ocean. On January 7, it was located to the south of Iceland, according to information provided by Lloyd’s List Intelligence. A number of analysts interviewed by our team said they believed that the boat was heading towards a Russian port.

In recent days, aviation data seemed to indicate that the Marinera was being closely surveilled by two American P-8 spy planes, who took off from Mildenhall air base in the United Kingdom.

“The vessel is being shadowed by a United States Coast Guard cutter, with supporting surveillance including an RAF Rivet Joint mission and RFA Tideforce operating in the area,” Martin Kelly, head of advisory at the British security company EOS Risk Group, told our team a few hours before the operation took place.

The RAF is an abbreviation for the Royal Air Force, the British Air Force. A Rivet Joint is a spy plane. And the RFA Tideforce is a refuelling ship that belongs to the RAF.

A video posted on January 6, 2026 by Russia Today , which was said to have been filmed by the crew of the Marinera, shows a US Coast Guard Patroller following them. It is impossible to know when and where this video was filmed.

The Bella 1 is not the only ship operating in Venezuela that has reflagged to Russia in recent days.

“Reflagging to Russia is increasingly being used by these tankers to allow them to continue operating and gain some sort of legitimacy and protection,” said Mark Douglas, a maritime analyst with Starboard Maritime Intelligence.

After having dropped off its cargo of Russian naphtha – used to refine crude oil – in Venezuela, the Hyperion oil tanker, which is also under sanction, dropped the false Gambian flag that it was operating under on December 25 and announced that it was now flagged to Russia, according to the publication gCaptain . It then managed to travel into the Atlantic Ocean, making it seem as if it had escaped American seizure.

The oil tanker the Premier also indicated that it had reflagged in late December, going from the Gambian flag to the Russian flag, according to Windward . On Wednesday, it was located in the Caribbean.

According to the New York Times , three other boats under sanction that were recently located in Venezuelan waters have reflagged to Russia in recent days. They are all now also listed in the Russian maritime registry.

“Over the past six months, a dozen or more of the darkest tankers operating globally have switched from open registries to Russia. This trend accelerated in December as the flag state emerged as a critical shield against drone strikes and vessel seizures,” Windward wrote.

Vessels also began to reflag to Russia in the Black Sea after Ukrainian drone attacks on oil tankers carrying false flags.

“This is ultimately about principle,” says Kelly. “The United States cannot allow this to become a template for dozens of other sanctioned tankers off Venezuela to evade enforcement by simply changing flags.”

After Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro was arrested, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that the blockade on sanctioned oil tankers would remain in place.

The risk is also that other boats in the so-called dark or ghost fleet, operating in other regions, will also adopt this strategy.

“If the vessel doesn't get seized, then the remaining near 1,500 dark fleet tankers worldwide will resort to keeping a Russian flag handy in their closet,” said Samir Madani, co-founder of the site TankerTrackers.com , ahead of the US operation.

However, an operation like the seizure of the Marinera is not without risk. The New York Times said Wednesday that Russia had sent a warship to escort the oil tanker.

Kelly explains:

“The presence of Russian warships ‘defending’ a vessel that now declares itself Russian-flagged significantly increases the risk of miscalculation and escalation.

The Russian warship will have specific rules of engagement and is unlikely to use force to oppose any boarding, but it may seek to disrupt or obstruct boarding operations, potentially through unsafe manoeuvring or using laser devices to target aircraft. Any Russian submarine nearby will highly likely conduct surveillance without playing an active part in the incident.”

But why is Russia getting so involved? We spoke to Eric Orsini, global head of compliance at Lloyd's List Intelligence:

What you're seeing is sanctioned actors working together. They're forming their own little ecosystem.

Russia has been providing Venezuela with condensate or diluents [Editor’s note: like naphtha]. Venezuela's oil is heavy crude and it needs to be mixed or blended with diluents in order for it to be refined. So it’s in Russia's interest to continue the flow of their diluents to Venezuela, because Venezuela is buying it.

Russia has an interest in also keeping the shadow fleet on the water. The Marinera is a VLCC – a very large crude carrier, which has a lot of capacity to move oil. The more vessels that come out of the shadow fleet, the less capacity the sanctioned actors have to continue moving the oil and storing it.

It remains to be seen how Western countries will adapt to this new world.

“The reflagging will likely lead to an evolution of the approach taken to these vessels by the likes of Ukraine and the US as they consider what additional actions Russia might be willing to take to protect the tankers and the oil they carry,” concludes Douglas.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 20:27:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/15a46b36-ebf8-11f0-b153-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/hyperion.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iranian regime's 'iron fist': Internet blackout as protests swell to hundreds of thousands</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/iranian-regime-s-iron-fist-internet-blackout-as-protests-swell-to-hundreds-of-thousands</link><description /><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 20:27:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/43c03bee-ed83-11f0-8247-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260109-181116-182553-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>EU greenlights Mercosur trade deal, von der Leyen 'looks forward' to signing 'soon'</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260109-eu-countries-greenlight-mercosur-trade-deal-overriding-france</link><description>The EU gave Friday a long-delayed go ahead to a huge trade deal with South American bloc Mercosur championed by business groups but loathed by many European farmers – overriding opposition led by France.

A majority of the European Union 's 27 nations backed the pact at an ambassadors' meeting in Brussels , diplomatic sources said, paving the way for it to be inked in Paraguay next week.

More than 25 years in the making, supporters see the deal as crucial to boost exports, support the continent's ailing economy and foster diplomatic ties at a time of global uncertainty.

EU chief Ursula von der Leyen Friday hailed the green light given to the bloc's trade deal with South American bloc Mercosur, saying she looked forward to signing the accord "soon".

"This historic trade deal is further proof that Europe charts its own course and stands as a reliable partner," said the European Commission chief, who confirmed she would travel to Paraguay for the signing, without specifying a date.

Argentina's foreign minister said the deal would be signed on January 17.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz also hailed the agreement.

"The approval of the EU-Mercosur Agreement is a milestone in European trade policy and an important signal of our strategic sovereignty and capacity to act," the German leader said.

But the European Commission , which negotiated the text, failed to win over all of the bloc's member states.

Key power France, where politicians across the divide are up in arms against a deal attacked as an assault on the country's influential farming sector, led an ultimately unsuccessful push to sink it.

Ireland , Poland , Hungary and Austria also voted against the accord.

But that was not enough to block it, after Italy , which had demanded and obtained a last-minute delay in December, threw its weight behind the pact.

The deal will create a vast market of more than 700 million people, making it one of the world's largest free trade areas.

Part of a broader push to diversify trade in the face of US tariffs, it will bring the 27-nation EU closer together with Brazil , Paraguay, Argentina and Uruguay , removing import tariffs on more than 90 percent of products.

This will save EU businesses four billion euros ($4.6 billion) worth of duties per year and help exports of vehicles, machinery, wines and spirits to Latin America , according to the EU.

It will also help the bloc reduce its dependency on China for critical raw materials, said Agathe Demarais, of the European Council on Foreign Relations, a think tank.

"The conclusion of the EU-Mercosur trade deal is great news for Europe's global geopolitical and economic clout," she said, describing it one of the "best responses to US tariffs, growing protectionism and trade tensions with China."

Germany, Spain and others were strongly in favour, believing the deal will provide a welcome boost to their industries hampered by Chinese competition and tariffs in the United States.

But France and other critics opposed it over concerns that their farmers would be undercut by a flow of cheaper goods, including meat, sugar, rice, honey and soybean, from agricultural giant Brazil and its neighbours.

Failure to sign off on the deal could have spelt the end of it: Brazil last month threatened to walk if the EU kicked the can down the road.

Over the past months, the commission has been at pains to reassure farmers and their backers that pros outweigh cons.

It stressed the accord is expected to boost EU agri-food exports to South America by 50 percent, in part by protecting more than 340 iconic European products – from Greek feta to French champagne – from local imitations.

It also laid out plans to set up a €6.3 billion crisis fund and safeguards allowing for the suspension of preferential tariffs on agricultural products in case of a damaging surge in imports.

The latter were tightened further at the last minute by member states lowering the threshold for action, in a late concession to Italy.

"It seems to me that the balance that has been created is a sustainable one, and I hope that the agreement will bring benefits in many areas, as I believe it will, and hopefully for everyone," Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni told journalists on Friday.

"There is a lot of pain. There is a lot of anger," Judy Peeters, a representative for a Belgian young farmers group said at a protest on a motorway south of Brussels.

The deal still needs approval from the European Parliament before it can definitively come into force.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 20:27:56 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/4bc2fadc-ed62-11f0-8a86-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/d4ced373109f8f3a83cc98f7c058d2a50adbfeb0.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US oil firms juggle Venezuela opportunity, investor concern ahead of White House summit</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/us-oil-firms-juggle-venezuela-opportunity-investor-concern-ahead-white-house-2026-01-09/</link><description>Jan 9 (Reuters) - U.S. oil executives being summoned to the White House on Friday to discuss potential investment plans in Venezuela will be carefully weighing the country's business potential and enthusiasm from President Donald Trump with a more cautious sentiment being expressed by some of their investors.

Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, speaking at a Goldman Sachs energy conference in Miami this week, repeated a claim from Trump that U.S. oil firms were prepared to spend billions of dollars to rebuild the South American country's oil economy after U.S. forces removed Nicolás Maduro from power on Saturday.

Some energy investors were skeptical, however, and questioned the cost of any such spending in Venezuela, which holds the world's largest estimated crude reserves. They also had ongoing concerns about the country's political stability and whether they could trust the interim government in Caracas being run by Delcy Rodriguez.

"Investors will want to see long-lasting stability and good fiscal terms to protect against the risk of asset nationalization, which we’ve seen from Venezuela in the past," said David Byrns, portfolio manager and senior investment analyst at American Century Investments, which is a major Chevron (CVX.N) , opens new tab and Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) , opens new tab shareholder.

Multiple attendees of private meetings held by Chevron and ConocoPhillips at the Miami conference told Reuters that executives from those companies offered few insights into Venezuela, but made one thing clear: they did not intend to make rash decisions.

Chevron and Conoco did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

On Friday, Trump is expected to urge oil executives to invest and help boost Venezuela’s crude production during a meeting attended by Wright, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and 17 major firms. The companies represented will include ConocoPhillips, Exxon (XOM.N) , opens new tab , Chevron, along with Spain's Repsol and trading firms Vitol and Trafigura , according to sources familiar with the matter.

"The American people, energy companies, and the Venezuelan people will all greatly benefit from these new, unprecedented investments in Venezuela’s oil infrastructure thanks to President Trump,” said White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers.

Chevron already operates in the country, but Exxon and Conoco departed nearly 20 years ago after their assets were nationalized and are still owed billions of dollars.

"The tension is between the compelling geological resource and the obvious business opportunity, and the considerable above-ground risk, uncertainty and unpaid claims," said Geoffrey Pyatt, former Assistant Secretary of State for Energy Resources in the Biden administration.

Foreign embassies in Venezuela are beginning to arrange visits for next week that will include representatives for American and European oil companies, two sources told Reuters on Thursday.

Matthew Sallee, head of investments at fund manager Tortoise Capital, which owns shares in Chevron, said he could support further Venezuela investments if Chevron could show returns paying out, but he would be very cautious because infrastructure in the country is so dilapidated.

"If Chevron says we're going to dedicate multi-billion dollars a year to Venezuela, we would probably sell," he said.

Service companies, which could be among the first to benefit from any rush into Venezuela as infrastructure gets rebuilt, have tried to curb any immediate enthusiasm.

"We have a yard in Colombia, across the border, that could deliver rigs into the region, and we understand what it takes to work there, but we need to make sure that the timing is right and that we have the right customer-partner relationship going in," said Helmerich &amp; Payne President Trey Adams, speaking at the Miami conference.

Ali Moshiri, Chevron's former president of Africa and Latin America, who is now CEO of Amos Global Energy, said his firm planned to enter Venezuela and was in early-stage talks with U.S. government departments for public funding, and with service companies to repair infrastructure and build pipelines. But despite overwhelming interest from investors, the plan would be contingent on the U.S. determining who will manage the transition period in the country, he added.

"That decision must be made, it is the precondition for investors," Moshiri said.

While Trump has said the U.S. intends to control Venezuela, how that plays out on the ground remains unclear, especially given questions about how different spheres of power in Caracas will get along in the absence of Maduro.

The U.S. has a three-step plan for Venezuela that will begin with stabilization, followed by a recovery phase ensuring U.S. oil companies have access to the country and finally a transition, Rubio said on Wednesday.

Some U.S. oil companies may worry they could be pressured to enter Venezuela quickly or potentially face repercussions down the road, said Samantha Carl-Yoder, co-chair of the international practice at lobbying firm Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck.

"Companies may feel they have to go back in to get things they want in other areas. Will the administration hold permits and licensing hostage? Will the administration provide some financial incentives to companies going in? Those are questions I would have if I were an integrated oil company," she said.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 21:21:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/FEPHKIVSURJEHPHUHR4CDYBECM.jpg?auth=18dfa7af69567f77f98bb78fd1ac8320557ac0c1782ab52425db342d44e9da64&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Families anxiously wait for prisoners to be released in Venezuela, just nine freed</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/families-anxiously-wait-prisoners-be-released-venezuela-just-nine-freed-2026-01-09/</link><description>Jan 9 (Reuters) - Nine people considered political prisoners by a leading Venezuelan rights group had been released by Friday afternoon as part of an effort praised by U.S. President Donald Trump, the group said, with families of others anxiously waiting to hear if their relatives would also be freed.

Human rights groups, international bodies and opposition figures - including Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Corina Machado, who has several close allies imprisoned - have long demanded the release from Venezuelan jails of some 800 people they consider political prisoners.

Trump said in a post on Truth Social earlier on Friday that he had canceled a second wave of attacks on Venezuela following cooperation from the South American nation, and that Venezuela was releasing "large numbers of political prisoners."

Both Venezuela's top lawmaker Jorge Rodriguez, the brother of acting President Delcy Rodriguez, and Trump said the releases are a gesture of peace.

There is no official list of exactly how many prisoners will be released nor who they are.

The releases come during a week of political turmoil in Caracas after the U.S. capture of President Nicolas Maduro , his arraignment in a New York court on narcoterrorism charges, the swearing-in of interim President Delcy Rodriguez and the announcement that the U.S. would refine and sell up to 50 million barrels of crude oil stuck in Venezuela under U.S. sanctions.

For years, Venezuela's opposition and human rights groups have said the government uses detentions to stamp out dissent. The authorities have consistently denied that and have said the prisoners were rightfully jailed for committing crimes.

The families of both prominent and little-known detainees gathered outside prisons on Friday, or visited multiple detention centers in an attempt to discover the location and status of their loved ones.

Leading local rights group Foro Penal estimates that after the releases this week there are 811 political prisoners still being held in the country. That figure includes more than 80 foreign detainees, including two from the United States and one with American residency.

Five Spanish citizens, including Venezuelan-Spanish rights activist Rocio San Miguel, were the first confirmed releases on Thursday. They arrived in Madrid the following day.

Also released late on Thursday were former Venezuelan opposition presidential candidate Enrique Marquez, journalist Biagio Pilieri and soldier Larry Osorio, said Alfredo Romero, the director of Foro Penal. Opposition member Aracelis Balza was released on Friday.

"We are waiting to hear what the authorities here have to say. I found out through social media that they were releasing people," said Gregory Trejo, as he waited outside El Rodeo prison in Guatire, near capital Caracas, for news of his father, Jose Gregorio Trejo, detained for nearly a year.

"For there to be a democratic transition in a democratic country, there cannot be political prisoners, and we demand the release of all those who are in all detention centers," said Soraida Gonzalez, who was awaiting the release of her son Jose Miguel Estrada.

Among prominent detained figures are opposition politician Juan Pablo Guanipa and lawyer Perkins Rocha, both close allies of Machado; Rafael Tudares, son-in-law of the opposition's former presidential candidate Edmundo Gonzalez; opposition Voluntad Popular party leaders Freddy Superlano and Roland Carreno; and Javier Tarazona, director of an NGO that tracks alleged abuses by Colombian armed groups and the Venezuelan military.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 21:21:58 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/QSYA4FVWYBKSHH6CYK7IJ6DNOM.jpg?auth=66bec3cee8f164d455fe7710baf8f7b4ef501df5e410f313452cddd5a231aaf6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Washington pipe bomb suspect pleads not guilty</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/washington-pipe-bomb-suspect-pleads-not-guilty-2026-01-09/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 9 (Reuters) - The man accused of planting pipe bombs in Washington the night before the January 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol attack pleaded not guilty on Friday to two explosives-related charges.

Brian Cole, 30, is accused of leaving two explosive devices outside the headquarters of the Democratic and Republican national committees on the evening of January 5.

Cole, wearing a tan prison jumpsuit, entered the plea himself during a brief hearing in Washington federal court.

The bombs, which did not detonate, were discovered the next day shortly before supporters of President Donald Trump streamed into the Capitol nearby in a failed attempt to stop Congress from certifying the 2020 election.

Cole is facing two criminal counts: interstate transportation of explosives and malicious attempt to use explosives.

A judge has ordered him detained to await trial, finding evidence Cole poses a danger to public safety.

FBI investigators struggled for nearly five years to pinpoint a suspect. Cole was arrested and charged last month following a fresh review of evidence ordered by Trump’s top appointees at the FBI.

Cole gave a detailed confession , opens new tab in an interview with FBI agents following his arrest, prosecutors have said. He expressed dissatisfaction with both political parties and also echoed Trump’s false claims of tampering in the 2020 election, according to a court filing.

Cole denied in the FBI interview that the placement of the bombs was related to Congress' certification of the election and the events the next day.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 21:22:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/VAJWJVTBVNNW7A2LU2CNZ4444E.jpg?auth=4ef2a32979395681a8ac49221a00bf365b263e4d5ac0af92f76922db1948d8c1&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UK allocates $270 million to prepare for possible Ukraine deployment</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/uk-allocates-270-million-prepare-possible-ukraine-deployment-2026-01-09/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Britain said it was allocating 200 million pounds ($270 million) to fund preparations for the possible deployment of troops to Ukraine, after pledging its soldiers this week to a multinational force for the country in the event of a ceasefire.

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Tuesday agreed a declaration of intent at a summit of the "coalition of the willing" of Ukraine's allies, outlining a potential future deployment.

Visiting the Ukrainian capital Kyiv on Friday, British defence minister John Healey said the money would be spent on upgrading vehicles and communication systems and counter-drone protection, as well as ensuring troops are ready to deploy.

Britain made the announcement hours after Russia fired a powerful hypersonic missile, in what Kyiv's European allies described as an attempt to intimidate them from supporting Ukraine.

Macron has said France could send thousands of troops to the Multinational Force for Ukraine (MNFU), aimed at firming up security guarantees to reassure Kyiv. Britain has not said how many troops it would send; Starmer said on Wednesday Britain's plans were still being finalised.

Healey said the funding announcement for the MNFU showed the government was "surging investment" into preparations for Ukraine.

"This capital spending is being funded from the core defence budget and sends a clear signal to allies and adversaries of the UK’s intent to lead the MNFU, (and) fulfil our promises to secure the peace in Ukraine," the statement from the Ministry of Defence said.

Healey also told Zelenskiy that production of Octopus interceptor drones, based on a Ukrainian design but made in Britain, would start in January. Britain will send thousands of them back to Ukraine each month to help the country defend itself against Russian drone attacks.

"We are going to do something on Greenland whether they like it or not. Because if we don't do it, Russia or China will take over Greenland, and we're not going to have Russia or China as a neighbor," Trump told reporters at the White House while meeting with oil company executives.

Trump said the U.S. must acquire Greenland, even though it already has a military presence on the island under a 1951 agreement, because such deals are not enough to guarantee Greenland's defense. The island of 57,000 people is an autonomous territory of the Kingdom of Denmark.

"You defend ownership. You don't defend leases. And we'll have to defend Greenland. If we don't do it, China or Russia will," Trump said.

Trump and White House officials have been discussing various plans to bring Greenland under U.S. control, including potential use of the U.S. military and lump sum payments to Greenlanders as part of a bid to convince them to secede from Denmark and potentially join the U.S.

Leaders in Copenhagen and throughout Europe have reacted with disdain in recent days to comments by Trump and other White House officials asserting their right to Greenland. The U.S. and Denmark are NATO allies bound by a mutual defense agreement.

On Tuesday, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, Britain and Denmark issued a joint statement, saying only Greenland and Denmark can decide matters regarding their relations.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 22:23:19 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/IUSZVJR6NFN6BIVKNALV7ZJFB4.jpg?auth=94cfa62f7f036a7d939e12c16c0eb7f17288eb6fd81558aea89a05e24009a8ea&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>North Korea says South Korean drone entered its airspace on Jan 4</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/north-korea-says-south-korea-infringed-its-airspace-with-another-drone-jan-4-2026-01-09/</link><description>SEOUL, Jan 10 (Reuters) - North Korea said on Saturday that South Korea flew another drone into its airspace on January 4, infringing on its sovereignty, according to state media KCNA.

The drone, which originated from an island in the South Korean city of Incheon, flew 8 km (5 miles) before it was shot down inside North Korean airspace, KCNA said, citing a spokesperson for the North Korean military.

The drone was equipped with surveillance cameras to record important North Korean facilities, KCNA said.

"Even after the change of a regime... (South Korea) has continued to commit such acts of provocation by drones near the border," KCNA said, calling South Korea its "enemy most hostile".

Since South Korean President Lee Jae Myung took office in June, North Korea has rebuffed conciliatory gestures from Lee's administration. Lee had pledged to re-engage with Pyongyang to defuse tensions on the Korean Peninsula.

South Korea "can never evade the responsibility for escalating tension" and will be "forced to pay a dear price" KCNA said.

North Korea has previously accused South Korea for sending a drone over Pyongyang in October 2024.

South Korea's former President Yoon Suk Yeol was accused by Seoul's special prosecutor late last year of ordering the Pyongyang drone operation to use military tensions between Pyongyang and Seoul as a justification for declaring emergency martial law.

Yoon has denied the charge, with his legal counsel saying the performance of the president's duties cannot be framed as a crime after the fact.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 22:23:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Colombia's FARC rebel leader calls for guerrilla unity to face US interventionism</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/colombias-farc-rebel-leader-calls-guerrilla-unity-face-us-interventionism-2026-01-09/</link><description>BOGOTA, Jan 9 (Reuters) - The head of the largest dissident branch of the former Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) guerrilla group called on other rebel groups to come together to fight U.S. interventionism in the region, in a video message confirmed by the group as authentic on Friday.

Three people remained missing in the southeastern state of Victoria where more than 50 fires, many at the highest danger rating, were burning out of control on Saturday morning local time.

Authorities have said the fires, which took hold amid a heatwave and have been fanned by strong winds, are the worst to hit the state since the Black Summer blazes of 2019-2020 that destroyed an area the size of Turkey and killed 33 people.

"Australians across the country are facing extreme and dangerous weather conditions with bushfires burning in multiple states but particularly Victoria," Albanese said in televised remarks from Canberra.

"My thoughts are with Australians in these regional communities at this very difficult time."

A disaster declaration was made in 18 areas of Victoria overnight, while the Australian Defence Force had been requested to provide accommodation support for Victorian firefighters, the prime minister added.

The largest fire near the town of Longwood, about 112 km (69.6 miles) north of state capital Melbourne, had burned 35,000 hectares (86,486 acres) of bushland, destroying multiple homes, a community centre and a telephone exchange, authorities said on Friday.

Dozens of communities near the fires have been evacuated and many of the state's parks and campgrounds are closed.

A heatwave warning on Saturday was in place for large parts of Victoria, while fire weather warnings were active for neighbouring New South Wales state and the Australian Capital Territory, the nation's weather forecaster said.</description><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 01:43:43 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/EPFXAGCEZZPSXCDNYHSATVYUKA.jpg?auth=f06afbdc67d54eb7eb209017510c2d5c67b4cc1370878b0dc25c4f6f289f3607&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuela's most prominent prisoners linked to opposition movement</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/venezuelas-most-prominent-prisoners-linked-opposition-movement-2026-01-10/</link><description>Jan 9 (Reuters) - Venezuela has slowly begun releasing some of those held in jail who are considered political prisoners by rights groups and the opposition, in the aftermath of the U.S. capture of President Nicolas Maduro last weekend.

U.S. President Donald Trump said early on Friday: "Venezuela is releasing large numbers of political prisoners as a sign of 'Seeking Peace.'" Venezuelan authorities have not said how many will be released or given their names.

As of Friday evening there had been at least nine confirmed releases , including five Spanish citizens and former opposition presidential candidate Enrique Marquez , said Foro Penal, a leading rights group. Foro Penal estimates there are still more than 800 political prisoners in Venezuela, including at least 80 foreign detainees.

Below are some of the high-profile prisoners in Venezuela:

Juan Pablo Guanipa

This well-known opposition politician - and ally of opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Maria Corina Machado - was arrested in May 2025 after months in hiding after he was accused of leading a terrorist plot , which he denies.

Venezuelan officials regularly accused the opposition of conspiring to commit terrorism, overthrow Maduro or attack the power grid.

Guanipa, a lawyer, was arrested days before Venezuela's parliamentary elections last year.

"I don't know what will happen to me in the coming hours, days and weeks. But I am sure that we will win this long fight against the dictatorship," he said in a statement on social media following his arrest.

Freddy Superlano

Superlano is the former head of the Voluntad Popular party, part of Venezuela's political opposition. He was retroactively disqualified by the Supreme Court from participating in the 2021 governor's race in Barinas, the home state of late socialist President Hugo Chavez, in a contest that pitted him against Chavez's brother. The opposition won the rerun of the vote.

His arrest after the 2024 election , captured on video, showed him being shoved into the back of an unmarked car surrounded by armed security agents.

Roland Carreno

Carreno is a journalist and former operations director for opposition party Voluntad Popular. He was arrested in August 2024 in Caracas by unidentified intelligence agents who approached him in vehicles without license plates, the party said following his detention.

At the time, Venezuela's attorney general, Tarek Saab, said Carreno had been detained for alleged "participation in conspirative plans against the democratic peace."

Carreno had previously been detained in October 2020 on charges of financing terrorism. He was released in October 2023 amid negotiations between Caracas and Washington.

Perkins Rocha

Rocha is a lawyer for the Vente Venezuela opposition movement and a close confidante of Machado. He was detained in August 2024 by unknown individuals who took him by force, the opposition movement said. Rocha also served as the spokesperson for Machado's campaign.

"We keep moving forward, for Perkins, for all those jailed and persecuted and for all of Venezuela," Machado said on X after the arrest.

Rafael Tudares

Tudares, 45, is the son-in-law of the opposition's former presidential candidate Edmundo Gonzalez.

Tudares, an attorney who was not involved in politics and who is married to Gonzalez's daughter Mariana, was detained in January 2025 in Caracas by masked men while driving his two young children to school.

His wife has been visiting detention centers since the releases were announced and says she does not know for sure where her husband is being held.

Javier Tarazona

Tarazona is the former director of local NGO FundaRedes, which tracks alleged abuses by Colombian armed groups and the Venezuelan military along the shared border. He was arrested in July 2021 alongside three other FundaRedes members, including his brother Jose Rafael Tarazona, after reporting to a state prosecutor that their team had been harassed by intelligence service officials.

Unidentified armed men waited for him at his hotel, the organization said on social media following his arrest. The three detainees were charged with instigating hatred, treason and terrorism.</description><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 01:43:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/F2FGYT3QBFIZDCU5OODGBW2SUA.jpg?auth=82c0bd99747ec824b11f6c3f6959864c58b5912162ae1011fe9eded86b0eb148&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Bessent says Australia, India invited to G7 meeting on critical minerals</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/bessent-says-australia-india-invited-g7-meeting-critical-minerals-2026-01-10/</link><description>SAVAGE, Minnesota, Jan 9 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Australia and several other countries would join a meeting of finance ministers from the Group of Seven advanced economies that he is hosting in Washington on Monday to discuss critical minerals.

Bessent said he had been pressing for a separate meeting on the issue since last summer's summit of G7 leaders, and finance ministers had already held a virtual meeting in December.

India was also invited to attend the meeting, Bessent told Reuters in an interview after touring the Minneapolis-area engineering lab of RV and boat maker Winnebago Industries. He said he was unsure if it had accepted the invitation.

It was not immediately clear which other countries had been invited.

The G7 includes the United States, Britain, Japan, France, Germany, Italy and Canada, as well as the European Union, most of whom are heavily dependent on rare earths supplies from China. The group last June agreed on an action plan to secure their supply chains and boost their economies.

Australia signed an agreement with the U.S. in October aimed at countering China's dominance in critical minerals. It included an $8.5 billion project pipeline and leverages Australia's proposed strategic reserve, which will supply metals like rare earths and lithium that are vulnerable to disruption.

Canberra has said it has subsequently received interest from Europe, Japan, South Korea and Singapore.

China dominates the critical minerals supply chain, refining between 47% and 87% of copper, lithium, cobalt, graphite and rare earths, according to the International Energy Agency. These minerals are used in defense technologies, semiconductors, renewable energy components, batteries and refining processes.

Western countries have sought to reduce their dependence on China's critical minerals in recent years, given moves by China to impose strict export controls on rare earths.

Monday's meeting comes days after reports that China had begun restricting exports to Japanese companies of rare earths and powerful magnets containing them, as well as banning exports of dual-use items to the Japanese military.

Bessent said China was still living up to its commitments to purchase U.S. soybeans and ship critical minerals to U.S. firms.</description><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 01:43:54 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/GOZBI5OTVNMVFM6UYR3VVRN6PI.jpg?auth=8e854a9332ea4e9b0b978df34559c2de6b2d97fd0a5b8b71b7d2b9feb73e716d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Bessent says overseas money transfers are fine if people can prove origin of funds</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/bessent-says-overseas-money-transfers-are-fine-if-people-can-prove-origin-funds-2026-01-10/</link><description>SAVAGE, Minnesota, Jan 9 (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department's plan to increase scrutiny of overseas transfers of money should not harm people who can prove the funds did not come from social service payments, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Reuters on Friday.

Bessent on Friday announced the Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) is investigating some money services businesses as part of a crackdown on federal social benefits abuses in Minnesota, while some banks will be audited by the Internal Revenue Service for alleged money laundering.

FinCEN also issued a geographic order increasing scrutiny on banks and money transmitters in Minnesota's Hennepin and Ramsey counties, which will require firms to report additional information on funds transferred outside of the U.S., including FinCEN reports on transactions above $3,000.

Asked if this would have a chilling effect on legitimate remittances made by migrants to families overseas, Bessent said, "No, it shouldn't. Anyone who can prove where the money has come from ... is fine," in an interview after touring the Minneapolis-area engineering lab of RV and boat maker Winnebago Industries (WGO.N) , opens new tab .

Bessent said payments from people who are in the United States legally were usually transferred through the regulated banking system. "You cannot send welfare money from the people of Minnesota to Somalia, right? Like, that just means you're getting too much, or you can't send stolen money."

Remittances account for large percentages of the gross domestic product of many poorer countries, including El Salvador and Somalia.
Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, a Democrat and a vice presidential candidate in the 2024 election, this week announced he will not seek a third term and instead focus on allegations of state welfare fraud that have become a crisis after mounting attacks from Republican U.S. President Donald Trump's administration.

The Trump administration has singled out Walz and Minnesota, including its large population of Somali Americans and Somali immigrants, over allegations of fraud dating to 2020 by some nonprofit groups that administer the state's childcare and other social services programs, backed by federal funding.

At least 56 people have pleaded guilty since federal prosecutors started to bring charges in 2022 under Trump's Democratic predecessor, Joe Biden.</description><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 01:43:56 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BQ32FRM57NLQBBEQCYS3PUQPIU.jpg?auth=425726b6caaf1c5fcc725ecaa14cbf1f3f454760f58433ba49cf0d6dd64281bf&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>NASA, SpaceX set target date for Crew-11’s return to earth</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/nasa-spacex-set-target-date-crew-11s-return-earth-2026-01-10/</link><description>Jan 9 (Reuters) - NASA on Friday said the space agency and SpaceX are targeting to undock the agency’s SpaceX Crew-11 mission from the International Space Station no earlier than 5 p.m. ET (2200 GMT) on Wednesday, January 14, pending weather conditions.

President Donald Trump's threats to seize Greenland have triggered a wave of European solidarity with Denmark. But the crisis has exposed an uncomfortable reality - Denmark is rallying support to protect a territory whose population wants independence, and whose largest opposition party now wants to bypass Copenhagen and negotiate directly with Washington .

"Denmark risks exhausting its foreign policy capital to secure Greenland, only to watch it walk away afterwards," said Mikkel Vedby Rasmussen, a political science professor at University of Copenhagen.

Denmark cannot let Greenland go without losing its geopolitical relevance in the Arctic territory , strategically located between Europe and North America and a critical site for the U.S. ballistic missile defence system.

Yet it may ultimately have nothing to show for its efforts if Greenlanders choose independence - or strike their own deal with Washington.

The stakes extend beyond Denmark's national interests. European allies have rallied behind Denmark not just out of solidarity, but because giving up Greenland would set a dangerous precedent that could embolden other powers to pursue territorial claims against smaller nations, upending the post-1945 world order.

Denmark's foreign ministry declined to comment, but referred to joint remarks by Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and Greenlandic Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen on December 22.

"National borders and the sovereignty of states are rooted in international law," the two leaders said. "They are fundamental principles. You cannot annex another country ... Greenland belongs to the Greenlanders."

This week, Frederiksen said: "If the U.S. chooses to attack another NATO country, everything stops, including NATO and the security the alliance has provided since World War Two."

For now, the Trump administration says all options are on the table, including buying the territory or taking it by force.

Copenhagen professor Rasmussen said any discussion of whether holding on to Greenland is worth the cost has been drowned out by outrage at Trump's threats.

"It is not part of the political debate in Denmark. I fear we have gone into patriotic overdrive," he said.

During the Cold War, Greenland's strategic location gave Denmark outsized influence in Washington and allowed it to maintain lower defence spending than would otherwise be expected of a NATO ally.

This became known as "the Greenland Card", according to a 2017 report by the University of Copenhagen's Centre for Military Studies.

But Greenland's aspirations for self-determination have been brewing since the former colony got greater autonomy and its own parliament in 1979. A 2009 agreement explicitly recognised Greenlanders' right to independence if they choose.

All Greenlandic parties say they want independence, but differ on how, and when, to achieve it.

Trump's pressure has accelerated a timeline that was already in motion, forcing Copenhagen to spend political capital and financial resources on a relationship with an increasingly uncertain endpoint.

"How much should we fight for someone who doesn't really care about us?" Joachim B. Olsen, a political commentator and former Danish lawmaker, told Reuters.

Copenhagen provides an annual block grant of roughly 4.3 billion Danish crowns ($610 million) to Greenland's economy, which is near stagnation with GDP growth of just 0.2% in 2025.

The central bank estimates an annual financing gap of approximately 800 million Danish crowns to make current public finances sustainable. Denmark also covers police, the justice system and defence - bringing total annual spending to just under $1 billion.

In addition, Copenhagen last year announced a 42 billion Danish crowns ($6.54 billion) Arctic defence package in response to U.S. criticism that Denmark has not done enough to protect Greenland.

Some reject framing the relationship in transactional terms , pointing to Denmark's legal and moral obligations under international law and centuries of shared history.

"We're talking about family relations, long history of relations between Denmark and Greenland," said Marc Jacobsen, associate professor at the Royal Danish Defence College. "So this is much more, it's not just about defence and economy, it's about feelings, it's about culture."

Prime Minister Frederiksen faces a difficult balancing act, said Serafima Andreeva, researcher at Oslo-based Fridtjof Nansen Institute.

For now, Denmark has little choice but to stand firm to maintain its diplomatic credibility, but in doing so risks the relationship with the United States at a time "when Russia is an accelerating threat and being on the U.S.'s bad side is no good for anyone in the West".

Frederiksen also faces an election this year, though Greenland has not been a major theme.

"I don't understand why we have to cling to this community with Greenland when they so badly want out of it," Lone Frank, a Danish science writer and broadcaster, told Reuters. "To be completely honest, Greenland doesn't inspire any sense of belonging in me."</description><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 06:31:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/IVB5NKFQ4BLUBPJMTXNK6UZPMI.jpg?auth=ab8d8f4f64245634a5a9c990dddd8202fa4ba300acf60c0bbfa942c80ea98207&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Syrian army resumes operation in Aleppo’s Kurdish district after ceasefire collapses</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260110-syria-urges-kurdish-fighters-to-surrender-after-ramping-up-aleppo-operation</link><description>Syria 's army said its operation in a Kurdish neighbourhood of Aleppo was nearing completion early Saturday and urged fighters from the minority to surrender themselves and their weapons.

Government forces began striking the Sheikh Maqsud district overnight after the Kurdish fighters defied a deadline to withdraw during a temporary ceasefire.

A military source told the official SANA news agency that the combing operation in Sheikh Maqsud was "more than 90 percent" complete, and that "a number of SDF members" had been arrested.

In a statement posted by the Ministry of Defence, Syria's army said "the only remaining option for the armed elements in the Sheikh Maqsud area of Aleppo is to surrender themselves and their weapons immediately".

The violence in Syria's second city erupted after efforts to integrate the Kurds ' de facto autonomous administration and military into the country's new government stalled.

Since the start of the fighting on Tuesday, at least 21 civilians have been killed, according to figures from both sides, and tens of thousands have fled Aleppo.

The clashes, some of the most intense since Syria's new Islamist authorities took power, present yet another challenge as the country struggles to reunify after ousting longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad in December 2024.

Both sides blame the other for starting the violence.

Early Friday, Syrian authorities announced a six-hour window for the Kurdish fighters to leave, but they instead refused to "surrender" and vowed to defend their districts.

In response, Syria's army warned it would renew strikes on military targets in Sheikh Maqsud and urged civilians to get out ahead of the district's takeover by security forces.

An AFP correspondent saw residents laden with belongings fleeing before the two-hour humanitarian corridor closed.

Kurdish forces reported coming under artillery and drone attacks and claimed in a post on social media to be mounting a "fierce and ongoing resistance".

The army said three soldiers had been killed by Kurdish forces, while state television accused them of launching drones on residential areas of Aleppo.

A flight suspension at Aleppo airport was extended until late Saturday.

The SDF controls swathes of Syria's oil-rich north and northeast, and was key to the defeat of the Islamic State group in 2019.

But Ankara views its main component as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which agreed last year to end its four-decade armed struggle against Turkey.

Elham Ahmad, a senior official in the Kurdish administration in Syria's northeast, accused Syria's authorities of "choosing the path of war" by attacking Kurdish districts and of "seeking to put an end to the agreements that have been reached".

"We are committed to them and we are seeking to implement them," she told AFP.

The March integration agreement was meant to be implemented last year, but differences, including Kurdish demands for decentralised rule, have stymied progress.

Ahmad said that "the United States is playing a mediating role... we hope they will apply pressure to reach an agreement".

A diplomatic source told AFP that US envoy Tom Barrack was headed to Damascus.

Turkey, which shares a 900-kilometre (550-mile) border with Syria, has launched successive offensives to push Kurdish forces from the frontier.

UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric expressed alarm over the impact of the fighting on civilians and called on all parties "to swiftly return to negotiations to ensure the full implementation of the 10 March agreement".

Nanar Hawach, senior Syria analyst at the International Crisis Group, said the renewed clashes cast doubt on the government's ability to gain the trust of minority factions and sow the country back together after 14 years of civil war.

"If the fighting escalates, international actors will wonder about Damascus's capacity to govern Syria's heterogeneous society," he added.

Syria's authorities have committed to protecting minorities, but sectarian bloodshed rocked the Alawite and Druze communities last year.</description><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 06:32:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/98de8d5a-edde-11f0-a6bf-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/59c90a692234364fa10c19db42ddc07368fca7f9.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>New video filmed by ICE agent emerges of Minnesota woman’s killing</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260110-new-video-filmed-by-ice-agent-emerges-of-minnesota-woman-s-killing</link><description>A Minnesota prosecutor on Friday called on the public to share with investigators any recordings and evidence connected to the fatal shooting of Renee Good as a new video emerged showing the final moments of her encounter with an immigration officer.

The Minneapolis killing and a separate shooting in Portland, Oregon, a day later by the Border Patrol have set off protests in multiple cities and denunciations of immigration enforcement tactics by the US government. The Trump administration has defended the officer who shot Good in her car, saying he was protecting himself and fellow agents.

The reaction to the shooting has largely been focused on witness cellphone video of the encounter. A new, 47-second video that was published online by a Minnesota-based conservative news site, Alpha News, and later reposted on social media by the Department of Homeland Security shows the shooting from the perspective of ICE officer Jonathan Ross, who fired the shots.

Sirens blaring in the background, he approaches and circles Good’s vehicle in the middle of the road while apparently filming on his cellphone. At the same time, Good’s wife also was recording the encounter and can be seen walking around the vehicle and approaching the officer. A series of exchanges occurred:

“That’s fine, I’m not mad at you,” Good says as the officer passes by her door. She has one hand on the steering wheel and the other outside the open driver side window.

“US citizen, former f---ing veteran,” says her wife, standing outside the passenger side of the SUV holding up her phone. “You wanna come at us, you wanna come at us, I say go get yourself some lunch big boy.”

Other officers are approaching the driver’s side of the car at about the same time and one says: “Get out of the car, get out of the f---ing car.” Ross is now at the front driver side of the vehicle. Good reverses briefly, then turns the steering wheel toward the passenger side as she drives ahead and Ross opens fire.

The camera becomes unsteady and points toward the sky and then returns to the street view showing Good’s SUV careening away.

“F---ing b---,” someone at the scene says.

A crashing sound is heard as Good’s vehicle smashes into others parked on the street.

Federal agencies have encouraged officers to document encounters in which people may attempt to interfere with enforcement actions, but policing experts have cautioned that recording on a handheld device can complicate already volatile situations by occupying an officer’s hands and narrowing focus at moments when rapid decision-making is required.

Under an ICE policy directive, officers and agents are expected to activate body-worn cameras at the start of enforcement activities and to record throughout interactions, and footage must be kept for review in serious incidents such as deaths or use-of-force cases.

The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to questions about whether the officer who opened fire or any of the others who were on the scene were wearing body cameras.

Vice President JD Vance and Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in posts on X that the new video backs their contention that the officer fired in self-defence.

“Many of you have been told this law enforcement officer wasn’t hit by a car, wasn’t being harassed, and murdered an innocent woman,” Vance said. “The reality is that his life was endangered and he fired in self defense.”

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey has said any self-defense argument is “garbage.”

Policing experts said the video didn’t change their thoughts on the use-of-force but did raise additional questions about the officer’s training.

“Now that we can see he’s holding a gun in one hand and a cellphone in the other filming, I want to see the officer training that permits that,” said Geoff Alpert, a criminology professor at the University of South Carolina.

The video demonstrates that the officers didn’t perceive Good to be a threat, said John P. Gross, a professor at the University of Wisconsin Law School who has written extensively about officers shooting at moving vehicles.

“If you are an officer who views this woman as a threat, you don’t have one hand on a cellphone. You don’t walk around this supposed weapon, casually filming,” Gross said.

Ross, 43, is an Iraq War veteran who has served in the Border Patrol and ICE for nearly two decades. He was injured last year when he was dragged by a driver fleeing an immigration arrest.

Attempts to reach Ross at phone numbers and email addresses associated with him were not successful.

Meanwhile, Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty said that although her office has collaborated effectively with the FBI in past cases, she is concerned by the Trump administration's decision to bar state and local agencies from playing any role in the investigation into Good's killing.

She also said the officer who shot Good in the head does not have complete legal immunity, as Vance declared.

“We do have jurisdiction to make this decision with what happened in this case,” Moriarty said at a news conference. “It does not matter that it was a federal law enforcement agent.”

Moriarty said her office would post a link for the public to submit footage of the shooting, even though she acknowledged that she wasn't sure what legal outcome submissions might produce.

Good's wife, Becca Good, released a statement to Minnesota Public Radio on Friday saying, “kindness radiated out of her.”

"On Wednesday, January 7th, we stopped to support our neighbors. We had whistles. They had guns," Becca Good said.

“I am now left to raise our son and to continue teaching him, as Renee believed, that there are people building a better world for him,” she wrote.

The reaction to Good's shooting was immediate in the city where police killed George Floyd in 2020, with hundreds of protesters converging on the shooting scene and the school district canceling classes for the rest of the week as a precaution and offering an online option through Feb. 12.

On Friday, protesters were outside a federal facility serving as a hub for the immigration crackdown that began Tuesday in Minneapolis and St. Paul. That evening, hundreds protested and marched outside two hotels in downtown Minneapolis where immigration enforcement agents were supposed to be staying. Some people were seen breaking or spray painting windows and state law enforcement officers wearing helmets and holding batons ordered the remaining group of fewer than 100 people to leave late Friday.

The Portland shooting happened outside a hospital Thursday. A federal border officer shot and wounded a man and woman in a vehicle, identified by the Department of Homeland Security as Venezuela nationals Luis David Nico Moncada and Yorlenys Betzabeth Zambrano-Contreras.

Police said they were in stable condition Friday after surgery, with DHS saying Nico Moncada was taken into FBI custody.

DHS defended the actions of its officers in Portland, saying the shooting occurred after the driver with alleged gang ties tried to “weaponize” his vehicle to hit them. It said no officers were injured.

Portland Police Chief Bob Day confirmed that the two people shot had “some nexus” to Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang. Day said they came to the attention of police during an investigation of a July shooting believed to have been carried out by gang members, but they were not identified as suspects.

The chief said any gang affiliation did not necessarily justify the shooting by US Border Patrol. The Oregon Department of Justice said it would investigate.

On Friday evening, hundreds of protesters marched to the ICE building in Portland.

The Minneapolis shooting happened on the second day of the immigration crackdown in the Twin Cities, which Homeland Security said is the biggest immigration enforcement operation ever. More than 2,000 officers are taking part and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said they have made more than 1,500 arrests.

The government is also shifting immigration officers to Minneapolis from sweeps in Louisiana, according to documents obtained by The Associated Press. This represents a pivot, as the Louisiana crackdown that began in December had been expected to last into February.

Good's death — at least the fifth tied to immigration sweeps since President Donald Trump took office — has resonated far beyond Minneapolis. More protests are planned for this weekend, according to Indivisible, a group formed to resist the Trump administration.</description><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 07:20:07 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/859074e0-edeb-11f0-936d-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26009843919737.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Fatal ICE shooting of Minneapolis activist sets stage for national protests</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/fatal-ice-shooting-minneapolis-activist-sets-stage-national-protests-2026-01-10/</link><description>MINNEAPOLIS, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Civil liberties and migrant-rights groups called for nationwide rallies on Saturday to protest the fatal shooting of an activist in Minnesota by a U.S. immigration agent, as state authorities opened their own investigation of the killing.

Protest organizers said more than 1,000 weekend events were planned across the country demanding an end to large-scale deployments of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents ordered by President Donald Trump, mostly to cities led by Democratic politicians.

Minneapolis became a major flashpoint of the Republican president's militarized deportation roundups on Wednesday, when an ICE officer shot and killed a 37-year-old mother of three , Renee Good, behind the wheel of her car on a residential street.

The violence came soon after some 2,000 federal officers were dispatched to Minneapolis in what ICE's parent agency, the Department of Homeland Security, called the "largest DHS operation ever." Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, a Democrat, condemned the deployment as a "reckless" example of "governance by reality TV."

At the time, Good was participating in one of numerous "neighborhood patrols" that track, monitor and record ICE activities, according to family and local activists.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and other Trump administration officials said Good was "impeding" and "stalking" ICE agents all day, and that the officer opened fire in self-defense when she tried to ram her car into him in an "act of domestic terrorism."

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, a Democrat, pointed to bystander video he said directly contradicted the federal government's "garbage narrative." Civil liberties advocates said the video showed federal agents lacked any justification for using deadly force.

Amid the sharply differing accounts of the shooting, Minnesota and Hennepin County law enforcement authorities said on Friday they were opening their own criminal inquiry of the incident separate from a federal investigation led by the FBI.

Some Trump administration officials, including Vice President JD Vance, asserted state prosecutors lack jurisdiction to charge a federal officer with a crime, though legal experts say federal immunity in such cases is not automatic.

The crisis atmosphere led Walz - a prominent Trump antagonist who branded Trump and his Republican allies as "weird" during his own run for vice president last year - to put the state's National Guard on alert.

Federal-state tensions escalated further on Thursday when a U.S. Border Patrol agent in Portland, Oregon, shot and wounded a man and woman in their car after an attempted vehicle stop. As in the Minneapolis incident, DHS said the driver had tried to "weaponize" his vehicle and run over agents.

DHS on Friday identified the wounded driver and passenger as suspected gang associates from Venezuela who were in the U.S. illegally. The agency said the woman had been involved in a prior shootout in Portland but provided no evidence of its allegations against the pair.

Portland Mayor Keith Wilson, echoing Frey, said he could not be sure the government's account was grounded in fact without an independent investigation.

The deployment of agents to Minneapolis follows Trump's recent denunciations of Walz and his state's large population of Somali immigrants over allegations of fraud dating back to 2020 by some nonprofit groups administering childcare and other social service programs.

Good was shot dead just a few blocks from where George Floyd was killed by a Minneapolis police officer crushing his neck into the pavement with his knee during a videotaped arrest in May 2020. Floyd's death sparked months of nationwide racial-justice protests during Trump's first term in office.

Bystander video of the Minneapolis incident showed masked officers approaching Good's Honda SUV while it was stopped at a perpendicular angle to the street, partially blocking traffic.

One agent is seen ordering her out of the car and grabbing onto the driver-side front door handle as the car pulls forward and steers away from the officers, one of whom jumps back and fires three shots into the front of the vehicle as it rolls past.

Video filmed by the officer who opened fire, identified through official comment and public records as Jonathan Ross, shows Good appearing calm. She is heard telling him, "That's fine, dude, I'm not mad at you" - moments before he opens fire as she drives forward into the street, steering the car away from him.

Noem has said he was treated at a local hospital for unspecified injuries and released.

The car's front bumper appears in the bystander video to pass Ross before he shot at Good. It is unclear from any of the footage whether the vehicle made contact with him.

In any case, Ross is shown remaining on his feet and can be seen walking after the incident, contradicting Trump's assertion on social media that the woman "ran over the ICE officer."

The two DHS-related shootings this week have drawn thousands of protesters to the streets of Minneapolis, Portland and other U.S. cities, with many more demonstrations under the banner "ICE Out For Good" planned for Saturday and Sunday.

The rallies were being organized by a coalition of groups including the American Civil Liberties Union, MoveOn Civic Action, Voto Latino, and Indivisible, some of which were at the forefront of "No Kings" protests against Trump last year.</description><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 07:40:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5ECQRUDDDZLNZAXMOFN75PUNF4.jpg?auth=52540f51b34d4d208d8adcb907e84a564dee11ac4c8b0a739aa343f9525c7860&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Death toll in Philippines landfill collapse rises to 4</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/death-toll-philippines-landfill-collapse-rises-4-2026-01-10/</link><description>CEBU CITY, Philippines, Jan 10 (Reuters) - The death toll from a landfill collapse in the central Philippines has risen to four, an official said on Saturday, as rescue efforts continued for dozens who remained missing.

The Binaliw landfill in the central city of Cebu collapsed on Thursday, with 110 workers on site at the time. Several structures and facilities inside the landfill were damaged during the collapse.

Cebu City Mayor Nestor Archival said in a Facebook post on Saturday the death toll had risen to four and that 12 others had been sent to hospitals.

"Authorities confirmed ... detected signs of life in specific areas, requiring continued careful excavation and the deployment of a more advanced 50-ton crane," Archival said.

Thirty-six people were missing based on a Friday tally. An update on the number of missing was not immediately available.

Families of the missing workers remained hopeful on Saturday that they would be found alive.

Jerahmey Espinoza, whose husband was among the missing, went to the landfill in hopes of finding him.

"They haven't seen him or located him ever since the disaster happened. We're still hopeful that he's alive," Espinoza said.</description><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 07:40:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/T75O532YAZKZVMH73DR3SZYPSU.jpg?auth=7fb1e6332ecbb692d1c4d51c11f60c9174070de0fea3b3af8d03b960e690e23b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Syrian army says it finished combing through Aleppo neighbourhood, signalling takeover from Kurdish forces</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/syrian-army-says-it-finished-combing-through-aleppo-neighbourhood-signalling-2026-01-10/</link><description>Jan 10 (Reuters) - The Syrian army has combed through Aleppo city's Sheikh Maksoud district, it said on Saturday, signalling it had seized the area from Kurdish fighters by force after a temporary ceasefire failed to end to days of deadly fighting.

The violence in the second city has deepened one of the main faultlines in Syria, where President Ahmed al-Sharaa's promise to unify the country under one leadership after 14 years of war has faced resistance from Kurdish forces wary of his Islamist-led government.

The U.S. and other world powers welcomed a ceasefire earlier in the week, but Kurdish forces refused to leave the last stronghold of Sheikh Maksoud under the deal. Syria's army said late on Friday it would conduct a ground operation to expel them.

Early on Saturday, Syria's army said it had finished combing through the district, but that some Kurdish fighters were still in hiding. In a written statement, Kurdish forces denied the government had captured Sheikh Maksoud and said they were still resisting. Reuters reporters in the city did not hear the sound of clashes.

The takeover of Sheikh Maksoud by the army would end Kurdish control over pockets of Aleppo held by Kurdish forces since Syria's war erupted in 2011. Kurdish forces still hold large parts of Syria's northeast, where they run a semi-autonomous zone.

They have resisted efforts to integrate into Syria's new government, made up of former rebel fighters who ousted longtime leader Bashar al-Assad in December 2024. With negotiations on their merging stalled, fighting erupted in Aleppo on Tuesday, leaving at least nine civilians dead and forcing more than 140,000 to flee.

U.S. envoy Tom Barrack said in a statement on X posted on Saturday that he had met with Jordan's Foreign Minister Ayman al-Safadi in Amman to consolidate a ceasefire and ensure the Kurdish forces' "peaceful withdrawal from Aleppo."</description><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 07:41:12 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/Y4GJIMZBSJLJ3HA6FUH7LRRROQ.jpg?auth=75a281ca31154ec5dc99632fc812b52d1de37c08712233397636c2cf51acadac&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Indonesia temporarily blocks access to Grok over  sexualised images</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/indonesia-temporarily-blocks-access-grok-over-sexualised-images-2026-01-10/</link><description>JAKARTA, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Indonesia temporarily blocked Elon Musk's Grok chatbot on Saturday due to the risk of AI-generated pornographic content, becoming the first country to deny access to the AI tool.

The move comes after governments and regulators from Europe to Asia have condemned and some have opened inquiries into sexualised content on the app.

xAI, the startup behind Grok, said on Thursday it was restricting image generation and editing to paying subscribers as it tried to fix safeguard lapses that had allowed sexualised outputs including depictions of scantily clad children.

"The government views the practice of non-consensual sexual deepfakes as a serious violation of human rights, dignity, and the security of citizens in the digital space," Communications and Digital Minister Meutya Hafid said in a statement.

The ministry has also summoned X officials to discuss the matter.

Musk said on X that anyone using Grok to make illegal content would suffer the same consequences as if they had uploaded illegal content.

xAI replied to Reuters' email seeking comment with what seemed to be an automated response: "Legacy Media Lies". X did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Indonesia, with the world's biggest Muslim population, has strict rules that ban the sharing online of content deemed obscene.</description><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 07:41:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BBH6UACQQFNVVAQQ6SG5OKMBAY.jpg?auth=ad2d8a1b2af9a85eb649f6d96c50106c6b57c21f437b3fa50788b88116879f37&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israel's Netanyahu hopes to 'taper' Israel off US military aid in next decade</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israels-netanyahu-hopes-taper-israel-off-us-military-aid-next-decade-2026-01-10/</link><description>JERUSALEM, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in an interview published on Friday that he hopes to "taper off" Israeli dependence on American military aid in the next decade.

Netanyahu has said Israel should not be reliant on foreign military aid but has stopped short of declaring a firm timeline for when Israel would be fully independent from the U.S.

"I want to taper off the military within the next 10 years," Netanyahu told the Economist. Asked if that meant a tapering "down to zero," he said, "Yes."

Netanyahu said he told President Donald Trump during a recent visit that Israel "very deeply" appreciates "the military aid that America has given us over the years, but here too we've come of age and we've developed incredible capacities."

In December, Netanyahu said Israel would spend 350 billion shekels ($110 billion) on developing an independent arms industry to reduce dependency on other countries.

In 2016, the U.S. and Israeli governments signed a memorandum of understanding for the 10 years through September 2028 that provides $38 billion in military aid, $33 billion in grants to buy military equipment and $5 billion for missile defence systems.

Israeli defence exports rose 13% last year, with major contracts signed for Israeli defence technology including its advanced multi-layered aerial defence systems.</description><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 08:27:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HYGINXS4IVMODAI7YY2VEKGKPI.jpg?auth=734d1f41f35db01760eb134b58a4dcdf96a7bc553cd8b80cb8c41adea3b42f17&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukraine drone strike causes fire at oil depot in Russia's Volgograd region, authorities say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/ukraine-drone-strike-causes-fire-oil-depot-russias-volgograd-region-authorities-2026-01-10/</link><description>MOSCOW, Jan 10 (Reuters) - A drone strike by Ukraine caused a fire at an oil depot in the Oktyabrskiy district in the southern part of Russia's Volgograd region, regional authorities said on Saturday.

Ukraine has been targeting Russia's energy infrastructure in recent months, aiming to cut off Moscow's ability to finance its military campaign against Kyiv.

"We don't want to be Americans, we don't want to be Danish, we want to be Greenlanders," the leaders of five parties in parliament said in a joint statement.

"The future of Greenland must be decided by Greenlanders," they added.

The statement came hours after Trump once again asserted that the US needs to own Greenland.

"We are going to do something ​on Greenland whether they like it or not. Because ‍if we don't do it, Russia or China will take over Greenland, and we're not ​going to have Russia or China as a neighbour," Trump ​told reporters at the White House while meeting with oil company executives.

Trump said the US must acquire Greenland, even though it already has a military presence on the island under a 1951 agreement. The island of 57,000 people is an autonomous territory of ‍the Kingdom of Denmark.

"You defend ownership. You don't defend leases," Trump added.

Denmark and other European allies have voiced shock at Trump's threats to take control of Greenland, where the US already has a military base.

Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has warned that an invasion of Greenland would end "everything", meaning the transatlantic NATO defence pact and the post-World War II security structure.

On Tuesday, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, Britain and Denmark issued ‌a joint statement, ​saying only Greenland and Denmark can decide matters regarding their relations.

Trump has made light of the concerns of Denmark, a steadfast US ally that joined the United States in the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

"I'm a fan of Denmark, too, I have to tell you. And you know, they've been very nice to me," Trump said.

"But you know, the fact that they had a boat land there 500 years ago doesn't mean that they own the land."

The latest joint statement by Greenland's top political parties comes as US Secretary of State Marco Rubio is due to meet next week with Denmark's foreign minister and representatives from Greenland.

NATO chief Mark Rutte on Friday discussed efforts to bolster Arctic security with Rubio ahead of newt week's discussions.

NATO has sought to deflect Washington's interest in Greenland by emphasising steps it is taking to bolster security in the region.

A NATO spokeswoman said Rutte spoke with Rubio "on the importance of the Arctic to our shared security and how NATO is working to enhance our capabilities in the High North."

While Denmark's prime minister has warned that an armed US attack to take Greenland could spell the end for the 76-year-old Western military alliance, the head of NATO's forces in Europe, US General Alexus Grynkewich, said Friday the alliance was far from being in "a crisis".</description><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 08:30:12 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/476439ba-edf8-11f0-9d68-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/000-89VG9WE.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China, Russia, Iran start 'BRICS Plus' naval exercises in South African waters</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-russia-iran-start-brics-plus-naval-exercises-south-african-waters-2026-01-10/</link><description>JOHANNESBURG, Jan 10 (Reuters) - China, Russia and Iran began a week of joint naval exercises in South Africa's waters on Saturday in what the host country described as a BRICS Plus operation to "ensure the safety of shipping and maritime economic activities".

BRICS Plus is an expansion of a geopolitical bloc originally comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa - and seen by members as a counterweight to U.S. and Western economic dominance - to include six other countries.

Though South Africa routinely carries out naval exercises with China and Russia, it comes at a time of heightened tensions between U.S. President Donald Trump's administration and several BRICS Plus countries, including China , Iran , South Africa and Brazil .

The expanded BRICS group also includes Egypt, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Ethiopia and the United Arab Emirates.

Chinese military officials leading the opening ceremony said Brazil, Egypt and Ethiopia participated as observers.

"Exercise WILL FOR PEACE 2026 brings together navies from BRICS Plus countries for ... joint maritime safety operations (and) interoperability drills," South Africa's military said in a statement.

Lieutenant Colonel Mpho Mathebula, acting spokesperson for joint operations, told Reuters all members had been invited.

Trump has accused the BRICS nations of pursuing "anti-American" polities, and last January threatened all members with a 10% trade tariff on top of duties he was already imposing on countries across the world.

The pro-Western Democratic Alliance, the second largest party in South African President Cyril Ramaphosa's coalition, said the exercises "contradict our stated neutrality" and that BRICS had "rendered South Africa a pawn in the power games being waged by rogue states on the international stage".

Mathebula rejected that criticism.

"This is not a political arrangement ... there is no hostility (towards the U.S.)," Mathebula told Reuters, pointing out that South Africa has also periodically carried out exercises with the U.S. Navy.

"It's a naval exercise. The intention is for us to improve our capabilities and share information," she said.</description><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 08:50:58 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/QRZREBZPAVND5ITNSIAIHQDA6M.jpg?auth=3ecf8efd8c78fdf146d0f02989f113a94b731328db9e138309a28e0ad3b6112b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UN says 53 Congolese refugees have died in Burundi</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/un-says-53-congolese-refugees-have-died-burundi-2026-01-10/</link><description>KINSHASA, Jan 10 - More than 50 refugees fleeing fighting in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo have died in neighbouring Burundi, the United Nations Refugee Agency told Reuters late on Friday.

Of a total 53 deaths recorded, 25 people died due to a cholera outbreak, the agency said, while six others died from anemia and other complications related to malnutrition, it said.

The U.N. said it was working with the health ministry and other partners to investigate the cause of the other deaths.

More than 100,000 Congolese have sought refuge in Burundi since fighting near the border intensified in early December and rebels seized the town of Uvira, the UNHCR said.

Jean Jacques Purusi, governor of South Kivu province where Uvira is located, described the situation in Burundi as "misery" and "a crisis completely forgotten by the international community and media."

Congo's state and social affairs ministry said it was leading a humanitarian mission to help displaced Congolese in Burundi, providing food, medicines, and non-food items.

The Iranian military statement came after U.S. President Donald Trump issued a new warning to Iran's leaders on Friday, and after Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Saturday declared: "The United States supports the brave people of Iran."

Unrest continued overnight. State media said a municipal building was set on fire in Karaj, west of Tehran, and blamed "rioters". State TV broadcast footage of funerals of members of the security forces it said were killed in protests in the cities of Shiraz, Qom and Hamedan.

Authorities continued to impose an internet blackout.

A witness in western Iran reached by phone said the Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) were deployed and opening fire in the area from which they were speaking, declining to be identified for their safety.

The Iranian military operates separately to the IRGC - an elite force tasked with defending Iran's Islamic Revolution and which authorities have deployed to quell previous unrest. Both forces are commanded by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

In a statement published by semi-official news sites, the military accused Israel and "hostile terrorist groups" of seeking to "undermine the country's public security".

"The Army, under the command of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief, together with other armed forces, in addition to monitoring enemy movements in the region, will resolutely protect and safeguard national interests, the country’s strategic infrastructure, and public property," it said.

The protests have spread across much of Iran over the last two weeks, beginning in response to soaring inflation, but quickly turned political with protesters calling for clerical rulers to step down. Authorities have accused the U.S. and Israel of fomenting the "riots".

Iranian rights group HRANA said it had documented 65 deaths including 50 protesters and 15 security personnel as of January 9. The Norway-based human rights group Hengaw said more than 2,500 people had been arrested over the past two weeks.

In a country with a history of fragmented opposition to clerical rule, the son of the last shah of Iran who was toppled in the 1979 Islamic revolution has emerged as a prominent voice abroad spurring on the protests.

In his latest appeal on the X social media platform, U.S.-based Reza Pahlavi said: "Our goal is no longer merely to come into the streets; the goal is to prepare to seize city centres and hold them."

He also called on "workers and employees in key sectors of the economy, especially transportation, and oil, and gas and energy", to begin a nationwide strike.

Trump said on Thursday he was not inclined to meet Pahlavi, a sign that he was waiting to see how the crisis plays out before backing an opposition leader.

Trump, who bombed Iran last summer and warned Tehran last week the U.S. could come to the protesters' aid, issued another warning on Friday, saying: "You better not start shooting because we'll start shooting too."

"I just hope the protesters in Iran are going to be safe, because that's a very dangerous place right now," he added.

Some protesters on the streets have shouted slogans in support of Pahlavi, such as "Long live the shah", although most chants have called for an end to rule by the clerics or demanded action to fix an economy hammered by years of U.S. and other international sanctions and pummelled by the 12-day war in June, when Israel and the U.S. launched air strikes on Iran.

A doctor in northwestern Iran said that since Friday, large numbers of injured protesters had been brought to hospitals. Some were badly beaten, suffering head injuries and broken legs and arms, as well as deep cuts.

At least 20 people in one hospital had been shot with live ammunition, five of whom later died.

On Friday, Khamenei accused protesters of acting on behalf of Trump, saying rioters were attacking public properties and warning that Tehran would not tolerate people acting as "mercenaries for foreigners".

The Revolutionary Guards’ public relations office said three members of the Basij security force were killed and five wounded during clashes with what it described as “armed rioters” in Gachsaran, in the southwest.

Another security officer was stabbed to death in Hamedan, in western Iran. The son of a senior officer, Brigadier General Martyr Nourali Shoushtari, was killed in the Ahmadabad area of Mashhad, in the northeast. Two other security personnel were killed over the past two nights in Shushtar, in Khuzestan province.

The protests pose the biggest internal challenge in at least three years to Iran's clerical rulers, who look more vulnerable than during past bouts of unrest amid a dire economic situation and after last year's war.

The leaders of France, Britain and Germany issued a joint statement on Friday condemning the killing of protesters and urged the Iranian authorities to refrain from violence.

Authorities have described protests over the economy as legitimate while condemning what they call violent rioters and cracking down with security forces.

Iran's clerical establishment has weathered repeated past bouts of unrest, including student protests in 1999, over a disputed election in 2009, against economic hardships in 2019, and the 2022 Woman, Life, Freedom protests.</description><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 10:21:31 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/L7ZSOOIGQRJWXF7KUO67PMR42E.jpg?auth=ad9f7115cc051c0b3f6fa0ca25dfa39eaa660197ac009e0138f26ddadf3aa08e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Exclusive: CIA highlighted Cuba's grim economy but gave mixed view on government falling</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/cia-highlighted-cubas-grim-economy-gave-mixed-view-government-falling-2026-01-10/</link><description>MIAMI/WASHINGTON, Jan 10 (Reuters) - U.S. intelligence has painted a grim picture of Cuba’s economic and political situation, but its assessments offer no clear support for President Donald Trump’s prediction that last weekend’s military action in nearby Venezuela leaves the island nation “ready to fall,” said three people familiar with the confidential assessments.

The CIA’s view is that key sectors of the Cuban economy, such as agriculture and tourism, are severely strained by frequent blackouts, trade sanctions and other problems. The potential loss of oil imports and other support from Venezuela, for decades a key ally, could make governing more difficult for the administration that has ruled Cuba since Fidel Castro led a revolution in 1959.

But the most recent CIA assessments were inconclusive on whether the worsening economy would destabilize the government, said the people familiar with the intelligence, speaking on the condition of anonymity to share sensitive information.

CUBA 'READY TO FALL': TRUMP

These assessments are notable because Trump and other U.S. officials have suggested that shutting off Venezuelan oil to the island after the Caracas operation could topple the government in Havana, a longtime dream of Secretary of State Marco Rubio and some other high-ranking officials in the Trump administration.

"Cuba looks like it is ready to fall," Trump told reporters on Air Force One on Sunday. "I don't know if they're going to hold out, but Cuba now has no income. They got all their income from Venezuela, from the Venezuelan oil."

The White House, the CIA and the Cuban Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not respond to requests for comment. Reuters could not determine if the CIA had produced an updated assessment since U.S. forces arrested Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro last Saturday.

Venezuela is Cuba's top oil supplier. Since Maduro's capture, the U.S. has successfully pressed Venezuelan interim President Delcy Rodriguez to send essentially all of Venezuela's oil to the U.S.

Given the dire assessments of Cuba's energy situation even when Venezuelan oil was flowing to the island, the impacts of Caracas' shifting oil flows on Cuba's economy will be severe, independent analysts say.

Cuba's Communist economy has performed poorly for decades amid rigid state planning and a U.S. embargo.

But a confluence of factors in recent years - including Venezuela's declining economy and a drop-off in tourism following the COVID-19 outbreak - has compounded Cuba's pain.

The people who were familiar with the intelligence and spoke to Reuters said the CIA had described Cuba's economy in very poor terms - although their descriptions differed in degree. One official said the situation described in the assessments was not quite as bad as the "Special Period" of the 1990s, a time of prolonged economic pain following the withdrawal of the Soviet Union's support in the late 1980s and early 1990s.

One of the officials, however, said blackouts were lasting on average 20 hours a day outside of Havana, which had not occurred previously.

Whether or not economic suffering actually leads to government change is unclear - a reality acknowledged in the CIA assessments.

Two U.S. officials said the U.S. government assessed that there has been a demographic collapse on the island in recent years, with large numbers of people under 50 having migrated from Cuba. That could blunt the push for political reform, which in other countries tends to draw energy from young people.

Cuba's census estimated the population at over 10 million in 2023, but one of the officials said it likely now stands at less than 9 million.

Richard Feinberg, a professor emeritus at the University of California San Diego who served in high-ranking U.S. national security roles for decades, said economic conditions in Cuba were "certainly very bad."

He noted that Cuba’s President, Miguel Díaz-Canel, who took office in 2021, does not have the widespread legitimacy enjoyed by former leader Fidel Castro.

"When a population is really hungry, what it does is, your day-to-day is just about survival. You don't think about politics, all you think about is putting bread on the table for your family," Feinberg said.

"On the other hand, people can become so desperate that they lose their fear, and they take to the streets."</description><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 10:21:52 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/VOYHKQ35ZJNXPJL7SGTQNPXTJY.jpg?auth=987a70091ea5b9b3c86cc5fa83d9d19aa74269ef99ab4b677f50337725cff41e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Governor of Russia's Belgorod region says 600,000 without power, heat, or water after Ukrainian strike</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/governor-russias-belgorod-region-says-600000-without-power-heat-or-water-after-2026-01-10/</link><description /><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 10:23:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Swiss canton leader voices anger over lack of checks at bar that caught fire</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/swiss-canton-leader-voices-anger-over-lack-checks-bar-that-caught-fire-2026-01-10/</link><description>ZURICH, Jan 10 (Reuters) - The leader of the Swiss canton where a bar fire killed 40 people voiced anger over local authorities' failure to inspect the venue for six years, as prosecutors step up efforts to hold those responsible to account.

The mayor of the ski resort of Crans-Montana said this week the "Le Constellation" bar had not been inspected since 2019, and Mathias Reynard, head of the Canton Valais government, expressed dismay at this in a local newspaper interview.

"I was angry, obviously," he told Le Temps, when asked about the missing checks. "At these serious failings. And I think it's normal to be angry. But we have to let justice take its course."

This week the Valais head of security said soundproofing foam in the basement of the bar that caught fire during New Year celebrations should have been subject to safety checks by law, contradicting Crans-Montana's mayor. Most victims were teenagers.

Prosecutors on Friday ordered the detention of Jacques Moretti, one of the bar's two French owners. A court will decide soon whether to place him under formal arrest.

Prosecutors are investigating the owners on suspicion of crimes including homicide by negligence. Victims' families have filed legal complaints over the fire.

Jessica Moretti, Jacques' partner, apologised to victims on Friday. The pair have said they are devastated by the tragedy.

Calls have intensified in Switzerland for those responsible to face justice. Critics of the investigation have questioned why both owners were free for so long.

"Those responsible will have to take responsibility, including the relevant authorities," Reynard said.</description><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 10:23:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/UEVJLBXSJ5PFBKWVMG564JPU3I.jpg?auth=2bbee4a48c5dda040e0a078eb9229324d2f2ce19071160e21fe9eb3371d3858d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Greenlanders voice concern after Trump reiterates goal to own island</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/greenlanders-voice-concern-after-trump-reiterates-goal-to-own-island</link><description /><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 10:24:03 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/b9f6245a-ee09-11f0-8c54-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260110-100841-101034-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Protests roil Iran despite nationwide internet blackout</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/protests-roil-iran-despite-nationwide-internet-blackout</link><description /><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 10:24:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/b4757eaa-ee08-11f0-a9b9-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260110-100201-100341-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Greenland's parliament will bring forward meeting to discuss US threats, party leaders say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/greenlands-parliament-will-bring-forward-meeting-discuss-us-threats-party-2026-01-10/</link><description>OSLO, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Greenland's parliament will bring forward a meeting to discuss its response to U.S. threats to take control of the Arctic island, the leaders of the five political parties in the Greenlandic assembly said in a joint statement.

President Donald Trump has said the United States must own Greenland, an autonomous part of the Kingdom of Denmark , to prevent Russia or China occupying the strategically located and minerals-rich territory in the future.

"We emphasise once again our desire for the U.S. contempt for our country to end," the leaders of all five political parties elected to Greenland's parliament said in their joint statement late on Friday.

"We do not want to be Americans, we do not want to be Danes, we want to be Greenlanders," they said in the statement, posted on social media by Greenland's prime minister , Jens-Frederik Nielsen.

A meeting of Greenland's parliament, the Inatsisartut, will be brought forward to ensure that a fair and comprehensive political debate takes place and that the people's rights are secured, the leaders said.

The date of the meeting has not yet been determined. Greenland's parliament last met in November and had been scheduled to meet again on February 3, according to its website.

Trump said on Friday he would "do something on Greenland whether they like it or not" and that the U.S. military presence in the island under a 1951 agreement with fellow NATO member Denmark is not enough to guarantee the island's defence.

Trump's renewed push for Greenland, after U.S. military intervention in Venezuela , worries many of the island's 57,000 inhabitants, whose widely held goal is to eventually become an independent nation.

A 2009 agreement between Greenland and Denmark explicitly recognised Greenlanders' right to independence if they choose, but while all five parties say they want independence, they differ on how and when to achieve it.

"We must decide the future of our country ourselves, without pressure for a quick decision, delay or interference from other countries," the party leaders said, adding that they sought dialogue based on diplomacy and international principles.</description><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 10:45:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/Z56QS4EVEVOFZEVRCO7KPYB7IY.jpg?auth=97b643c9eeffaa5c160914119edd160a10192d90d27b1dfe0cadd88ae83a17f0&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Yemen's main separatist group denies disbanding</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/yemens-main-separatist-group-denies-disbanding-2026-01-10/</link><description>CAIRO, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Yemen's main separatist group, the Southern Transitional Council, denied on Saturday it was disbanding, according to a statement posted on X.

Under Trump’s orders to ramp up deportations, masked immigration officers have surged into Democratic-led cities, sprayed tear gas in residential streets , tackled people in parking lots , opens new tab and pointed guns at bystanders trying to film them.

A federal officer in Minneapolis dragged a woman through a snowy street in an incident last month that the city’s police chief called an “egregious disregard for human dignity.”

These contentious encounters, which have come amid a push to quickly recruit and train thousands of new officers , have stemmed from a dramatic shift in the approach to immigration enforcement, according to current and former immigration officials.

The White House demanded a steep increase in immigration arrests in late May, leading officers to change tactics, embracing showy sweeps over more targeted arrests of people with serious criminal records. Since then, officers have been met with more public backlash and resistance, at times creating tense standoffs.

“It’s this high-visibility, high-footprint, high-contact form of operation that invites danger,” said former ICE official Scott Shuchart, who served in Joe Biden’s administration.

Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem have all defended the ICE officer who killed Renee Good , the 37-year-old mother of three, and portrayed her as an agitator trying to disrupt enforcement operations.

Within hours of the incident, Noem alleged that Good tried to ram the officer with her vehicle in an act of “domestic terrorism.”

In response to a Reuters request for comment, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson accused Democrats and news outlets of demonizing ICE officers and encouraging backlash.

"The Democrats’ lies have directly fueled their supporters to harass and impede law enforcement, which is the cause of any tensions and puts officers at risk," Jackson said.

The ICE officer involved in the fatal shooting, Jonathan Ross, fired the first of three shots as Good's vehicle moved past him, a Reuters analysis of the available visuals showed.

Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin defended the Trump administration's approach and said the officer in Minneapolis feared for his life.

“ICE law enforcement officers are trained to use the minimum amount of force necessary to resolve dangerous situations," she said.

One former ICE official who spoke with Reuters blamed Democratic leaders for fueling the backlash by refusing to cooperate with ICE and publicly criticizing their work. Another said it was jarring to see protesters following officers with whistles, trying to disrupt their work. In Minnesota, they have been pelted with snowballs.

The administration is preparing to spend tens of billions of taxpayer dollars to hire more immigration officers and intensify its operations, raising concerns such violence could grow in the coming year. Several current and former ICE officers, speaking on the condition of anonymity to speak openly about sensitive matters, expressed concerns that ICE could bring on less-qualified candidates with its accelerated hiring push.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said earlier this month that it had hired 12,000 new ICE officers on top of an existing force of 10,000, although some questioned whether that many were actually fully hired and working.

DHS' internal watchdog is conducting a review of ICE’s hiring practices, with staff expected to visit the department’s Georgia training facility in coming weeks, one of the former ICE officials said. The new curriculum cuts involved halving training for firearms and tactics, the former ICE official said.

The training for new ICE officers had previously been five months but the Trump administration reduced it to two months as part of its effort to speed up hires, McLaughlin said, adding that it was done to "cut redundancy" and that candidates still meet the same standards.

Even as immigration enforcement becomes more contentious and ICE adds thousands more officers, the agency will have less oversight than in previous years after several DHS oversight bodies experienced mass staffing cuts last year.

Federal immigration officers have shot people in 16 incidents , opens new tab since Trump intensified his crackdown in June, according to The Trace, a non-profit news outlet that tracks gun violence.

In some of the cases, immigration officials said agents were under threat due to vehicles being used as weapons, though video evidence and judges later raised questions about those claims.

The incidents included the fatal shooting in Chicago of a Mexican father of two after dropping off his kids , the shooting of a TikTok streamer in Los Angeles and a U.S. citizen in Chicago .

John Tsoukaris, a former top ICE official who retired in July, said the ICE officer who fired the fatal shots in Minneapolis may have been within the bounds of protocol and that an investigation would be needed to determine the facts.

"In these very stressful and challenging situations, officers have to make a split-second decision," said Tsoukaris, who was a field office director for ICE’s office in Newark, New Jersey. "We should not rush to judgment of the officer’s actions without the full picture."

The Supreme Court in September said the Trump administration could stop people in U.S. cities for reasonable suspicion of violating immigration laws based on factors such as having brown skin or speaking Spanish, a position defended by Justice Brett Kavanaugh in a concurrence at the time.

Opponents of Trump’s aggressive enforcement say such “Kavanaugh stops” by ICE and Border Patrol have inflamed tensions.

Darius Reeves, a former ICE field office director who retired in 2025, said the Trump administration's confrontational approach is putting officers at risk and increasing the likelihood of violent interactions.

Reeves, who spent more than two decades at the agency, said ICE historically tried to minimize its public presence and operate in a more targeted manner.

"We should not be flooding these neighborhoods and antagonizing people," Reeves said. "This is not going to go well.”</description><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 11:17:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/65VZI5UZ3ZI2TBI7ZEBT7CQ7LQ.jpg?auth=d8ae571723f5da02bc209bc3256245d5f74d6b9c43f065f22ba1cecbc489e274&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Kyiv's power, water and heat systems turned off for repairs amid intense cold</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/kyivs-power-water-heat-systems-turned-off-repairs-amid-intense-cold-2026-01-10/</link><description>Jan 10 (Reuters) - Kyiv's electricity system, severely damaged by a winter campaign of Russian bombardment including a strike two nights ago, has been turned off for repairs at the orders of the state grid operator, the city administration said on Saturday amid intense cold weather.

The architect described a life in Venezuela shaped by fear and violence . “I saw elderly people beaten. I saw friends die,” he said. “Almost all of them have left the country.”

When news broke that Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro had been captured by US forces , Jesus was stunned. Like millions of Venezuelans in exile, he had never truly believed this moment would come – least of all in this way. “I’m not entirely comfortable with it, particularly from a legal standpoint,” he said. “But given Venezuela’s reality, there were few alternatives.”

For others, relief outweighed any hesitation. Maria*, a Venezuelan who has lived in the United Kingdom for nearly 30 years, told The Observers she has long been fiercely opposed to Maduro. For her, his capture marked a long-awaited turning point.

Watch more China loses, but also gains a lot from Trump's Venezuela move, analyst says

“I know everything is not over,” she said. “This doesn't mean we are free yet: chavismo is still in power. But this is the beginning of the end.”

According to Maria, those opposing Maduro’s arrest are mainly people who benefited from the regime, or “ideologues who refuse to see the damage caused to the country over the past 25 years".

She believes a US‑led transition could help stabilise Venezuela’s battered economy – something that, in her view, has not happened in more than two decades. “We don’t have anyone today who is trustworthy or capable of governing the country,” she said. “The United States recognised that there is a political vacuum. A transition will take time, because corruption is massive, both within the regime and parts of the opposition.”

Maria said she would consider returning to Venezuela with her husband one day to “help rebuild” the country, where she still has family.

In Bogota, Colombia – home to one of the world’s largest Venezuelan diaspora – Derwin described scenes of celebration. “People went out to celebrate. I didn’t see anyone supporting Maduro.” He adds that online expressions of support for Maduro leave him baffled. “I don’t understand how that’s possible. These are the people who destroyed Venezuela.”

Several refugees, however, stressed that such celebrations are largely limited to those outside the country. “My people still cannot celebrate,” said Edgarlys Castaneda, a 27-year-old Venezuelan living in New York . A vocal opposition activist, she fled Venezuela after facing threats for her political engagement and spent several months in ICE detention in El Paso, Texas . She was released through habeas corpus and now lives under electronic monitoring in New York.

Edgarlys emphasises that the regime’s grip on power remains strong, highlighting the new laws criminalising sharing content perceived as favourable to Maduro’s capture.  “Only a few political prisoners have been released,” she said. “Many remain in jail. Things haven’t changed much inside Venezuela – it may even be more dangerous now.”

For many exiles, support for US intervention follows years of failed attempts to bring change through protests and elections. Juan Jose Cardenas Lopez, a Venezuelan oceanographer now living in Spain , left the country in 2024, largely due to a lack of work. He saw Maduro’s removal as inevitable.

“Maduro is the leader of a criminal system that led our country into disaster,” he said, citing repression, restrictions on free speech, electoral fraud allegations and accusations of drug trafficking . “Faced with the inaction of international justice and multilateral organisations, intervention by a superior force was the only option left.”

Cardenas Lopez believes Venezuela now faces a long transition that will require international support, particularly from Europe. While acknowledging that Washington acted in line with its geopolitical and economic interests, he said this does not invalidate the outcome.

“This has happened before,” he said. “Venezuela’s past economic development was largely linked to American industry. I don’t see another realistic option if the country is to recover in the short term and if people are to benefit.”

In Lyon , 20‑year‑old Samantha, whose family fled Venezuela in 2021 and was later granted political asylum in France, recalled the night the news broke. “My mother woke me up, everyone was awake that night,” she said. “When we realised Maduro had been captured, we cried, we danced, and we even opened a bottle of sangria.”

The initial joy was soon tempered by anxiety. “We have hope, but we don’t know what will happen next,” she said. “Trump has his interests, of course. But after so many deaths and failed attempts, we were desperate to get out of this situation.”

That ambivalence is echoed by former opposition figures now in exile.

Zeneida Gonzalez, 49, a lifelong political activist with the opposition party Vente Venezuela, fled the country in 2019 and now lives near Paris. She said constant surveillance, threats, and violence were an everyday reality for opponents of the regime.  “Everyone in Venezuela knows someone who was tortured,” she said. “I have friends who were shot in the head just for protesting.”

She insisted that recent political prisoner releases – though limited – would not have happened without US pressure. “People talk about oil,” she said. “We talk about the dead.”

For others, the capture of Maduro is just the beginning of a long road. Thanya Faverial, a former Venezuelan civil servant now working as a data project manager in France, recalled witnessing corruption and drug trafficking involving state-owned companies, alongside shortages so severe she struggled to find milk for her young child.

“Seeing those photos of Maduro on this plane felt like a Hollywood movie,” she said. “I cried both from joy and from the fear of being disappointed again.” She believes Maduro’s fall marks a rupture, but not a resolution. “This is a fracture in the dictatorship,” she said. “But some people who are even worse than Maduro are still in the government.”

The Iranian military statement came after US President Donald Trump issued a new warning to Iran's leaders on Friday, and after Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Saturday declared: "The United States supports the brave people of Iran."

Unrest continued overnight. State media said a municipal building was set on fire in Karaj, west of Tehran, and blamed "rioters". State TV broadcast footage of funerals of members of the security forces it said were killed ​in protests in the cities of Shiraz, Qom and Hamedan.

Saturday marks the start of the work week in Iran, but many schools and universities reportedly held online classes, Iranian state TV reported. Internal Iranian government websites are believed to be functioning.

State TV repeatedly played a driving, martial orchestral arrangement from the “Epic of Khorramshahr” by Iranian composer Majid Entezami, while showing pro-government demonstrations. The song, aired repeatedly during the 12-day war launched by Israel, honours Iran's 1982 liberation of the city of Khorramshahr during the Iran-Iraq war. It has been used in videos of protesting women cutting away their hair to protest against the 2022 death of Mahsa Amini as well.

With the internet down in Iran and phone lines cut off, gauging the demonstrations from abroad has grown more difficult. But the death toll in the protests has grown to at least 65 people killed and over 2,300 others detained, according to the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency. Iranian state TV is reporting on security force casualties while portraying control over the nation.

A witness in western Iran reached by phone told Reuters the Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) ‍were deployed and opening fire in the area from which they were speaking, declining to be identified for their safety.

The military, which operates separately to the IRGC but is also commanded by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, announced it would "protect and safeguard national interests, the country’s strategic infrastructure, and public property".

In a statement published by semi-official news sites, the military accused Israel and "hostile terrorist groups" of seeking to "undermine the country's public security".

"The Army, under the command ​of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief, together with other armed forces, in addition to monitoring enemy movements in the region, will resolutely protect and safeguard national interests, the country’s strategic infrastructure, and public property," it said.

The protests have spread across much of Iran over the last two weeks, beginning in response to soaring inflation, but quickly turned political with protesters calling for clerical rulers to step down.

In a country with a history of fragmented opposition to clerical rule, the son of the last shah of Iran who was toppled in the 1979 Islamic revolution has emerged as a prominent voice abroad spurring on the protests.

In his latest appeal on the X social media platform, US-based Reza Pahlavi said: "Our ‍goal is no longer merely to come into the streets; the goal is to prepare to seize city centres and hold them."

He also called on "workers and employees in key sectors of the economy, especially transportation, and oil, and gas and energy", to begin a nationwide strike.

Trump said on Thursday he was not ​inclined to meet Pahlavi, a sign that he was waiting to see how the crisis plays out before backing an opposition leader.

Trump, who bombed Iran last summer and warned Tehran last week that the US could come to the protesters' aid, issued another warning on Friday, saying: "You better not start shooting because we'll start shooting too."

"I just hope the protesters in Iran are going to be safe, because that's a very ‌dangerous place right now," he added.

Some protesters on the streets have shouted slogans in support of Pahlavi, such as "Long live the shah", although most chants have called for an end to rule by the clerics or demanded action to fix an economy hammered by years of US and other international sanctions and pummelled by the 12-day war in June, when ‍Israel and the US launched air strikes on Iran.

A doctor in northwestern Iran said that since Friday, large numbers of injured protesters had been brought to hospitals.

Some were badly beaten, suffering head injuries and broken legs and arms, as well as deep cuts.

At least 20 people in one hospital had been shot with live ammunition, five of whom later died.

On Friday, Khamenei accused protesters of acting on behalf of Trump, saying rioters were attacking public properties and warning that Tehran would not tolerate people acting as "mercenaries for foreigners".

The Revolutionary Guards’ public relations office said three members of the Basij security force were killed and five wounded during clashes with what it described as “armed rioters” in Gachsaran, in the southwest.

Another security officer was stabbed to death in Hamedan, in western Iran. The son of a senior officer, Brigadier General Martyr Nourali Shoushtari, was killed in the Ahmadabad area of Mashhad, in the northeast. Two other security personnel were killed over the past two nights in Shushtar, in ‍Khuzestan province.

The protests pose the biggest internal challenge in at least three years to Iran's clerical rulers, who look more vulnerable than during past bouts of unrest amid a dire economic situation and after last year's war.

The leaders of France, Britain and Germany issued a ‌joint statement on Friday condemning the killing of ​protesters and urged the Iranian authorities to refrain from violence.

Authorities have described protests over the economy as legitimate while condemning what they call violent rioters and cracking down with security forces.

Iran's clerical establishment has weathered repeated past bouts of unrest, including student protests in 1999, over a disputed election in 2009, against economic hardships in 2019, and the 2022 Woman, Life, Freedom protests.</description><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 11:41:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/4912dabe-e62d-11f0-8568-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25363525413736.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Four tankers that had left Venezuela in 'dark mode' are back in its waters</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/four-tankers-that-had-left-venezuela-dark-mode-are-back-its-waters-2026-01-10/</link><description>Jan 10 (Reuters) - At least four tankers, most of them loaded, that had departed from Venezuela in early January in 'dark mode' - or with their transponders off amid a strict U.S. blockade - are now back in the South American country's waters, according to state company PDVSA and monitoring service TankerTrackers.com.

A flotilla of about a dozen loaded vessels and at least three other empty ships left Venezuelan waters last month in apparent defiance of an embargo imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump since mid-December, which has dragged down the country's oil exports to minimum.

One of the ships, the Panama-flagged supertanker M Sophia, was intercepted and seized by the U.S. this week when returning to the country; while another, the Aframax tanker Olina with a flag from Sao Tome And Principe, was intercepted but released to Venezuela on Friday, state company PDVSA said.

Three more of the vessels that had departed in that flotilla, Panama-flagged Merope, Cook Islands-flagged Min Hang and Panama-flagged Thalia III, were spotted by Tankertrackers.com in Venezuelan waters late on Friday through satellite images.

U.S. authorities had said on Friday that Olina -previously known as Minerva M - would be freed. The next step for the country, which remains under strict U.S. supervision after it captured and extracted President Nicolas Maduro last week, would be the beginning of organized crude exports as part of a $2 billion oil supply deal Caracas and Washington are negotiating, they said.

In a meeting with top oil company executives on Friday, U.S. President Donald Trump said arrangements for the supply had progressed. Global trading houses Vitol and Trafigura received this week the first U.S. licenses to negotiate and carry Venezuela's exports, and naphtha supplies to the OPEC country also are expected, sources said.</description><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 13:48:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>South Africa president urges ANC to fix poor local government ahead of poll</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/south-africa-president-urges-anc-fix-poor-local-government-ahead-poll-2026-01-10/</link><description>JOHANNESBURG, Jan 10 (Reuters) - South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa on Saturday urged his co-ruling African National Congress to address its dismal record on providing basic services, ahead of local elections in which the ANC's share of the vote is widely expected to slide.

Africa's most industrialised country must hold local elections before November, and the ANC often does worse in local polls than national, as voters vent their frustrations over leaky water pipes, sewage discharges and crumbling roads.

"The first task for our movement in 2026 is to fix local government and improve services," Ramaphosa told his party at a televised event in Rustenburg, Northwest Province, to celebrate its 114th birthday.

In the 2021 local election , the ANC won less than half of the votes for the first time since the 1994 end of white minority rule, in what turned out to be a forerunner for national polls less than three years later when the party lost its majority.

"Municipalities must ... fulfill their basic obligations," Ramaphosa said. "They must fix potholes, remove refuse regularly (and) provide clean water and sanitation".

The ANC was celebrated for unifying a country divided along race lines, and for one of the world's most progressive constitutions and judiciaries.

It punches above its weight diplomatically, bringing a genocide case against Israel and securing a G20 summit declaration despite a U.S. boycott.

At the same time, its record on more mundane tasks, such as repairing drains and staffing schools, has been poor.

Ramaphosa said chronic power shortages had ended, but some municipalities continued to have local outages. He pledged 54 billion rand ($3.28 billion) in state funding for water and power infrastructure.

Though growth has improved, unemployment remains high, and many young people were starting to "question whether our democracy ... and indeed our movement really work for them," Ramaphosa said.

There were no immediate reports of casualties, regional Gov. Andrei Bocharov was quoted as saying in a Telegram post published on the channel of the local administration. The post did not specify the damage, but said that people living near the depot may have to be evacuated.

Ukraine’s long-range drone strikes on Russian energy sites aim to deprive Moscow of the oil export revenue it needs to pursue its full-scale invasion. Russia wants to cripple the Ukrainian power grid, seeking to deny civilians access to heat, light and running water in what Kyiv officials say is an attempt to “weaponise winter".

Saturday's attack came the day after Russia bombarded Ukraine with hundreds of drones and dozens of missiles overnight into Friday, according to Ukrainian officials, killing at least four people in the capital. For only the second time in the nearly 4-year-old war, it used a powerful, new hypersonic missile that struck western Ukraine on Friday in a clear warning to Kyiv’s NATO allies.

The intense barrage and the launch of the nuclear-capable Oreshnik missile followed reports of major progress in talks between Ukraine and its allies on how to defend the country from further Moscow aggression if a US-led peace deal is struck.

Russia’s Defence Ministry said Saturday that its forces used aviation, drones , missiles and artillery to strike Ukrainian energy facilities and fuel-storage depots on Friday and overnight. It did not immediately specify the targets or damage.

⁠Kyiv's ‍electricity system was ​turned off for ‍repairs at the orders of the ​state grid operator, the city ​administration said on Saturday.

The city's water and heat distribution systems, as well as electrified public transport, have also ‍stopped working as a result of the ​power outage, the administration said on Telegram.

It said repairs were ‌under way, but did not indicate how long ‍the systems would remain shut down amid intense cold weather.

Half of Kyiv's apartment blocks were without heat on Friday after the latest Russian attack, as ‍temperatures sank below minus 10 degrees ‌Celsius (14 degrees ​Fahrenheit).

Overnight into Saturday, Russia struck Ukraine with 121 drones and one Iskander-M ballistic missile, according to the Ukrainian air force. It said 94 drones were shot down.</description><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 14:21:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/e24e6cc2-ee28-11f0-8b51-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-10T082521Z-1498693124-RC2TXIAQ0X37-RTRMADP-3-UKRAINE-CRISIS-ATTACK-BELGOROD-BLACKOUT.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Cuba on edge after US captures Venezuela's Maduro</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/cuba-on-edge-after-us-captures-venezuela-s-maduro</link><description /><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 14:21:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/fed9c8e6-ee28-11f0-9ec5-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260110-131348-131611-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Protest erupts in Minneapolis after fatal ICE shooting of activist</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/protest-erupts-in-minneapolis-after-fatal-ice-shooting-of-activist</link><description /><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 14:21:58 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/fbbf82a2-ee16-11f0-9c44-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260110-120613-120812-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Suspect detained after six killed in Mississippi, say law enforcement, local media</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/suspect-detained-after-six-killed-mississippi-say-law-enforcement-local-media-2026-01-10/</link><description>Jan 10 (Reuters) - At least six people were fatally shot on Friday night in Clay County, Mississippi, and the suspect is in custody, according to local news outlets and law enforcement, without providing additional details.

The deaths occurred at three different shooting locales, according to WTVA, an NBC News affiliate.

The suspect is in custody "and no longer poses a threat to our community," Eddie Scott, the Clay County sheriff, posted on social media.

His post did not provide a specific figure for the number of fatalities, but WTVA said six people died.

Scott and the sheriff's department did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

"I ask that you lift our victims and their families in your prayers," Scott wrote on Facebook.

Located in northeastern Mississippi, Clay County has a population of nearly 20,000.</description><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 15:20:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Yemen completes evacuation of stranded tourists on Socotra island</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/yemen-completes-evacuation-stranded-tourists-socotra-island-2026-01-10/</link><description>Jan 10 (Reuters) - Yemen completed on Saturday the evacuation of more than 600 tourists who had been stranded on the remote Yemeni island of Socotra after the United Arab Emirates withdrew its troops from Yemen last week amid a rift with Saudi Arabia.

Four flights operated by Yemenia Airways, Yemen's national carrier, transported 609 tourists to Saudi Arabia's city of Jeddah, the Yemeni Foreign Ministry said in a statement.

Air traffic at the island's main airport came to a halt as a deepening crisis between the UAE and Saudi Arabia translated into fresh conflict on Yemen's mainland, where the two Gulf powers now back opposing groups in the country's civil war.

Socotra, which lies more than 300 km (186 miles) south of Yemen's coast and until recently was mainly accessible by air via the UAE, has been a haven of tranquillity through the years of conflict on the mainland.</description><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 15:21:54 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Storm Goretti kills man in UK and leaves 100,000 French homes without power</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260110-storm-goretti-kills-man-in-uk-and-leaves-100-000-french-homes-without-power</link><description>A man was killed after a tree fell on a caravan in England after record winds brought by Storm Goretti, as 100,000 homes in France were still without power on Saturday.

Some 15 people have died in weather-related accidents this week across Europe as gale-force winds and storms caused travel mayhem, shut schools, and cut power to hundreds of thousands in freezing temperatures.

The storm barrelled through southwestern Cornwall and parts of Wales overnight Thursday to Friday, with gusts of up to 160 kilometres per hour (100 miles per hour) downing trees and leaving tens of thousands of homes without power.

A man was found dead in the town of Helston in Cornwall on Friday after a tree fell onto a caravan, UK police said.

"Tragically, a man aged in his 50s was located deceased within the caravan," Devon and Cornwall police said in a statement.

Most of the UK remains under a weather warning for snow and ice on Saturday, the Met Office national weather agency said, warning that black ice could cause "disruption" in Scotland and northern England.

Heavy snowfall followed by the storm meant that some 250 schools in Scotland were closed for the much of the first week back after the Christmas break.

Around 28,000 homes were still without power at the start of the weekend in southwestern England and the Midlands, according to the network operator National Grid.

Storm Goretti also ploughed through other parts of northern Europe, with nearly 100,000 homes in France still without power on Saturday morning.

Meanwhile long-distance rail traffic slowly resumed on Saturday in northern Germany , after being completely suspended on Friday due to another storm named Elli, rail operator Deutsche Bahn said.

In the far north of the country, the port city of Hamburg, heavily affected by a large amount of snow, remains particularly impacted by the disruptions, it added.

A number of rail services will still not be restored on Saturday, notably those linking Hamburg to Copenhagen , Amsterdam and Hanover.

Services from Hamburg to the western Ruhr region or to Berlin are expected to be restored over the course of Saturday, it said.</description><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 15:22:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/a3e3bf64-ee32-11f0-96f6-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26009372666881.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Egypt announces results of last seats in parliament vote that gave Sisi strong majority</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/egypt-announces-results-last-seats-parliament-vote-that-gave-sisi-strong-2026-01-10/</link><description>Jan 10 - Egypt’s National Elections Authority declared the results on Saturday of the last 49 seats in a parliamentary election that began more than three months ago and gave President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi the super-majority he needs to amend the constitution.

The results of the final seats had been held up by reruns of voting in constituencies where initial results had been annulled.

Although the Elections Authority did not list the party affiliations of the elected candidates, the results are not believed to alter the overall composition of parliament, which will be overwhelmingly controlled by Sisi's supporters.

Last week, Egypt’s State Information Service said opposition parties and independents were on track to hold 158 of the 568 elected seats, about 28%. The president also appoints a further 5% of seats, bringing the total to 596. A two-thirds majority is needed to amend the constitution.</description><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 16:25:32 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/X66KP5DW5RIERG5DGWGBYHV2LE.jpg?auth=865f13b75e65854d688919ce60ff3925f619a14270476ad38f30c3f77c59f735&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'Nothing to Lose': Nationwide protests challenge Iran’s regime</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/nothing-to-lose-nationwide-protests-challenge-iran-s-regime</link><description /><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 16:25:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/8bca8878-ee2c-11f0-b670-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260110-130340-131323-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Protests sweep Iran as authorities intensify crackdown on demonstrators</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/protests-sweep-iran-as-authorities-intensify-crackdown-on-demonstrators</link><description /><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 16:26:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/67ef2b56-ee37-11f0-a442-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260110-160128-160334-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump presses top oil executives to invest in Venezuela's reserves</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/trump-presses-top-oil-executives-to-invest-in-venezuela-s-reserves</link><description /><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 16:26:02 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/d013a444-ee2a-11f0-a38b-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260110-140706-140856-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Police arrest 29 people during overnight protests in Minneapolis</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/police-arrest-29-people-during-overnight-protests-minneapolis-2026-01-10/</link><description>MINNEAPOLIS, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Twenty-nine people were arrested overnight as police responded to protests against federal immigration enforcement in Minneapolis, Mayor Jacob Frey said at a press conference on Saturday.

In a statement, the institute said the decision to award a Nobel Prize is final and permanent, citing the statutes of the Nobel Foundation, which do not allow appeals. The organization also noted that committees awarding the prizes do not comment on the actions or statements of laureates after receiving awards.

“Once a Nobel Prize is announced, it cannot be revoked, shared or transferred to others,” the Norwegian Nobel Committee and the Norwegian Nobel Institute said on Friday. “The decision is final and stands for all time.”

On Monday, Machado, speaking to Sean Hannity on Fox News, said that presenting the prize to Trump would be an act of gratitude from the Venezuelan people for the removal of Nicolás Maduro, the country’s president, who was captured last week by the United States.

“Did you at any point offer to give him the Nobel Peace Prize?” Hannity asked. “Did that actually happen?”

She responded, “Well, it hasn’t happened yet."

Trump, who has long expressed interest in winning the prize and has at times linked it to diplomatic achievements, said he would be honored to accept the prize if offered by Machado during a planned meeting in Washington next week.

Machado, a former National Assembly member, was barred from running in Venezuela’s 2024 general election by authorities aligned with Maduro.

She backed a stand‑in candidate who was widely considered to have won the vote, although Maduro claimed victory.

Slovakia, which currently has five nuclear power reactors at two plants, has been in talks with Washington since last year to build a large plant with U.S. group Westinghouse.

Fico said on Saturday the plant would have capacity of almost 1,200 megawatts (MW), bigger than existing units.

"In cooperation with American partners, we want to build a new huge block in purely state ownership on the grounds of the existing nuclear power plant in Jaslovske Bohunice," he said, without elaborating.

Fico said he wanted to participate in the signing of the more general agreement on U.S.-Slovak cooperation in the nuclear sector in Washington on Friday. He did not give more details on the signing.

The Slovak government approved an inter-governmental deal with the U.S. in October for the construction of a new unit, and Fico said in December U.S. President Donald Trump had invited him to the United States during this year's soccer World Cup for the signing of a nuclear power deal between the two countries.</description><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 18:30:56 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/FAQSOBJFNNPFXHA7AGLBI6BN34.jpg?auth=38611e85acdb1e6b86ec77b99f99a1a5e3252f6bd72d6cd1f9b42babc47706e1&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Anti-ICE protesters plan rallies across US after killing of Minneapolis woman</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260110-anti-ice-protesters-plan-rallies-across-us-after-killing-of-minneapolis-woman</link><description>Hundreds of rallies were planned for Saturday and Sunday across the United States to protest actions of the federal immigration agency after the fatal shooting of a 37-year-old woman in Minneapolis.

Organizers said more than 1,000 events were planned under the slogan "ICE, Out for Good" – referring to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency that is drawing growing opposition over its execution of President Donald Trump 's crackdown on illegal immigration.

The slogan is also a reference to Renee Good, the motorist shot dead by an ICE agent in the midwestern US city of Minneapolis on Wednesday.

Her death has sparked strong emotions in this Democratic stronghold, and further afield. Protests are planned across the country, including around Washington, D.C., Philadelphia and Los Angeles.

The calls to protest are being amplified by the "No Kings" movement, a network of left-wing organizations that mounted nationwide demonstrations against Trump last year.

The Trump administration has sought to paint Good as a "domestic terrorist," insisting that the agent who fatally shot her was acting in self-defense. This narrative is strongly disputed by local officials, who say footage of the shooting shows Good's vehicle was turning away from the agent and did not pose a threat to him.

Cell phone footage apparently taken by the officer who fired the fatal shots shows him interacting with Good as he approaches and circles her car, and her saying, "I'm not mad at you."

After he passes in front of the car, another agent can be heard ordering Good to exit the vehicle before she tries to drive off and shots ring out.

The agent filming the video can be heard saying "fucking bitch" at the end of the clip.

The White House insisted the video gave weight to the officer's claim of self-defense – even though the clip does not show the moment the car moved away, or him opening fire.

On Friday evening, hundreds of people gathered noisily in front of Minneapolis hotels believed to be housing ICE agents, equipped with whistles, loudspeakers, and musical instruments.

Twenty-nine ​people were arrested ⁠overnight as police responded to ​protests, ​Mayor Jacob Frey said at a press conference on Saturday.

Minneapolis ‍Police Chief ​Brian O'Hara said one police officer was ‌injured during the ‍protest response.

Officials and residents in Minnesota have expressed concern that local law enforcement agencies have been shut out of the FBI investigation into Minneapolis shooting.

"When the FBI, when the federal agencies, say they won't share evidence with the local authorities, the public can't trust that it's going to be a true, transparent investigation," Patrick O'Shaughnessy, a 43-year-old unemployed resident interviewed by AFP on Friday.

According to The Trace, a media outlet focusing on gun violence, reported that Good was the fourth person killed by federal immigration agents since the launch of the Trump administration's deportation policy, and seven others have been injured.

In a separate incident, two people were injured on Thursday in Portland, Oregon, by shots fired by federal border police during a traffic stop.</description><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 18:31:44 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/77134a50-ee4f-11f0-a61d-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26010546411712.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'Limited clashes' still ongoing in Aleppo neighborhood</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/limited-clashes-still-ongoing-in-aleppo-neighborhood</link><description /><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 18:31:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/701c7d88-ee41-11f0-9e51-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260110-170748-171134-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Nicaragua announces release of dozens of prisoners, one day after U.S. demands</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/nicaragua-announces-release-dozens-prisoners-one-day-after-us-demands-2026-01-10/</link><description>MEXICO CITY, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Nicaragua's government announced on Saturday that it had freed dozens of people from its national penitentiary system, a day after the United States demanded the release of more than 60 political prisoners in the country.

The releases comes at the same that Venezuela is in the process of releasing political prisoners under U.S. pressure.

In a statement, the authoritarian government of Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega announced the inmates' release without confirming the exact number of people freed or whether they had been detained for political reasons. It's unclear whether those released will be restricted to house arrest.

Opposition leader and former prisoner Ana Margarita Vijil, head of the UNAMOS political movement, told Reuters that those released “are political prisoners, and several of them are our friends.”

Vijil said she did not know the number of those involved but said they include former mayor Oscar Gadea and Christian pastor Rudy Palacios along with four of his relatives.

The U.S. has long exerted its influence in Latin America, but the pressure has been especially intense since the Trump administration attacked Venezuela a week ago and captured its president, Nicolas Maduro.

On Friday, the U.S. embassy in Nicaragua praised the release of opposition figures in Venezuela and called on Ortega's government to follow in their steps.

"In Nicaragua, more than 60 people remain unjustly detained or missing, including pastors, religious workers, the sick, and the elderly. Peace is only possible with freedom!," the embassy tweeted.</description><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 20:24:12 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Crans-Montana bar owner says service door was locked during deadly New Year blaze</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260110-crans-montana-bar-owner-says-service-door-was-locked-during-deadly-new-year-blaze</link><description>The French owner of the Swiss bar where 40 people died in a fire during New Year celebrations told investigators a service door had been locked from the inside.

Jacques Moretti, co-owner of the Constellation bar in the Swiss resort of Crans-Montana was taken into custody Friday, as prosecutors investigate the tragedy.

Most of the 40 people who died were teenagers, and another 116 people were injured .

Moretti told the Vallais public prosecutor's office that he had found out about the locked door just after the deadly fire.

When he arrived at the scene, he forced open the door, according to excerpts from police reports published by several French and Swiss media outlets confirmed to AFP by a source close to the case.

Moretti said he had found several people lying behind the door after opening it.

Initial findings suggest that the fire was caused by sparklers coming into contact with soundproofing foam installed on the ceiling of the establishment's basement.

Questions are also being raised regarding the presence and accessibility of fire extinguishers, and whether the bar's exits were in compliance with regulations.

"We always add a sparkler candle when we serve a bottle of wine in the dining room," said his wife and co-owner, Jessica, who was released after Friday's hearing.

Jacques Moretti told investigators that he had carried out tests and the candles were not powerful enough to ignite the acoustic foam.

Moretti said he bought the foam in a DIY store and installed it himself during renovations carried out after buying the establishment in 2015.

Regarding the presence of numerous underage kids in the bar at the time of the tragedy, Jacques Moretti said the establishment prohibited anyone under the age of 16 and that customers aged 16 to 18 had to be accompanied by an adult.

He said he had given these "instructions" to the security staff, but acknowledged that "it is possible that there was a lapse in protocol".

The couple is suspected of "negligent homicide, negligent bodily harm, and negligent arson".</description><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 20:25:02 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/4e50a228-ee60-11f0-993e-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26006576644548.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US military says it carried out strikes across Syria targeting Islamic State</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-military-says-it-carried-out-strikes-across-syria-targeting-islamic-state-2026-01-10/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 10 (Reuters) - The U.S. military said on Saturday it carried out multiple strikes in Syria targeting the Islamic State militant group.

Anxious relatives meanwhile camped outside jails, awaiting the promised release of political prisoners by the interim government.

Despite the shock of Maduro's capture during deadly nighttime raids on January 3, signs emerged Friday of cooperation with Washington after US President Donald Trump 's claim to be "in charge" of the South American country.

Venezuela's foreign minister said Friday it had launched talks with the United States on restoring diplomatic ties, which were severed in 2019 during Trump's first term.

Washington said US diplomats had visited Caracas to discuss reopening the American embassy.

A State Department official told AFP on Saturday they had left again on Friday "as scheduled."

"The Trump Administration remains in close contact with interim authorities" in Venezuela, the official addded.

Venezuela's interim president Delcy Rodriguez has pledged to cooperate with Trump over his demands for access to Venezuela's huge oil reserves after Maduro's ouster.

But she also moved to placate the powerful pro-Maduro base by insisting Venezuela is not "subordinate" to Washington.

In a gesture of ongoing defiance, organisers scheduled a rally of activists from the ruling leftist "Chavista" movement on Saturday.

The demo caps a week of angry protests after the United States launched airstrikes on Caracas, seized Maduro and took him to New York to face trial on drug-trafficking charges alongside his wife, Cilia Flores.

Rodriguez's camp on Thursday began releasing prisoners jailed under Maduro, promising a "large" number would be freed in a gesture of appeasement pending talks with Washington.

However, prisoners' rights groups said on Saturday that so far fewer than 20 had been freed, including several prominent opposition figures.

Families slept out overnight under blankets near El Rodeo prison east of Caracas, hoping for the release of their loved ones.

"I am tired and angry," Nebraska Rivas, 57, told AFP, as she waited for the release of her son.

"But I have faith that they will hand him over to us soon," she said, after sleeping out on the pavement for two nights.

"I have been fighting for this for seven years and I feel encouraged now because this is the home stretch. But I am also disappointed because nothing is happening."

The exiled opposition candidate from the 2024 elections , Edmundo Gonzalez Urritia, who was hoping for the release of his son-in-law, complained on X that "fewer than one percent of the announced releases" had taken place.

"Each hour that goes by without answers is a new form of violence against the families," he wrote.

Following Maduro's capture, Trump vowed to secure access for US companies to Venezuela's vast oil reserves.

Chevron is currently the only US firm licensed to operate in Venezuela, through a sanctions exemption.

The White House said Saturday Trump had signed an emergency executive order protecting US-held revenues derived from sales of Venezuelan oil, to prevent them from being seized by courts or creditors.

At a White House meeting on Friday, Trump pressed top oil executives to invest in Venezuela's reserves, but was met with a cautious reception.

ExxonMobil chief executive Darren Woods dismissed the country as "uninvestable" without sweeping reforms.

Experts say Venezuela's oil infrastructure is creaky after years of mismanagement and sanctions.

Trump said foreign firms had enjoyed no meaningful protections under Maduro, "but now you have total security. It's a whole different Venezuela."

He stressed that the companies would deal only with Washington, not Caracas, when exploiting Venezuela's oil resources.

Washington has maintained maritime pressure on oil tankers in the Caribbean, where it seized a fifth tanker carrying Venezuelan crude on Friday. Trump said that oil would be sold.

A sustained increase in Venezuelan oil production would take "months to years," Latin America specialist Orlando J. Perez, of the University of North Texas at Dallas, told AFP.

"It requires legal clarity on who can sign contracts, predictable sanctions relief, credible security conditions for firms, and major capital/technical inputs in a degraded sector."</description><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 21:47:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/fd0ebdaa-ee69-11f0-bfab-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26010714825096.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>North Korea's Kim Yo Jong urges South Korea to investigate drone incidents</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/north-koreas-kim-yo-jong-urges-south-korea-investigate-drone-incidents-2026-01-10/</link><description>SEOUL, Jan 11 (Reuters) - North Korea's Kim Yo Jong, the powerful sister of leader Kim Jong Un, urged South Korea to investigate recent drone incidents for detailed explanations, in a statement carried by state media KCNA on Sunday.

Kim said she personally appreciates Seoul for making a wise decision to announce its official stance that it has no intention of provocation, warning that any provocations will result in terrible situations.

Drones were flown from South Korea into North Korea earlier this month, after another intrusion in September, North Korea's military said on Saturday, which was soon followed by South Korea's response that they were not operated by the military.

South Korea also said there would be a thorough investigation of a civilian possibly having operated the drones, making clear its stance of having no intention of provocation.

"Clear is just the fact that the drone from the ROK violated the airspace of our country," Kim said. ROK stands for the Republic of Korea, South Korea's official name.

"No matter who is the perpetrator and whether it is a deed by any civilian organization or individual, the authorities responsible for national security can never evade their responsibility for it," she said.</description><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 22:20:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4RVEYTU7RJNXFJCTBX3WCEJU2M.jpg?auth=53ce2d10e4cebd161fb1b986a7b81a491ae6b05daa085b6b657919882ea13008&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukrainian drone attack injures four, damages buildings in Russia's Voronezh, governor says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/ukrainian-drone-attack-injures-four-damages-buildings-russias-voronezh-governor-2026-01-10/</link><description>Jan 10 (Reuters) - An overnight Ukrainian drone attack injured at least four people and damaged several buildings in Russia's southern city of Voronezh, governor of the Voronezh region said on Sunday.

Bessent said in an interview late on Friday that almost $5 billion worth of Venezuela's currently frozen IMF Special Drawing Rights monetary assets could be deployed to help rebuild the country's economy.

"We're de-sanctioning the oil that's going to be sold," Bessent said during a visit to a Winnebago Industries engineering facility. The Treasury was examining changes that would facilitate the repatriation of sale proceeds of the oil stored largely on ships back to Venezuela.

"How can we help that get back into Venezuela, to run the government, run the security services and get it to the Venezuelan people?" he said of the Treasury's sanctions analysis.

Asked when more sanctions could be removed from Venezuela, Bessent said, "It could be as soon as next week," but did not identify which ones.

The moves are part of the Trump administration's effort to stabilize Venezuela and encourage the return of U.S. oil producers to the country a week after U.S. forces captured Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro in Caracas and brought him to New York to face drug trafficking charges.

U.S. sanctions have banned international banks and other creditors from engaging with the Venezuelan government without a license. The institutions have cited this as an impediment to a complex $150 billion debt restructuring widely viewed as a key to the return of private capital to Venezuela.

On Friday evening, President Donald Trump signed an executive order blocking courts or creditors from impounding Venezuelan oil revenue held in U.S. Treasury accounts, declaring that these funds should be safeguarded to help Venezuela create "peace, prosperity and stability."

Bessent, who controls the dominant U.S. shareholding in the IMF and World Bank, said that the two institutions had already reached out to him about Venezuela.

The Treasury chief said that the U.S. Treasury would be willing to convert Venezuela's IMF Special Drawing Rights held at the Fund to dollars for use in rebuilding Venezuela.

Venezuela currently has about 3.59 billion SDRs, which are worth about $4.9 billion at Friday's exchange rate, but it cannot currently access them. SDRs are made up of dollars, euros, yen, sterling and Chinese yuan.

The Treasury last year agreed to back a $20 billion swap line for Argentina partly with that South American country's SDRs in an effort to stabilize the peso and help Argentine President Javier Milei's party win in parliamentary elections.

An IMF spokesperson said that the Fund was closely monitoring developments in Venezuela and declined comment on Bessent's mention of a meeting next week.

The IMF has not engaged with Venezuela for more than two decades, with the last formal IMF assessment of Venezuela's economy completed in 2004. Venezuela paid off its last World Bank loan in 2007, when Maduro's predecessor, the late Hugo Chavez declared that Venezuela "will no longer have to go to Washington" for funding.

A source familiar with the World Bank's internal discussions on Venezuela said that the development lender was in the early stages of exploring how it could be helpful to Venezuela, noting that the bank moved in quickly with assistance to Afghanistan and Syria after regime changes and provided early support to Gaza and Ukraine.

Bessent said that he believed that smaller, privately held companies would move swiftly back into Venezuela's oil sector, despite reluctance voiced by some oil majors including Exxon Mobil, whose past Venezuelan assets were nationalized twice.

"I think it's going to be the typical progression where the private companies can move quickly and will come in very quickly. They haven't talked about financing at all," Bessent said.

"Chevron has been there a long time and will continue to be there, so I believe that their commitment will greatly increase."

Bessent added that he believed there was a role for the U.S. Export-Import Bank in guaranteeing financing for Venezuela's oil sector, echoing previous comments from U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright.</description><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 22:21:47 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BQ32FRM57NLQBBEQCYS3PUQPIU.jpg?auth=425726b6caaf1c5fcc725ecaa14cbf1f3f454760f58433ba49cf0d6dd64281bf&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US carries out 'large scale' retaliation strikes against Islamic State group in Syria</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260110-us-carries-out-large-scale-retaliation-strikes-against-islamic-state-group-in-syria</link><description>US and allied forces carried out "large-scale" strikes against the Islamic State jihadist group in Syria on Saturday, the US military said, in the latest response to an attack last month that left three Americans dead.

Washington said a lone gunman from the militant group carried out the December 13 attack in Palmyra – home to UNESCO-listed ancient ruins and once controlled by jihadist fighters – that killed two US soldiers and a US civilian interpreter .

"The strikes today targeted ISIS throughout Syria" and were part of Operation Hawkeye Strike, which was launched "in direct response to the deadly ISIS attack on US and Syrian forces in Palmyra," US Central Command said in a statement on X, using an acronym for the jihadist group.

The United States and Jordan carried out a previous round of strikes as part of the same operation last month, hitting dozens of Islamic State group targets.

The Palmyra attack was the first such incident since the overthrow of Syria's longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad in December 2024.

The US personnel who were targeted were supporting Operation Inherent Resolve, the international effort to combat IS, which seized swaths of Syrian and Iraqi territory in 2014.

The jihadists were ultimately defeated by local ground forces backed by international air strikes and other support, but IS still has a presence in Syria, especially in the country's vast desert.

US President Donald Trump has long been skeptical of Washington's presence in Syria, ordering the withdrawal of troops during his first term but ultimately leaving American forces in the country.

The Pentagon announced in April that the United States would halve the number of US personnel in Syria in the following months, while US envoy for Syria Tom Barrack said in June that Washington would eventually reduce its bases in the country to one.</description><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 22:26:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/1d6a9110-dd93-11f0-88bf-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2025-12-20T005800Z-709279996-RC22JIAC0V5U-RTRMADP-3-USA-TRUMP-SYRIA-STRIKES.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Bangladesh seeks to join international force in Gaza</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/bangladesh-seeks-join-international-force-gaza-2026-01-10/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Bangladesh said on Saturday it has told the United States that it wants to join the international stabilization force that would be deployed in Gaza.

Bangladesh said its national security adviser, Khalilur Rahman, met U.S. diplomats Allison Hooker and Paul Kapur in Washington.

Rahman "expressed Bangladesh's interest in principle to be part of the international stabilization force that would be deployed in Gaza," a Bangladeshi government statement added. It did not mention the extent or nature of its proposed involvement. The State Department had no immediate comment.

A U.N. Security Council resolution, adopted in mid-November , authorized a so-called Board of Peace and countries working with it to establish a temporary International Stabilization Force in Gaza where a ceasefire began in October.

The truce has not progressed beyond its first phase, and little progress has been made on the next steps. More than 400 Palestinians and three Israeli soldiers have been reported killed since the ceasefire took effect, and nearly all of Gaza's more than 2 million people live in makeshift homes or damaged buildings in a sliver of territory where Israeli troops have withdrawn and Hamas has reasserted control.

Both Israel and Hamas remain far apart on the more difficult steps envisaged for the next phase of the ceasefire and have accused each other of violations.

Israel's military assault on Gaza since late 2023 has killed tens of thousands, caused a hunger crisis and internally displaced Gaza's entire population. Multiple rights experts , scholars and a U.N. inquiry say it amounts to genocide. Israel called its actions self-defense after a 2023 Hamas attack in which 1,200 were killed and over 250 taken hostage.</description><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 23:21:58 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BOEAARKZNFIW5HUHWMCFYRG4HU.jpg?auth=1c79eabdbefd506bec28772ab329a45f6983266734988585e0290943bd35d1a1&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Australia bushfires to burn out of control for weeks, authorities say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/australia-bushfires-burn-out-control-weeks-authorities-say-2026-01-10/</link><description>SYDNEY, Jan 11 (Reuters) - Australian authorities said on Sunday it would take firefighters weeks to get on top of bushfires in the country's southeast that have razed homes, cut power to thousands of homes and burned swathes of bushland.

The blazes have torn through more than 300,000 hectares (741,316 acres) of bushland in Victoria state since the middle of the week, destroying more than 130 properties, including homes, and leaving thousands without power.

There were more than 30 fires burning in Victoria on Sunday morning, Premier Jacinta Allan said. In neighbouring New South Wales state, several fires close to the Victorian border were burning at emergency level, the highest danger rating, the state's Rural Fire Service said.

Authorities have said the fires are the worst to hit the southeast since the Black Summer blazes of 2019-2020 that destroyed an area the size of Turkey and killed 33 people.

Chief Fire Officer of Forest Fire Management Victoria, Chris Hardman, said it would likely take firefighters weeks to get the upper hand on the fires.

"These fires will not be contained before it gets hot, dry and windy again," Hardman told Australian Broadcasting Corporation television.

Allan said on social media platform X that a total fire ban was in place for Victoria as thousands of firefighters and more than 70 aircraft battled the blazes.

"Bushfire smoke is impacting air quality in many areas across Victoria, including metropolitan Melbourne," she added.

One of the largest fires, near the town of Longwood, about 112 km (70 miles) north of Melbourne, has burned 130,000 hectares (320,000 acres) of bushland, destroying 30 structures, vineyards and agricultural land.

"My thoughts are with Australians in these regional communities at this very difficult time," Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said in televised remarks on Saturday.</description><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 23:41:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/D3QCVDOGBVLLJN5BLMUCZSZAQI.jpg?auth=74c4aa4265c1102a56565fcb51b787ea7ba56ccaf4f8592f1c02363c89c8d246&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Japan PM Takaichi may call early election, coalition partner says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/japans-coalition-partner-head-signals-snap-election-may-be-nearing-2026-01-11/</link><description>TOKYO, Jan 11 (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi may call an early general election, the head of her party's coalition partner, Hirofumi Yoshimura, said on Sunday, after media reported she was considering a February vote.

An early election could allow Takaichi, Japan's first female prime minister, to take advantage of the strong approval ratings she has enjoyed since taking office in October. Her tough stance on China has appealed to right-wing voters but has sparked a major diplomatic dispute with Japan's powerful Asian neighbour.

Yoshimura, leader of the Japan Innovation Party, known as Ishin, told public broadcaster NHK he had met with Takaichi on Friday and felt her view on the timing of an election had shifted to a new "stage".

"I won't be surprised if she made the decision as reported by media," Yoshimura said. The Yomiuri newspaper reported on Friday, citing government sources, that Takaichi was considering holding a snap election on February 8 or 15.

Yoshimura said he and Takaichi did not discuss the specific timing of any election.

Takaichi, a hard-line conservative and advocate of big spending, was mum on when she would call an election during an interview with NHK recorded on Thursday and aired on Sunday.

She said she had just instructed her cabinet ministers to ensure the timely execution of the supplementary budget for this fiscal year and parliamentary approval of the budget for the fiscal year beginning in April.

"At present, I am focusing on the immediate challenge of ensuring that the public feels the benefits of our stimulus policies aimed at cushioning the blow of inflation," she said.</description><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 01:55:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/JKQEE5JED5NMJEMZ3GIIUWB7JU.jpg?auth=0bb878ef298ad0b994651e8ea4ad79aefce1f7bd261b30c15038ef54a827a33c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Myanmar votes in second phase of military-run election</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/myanmar-votes-second-phase-military-run-election-2026-01-11/</link><description>Jan 11 (Reuters) - Voters in war-torn Myanmar queued up on Sunday to cast their ballots in the second stage of a military-run election, following low turnout in the initial round of polls that have been widely criticised as a tool to formalise junta rule.

Myanmar has been ravaged by conflict since the military ousted a civilian government in a 2021 coup and detained its leader, Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi , sparking a civil war that has engulfed large parts of the impoverished nation of 51 million people.

Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy party, which swept the last election in 2020, has been dissolved along with dozens of other anti-junta parties for failing to register for the latest polls, while rebel groups have refused to take part.

The United Nations, many Western countries and human rights groups say the election is a sham exercise that is neither free, fair nor credible in the absence of a meaningful opposition.

The military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party is leading by a huge margin after winning 90 of the 102 lower house seats contested in the first phase on December 28, which saw only 52.13% voter turnout , much lower than elections in 2020 and 2015.

"The USDP is on track for a landslide victory, which is hardly a surprise given the extent to which the playing field was tilted in its favour. This included the removal of any serious rivals and a set of laws designed to stifle opposition to the polls," said Richard Horsey, Senior Myanmar Adviser for Crisis Group.

A final round will take place on January 25. In all, there will be voting in 265 of Myanmar's 330 townships, including areas where the junta does not have full control.

The junta has said the election will bring political stability and a better future for the country, which is facing one of the most serious humanitarian crises in Asia.

At least 16,600 civilians have died in the conflict since the coup, according to Armed Conflict Location &amp; Event Data Project, and the U.N. estimates that 3.6 million people have been displaced.

However, analysts warn that the junta's attempt to form a stable administration amid raging conflict is fraught with risk and any military-controlled government is unlikely to gain broad international recognition.

Junta chief Min Aung Hlaing last month sidestepped a question from a reporter about his political ambitions.

He hailed the election as a success during a visit last week to central Myanmar township, where he urged authorities to work to further boost turnout.

"In phase one of the election, a large number of votes were cast, showing that the people have a strong desire to participate in the democratic process," state media quoted him as saying.

"Therefore, the election can be considered a successful one."</description><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 01:55:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/X3UBNTV5AZIADCSXLOU4YGQ6VE.jpg?auth=04c89bbd54f9d8090350b0cf651c4351051eca9dc6f9e6a54e8d2cfbd5803151&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Bob Weir, Grateful Dead co-founder and rhythm guitarist, dead at 78</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/bob-weir-grateful-dead-co-founder-has-died-age-78-2026-01-11/</link><description>Jan 10 (Reuters) - Veteran rock musician Bob Weir, the Grateful Dead's rhythm guitarist who helped guide the legendary jam band through decades of change and success, has died at age 78, according to a statement posted to his verified Instagram account on Saturday.

He was diagnosed with cancer in July and "succumbed to underlying lung issues" surrounded by loved ones, the statement said. It did not mention when or where he died.

Along with his late fellow Grateful Dead co-founder and lead guitarist Jerry Garcia, who was at the center of the Deadhead universe, Weir was one of the group's two frontmen and main vocalists for most of the band's history.

It was Weir who sang the verses on the band's trademark boogie anthem, "Truckin'," and who wrote such key songs as "Sugar Magnolia," "Playing in the Band" and "Jack Straw."

The youthful, ponytailed "Bobby" grew into an eclectic songwriter whose handsome appearance and diverse musical influences helped broaden the band's appeal. British newspaper The Independent called Weir "arguably rock's greatest, if most eccentric, rhythm guitarist."

After Garcia's death at age 53 in 1995, Weir carved out an interesting if somewhat neglected solo career - much of it with his band, RatDog - and participated in reunions of surviving Dead members in different configurations.

"As the one good-looking guy in the Dead, baby-faced Weir was always what passed for the band's sex symbol," the San Francisco Chronicle's Joel Selvin wrote in 2004. "He didn't care about that, either. In fact, he always seemed to secretly relish subverting that image."

Weir was the subject of the 2014 documentary "The Other One: The Long, Strange Trip of Bob Weir," which made a case for the Dead's "other" guitarist as a musical force. Though some diehard Dead fans, or "Deadheads," adopted the trappings of tie-dyed psychedelia, the group itself was deeply attached to American roots music and was credited with bringing experimental improvisation to rock music.

Weir's own musical tastes ranged from Chuck Berry to cowboy songs to R&amp;B and reggae.

Thanks to relentless touring, constant musical evolution and a passionate fan base, the Grateful Dead - who existed from 1965 to 1995 - did not have to rely on producing hit records.

"Bob was the wild one," journalist Blair Jackson wrote in 2012. "He was the rock 'n' roller, but also the confident, smooth-voiced narrator on all those dramatic country-rock numbers about desperadoes and fugitives; a perfect fit for those tunes. He was the guy who would screech and scream himself hoarse at the end of the show, whipping us into a dancing frenzy."

Weir, whose birth name was Robert Hall Parber, was born on October 16, 1947, and raised by adoptive parents in Atherton, California. He did not excel in school, due in part to his undiagnosed dyslexia. In 1964 at age 16, he met Bay Area folk musician Garcia, with whom he formed the Warlocks, who soon morphed into the Grateful Dead.

The athletic Weir, who enjoyed football, was the youngest member of the original band and was sometimes referred to as "the kid."

He was still in high school when he joined up with Garcia, bass guitarist Phil Lesh, organist-vocalist-harmonica player Ron "Pigpen" McKernan and drummer Bill Kreutzmann.

Lesh recalled in his 2005 autobiography that he and Garcia had to make a promise to young Bob's mother. "The long and short of it was that if Jerry and I promised to make sure that Bob got to school every day, and that he got home all right after the gigs, she would allow him to remain in the band," wrote Lesh, who died in October 2024 at age 84. "We somehow convinced her that we would indeed see that he got to school every day. In San Francisco. At 8:00 a.m."

Eventually Weir moved in to the communal Dead house at 710 Ashbury Street in San Francisco. The group's first album, "The Grateful Dead," was released in March 1967.

According to some accounts, Weir was briefly fired from the band in 1968 because his guitar skills were deemed lacking. But he either redoubled his efforts or the others had second thoughts, because he was soon back in. By the time of the band's two famous 1970 albums, "Workingman's Dead" and "American Beauty," Weir was a key contributor.

His 1972 solo album, "Ace," was a de facto Grateful Dead album that featured Garcia and the others and included well-regarded Weir songs including "Cassidy," "Black-Throated Wind," "Mexicali Blues" and "Looks Like Rain." Many of his best-known songs were co-written with his old school friend, John Perry Barlow, who died in 2018.

As the band's rhythm guitarist, Weir often played little fills, riffs and figures instead of straight chords. "I derived a lot of what I do on guitar from listening to piano players," he told GQ magazine in 2019, citing McCoy Tyner's work with saxophonist John Coltrane. "He would constantly nudge and coax amazing stuff out of Coltrane."

Even decades after Garcia's death, Weir never forgot the influence of his old friend. He told GQ that Garcia was still present when Weir played guitar. "I can hear him: 'Don't go there. Don't go there,' or 'Go here. Go here,'" Weir said. "And either I listen or I don't, depending on how I'm feeling. But it's always 'How's old Jerry going to feel about this riff?' Sometimes I know he'd hate it. But he'd adjust."

In 2017, Weir was appointed as a United Nations Development Program goodwill ambassador to support the agency's work to end poverty while fighting climate change.

Weir married Natascha Muenter in 1999. They had two daughters.

"Looking back," Weir once said, "I guess I have lived an unusual life."</description><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 01:56:16 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/MNYY5THC7VIJTHU37VPNQPKFBM.jpg?auth=572eb4af0d660c5530ebad7eef3dc27af340bc84c795926f40e6a7fb6bee6b94&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Last SDF fighters leave Syria's Aleppo, Ekhbariya TV reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/last-sdf-fighters-leave-syrias-aleppo-ekhbariya-tv-reports-2026-01-10/</link><description>Jan 11 (Reuters) - The last Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces fighters have left Aleppo, Syrian state-run Ekhbariya TV said on Sunday.

Koji, a category one cyclone, crossed the coast between the towns of Ayr and Bowen in the state of Queensland, about 500 km (310 miles) north of state capital Brisbane.

Koji has "weakened below tropical cyclone intensity", the nation's weather forecaster said on its website.

It said the system was now a tropical low, bringing wind gusts of up to 95 kph (59 mph) and heavy rainfall between the towns of Ayr and Mackay, a tourist hub and gateway to the Great Barrier Reef.

Koji could still spark "dangerous and life-threatening flash flooding" in the region, the weather bureau said.

Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Koji was "expected to bring large amounts of rainfall to coastal areas of north Queensland and potentially inland areas".

"Flash flooding is a major risk along a significant stretch of Queensland's coast," Albanese said in televised remarks.

Queensland state Premier David Crisafulli said the cyclone had already brought rainfall of up to 200 mm (7.8 inches) to some areas overnight and was expected to result in heavy downpours over the next 24 to 48 hours.

"I do believe that people have prepared brilliantly for the rain that will come," Crisafulli said on social media platform X.

Townsville Airport, which closed on Saturday as a precaution, said on Facebook that it planned to reopen on Sunday "if safety and weather conditions allow."

Koji's approach comes after the state was hit in March by Alfred, a downgraded tropical cyclone, brought damaging winds and heavy rains, cutting power to hundreds of thousands.</description><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 01:56:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Last SDF fighters leave Syria's Aleppo, Ekhbariya TV reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/last-sdf-fighters-leave-syrias-aleppo-ekhbariya-tv-reports-2026-01-10/</link><description /><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 01:56:53 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Cyclone Koji downgraded to storm after crossing Australia's northeast coast; flooding warning risks issued</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/australias-queensland-state-braces-tropical-cyclone-koji-2026-01-10/</link><description /><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 01:56:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Rubio and Netanyahu spoke by phone on Saturday, US official says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/rubio-netanyahu-discuss-iran-syria-gaza-axios-reports-2026-01-11/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 10 (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke over the phone with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Saturday, a U.S. official said, without providing additional details.

While the American official did not mention the topics discussed in the call, Axios reported earlier that the two of them spoke about Gaza, Syria and the protests in Iran.

Iran, which had a 12-day war with Israel last year and whose nuclear facilities were bombed by the U.S. in June, is seeing its biggest anti-government demonstrations in years.

In Gaza, a fragile ceasefire has not progressed beyond its first phase since it began in October, with Israel and Hamas accusing each other of major breaches of the deal. The two sides remain far apart on the more difficult steps envisaged for the next phase.

Earlier this week, Israel and Syria agreed during U.S.-mediated talks in Paris to set up a communication mechanism to coordinate on security and commercial issues.

Since U.S. President Donald Trump took office in January 2025, Netanyahu has visited the United States five times to meet the Republican president while Trump visited Israel in October.</description><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 03:52:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/MZ5DO7N7SFKK3IQKQDVSVVYJ5E.jpg?auth=216bdcf9f1bc57dde36fb4d048f08d7c5a00ddf135e832e70a682a10c4575fae&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israel on high alert for possibility of US intervention in Iran, sources say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-high-alert-possibility-us-intervention-iran-sources-say-2026-01-11/</link><description>Jan 11 (Reuters) - Israel is on high alert for the possibility of any U.S. intervention in Iran as authorities there confront the biggest anti-government protests in years, according to three Israeli sources with knowledge of the matter.

President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to intervene in recent days and warned Iran’s rulers against using force against demonstrators. On Saturday, Trump said the U.S. stands “ready to help”.

The sources, who were present for Israeli security consultations over the weekend, did not elaborate on what Israel’s high-alert footing meant in practice. Israel and Iran fought a 12-day war in June, in which the U.S. joined Israel in launching airstrikes.

In a phone call on Saturday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio discussed the possibility of U.S. intervention in Iran, according to an Israeli source who was present for the conversation. A U.S. official confirmed the two men spoke but did not say what topics they discussed.

Israel has not signalled a desire to intervene in Iran as protests grip the country, with tensions between the two arch-foes high over Israeli concerns about Iran’s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.

In an interview with the Economist published on Friday, Netanyahu said there would be horrible consequences for Iran if it were to attack Israel. Alluding to the protests, he said: “Everything else, I think we should see what is happening inside Iran."</description><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 06:33:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WNQFAFCEE5KNLFNGKABJP6S4TY.jpg?auth=168e301cd6ca2c7b74e56d9bf2e9780278ee1c226e923d343a9a719516f00e25&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>‘ICE, Out for Good’ protests over fatal shooting erupt in Minneapolis, other US cities</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260111-ice-out-for-good-protests-over-fatal-shooting-erupt-in-minneapolis-other-us-cities</link><description>Thousands of demonstrators took to the streets of Minneapolis on Saturday chanting the name of the woman killed by a federal agent in the city, amid widespread anger at use of force in the Trump administration's immigration crackdown.

Organisers said more than 1,000 events were planned across the United States under the slogan "ICE, Out for Good" – referring to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency that is drawing growing opposition over its execution of President Donald Trump 's effort at mass deportations .

The slogan is also a reference to Renee Good, the 37-year-old mother shot dead in her car by an ICE agent on Wednesday.

Thousands braved frigid weather and streamed toward a snow-covered park to mobilize near the scene of the shooting. They carried signs demanding "ICE OUT" of Minnesota.

At the start of the protest, a voice called out, "Say her name!" The crowd shouted back: "Renee Good!"

Her death has sparked strong emotions in this Democratic stronghold, and across the nation.

"We got ICE shooting women in the face for self-defense. It doesn't make any sense," said Alex Vega, a protester in Boston.

"Let them come around here with that, and let's see what's really going to happen to ICE."

In Philadelphia, protesters marched in the rain from City Hall to the ICE field office. Others mobilized in New York, Washington and Boston, with the gatherings drawing dozens to hundreds of demonstrators.

More protests were planned for Sunday.

The calls to protest were being amplified by the "No Kings" movement, a network of left-wing organizations that mounted nationwide demonstrations against Trump last year.

The Trump administration has sought to paint Good as a "domestic terrorist," vigorously insisting the agent who fatally shot her was acting in self-defense.

This narrative is strongly disputed by local officials, who say footage shows Good's vehicle turning away from the agent and did not pose a threat to his life.

Cell phone footage apparently taken by the officer who fired the fatal shots shows him interacting with Good, who had blocked the road with her car in an apparent effort to impede the agents.

He approaches and circles Good's car, as she says to him: "I'm not mad at you."

Another agent can be heard ordering Good to exit the vehicle before she tries to drive off and shots ring out.

The agent filming the video can then be heard saying "fucking bitch."

The White House insisted the video gave weight to the officer's claim of self-defense -- even though the clip does not clearly show the moment the car moved away, or him opening fire.

Drew Lenzmeier, 30, said he joined the protest in Minneapolis "because I feel our rights are being taken away from us and we are turning into an authoritarian dictatorship."

"No one is stopping the Trump administration from now murdering citizens and stealing, kidnapping human beings. It's time to stop," he said.

On Friday evening, hundreds gathered noisily in front of Minneapolis hotels believed to be housing ICE agents, equipped with whistles, loudspeakers and musical instruments.

Several people were arrested and then quickly released, according to police.

Officials and residents in Minnesota have expressed concern that local law enforcement agencies have been shut out of the FBI investigation into the Minneapolis shooting.

According to The Trace, a media outlet focusing on gun violence, Good was the fourth person killed by federal immigration agents since the launch of the Trump administration's deportation campaign. Seven people have been injured.

In a separate incident, two people were injured Thursday in Portland, Oregon, by shots fired by federal border police during a traffic stop.</description><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 06:35:08 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/d0b182a4-eeb1-11f0-a14d-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/000-92BA87H.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran warns Washington it will retaliate against any attack</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-warns-washington-it-will-retaliate-against-any-attack-2026-01-11/</link><description>DUBAI, Jan 11 (Reuters) - Iran warned President Donald Trump on Sunday that any U.S. attack would lead to Tehran striking back against Israel and regional U.S. military bases as "legitimate targets", Parliament Speaker Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf told parliament.

Hours earlier, Syria's military said it had finished operations in the Kurdish-held Sheikh Maqsud neighbourhood with state television reporting that Kurdish fighters who surrendered were being bused to the north.

The military had already announced its seizure of Aleppo's other Kurdish-held neighbourhood, Ashrafiyeh.

Kurdish forces had controlled pockets of Syria's second city Aleppo and operate a de facto autonomous administration across swathes of the north and northeast, much of it captured during the 14-year civil war.

The latest clashes erupted after negotiations to integrate the Kurds into the country's new government stalled.

"We reached an understanding that led to a ceasefire and secured the evacuation of the martyrs, the wounded, the trapped civilians and the fighters from Ashrafiyeh and Sheikh Maqsud neighbourhoods to northern and eastern Syria," the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) wrote in a statement.

Syria's official SANA news agency reported that "buses carrying the last batch of members of the SDF organisation have left the Sheikh Maqsud neighbourhood in Aleppo, heading towards northeastern Syria".

The SDF initially denied its fighters were leaving, describing the bus transfers as forced displacement of civilians.

An AFP correspondent saw at least five buses on Saturday carrying men out of Sheikh Maqsud, but could not independently verify their identities.

According to the SDF statement, the ceasefire was reached "through the mediation of international parties to stop the attacks and violations against our people in Aleppo".

The United States and European Union both called for the Syrian government and Kurdish authorities to return to political dialogue.

The fighting, some of the most intense since the ousting of long-time ruler Bashar al-Assad in December 2024, has killed at least 21 civilians, according to figures from both sides, while Aleppo's governor said 155,000 people fled their homes.

Both sides blamed the other for starting the clashes on Tuesday.

On the outskirts of Sheikh Maqsud, families who had been trapped by the fighting were leaving, accompanied by Syrian security forces.

An AFP correspondent saw men carrying children on their backs board buses headed to shelters.

Dozens of young men in civilian clothing were separated from the crowd, with security forces making them sit on the ground before transporting them to an unknown destination, according to the correspondent.

A Syrian security official told AFP on condition of anonymity that the young men were "fighters" being "transferred to Syrian detention centres".

At the entrance to the district, 60-year-old Imad al-Ahmad was heading in the opposite direction, trying to seek permission to return home.

"I left four days ago...I took refuge at my sister's house," he told AFP. "I don't know if we'll be able to return today."

Nahed Mohammad Qassab, a 40-year-old widow also waiting to return, said she left before the fighting to attend a funeral.

"My three children are still inside, at my neighbour's house. I want to get them out," she said.

A flight suspension at Aleppo airport was extended until further notice.

US envoy Tom Barrack met Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa on Saturday, and afterwards called for a "return to dialogue" with the Kurds in accordance with the integration framework agreed in March.

The deal was meant to be implemented last year, but differences, including Kurdish demands for decentralised rule, stymied progress as Damascus repeatedly rejected the idea.

The fighting in Aleppo raised fears of a regional escalation, with neighbouring Turkey, a close ally of Syria's new Islamist authorities, saying it was ready to intervene. Israel has sided with the Kurdish forces.

The clashes have also tested the Syrian authorities' ability to reunify the country after the brutal civil war and commitment to protecting minorities, after sectarian bloodshed rocked the country's Alawite and Druze communities last year.</description><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 07:23:47 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/867dc41e-eeb5-11f0-a231-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26010396872489.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran warns US troops, Israel will be ‘legitimate targets’ if America strikes over protests</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260111-iran-warns-us-troops-israel-will-be-legitimate-targets-if-america-strikes-over-protests</link><description>Iran 's parliament met on Sunday to discuss deadly, nationwide protests that have raged for over two weeks. During a parliamentary session broadcast live on state TV, Speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf warned that the US military and Israel would be “legitimate targets” if America strikes the Islamic Republic, as threatened by President Donald Trump .

Ghalibaf, a hard-liner who has run for the presidency in the past, gave a speech applauding police and Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, particularly its all-volunteer Basij, for having “stood firm” during the protests.

“The people of Iran should know that we will deal with them in the most severe way and punish those who are arrested,” he said.

He went on to directly threaten Israel, “the occupied territory” as he referred to it, and the US military, possibly with a preemptive strike.

“In the event of an attack on Iran, both the occupied territory and all American military centres, bases and ships in the region will be our legitimate targets,” said the speaker. “We do not consider ourselves limited to reacting after the action and will act based on any objective signs of a threat.”

The parliamentary session, which saw lawmakers rush the dais, shouting: “Death to America,” came as US news website Axios reported that US Secretary ⁠of State Marco Rubio on Sunday discussed Gaza, Syria and the protests in Iran in a phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu .

While US and Israeli officials confirmed the phone call, details of the topics were not revealed.

Anti-regime rallies have continued in several Iranian cities and towns, with the death toll linked to the protests rising to more 116, according to Iranian rights group HRANA.

Meanwhile the internet shutdown in Iran remains in place and has now lasted more than 60 hours, monitor Netblocks said on Sunday.

"The censorship measure presents a direct threat to the safety and wellbeing of Iranians at a key moment for the country's future," it said on X, adding that the blackout is "now past the 60 hour mark".

Online videos sent out of Iran, likely using Starlink satellite transmitters, purportedly showed demonstrators gathering in northern Tehran's Punak neighborhood. There, it appeared authorities shut off streets, with protesters waving their lit mobile phones. Others banged metal while fireworks went off.

Other footage purportedly showed demonstrators peacefully marching down a street and others honking their car horns on the street.

“The pattern of protests in the capital has largely taken the form of scattered, short-lived, and fluid gatherings, an approach shaped in response to the heavy presence of security forces and increased field pressure,” said HRANA. “At the same time, reports were received of surveillance drones flying overhead and movements by security forces around protest locations, indicating ongoing monitoring and security control.”

In Mashhad, Iran's second-largest city, some 725 kilometers (450 miles) northeast of Tehran, footage purported to show protesters confronting security forces. Flaming debris and dumpsters could be seen in the street, blocking the road. Mashhad is home to the Imam Reza shrine, the holiest in Shiite Islam, making the protests there carry heavy significance for the country's theocracy.

Protests also appeared to happen in Kerman, 800 kilometers (500 miles) southeast of Tehran.

Iranian state television on Sunday morning took a page from demonstrators, having their correspondents appear on streets in several cities to show calm areas with a date stamp shown on screen. Tehran and Mashhad were not included. They also showed pro-government demonstrations in Qom and Qazvin.

Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has signaled a coming clampdown, despite US warnings. Tehran escalated its threats Saturday, with Iran’s attorney general, Mohammad Movahedi Azad, warning that anyone taking part in protests will be considered an “enemy of God,” a death-penalty charge. The statement carried by Iranian state television said even those who “helped rioters” would face the charge.

Iran’s theocracy cut off the nation from the internet and international telephone calls on Thursday, though it allowed some state-owned and semiofficial media to publish. Qatar’s state-funded Al Jazeera news network reported live from Iran, but they appeared to be the only major foreign outlet able to work.

Iran’s exiled Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi, who called for protests Thursday and Friday, asked in his latest message for demonstrators to take to the streets Saturday and Sunday. He urged protesters to carry Iran’s old lion-and-sun flag and other national symbols used during the time of the shah to “claim public spaces as your own.”

Pahlavi’s support of and from Israel has drawn criticism in the past — particularly after the 12-day war. Demonstrators have shouted in support of the shah in some protests, but it isn’t clear whether that’s support for Pahlavi himself or a desire to return to a time before the 1979 Islamic Revolution .

The demonstrations began December 28 over the collapse of the Iranian rial currency, which trades at over 1.4 million to $1, as the country’s economy is squeezed by international sanctions in part levied over its nuclear program. The protests intensified and grew into calls directly challenging Iran’s theocracy.</description><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 08:30:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/7cd6676c-ee89-11f0-945c-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26010842324226.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>International law applies to everyone, including US, says German finance minister</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/international-law-applies-everyone-including-us-says-german-finance-minister-2026-01-11/</link><description>BERLIN, Jan 11 (Reuters) - The principles of international law apply to everyone, including the United States, German Finance Minister and Vice Chancellor Lars Klingbeil said on Sunday, in reference to President Donald Trump's threats to seize Greenland .

"It is solely up to Denmark and Greenland to decide about Greenland's future. Territorial sovereignty and integrity must be respected," Klingbeil said ahead of his departure to Washington for a meeting of finance ministers from the Group of Seven advanced economies.

A U.S. military seizure of the mineral-rich Arctic island from Denmark, a long-time ally, would send shockwaves through NATO and deepen the divide between Trump and European leaders.

"We increase security in the Arctic together as NATO allies, not in opposition to one another," Klingbeil said.

Monday's G7 meeting will focus on access to critical minerals as Western countries seek to reduce their dependence on China given moves by Beijing to impose strict export controls on rare earths.

Klingbeil said Germany has a strong interest in expanding international cooperation in this area in order to strengthen security of supply, reduce dependencies and ensure reliable economic framework conditions.

"That is why it is important that we consult with our international partners and - wherever possible - act together," he said.

China dominates the critical minerals supply chain, refining between 47% and 87% of copper, lithium, cobalt, graphite and rare earths, according to the International Energy Agency.</description><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 09:22:21 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/TTJ5WYYRZBMBRKX73AHNHD7EEY.jpg?auth=7c9e35e00df73fc0c4f1fc47984e2d47ea7da5507a4a67163376f83afcf14bb1&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Myanmar’s junta holds second phase of widely slammed elections</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260111-myanmar-s-junta-holds-second-phase-of-widely-slammed-elections</link><description>Myanmar 's junta held the second phase of elections on Sunday that democracy watchdogs warn will let the military prolong its rule, opening polling in the constituency of deposed democratic leader Aung San Suu Kyi .

The armed forces have ruled Myanmar for most of its post-independence history, snatching back power in a 2021 coup after a decade-long democratic thaw, nullifying the previous poll, detaining Suu Kyi and plunging the country into civil war.

With Suu Kyi sidelined and her massively popular party dissolved, democracy advocates say the vote has been rigged by a crackdown on dissent and a ballot stacked with military allies.

Polls opened on Sunday morning in dozens of constituencies, including Suu Kyi's former seat of Kawhmu south of commercial hub Yangon.

Farmer Than Than Sint acknowledged Myanmar's "many problems" but told AFP she voted in pursuit of peace.

"We know it will not come right away. But we need to go step-by-step for our future generations," the 54-year-old said after voting.

The junta has pledged the three-phase election will return power to the people after it ends on January 25.

The Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP), described by many analysts as the military's prime proxy, won nearly 90 percent of lower house seats in the first phase late last month.

"I think the results lie only in the mouth of the military," a 50-year-old resident of Yangon, where voting also took place, told AFP.

"This election has absolutely nothing to do with escaping this suffering," said the resident, who spoke on condition of anonymity for security reasons.

The first phase had a turnout of around 50 percent, far below the roughly 70 percent of the 2020 election when most voters backed Suu Kyi's party.

A truck blasted loudspeaker messages along the main road in Kawhmu, urging voters to come out.

Kyaw Than, a 72-year-old farmer, said it was better to vote. "It would be weird to sit by and do nothing," he said.

There is no polling in large enclaves carved out by rebel factions, who the military accused of staging drone, rocket and bomb attacks during the first phase of voting that killed five people.

Analysts say the junta is attempting to launder its image, aiming to improve diplomatic relations, increase foreign investment and sap momentum from rebels.

"The junta engineered the polls to ensure victory for its proxy, entrench military domination in Myanmar, and manufacture a facade of legitimacy while violence and repression continue unabated," UN rights expert Tom Andrews said in a statement on Thursday.

The military justified its coup by alleging that Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) won a landslide over pro-military parties in 2020 through massive voter fraud.

Election monitors say those claims were unfounded.

Parties that won 90 percent of seats in 2020 – including the NLD – have been dissolved, according to the Asian Network for Free Elections.

Regardless of the vote, a quarter of parliamentary seats will be reserved for the armed forces under a constitution drafted during a previous period of military rule.

More than 330 people are being pursued under junta-enacted laws, including clauses that punish protest or criticism of the poll with up to 10 years in prison.

There are more than 22,000 political prisoners in junta jails, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners advocacy group.

Security forces put down pro-democracy protests since the coup but activists formed ragtag guerrilla units, often fighting alongside ethnic minority armies long opposed to central rule.

Voting has been cancelled in dozens of constituencies, many of them battlegrounds or regions where rebels run parallel administrations beyond the junta's reach.

The military waged offensives, which witnesses said included air strikes targeting civilian sites, in an attempt to claw back ground before the voting.

There is no official toll for Myanmar's civil war but monitoring group ACLED, which tallies media reports of violence, estimates that 90,000 people have been killed on all sides.</description><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 10:23:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/866c3c76-ee92-11f0-81df-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/10dea1022dc7b75827eedf75f7a4f879319b73c5.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Confronting protests, Iran vows to strike back if U.S. attacks</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/confronting-protests-iran-vows-strike-back-if-us-attacks-2026-01-11/</link><description>DUBAI/JERUSALEM, Jan 11 (Reuters) - Tehran threatened on Sunday to retaliate against Israel and U.S. military bases in the event of U.S. strikes on Iran, issuing the warning as Israeli sources said Israel was on high alert for the possibility of any U.S. intervention.

With Iran's clerical establishment facing the biggest anti-government protests since 2022, U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to intervene in recent days, warning Iranian leaders against using force against demonstrators. On Saturday, Trump said the U.S. stands "ready to help".

Iranian Parliament Speaker Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf, speaking in parliament on Sunday, warned against "a miscalculation".

"Let us be clear: in the case of an attack on Iran, the occupied territories (Israel) as well as all U.S. bases and ships will be our legitimate target," said Qalibaf, a former commander in Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards.

Authorities have stepped up efforts to quell the unrest that has spread across Iran since December 28. A U.S.-based rights group, HRANA, reported the death toll stood at 116, mostly protesters but including 37 members of the security forces.

The protests began in response to soaring inflation , before turning against the clerical establishment that has ruled since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. The government accuses the U.S. and Israel of fomenting unrest.

Three Israeli sources, who were present for Israeli security consultations over the weekend, said Israel was on a high-alert footing, but did not elaborate on what that meant.

An Israeli government spokesperson declined to comment. The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Israel and Iran fought a 12-day war in June last year, in which the U.S. joined Israel in launching airstrikes. Iran retaliated for those U.S. strikes by firing missiles at an American air base in Qatar.

The flow of information from Iran has been hampered by an internet blackout imposed by the authorities since Thursday. Internet monitoring watchdog Netblocks reported national connectivity levels remained about 1% of the norm.

A social media video posted on Saturday showed large crowds gathered in Tehran's Punak neighbourhood at night, drumming rhythmically on the railings of a bridge or other metal objects in an apparent sign of protest. Reuters verified the location.

Iranian state TV broadcast funeral processions in western Iranian cities such as Gachsaran and Yasuj for members of the security forces killed in the protests. The authorities have not said how many have been killed.

State TV reported that 30 members of the security forces would be buried in the central city of Isfahan, and that six security force members were killed by "rioters" in Kermanshah in the west. State TV also reported a mosque was torched by "rioters" in Mashhad, in the northeast, on Saturday night.

The Revolutionary Guards on Saturday accused "terrorists" of attacking security facilities.

Ahmad-Reza Radan, Iran's police chief, said security forces had stepped up efforts to confront "rioters".

Iran's rulers have quelled previous bouts of unrest, most recently in 2022 over the death in custody of a woman accused of violating dress codes.

Trump, posting on social media on Saturday, said: "Iran is looking at FREEDOM, perhaps like never before. The USA stands ready to help!!!"

In a phone call on Saturday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio discussed the possibility of U.S. intervention in Iran, according to an Israeli source who was present for the conversation.

A U.S. official confirmed the two men spoke but did not say what topics they discussed.

A senior U.S. intelligence official on Saturday described the situation in Iran as an "endurance game". The opposition was trying to keep up pressure until key government figures either flee or switch sides, while the authorities were trying to sow enough fear to clear the streets without giving the United States justification to intervene, the official said.

Israel has not signalled a desire to intervene, with tensions between the two arch-foes high over Israeli concerns about Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.

In an interview with the Economist published on Friday, Netanyahu said there would be horrible consequences for Iran if it were to attack Israel. Alluding to the protests, he said: "Everything else, I think we should see what is happening inside Iran."</description><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 10:45:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LXPVYSCAFZP3JGF3U55PQJ3BJE.jpg?auth=5922b85ce3d69c32b10f74090ea704a36bb61f328cce12ab550df0b45c0a4383&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US to push for quicker action in reducing reliance on China for rare earths</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/us-push-quicker-action-reducing-reliance-china-rare-earths-2026-01-11/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 11 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will urge Group of Seven nations and others to step up their efforts to reduce reliance on critical minerals from China when he hosts a dozen top finance officials on Monday, a senior U.S. official said.

The meeting, which kicks off with a dinner on Sunday evening, will include finance ministers or cabinet ministers from the G7 advanced economies, the European Union, Australia, India, South Korea and Mexico, said the official who was not authorized to speak publicly.

Together, the grouping accounts for 60% of global demand for critical minerals.

"Urgency is the theme of the day. It's a very big undertaking. There's a lot of different angles, a lot of different countries involved and we really just need to move faster," the official said.

Bessent on Friday told Reuters that he had been pressing for a separate meeting on the issue since a G7 leaders summit in Canada in June, where he delivered a rare earths presentation to gathered heads of state from the U.S., Britain, Japan, Canada, Germany, France, Italy and the European Union.

Leaders agreed to an action plan at the summit to secure their supply chains and boost their economies, but Bessent has grown frustrated about the lack of urgency demonstrated by attendees, the official said.

Aside from Japan, which took action after China abruptly cut off its critical minerals supplies in 2010, G7 members remain heavily dependent on critical minerals from China, which has threatened to impose strict export controls.

China dominates the critical minerals supply chain, refining between 47% and 87% of copper, lithium, cobalt, graphite and rare earths, according to the International Energy Agency. These minerals are used in defense technologies, semiconductors, renewable energy components, batteries and refining processes.

The U.S. is expected to issue a statement after the meeting, but no specific joint action is likely, the official added.

“The United States is in the posture of calling everyone together, showing leadership, sharing what we have in mind going forward," said the official. "We're ready to move with those who feel a similar level of urgency ... and others can join as they come to the realization of how serious this is."

The official gave no details on what further steps were planned by the Trump administration, which is pushing forward to boost domestic production and reduce reliance on China through agreements with Australia, Ukraine and other producers.

The U.S. signed an agreement with Australia in October aimed at countering China's dominance in critical minerals that includes an $8.5 billion project pipeline. The deal leverages Australia's proposed strategic reserve, which will supply metals like rare earths and lithium that are vulnerable to disruption.

The official said there had been progress, but more work was needed. "It's not solved," they added.

Canberra has said it has subsequently received interest from Europe, Japan, South Korea and Singapore.

Monday's meeting comes days after reports that China had begun restricting exports to Japanese companies of rare earths and powerful magnets containing them, as well as banning exports of dual-use items to the Japanese military.

The meeting was planned well before that action, U.S. officials said. China was still living up to its commitments to purchase U.S. soybeans and ship critical minerals to U.S. firms.</description><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 11:18:21 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/DNNIYDYMOJJ3DD2ZR4G2NAJ4RM.jpg?auth=0e2f4fab61e8491689d12d8347e5de74d7c1206aaef10e440804fe3ae77903dd&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>A thousand Kyiv apartment blocks still without heating after Russian strike</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/thousand-kyiv-apartment-blocks-still-without-heating-after-russian-strike-2026-01-11/</link><description>KYIV, Jan 11 (Reuters) - More than 1,000 apartment buildings in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv are still without heating following a devastating Russian attack earlier this week, local authorities said on Sunday.

Russia has intensified bombardments of Ukraine's energy system since it invaded its neighbour in 2022.

On Friday, a missile strike on Kyiv left virtually the entire city without power and heating amid a sharp cold snap, and it was not until Sunday that authorities restored water supplies and partially restored electricity and heating.

The war's fourth winter could be the coldest and darkest yet, with the accumulated damage to the grid bringing utilities to the brink and temperatures, already below minus 12 degrees Celsius (10.4 F), set to plunge to minus 20 degrees (-4 F) later this week.

"Restoration work is ongoing. However, the energy supply situation in the capital remains very difficult," Kyiv Mayor Vitalii Klitschko said on Telegram.

"According to forecasts, the severe frosts are not expected to subside in the coming days. Therefore, the difficult situation in the capital will continue," he added.

Ukraine's energy ministry said Russian forces had attacked the country's power system again during the night, briefly cutting off electricity to the south-eastern Dnipropetrovsk and Zaporizhzhia regions.

"Not a single day passed this week without attacks on energy facilities and critical infrastructure. A total of 44 attacks were recorded," Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko said on Telegram.</description><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 11:18:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HC3IH3DKKBMRZJDV7UWXIL7TUE.jpg?auth=6e3dab74ad6ebcd695928dc441ea692d8c6582dcc973bc28c12a1c44c656085e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Son of Iran's toppled shah seeks a role as protests expand</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/son-irans-toppled-shah-seeks-role-protests-expand-2026-01-11/</link><description>Jan 11 (Reuters) - In a nation where opposition to almost half a century of clerical rule has long been fragmented, the son of the last shah of Iran has become a prominent voice spurring on protesters staging the biggest anti-government demonstrations in years.

Reza Pahlavi, 65, has sought to speak as a national leader despite living outside Iran since before his father was toppled in the 1979 Islamic Revolution.

In messages sent from his home in the United States, he has repeatedly praised Iranians demanding change and, like those who ended his father's rule, calling for an end to repression.

"We will completely bring the Islamic Republic and its worn-out, fragile apparatus of repression to its knees," he said in one of his most recent messages, in a video posted on X.

How much public support Pahlavi now commands in Iran, where he has not set foot for decades, is difficult to gauge.

Some protesters have voiced support for him in verified videos circulating on social media, with some chants of "Long live the shah", suggesting his messages may be galvanising some people.

Many others simply call for sweeping political change, with slogans such as "Down with the dictator", a reference to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , who under Iran's system of clerical rule has the final say in all state matters.

Others shout slogans demanding action to fix an economy hammered by years of international sanctions and pummelled by a 12-day war in June, when Israel and then the U.S. launched airstrikes on Iran.

The dire economy was the catalyst for the latest protests.

"Everything Reza Pahlavi learned about ruling a country came from his own father who failed for a reason. We had Pahlavis, now it is time for a democratic country," said Azadeh, 27, in a message from northern Iran.

Pahlavi has frequently called for change, particularly during bouts of unrest, including mass demonstrations in 2009 over a contested election and nationwide protests in 2022 over the death of Mahsa Amini , a young woman who died while in detention for allegedly violating Islamic dress codes.

In those protests, there were few obvious signs of momentum in support for a man who the exiled royal court in 1980 declared shah after his father's death from cancer in a Cairo hospital.

Unlike in the 1979 revolution, there is no single voice driving the opposition.

Five decades ago, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini became the voice of revolutionary fervour, spurring on demonstrators - even those who wanted a secular system to prevail in Iran. Khomeini's recorded speeches smuggled in on cassette tapes from his exile abroad stoked opposition to Pahlavi's father.

In his messages over the past two weeks, which have been blocked as the government has shut down the internet , Pahlavi has told Iranians he is ready to lead a transition.

He has long said he would let the people decide on who should rule them, but he has been clear that he wants an end to theocratic rule.

"There is only one way to achieve peace: a secular, democratic Iran. I am here today to submit myself to my compatriots to lead them down this road to peace and a democratic transition," he said in a speech posted on X on June 23, shortly before the end of last year's 12-day war.

Born in 1960, Pahlavi was declared crown prince in 1967 at his father's coronation in Tehran. Images show him sitting beside his father's jewel-encrusted throne in a child's version of the shah's uniform, peaked cap on his lap and gold brocades on his small shoulders.

The monarchy's lavish style at that time helped fuel discontent when Iranians compared it to their own hardships, with surging inflation and a big wealth divide as the shah's bid to modernise the oil-powered economy left many people behind.

Iranians also sought an end to repression by the shah and his feared security apparatus, SAVAK.

Pahlavi left Iran before his father was forced out, heading to the United States to train as a fighter pilot. He later wrote that he offered to serve in the war with Iraq in the 1980s when the young theocratic Iranian state came under attack, but that his offer was turned down.

He studied political science at university.

From exile, Pahlavi, who is married with three children, has garnered support in the diaspora, including Iranians in the U.S., with his criticism of Iran's rulers and calls for change.

In 2023, he visited Israel, a close ally of Iran in his father's day and an implacable foe of the Islamic Republic now, and met Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other officials.

He supported the Israeli and U.S. strikes in June that mainly hit Iran's nuclear facilities, but said more action was needed to support Iran's people. Israel and Western states accuse Iran of seeking nuclear weapons, which Iran denies.

But he has gained little traction in winning personal support from Western governments abroad - neither in Washington, a close ally of Iran in the shah's time, nor in European capitals, which have long been critical of the Islamic Republic and its nuclear programme.

As the latest protests have unfolded, U.S. President Donald Trump has said he would support Iranians if security forces fire on them, but also said on Friday he was "not sure that it would be appropriate" to meet Pahlavi.</description><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 11:19:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/DY6IIQ6UEVMUNJQR2OZWSGDCH4.jpg?auth=bae9405471e25a22fbeb0cc22bd841affe70a635faedc4cb33925a74554563b8&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Hollywood stars battle for trophies at Sunday's Golden Globes</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/hollywood-stars-battle-trophies-sundays-golden-globes-2026-01-11/</link><description>BEVERLY HILLS, California, Jan 11 (Reuters) - Leonardo DiCaprio, Timothee Chalamet and other top names in show business will compete for prizes on Sunday at the Golden Globes, one of the major film contests on Hollywood's journey to the Academy Awards.

DiCaprio's film, "One Battle After Another," leads the pack of movie nominees at the champagne-fueled ceremony in Beverly Hills, California. The dark comedy tells the story of a washed-up revolutionary who springs into action when his daughter's life is in danger. Co-stars Benicio del Toro, Sean Penn, Chase Infiniti and Teyana Taylor were nominated alongside DiCaprio.

Comedian Nikki Glaser will return for a second stint as host of the awards show, which starts at 8 p.m. Eastern time (1 a.m. GMT Monday).

The Globes are among the first of the 2026 Hollywood accolades to be handed out before the film industry's top honors, the Academy Awards, in March.

Globes voters do not have a say in the Oscars, but a win at the Globes can help bring attention to potential Academy Awards contenders.

Recipients of the Globes are chosen by more than 300 entertainment journalists, compared with roughly 9,000 voters who select the Oscars. The Globes voting body was expanded in recent years and organizers instituted reforms after criticisms for ethical lapses and a lack of diversity.

Globes voters highlighted several international films in this year's nominations. They include Norwegian family drama "Sentimental Value," "It Was Just an Accident" from Iranian director Jafar Panahi, and Brazilian drama "The Secret Agent."

In a new podcast category, the field includes "Armchair Expert with Dax Shepard," "Call Her Daddy," "Good Hang with Amy Poehler" and "The Mel Robbins Podcast."

Medics said one Palestinian was killed in the Tuffah neighbourhood in Gaza City, in an area under Palestinian control, while two others were killed in the town of Bani Suhaila east of Khan Younis, an area Israel still occupies.

There was no comment from the Israeli military on the two incidents.

Fighting has largely abated since Israel and Palestinian militant group Hamas agreed to a ceasefire in October, two years into the war, but it has not stopped entirely. Israel and Hamas have traded blame over the violations of the deal.

A Hamas official told Reuters on Sunday that the group urged mediators to intervene to stop "daily Israeli killings that aim to derail the ceasefire deal."

More than 440 Palestinians, most of them civilians according to Gaza health officials, have been killed since the truce, as well as three Israeli soldiers.</description><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 11:40:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>German foreign minister puts emphasis on close ties before US trip</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/german-foreign-minister-puts-emphasis-close-ties-before-us-trip-2026-01-11/</link><description>BERLIN, Jan 11 (Reuters) - German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul emphasised the importance of transatlantic relations on Sunday as he left for a trip to Washington that takes place at a delicate time due to tensions over U.S. interests in Greenland and Venezuela .

"Never before has it been so crucial to invest in the transatlantic partnership in order to remain capable of shaping the world order," Wadephul said in Berlin before his departure.

He said he would address what he called "differences of opinions" between Germany and the United States during a meeting on Monday with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

"Where there are differences of opinion, we want to address these differences through dialogue in order to fulfil our shared responsibility for peace and security," Wadephul said.

On his way to Washington, Wadephul plans to stop over in Iceland on Sunday, where a meeting on Arctic security is scheduled with his Icelandic counterpart in Reykjavik.

Later on Monday, he also plans to meet U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.

"For Germany, reliability as an international partner clearly includes a commitment to international law and international cooperation," he said, referring to the United Nations.</description><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 12:43:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/FXABOGITFZJFJHWHQEMQHSCXR4.jpg?auth=d6d6274dd362880a139bd7d644b3342fd0836960ef627760a71d367dd68ff66a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>AI-powered innovation dominates Consumer Electronics show</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/ai-powered-innovation-dominates-consumer-electronics-show</link><description /><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 12:43:42 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/c2ff3dda-eedf-11f0-960c-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260111-121019-121211-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>AFCON semi-finals: Morocco to play Nigeria, Egypt to face Senegal</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/afcon-semi-finals-morocco-to-play-nigeria-egypt-to-face-senegal</link><description /><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 12:43:44 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/387bd204-eedf-11f0-b7e8-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260111-120823-120939-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Live: Iran death toll rises as protesters defy crackdown</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260111-live-iran-death-toll-rises-as-protesters-defy-crackdown</link><description>Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar has said Israel supports the Iranian people in what he described as their "struggle for freedom", as major protests shake the Islamic republic.

"We support the Iranian people's struggle for freedom and wish them success," Saar said in a video interview posted on his X account.

Iran’s president has said his government will listen to protesters, but rioters were trying to “destroy the entire society”.

President Masoud Pezeshkian's comments represent a hardening tone from the reformist leader, who so far has been unable to assuage the public, as anger over the country’s ailing economy exploded into a direct challenge to the nation’s theocracy.

“People have concerns, we should sit with them and if it is our duty, we should resolve their concerns,” Pezeshkian said. “But the higher duty is not to allow a group of rioters to come and destroy the entire society.”

Iranian state television aired an interview with the president on Sunday. It had suggested it would be aired Saturday, but ended up not airing it.

Iranians living overseas rallied in London, Berlin, and other major cities over the weekend in a show of solidarity with the mass demonstrations in Iran.

At least 192 people have been killed in two weeks of protests against the government and economic strain in Iran, according to a Norway-based rights group.

"Since the start of the protests, Iran Human Rights has confirmed the killing of at least 192 protesters," the Norway-based NGO said, warning that the toll could be much higher as a days-long internet blackout hampered verification.

Israel's Foreign Minister Gideon Saar has urged the European Union to designate Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corps as a "terrorist organisation", as rights groups suspect the Islamic republic of using violence against protesters.

Saar said on X that he told visiting German Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt "that now is the time to designate Iran's Revolutionary Guards as a terrorist organisation within the European Union".

"This has long been Germany's position, and today the importance of this matter is clear to all," Saar added.

Iran has made significant arrests of key figures in the protest movement that has swept the Islamic republic over the last two weeks, the national police chief said Sunday.

"Last night (Saturday evening), significant arrests were made of the main elements in the riots, who, God willing, will be punished after going through legal procedures," Ahmad-Reza Radan told state TV, without giving details on the number or identities of those arrested.

Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian is set to  address economic plans and "people's demands" in an interview on Sunday, after two weeks of protests sparked by anger over the rising cost of living, state TV said.

"In a conversation with the national media, the president laid out the status of the government's major economic plan to reform the subsidy system, and also discussed recent events and the government's approach to responding to the people's demands," IRIB state TV said, noting the interview would be broadcast later Sunday.

For at least two decades, Beijing has sought to build influence in Latin America, not only to pursue economic opportunities but to gain a strategic foothold on the doorstep of its top geopolitical rival.

China's progress - from satellite tracking stations in Argentina and a port in Peru to economic support for Venezuela - has been an irritant for successive U.S. administrations, including that of Donald Trump .

Several Trump administration officials told Reuters the U.S. president's move against Maduro was intended in part to counter China's ambitions, and Beijing's days of leveraging debt to get cheap oil from Venezuela were "over."

Trump made the message explicit on Friday, expressing discomfort with China and Russia as a "next-door neighbor," in a meeting with oil executives.

“I told China and I told Russia, 'We get along with you very well, we like you very much, we don’t want you there, you’re not gonna be there,'" Trump said. Now, he said, he will tell China that “we are open for business” and that they can “buy all the oil they want from us there or in the United States.”

The success of the January 3 early morning raid, in which U.S. commandos swept into Caracas and grabbed the Venezuelan president and his wife, was a blow to China's interests and prestige.

The air defenses that U.S. forces quickly disabled had been supplied by China and Russia, and Trump said 30 million to 50 million barrels of oil under sanctions, much of it previously bound for Chinese ports, will now be sent to the U.S.

Analysts say Maduro's capture exposed Beijing's limited ability to exert its will in the Americas.

The attack exposed the gulf between China's "great-power rhetoric and its real reach" in the Western Hemisphere, said Craig Singleton, a China expert at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies think tank.

"Beijing can protest diplomatically, but it cannot protect partners or assets once Washington decides to apply direct pressure," he said.

In a statement to Reuters, the Chinese embassy in Washington said it rejected what it called the United States' "unilateral, illegal, and bullying acts."

"China and Latin American and Caribbean countries maintain friendly exchanges and cooperation. No matter how the situation may evolve, we will continue to be a friend and partner," said Liu Pengyu, the embassy's spokesperson.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

But one administration official said "China should be concerned about their position in the Western Hemisphere," adding that their partners in the region increasingly realize China cannot protect them.

The Trump administration's policy toward Beijing appears contradictory, with concessions aimed at calming a trade war on one hand and more assertive U.S. support for Taiwan on the other.

The Venezuela operation appeared to tilt U.S. policy in a more hawkish direction.

Indeed, the timing of the U.S. attack amplified Beijing's embarrassment.

Just hours before being toppled, Maduro met China's special envoy for Latin America, Qiu Xiaoqi, in Caracas, his last public appearance before becoming a U.S. captive.

The meeting, staged on camera even as U.S. military forces were secretly poised to launch their operation, suggested Beijing was blindsided, said another U.S. official.

"If they knew, they wouldn't have gone so publicly," the U.S. official told Reuters.

For years, Beijing poured money into Venezuela's oil refineries and infrastructure, providing an economic lifeline after the U.S. and its allies tightened sanctions from 2017.

Along with Russia, China has also provided funding and equipment for Venezuela's military, including radar arrays recently billed as able to detect advanced U.S. military aircraft. Those systems did little to impede a raid U.S. officials boasted had been conducted without any losses.

"Any nation around the world with Chinese defense equipment is checking their air defenses and wondering how safe they actually are from the United States," said Michael Sobolik, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute think tank.

"They are also noticing how China's diplomatic assurances to Iran and Venezuela resulted in zero meaningful protection when the U.S. military arrived."

China is now studying what went wrong with those defenses so they can shore up their own systems, according to a person briefed on intelligence about their response.

China may soon be under pressure elsewhere in the region.

It has sought to increase its influence in Cuba , and the U.S. suspects Beijing runs an intelligence-gathering operation there. China denies this, but last year pledged better intelligence sharing with Cuba.

In the days after the Venezuela operation, Trump said U.S. military intervention in Cuba, which has suffered from the loss of Venezuelan oil , was likely unnecessary because it appeared ready to fall on its own.

The Trump administration also continues to push Chinese companies away from port operations around the Panama Canal, the critical waterway linking the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.

A State Department official said the U.S. "remains concerned" about Chinese influence near the canal, but appreciates Panama's actions to curb this, including by exiting Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative and auditing the Panama ports concession under contract to Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison (0001.HK) , opens new tab .

While China may be on the back foot in the region, analysts caution that extended U.S. military involvement in Venezuela or deterioration in the security situation there could open a door for Beijing to reassert itself.

Daniel Russel, a former senior State Department official now with the Asia Society, said the dramatic shift in Washington under Trump from a rule-of-law posture to a “spheres-of-influence logic focused on the Western Hemisphere” could play into China’s hands.

“Beijing wants Washington to accept that Asia is in China’s sphere, and no doubt hopes that the U.S. will get bogged down in Venezuela,” he said.</description><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 13:31:04 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/IOEDAY7DMJL3ZA7Y3SFVH6YVVI.jpg?auth=f535836b5fef6dd8cbfb3185a7bb5dc7e836e11a7003db3e76f8c4aa4e36d763&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Nordics reject Trump's claim of Chinese and Russian ships around Greenland, FT reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/nordics-reject-trumps-claim-chinese-russian-ships-around-greenland-ft-reports-2026-01-11/</link><description>Jan 11 (Reuters) - Nordic diplomats rejected U.S. President Donald Trump's claims of Russian and Chinese vessels operating near Greenland, the Financial Times reported on Sunday.

There have been no signs of Russian or Chinese ships or submarines around Greenland in recent years, the FT said, citing two senior Nordic diplomats with access to NATO intelligence briefings.

Reuters could not immediately verify the report. The White House and NATO did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.

“It is simply not true that the Chinese and Russians are there. I have seen the intelligence. There are no ships, no submarines,” the FT quoted one senior diplomat as saying.

Another Nordic diplomat said claims that waters around Greenland were “crawling” with Russian and Chinese vessels were unfounded, adding that such activity was on the Russian side of the Arctic.

Trump has repeatedly said Russian and Chinese vessels are operating near Greenland, a claim Denmark disputes. He has not provided evidence to support it.

Trump said on Friday the U.S. must own Greenland , an autonomous part of the Kingdom of Denmark , to prevent Russia or China from occupying the strategically located and mineral-rich territory.

"The image that's being painted of Russian and Chinese ships right inside the Nuuk fjord and massive Chinese investments being made is not correct," Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said earlier this week.

Vessel tracking data from MarineTraffic and LSEG show no Chinese or Russian ship presence near Greenland.

Greenland's assembly said late on Friday it would bring forward a meeting to discuss its response to U.S. threats to take control of the island.

Trump's renewed push for Greenland, after U.S. military intervention in Venezuela , worries many of the island's 57,000 inhabitants, whose widely held goal is to eventually become an independent nation.</description><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 13:31:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WICV5CFXWFM7NLY6IOE5WTAWVE.jpg?auth=5c48cff09b0ca9da937e82261a07f88cb13ca7c7bd7e81083867be9ed2d6aebc&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Sweden 'highly critical' of US rhetoric on Greenland and Denmark, says PM</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/sweden-highly-critical-us-rhetoric-greenland-denmark-says-pm-2026-01-11/</link><description>SALEN, Sweden, Jan 11 (Reuters) - Sweden is highly critical of the "threatening rhetoric" against Greenland and Denmark from U.S. President Donald Trump's administration, Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said on Sunday.

Kristersson said in a speech on Sunday that the rules-based world order was under greater threat than for many decades.

"We are highly critical of what the United States is now doing and has done in Venezuela, in regards to international law, and probably even more critical of the rhetoric that is being expressed against Greenland and Denmark," he said at an annual security conference in northern Sweden.

"On the contrary, the United States should thank Denmark, which has been a very loyal ally over the years."

Sweden has, like most European countries, invested heavily in defence following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. However, Sweden's vast territory has remained vulnerable to aerial threats.

"The experience from the war in Ukraine clearly shows how crucial a robust and resilient air defence is," Defence Minister Pal Jonson told reporters at a security conference in northern Sweden.

He said Sweden would buy short-range air defence systems to protect cities, bridges, power plants and other critical infrastructure.

On Sunday Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson criticized the U.S. administration's "threatening rhetoric" against Greenland and Denmark, saying the U.S. should thank Denmark for being a loyal ally.

"Chariots of the Gods?", published in 1968, sold millions of copies with its thesis that advanced aliens had repeatedly visited Earth, leaving their mark in the form of Inca and Egyptian ruins, cave drawings and other physical monuments.

"It took courage to write this book, and it will take courage to read it," the work begins.

It acknowledged that scholars would dismiss it as nonsense, but insisted that "the past teemed with unknown gods who visited the primeval earth in manned spaceships".

Academics wrote books refuting his theories, criticising him as a purveyor of some of the more fantastical notions of pseudoscience. German news magazine Der Spiegel even had a 1973 cover story titled "The Daeniken Hoax".

Nevertheless, legions of fans snapped up his more than 40 books and watched his television specials and documentary films. The over 70 million books that he sold were translated into more than 30 languages.

Von Daeniken spent the early part of his working life managing a hotel in eastern Switzerland, where a fraud conviction landed him in jail for 18 months.

But as his book took off, he emerged from prison as a best-selling author.

Still, he never presented the smoking gun to fulfil astronomer Carl Sagan's famous adage that "extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence".

"He ... says that the astonishing astronomical information ancient civilizations, such as the Mayan, had is proof that there were some space travelers around to teach it to them. This fits in with his general questioning of the ability of the Egyptians to build the pyramids, or the Easter Islanders to erect those massive stone heads," the New York Times wrote in 1974.

"His method is to use a negative - ancient peoples couldn't have done or thought all the things they did - to prove a positive - that the ancient people were the beneficiaries of some kind of cosmological Point 4 (development assistance) programme."

Such criticism never knocked von Daeniken off his stride.

"We owe it to our self-respect to be rational and objective," he wrote. "At some time or other every daring theory seemed to be a Utopia. How many Utopias have long since become everyday realities!"

Television specials about his books made him a well-known figure in Europe and the United States. In 2003 he opened a Mysteries of the World theme park in Interlaken - although it went bust after three years.

In a treatise on his website, von Daeniken said he was not an esoteric, and that his work served to debunk "a world of religious and unfortunately often scientific humbugs".

"From countless old written records I know that these 'gods' promised to return. Then we will experience the god shock, a total catastrophe in religion and science. And everything would have been so easy to understand - without this god shock. The evidence speaks a clear language. That is what drives me."

The release in July 2021 of a watershed U.S. government UFO report that did not rule out extraterrestrial origins gave him hope.

"In future, anyone who talks about UFOs and extraterrestrials can no longer simply be ridiculed. People will slowly realise that many things are possible that they previously considered impossible," he told the Neue Zuercher Zeitung newspaper.

"As soon as we are prepared and get used to the idea that we are not alone in the universe, the extraterrestrials will come to us. I expect that to be the case within the next 10 years."</description><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 15:21:58 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'No more oil or money': Trump urges Cuba to cut deal with US 'before it's too late'</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260111-no-more-oil-or-money-trump-urges-cuba-to-cut-deal-with-us-before-it-s-too-late</link><description>US President Donald Trump on Sunday suggested Cuba should strike a ⁠deal with Washington, warning that the island nation would no longer receive oil or money from Venezuela.

Venezuela is Cuba's biggest oil supplier, but since ​the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro by US forces, ‍Trump has successfully pressed interim President Delcy Rodriguez to send Venezuelan oil to the United ​States.

"THERE WILL BE NO MORE OIL OR MONEY GOING ​TO CUBA – ZERO! I strongly suggest they make a deal, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE," Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social on Sunday.

" Cuba lived, for many years, on large amounts of OIL and MONEY from Venezuela," Trump said.

US intelligence has painted a grim picture of Cuba's economic and political ‍situation, but its assessments offer no clear support for Trump's prediction that the island is "ready ​to fall", Reuters reported on Saturday, citing three people familiar with the confidential assessments.

The CIA’s view is that key sectors of the Cuban ‌economy, such as agriculture and tourism, are severely strained by frequent blackouts, trade sanctions and other problems. The potential ‍loss of oil imports and other support from Venezuela, for decades a key ally, could make governing more difficult for the administration that has ruled Cuba since Fidel Castro led a revolution in 1959.

For Cuba, the loss of Venezuelan oil is devastating. Between January and November of last year, Venezuela ‍sent an average of 27,000 barrels per day (bpd) to the island, covering roughly 50% of ‌Cuba's oil ​deficit, according to shipping data and documents from Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA.</description><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 15:22:33 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/bb274260-ecb4-11f0-8f02-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-07T223444Z-627251180-RC2SBEA20ART-RTRMADP-3-USA-TRUMP-UN.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Conditions not met for oil firms to invest in Venezuela, expert says</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/conditions-not-met-for-oil-firms-to-invest-in-venezuela-expert-says</link><description /><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 15:22:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/0546dc28-eefb-11f0-b731-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260111-090401-091523-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuela releases political prisoners in deal with Washington</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/venezuela-releases-political-prisoners-in-deal-with-washington</link><description /><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 15:22:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/4acddfc6-eefb-11f0-b192-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260111-150515-150725-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Salah, Osimhen and Mané aim to deny Morocco AFCON title</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/africa/20260111-salah-osimhen-and-man%C3%A9-aim-to-deny-morocco-afcon-title</link><description>The Africa Cup of Nations has reached the semi-final stage and a tournament devoid of shocks now offers up two mouthwatering ties with hosts Morocco looking to see off the challenges of their fellow continental heavyweights.

Mohamed Salah 's Egypt , Victor Osimhen's Nigeria and Sadio Mané' s Senegal all remain in contention to win the trophy in Rabat next Sunday, even if home advantage still makes Morocco favourites.

World Cup semi-finalists in 2022, Morocco are Africa's top-ranked team and approach Wednesday's semi-final against Nigeria in the capital defending an unbeaten record since losing to South Africa at the last AFCON.

Walid Regragui's side have conceded just one goal in five matches here and doubts about their ability to handle the enormous pressure of playing at home were blown away with their performance in beating Cameroon 2-0 in the quarter-finals.

Captain and current African player of the year Achraf Hakimi is fit again after injury, and in Real Madrid winger Brahim Diaz – scorer of five goals in five games – they have probably the tournament's outstanding player.

"He can become the best player in the world if he wants to," remarked Regragui after the Cameroon game.

Morocco are Africa's leading power right now and, unlike Nigeria, are gearing up for the World Cup .

But their Cup of Nations record down the years has been underwhelming. This is their first semi-final since 2004, when they lost the final to Tunisia .

Going further back, Morocco beat Nigeria en route to lifting the trophy in 1976 – half a century on, that remains their only continental title.

Nigeria returned to Morocco with much to prove after a penalty shoot-out defeat by the Democratic Republic of Congo in a November play-off in Rabat ended their hopes of World Cup qualification.

There might be 10 African countries participating at the World Cup and it is remarkable that Nigeria – with its footballing pedigree and the largest population on the continent – will not be among them.

However, their performances over the last three weeks have shown that to be an anomaly.

Nigeria were runners-up at the last Cup of Nations in 2024. Led by two former African players of the year in Osimhen and Ademola Lookman, they are this tournament's top scorers with 14 goals.

So what has changed from the failed World Cup qualifying campaign?

"Nothing," said coach Eric Chelle, appointed exactly a year ago. "This is the same team. The difference is just that they have improved because they know what I want."

Shocks have been effectively non-existent at this AFCON but Nigeria's presence means four of the five top-ranked African teams are in the semis – the exception is Algeria, beaten by the Super Eagles on Saturday.

Wednesday's other semi-final in Tangiers between Egypt and Senegal is a repeat of the 2022 final, which the Lions of Teranga won on penalties.

Watch more Senegal vs Egypt: the Pharaohs' revenge?

Senegal, ranked second in Africa and 19th in the world, were seen as the biggest threat to Morocco before the tournament and stand one game away from a third final appearance in four editions.

They have an experienced side which includes Mané, who will come up against his old Liverpool teammate Salah.

Their presence means the last five players to win the African player of the year prize are all in the semi-finals.

Salah, who like Osimhen has four goals at the tournament, has never won AFCON, having twice been a losing finalist.

He came to Morocco having fallen from favour at his club but seems to have found happiness again with his national team as he looks to fire Egypt to a record-extending eighth title.

"I have won almost every honour, but this is the one I am waiting for," said Salah after the quarter-final win over Ivory Coast, before insisting the Pharaohs are now the outsiders.

"We are coming up against really good teams, most of whose players are based in Europe , which makes it easier for them. We have very good players but most play in Egypt. We have three players playing abroad but all of them are in a difficult situation – none of them are playing for their clubs just now," he added, with a nod to his own problems at Anfield.</description><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 16:25:07 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/780fa9d4-eeff-11f0-966d-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/2025-12-27T152209Z-1035249010-MT1SIPA000M249NZ-RTRMADP-3-SIPA-USA.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran protest deaths rise to more than 500, rights group says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-protest-deaths-rise-more-than-500-rights-group-says-2026-01-11/</link><description>DUBAI, Jan 11 (Reuters) - Deaths from two weeks of protests in Iran have risen to more than 500, U.S.-based rights group HRANA said on Sunday.

In the early days of the regular military 's war with the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in April 2023, the army-aligned government fled the capital, which was quickly overrun by rival troops.

It has pursued a gradual return to Khartoum since the army recaptured the city last March.

"Today, we return, and the Government of Hope returns to the national capital," Idris told reporters in Khartoum, promising "better services" for residents.

For close to two years, the Sudanese capital – composed of the three cities of Khartoum, Omdurman and Khartoum North (Bahri) – was an active battlefield.

Entire neighbourhoods were besieged, rival fighters shot artillery across the Nile River and millions of people were displaced from the city.

Between March and October, 1.2 million people returned to Khartoum, according to the UN.

Many found a city with barely functioning services, their homes destroyed and neighbourhoods pockmarked by makeshift cemeteries authorities are now exhuming.

The war is estimated to have killed tens of thousands of people in the capital alone, but the complete toll is unknown, as many families are forced to bury their dead in makeshift graves.

Idris said the government was committed to improving electricity, water, healthcare and education services.

According to the UN , the rehabilitation of the capital's essential infrastructure would cost some $350 million.

In recent months, the government has held some cabinet meetings in Khartoum and launched reconstruction efforts.

The city has witnessed relative calm, though the RSF has carried out drone strikes, particularly on infrastructure.

Battles rage elsewhere across the vast country. South of Khartoum, the RSF has pushed through the Kordofan region, after dislodging the army from its last stronghold in Darfur last year.

The conflict has left 11 million people displaced internally and across borders, and created the world's largest displacement and hunger crises.</description><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 16:50:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/b0629372-ef05-11f0-b9ca-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/000-88274T6.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Hundreds killed in protests in Iran, rights group says</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/hundreds-killed-in-protests-in-iran-rights-group-says</link><description /><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 16:50:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/9a3d61ee-ef0a-11f0-addd-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260111-170139-170708-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump briefing on Iran options planned for Tuesday, WSJ reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-briefing-iran-options-planned-tuesday-wsj-reports-2026-01-11/</link><description>Jan 11 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump is scheduled to be briefed by senior officials in his administration on Tuesday on specific options to respond to the protests in Iran, the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday, citing U.S. officials.

The strikes came days after the Lebanese military said it had completed disarming Hezbollah south of the Litani River, the first phase of a nationwide plan, though Israel has called those efforts insufficient.

Lebanon's official National News Agency (NNA) reported that "enemy warplanes launched more than 10 raids on the threatened location" in the town of Kafr Hatta, which lies north of the Litani, noting "significant damage" to buildings there.

The Israeli military said it was "striking Hezbollah infrastructure in several areas" shortly after issuing an evacuation warning for Kafr Hatta.

Israel has kept up regular strikes in Lebanon despite a November 2024 ceasefire that sought to end more than a year of hostilities between it and Hezbollah.

Earlier on Sunday, the Israeli army announced it had carried out strikes on what it said was Hezbollah infrastructure elsewhere in the south "in response to Hezbollah's continuous violations of the ceasefire understandings".

The NNA reported "a series of violent Israeli strikes" on Jezzine, Mahmudiyeh and Al-Dimasqiyeh, as well as "more than 10 strikes" on Al-Bureij, all in southern Lebanon.

Most of the targeted areas are located north of the Litani.

Under heavy US pressure and fearing expanded Israeli strikes, Lebanon has committed to disarming the Iran-backed militant group, which was badly weakened by its war with Israel.

Lebanon's army said Thursday that it had "achieved the objectives of the first phase" of its disarmament plan, covering the area south of the Litani – around 30 kilometres (20 miles) from the Israeli border – with the intention to extend it to the rest of the country.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 's office said in response that the ceasefire "states clearly, Hezbollah must be fully disarmed".

Lebanon's efforts, it added, "are an encouraging beginning, but they are far from sufficient, as evidenced by Hezbollah's efforts to rearm and rebuild".

Despite the truce , Israel has also maintained troops in five south Lebanon areas it deems strategic.</description><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 17:20:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/ac50aa8a-d1e6-11f0-ba27-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/2025-12-04T152038Z-1695848887-RC2Q9IA6O1M8-RTRMADP-3-ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS-LEBANON-EVACUATION.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Homeland Security to send hundreds more officers to Minnesota, Noem says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/homeland-security-send-hundreds-more-officers-minnesota-noem-says-2026-01-11/</link><description>Jan 11 (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Homeland Security is sending "hundreds" more officers to Minnesota a day after tens of thousands of people marched through Minneapolis to protest the fatal shooting of a woman by an immigration agent, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in remarks that aired on Sunday.

The officers would be deployed on Sunday and Monday to bolster the safety of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Border Patrol officials already in Minnesota, Noem said on Fox News' "Sunday Morning Futures" program. Some 2,000 federal officers have already been dispatched to the Minneapolis-St. Paul area in what DHS has called its largest operation ever.

The new deployments were scheduled to begin even as more than 1,000 rallies were planned nationwide this weekend to protest the federal government's deportation push and Wednesday's fatal shooting of 37‑year‑old Renee Good by an ICE officer.

Minnesota officials have called the shooting unjustified, pointing to bystander video they say showed Good's vehicle turning away from the agent as he fired.

Noem and other U.S. officials have maintained that the agent acted in self-defense because Good, a volunteer in a community network that monitors and records ICE operations in Minneapolis, drove forward in the direction of the agent who then shot her, after another agent had approached the driver's side and told her to get out of the car.

In a separate Sunday appearance on CNN's "State of the Union," Noem said other video footage showed Good protesting ICE agents at other locations earlier on Wednesday morning, but did not say if or when it would be publicly released.

Minnesota authorities on Friday said they were opening their own criminal investigation into the incident, after some state law enforcement officials said the FBI was refusing to cooperate with state investigators.

White House Border Security Czar Tom Homan said on "Fox News Sunday" that he wanted to let the investigation play out, but that he "truly believe[s] that officer thought his life was in danger to take that action."</description><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 18:30:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/OK5Y3U52ZJP3PKFUJMW7XAXJ7M.jpg?auth=9f7d11b9ba1433dbe35170e384cb8d83f4c81efc659ca8d7f7ac575f775c8056&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Onus now on Russia to show it wants peace in Ukraine, says EU's von der Leyen</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/onus-now-russia-show-it-wants-peace-ukraine-says-eus-von-der-leyen-2026-01-11/</link><description>BRUSSELS, Jan 11 (Reuters) - It is now up to Russia to show it is interested in peace, after Kyiv and its allies agreed on a peace plan and security guarantees that would take effect following a ceasefire, the head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said.

Speaking to reporters, she said the peace plan was the 20-point proposal that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy discussed with U.S. President Donald Trump at the end of last year.

She added that, alongside the plan, there were substantial, robust, and well-defined security guarantees for Kyiv from the United States and Europe.

"Now, Russia has to show that they are interested in peace," von der Leyen said.

She said the security guarantees would rely first on Ukraine's armed forces, which she said were well-trained and battle-experienced. It would be the task of the Europeans to make sure the Ukrainian army is also well equipped, she said.

The second line of defence would be the so-called Coalition of the Willing -- 35 states including most EU countries as well as Canada, Britain, Australia, New Zealand and Turkey.

"Here it is very good that the Americans are involved, specifically in the verification and the monitoring, but also with a backstop," von der Leyen said.

She said that the EU was working on plans to ensure Ukraine's economic prosperity after a ceasefire, with ideas to be spelled out in a forthcoming "prosperity paper". The document would set out measures for the short-term and over the next decade to boost Ukraine's economy and support its recovery.</description><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 18:31:43 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/QXIBPVVLXZPI5FZ674HJ62NBGM.jpg?auth=5799ad347a2d0511fc19e23b671b22e3c0f7555e3b47605fe1d7d5134f69311f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UK, Germany discuss NATO forces in Greenland to calm US threat, Bloomberg News reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk-germany-discuss-nato-forces-greenland-calm-us-threat-bloomberg-news-reports-2026-01-11/</link><description>Jan 11 (Reuters) - A group of European countries, led by Britain and Germany, is discussing plans to boost their military presence in Greenland to show U.S. President Donald Trump that the continent is serious about Arctic security, Bloomberg News reported on Sunday.

The Telegraph reported on Saturday that military chiefs from Britain and other European countries were drawing up plans for a possible NATO mission in Greenland, which U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly said he wanted to acquire .

The newspaper said British officials had begun early-stage talks with Germany, France and others on plans that could involve deploying British troops, warships and aircraft to protect Greenland from Russia and China.

British transport minister Heidi Alexander, asked on Sky News whether Britain was discussing troop deployments, said talks on how to deter Russian President Vladimir Putin in the Arctic were "business as usual".

"It's becoming an increasingly contested geopolitical region, with Russia and China ... you would expect us to be talking to all our allies in NATO about what we can do to deter Russian aggression in the Arctic Circle," Alexander said.

Asked about the Telegraph report, a government spokesperson said Britain was "committed to working with NATO allies to strengthen NATO's Arctic deterrence and defence".

Trump has said the U.S. must own Greenland , an autonomous part of the Kingdom of Denmark, to prevent Russia or China occupying the strategically located and minerals-rich territory in the future, arguing U.S. military presence there was not enough.

Bloomberg News reported on Sunday that a group of European countries, led by Britain and Germany, is discussing plans to boost their military presence in Greenland.

Citing people familiar with the plans, the report said Germany will propose setting up a joint NATO mission to protect the Arctic region.

The Financial Times reported on Sunday that Nordic diplomats rejected Trump's claims of Russian and Chinese vessels operating near Greenland.

Trump has not provided any evidence to back up his claims, which Denmark disputes. Vessel tracking data from MarineTraffic and LSEG show no Chinese or Russian ship presence near Greenland.

The Telegraph reported that European nations hoped a stronger military presence in the Arctic would convince Trump to drop his plans to seize the island.</description><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 18:53:07 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/44AGMJI53JPZTDR4UC6JNNXN5U.jpg?auth=c4d2f3c9680b40b2db54f066b9e314b405be09ac3d39752f785d0d011ffd1804&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>French Socialists won't vote with Mercosur no-confidence motions</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/french-socialists-wont-vote-with-mercosur-no-confidence-motions-2026-01-11/</link><description>PARIS, Jan 11 (Reuters) - The French Socialist party will not vote in favour of two no-confidence motions filed by far-right and far-left opposition parties over France's failure to block the EU's Mercosur trade deal , its leader said on Sunday, giving some breathing space to the country's fragile government.

"It would be absurd to censure the government on Mercosur," Olivier Faure told BFM TV. The Mercosur deal- 25 years in the works - is between the EU and the Mercosur group of South American countries.

Analysts had said last week that approval chances of these motions were few, especially the one filed by the far-right National Rally (RN), the biggest party in the National Assembly, as left-wing parties never vote for any of its initiatives.

Still, the threats underline the political tightrope Macron's administration continues to walk just over a year before the 2027 presidential election, with polls showing the RN has a shot at victory next year.

Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu wants neither censure nor dissolution of the National Assembly, Le Parisien newspaper reported on Saturday.

At the same time, his office announced it had asked the Interior Ministry to prepare for possible legislative elections on the same dates as municipal elections, on March 15 and 22, in the event of his government's collapse.

"Let's be clear. I want neither censure, nor dissolution. My fight is for stability and to ward off disorder," Lecornu told Le Parisien.

"The motion of no-confidence would send a dramatic signal at a time when we are seeking compromise and an even more dramatic message in view of the international political situation," he told the daily newspaper, after denouncing "cynical partisan posturing" in a message on X on Friday .

Lecornu said the no confidence motions sent a negative signal abroad. They will be put to the vote early next week while budget talks are supposed to resume Tuesday.

Over the weekend, a parliamentary committee rejected the budget bill in its present form, another sign of the uphill struggle the government is facing to secure the euro zone's second-largest economy a working budget.

The government has invited parties except RN and the hard-left France Unbowed to a last-resort meeting at the finance ministry to find a deal on the budget.

"There is a meeting tomorrow ... with those who are willing to discuss ... I hope for a compromise," Faure said.</description><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 18:53:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/UGQZQVTCOJO3TNFKXQ7QRRCLTM.jpg?auth=015668a17718c41cf6bce2a1940a8eb98b02576cc9837210d42729c844b6778c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Some US senators skeptical about military options for Iran</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/some-us-senators-skeptical-about-military-options-iran-2026-01-11/</link><description>Jan 11 (Reuters) - Some U.S. lawmakers in both major parties on Sunday questioned whether military action against Iran is the best approach for the United States as Iranian authorities face growing turmoil.

U.S. President Donald Trump in recent days has left open the possibility of American intervention in Iran, where the biggest anti-government protests in years have led to the Revolutionary Guards blaming unrest on terrorists and vowing to safeguard the governing system.

But at least two U.S. senators sounded notes of caution during interviews on TV networks’ Sunday morning programs.

"I don’t know that bombing Iran will have the effect that is intended,” Republican Senator Rand Paul said on ABC News’ "This Week" show.

Rather than undermining the regime, a military attack on Iran could rally the people against an outside enemy, Paul and Democratic Senator Mark Warner said.

Warner, appearing on "Fox News Sunday," warned that a military strike against Iran could risk uniting Iranians against the United States "in a way that the regime has not been able to." History shows the dangers of U.S. intervention, said Warner, who argued that the U.S.-backed 1953 overthrow of Iran's government set in motion a chain of events that gradually led to the rise of the country's Islamic regime in the late 1970s.

The Wall Street Journal on Sunday reported that U.S. military and diplomatic officials will brief Trump on Tuesday about options for Iran, including cyberattacks and potential military action.

Iran has said it will target U.S. military bases if the United States launches an attack. But Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, who has often touted a muscular approach to foreign policy, said Trump "needs to embolden the protesters and scare the hell out of the [Iranian] regime."

"If I were you, Mr. President, I would kill the leadership that are killing the people," Graham said on Fox News' "Sunday Morning Futures" show. "You’ve got to end this."

Reza Pahlavi, the U.S.-based son of the Iranian shah who was ousted in 1979, said on Sunday he is prepared to return to Iran to lead a shift to a democratic government.

"I'm already planning on that," Pahlavi said on "Sunday Morning Futures." "My job is to lead this transition to make sure that no stone is left unturned, that in full transparency, people have an opportunity to elect their leaders freely and to decide their own future."</description><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 19:39:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/B2GDYHETWFITZESJSIA7BDLJYQ.jpg?auth=8ad81f2dd19c6c7e6d3cb455a6752370d4bc82486f58695881ad333860940247&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>NATO should launch operation to boost security in Arctic, Belgian minister says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/nato-should-launch-operation-boost-security-arctic-belgian-minister-says-2026-01-11/</link><description>BRUSSELS, Jan 11 (Reuters) - NATO should launch an operation in the Arctic to address U.S. security concerns, Belgium's defence minister told Reuters on Sunday, urging transatlantic unity amid growing European unease about U.S. President Donald Trump's push to take control of Greenland.

"We have to collaborate, work together and show strength and unity," Theo Francken said in a phone interview, adding that there is a need for "a NATO operation in the high north".

Trump said on Friday that the U.S. needs to own Greenland to prevent Russia or China from occupying it in the future.

European officials have been discussing ways to ease U.S. concerns about security around Greenland, an autonomous territory of the Kingdom of Denmark.

Francken suggested NATO's Baltic Sentry and Eastern Sentry operations, which combine forces from different countries with drones, sensors and other technology to monitor land and sea, as possible models , opens new tab for an "Arctic Sentry".

He acknowledged Greenland's strategic importance but said "I think that we need to sort this out like friends and allies, like we always do".

A NATO spokesperson said on Friday that alliance chief Mark Rutte spoke with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio about the importance of the Arctic for shared security and how NATO is working to enhance its capabilities in the high north.

Denmark and Greenland's leaders have said that the Arctic island could not be annexed and international security did not justify such a move.

The U.S. already has a military presence on the island under a 1951 agreement.</description><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 19:40:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/AFZQKZJPBJPDXMVM2R76DDQNZI.jpg?auth=5339c55d969123129e62fef991f73adedc7d6d2f72a5f95df39eaaf6eeb1a7b3&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Britain to develop new ballistic missile for Ukraine's defense</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/britain-develop-new-ballistic-missile-ukraines-defense-2026-01-11/</link><description>Jan 11 (Reuters) - The British government said on Sunday that it will develop a new deep-strike ballistic missile for Ukraine to support the country's war efforts against Russia.

The officers would be deployed on Sunday and Monday to bolster ​the safety of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Border Patrol officials already in ​Minnesota, Noem said on Fox News ' "Sunday Morning Futures" program. Some 2,000 federal officers have already been dispatched to the Minneapolis-St. Paul area in what DHS has called its largest operation ever.

The new deployments were scheduled to begin even as more than 1,000 rallies were planned nationwide this weekend to protest the federal government's deportation push and Wednesday's fatal shooting of 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good by an ICE officer.

Minnesota officials have called the ‍shooting unjustified, pointing to bystander video they say showed Good's vehicle turning away from the agent as he fired.

Noem and ​other US officials have maintained that the agent acted in self-defense because Good, a volunteer in a community network that monitors and records ICE operations in Minneapolis, drove forward in the ‌direction of the agent who then shot her, after another agent had approached the driver's side and told her to get out of the ‍car.

In a separate Sunday appearance on CNN 's "State of the Union," Noem said other video footage showed Good protesting ICE agents at other locations earlier on Wednesday morning, but did not say if or when it would be publicly released.

Minnesota authorities on Friday said they were opening their own criminal investigation into the incident, after some state law enforcement officials said the FBI was refusing to cooperate with state ‍investigators.

White House Border Security Czar Tom Homan said on "Fox News Sunday" that he wanted to let the investigation ‌play out, but that ​he "truly believe that officer thought his life was in danger to take that action."</description><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 20:47:47 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/60edb7e0-ef28-11f0-affe-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-10T220515Z-1169860487-RC2KYIA5TRK8-RTRMADP-3-USA-TRUMP-MINNESOTA.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Hong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai's mitigation hearing set to begin ahead of sentencing</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/hong-kong-media-tycoon-jimmy-lais-mitigation-hearing-set-begin-ahead-sentencing-2026-01-11/</link><description /><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 22:21:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Denmark warns of ‘decisive moment’ as Trump renews threat of force over Greenland</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260111-denmark-trump-greenland</link><description>Denmark's prime minister on Sunday said her country faces a "decisive moment" in its diplomatic battle with the United States over Greenland , after President Donald Trump again suggested using force to seize the Arctic territory.

Ahead of meetings in Washington from Monday on the global scramble for key raw materials, Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said that "there is a conflict over Greenland".

"This is a decisive moment" with stakes that go beyond the immediate issue of Greenland's future , she added in a debate with other Danish political leaders.

Frederiksen posted on Facebook that "we are ready to defend our values -- wherever it is necessary -- also in the Arctic. We believe in international law and in peoples' right to self-determination."

Germany and Sweden backed Denmark against Trump's latest claims to the self-governing Danish territory.

Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson condemned US "threatening rhetoric" after Trump repeated that Washington was "going to do something on Greenland, whether they like it or not".

"Sweden, the Nordic countries, the Baltic states, and several major European countries stand together with our Danish friends," he told a defence conference in Salen where the US general in charge of NATO took part.

Kristersson said a US takeover of mineral-rich Greenland would be "a violation of international law and risks encouraging other countries to act in exactly the same way".

Germany reiterated its support for Denmark and Greenland ahead of the Washington discussions.

Before meeting US counterpart Marco Rubio on Monday, German Foreign Minister Johann Wadehpul held talks in Iceland to address the "strategic challenges of the Far North", according to a foreign ministry statement.

"Security in the arctic is becoming more and more important" and "is part of our common interest in NATO", he said at a joint news conference with Icelandic Foreign Minister Thorgerdur Katrin Gunnarsdottir.

"If the American president is looking at what threats might come from Russian or Chinese ships or submarines in the region, we can of course find answers to that together," he added.

But "the future of Greenland must be decided by the people of Greenland" and Denmark, he said.

Asked about a possible strengthening of NATO's commitment in the Arctic, Wadephul said Germany was "ready to assume greater responsibilities".

Earlier Sunday, German Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil said: "We are strengthening security in the Arctic together, as NATO allies, and not against one another."

He was speaking ahead of an international meeting on critical raw materials in Washington.

European nations have scrambled to coordinate a response after the White House said this week that Trump wanted to buy Greenland and refused to rule out military action.

On Tuesday, leaders of seven European countries including France, Britain, Germany and Italy signed a letter saying it is "only" for Denmark and Greenland to decide the territory's future.

Trump says controlling the island is crucial for US national security because of the rising Russian and Chinese military activity in the Arctic.

NATO Supreme Allied Commander General Alexus Grynkewich told the Swedish conference that alliance members were discussing Greenland's status.

While there was "no immediate threat" to NATO territory, the Arctic's strategic importance was fast growing, the US general added.

Grynkewich said he would not comment on "the political dimensions of recent rhetoric" but talks on Greenland were being held at the North Atlantic Council.

"Those dialogues continue in Brussels. They have been healthy dialogues from what I've heard," the general said.

A Danish colony until 1953, Greenland gained home rule 26 years later and is contemplating eventually loosening its ties with Denmark. Polls indicate that Greenland's population strongly oppose a US takeover.

"I don't think there's an immediate threat to NATO territory right now," Grynkewich told the conference.

But he said Russian and Chinese vessels had been seen patrolling together on Russia's northern coast and near Alaska and Canada, working together to get greater access to the Arctic as ice recedes due to global warming.</description><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 23:42:07 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/cbe470fc-e9b5-11f0-86d5-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25297625966686.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'Unhinged' or savvy? Meet Li Chenggang, who leads China’s trade talks with the US</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/unhinged-or-savvy-meet-li-chenggang-who-leads-chinas-trade-talks-with-us-2026-01-12/</link><description>BEIJING/GENEVA/WASHINGTON, Jan 12 (Reuters) - When U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent described China's lead trade negotiator Li Chenggang as " unhinged " for breaching diplomatic niceties shortly before a critical summit in October, he painted a picture of an erratic junior bureaucrat who had "gone rogue."

Neither a “wolf warrior” nor a wallflower, Li is a chain-smoking, porcelain-collecting career diplomat with an encyclopedic knowledge of trade law and excellent English who alternates between charm and delivering Beijing's tough messages, sources say.

After playing a crucial role in steadying the U.S.-China trade relationship in 2025, he is set to be at the forefront of further negotiations this year. U.S. President Donald Trump has made clear he wants to visit China in April and said he would host President Xi Jinping for a state visit later in the year.

More than a dozen diplomats, businesspeople and current and former U.S. officials described the man at the heart of the world’s most important trade negotiations as smart and pragmatic, with a tough edge that helps China achieve its goals.

Trade officials and Western diplomats who have interacted with the vice commerce minister in recent months described him as commanding rooms. One American business figure said he had an "executive presence," a contrast from the stereotypical Chinese bureaucrat: A stoic, script-bound delivery that allows little room for personal flair.

They said he is well-prepared, with a deep understanding of China's economic structure and U.S. trade demands. One former U.S. official who negotiated with Li on an Obama-era investment deal called him a "rising star."

From April through October, Li helped steer months of stop-start negotiations across European capitals - from Geneva to Stockholm to London - that tested the limits of economic diplomacy between the U.S. and China.

The 58-year-old, who earlier represented China at the World Trade Organization before taking on his current role , navigated subjects spanning export curbs on rare earths , agricultural purchases and semiconductor access - issues that underpin $660 billion in annual bilateral trade.

The October negotiations produced an uneasy truce that has held to this day, with China deferring expansive controls on rare earth exports for a year and agreeing to buy 12 million tons of U.S. soybeans by March.

“Li's near-term priority is to maintain the bilateral trade truce and create a positive environment for Trump's visit to China,” said Neil Thomas of the Asia Society, a New York-based think tank.

"The Chinese trade team's biggest challenge is to get the Trump administration to relax more U.S. export controls without generating an overwhelming backlash in Washington."

It was in the weeks ahead of the October talks that Li drew a public rebuke from Bessent when the Chinese negotiator sought meetings in Washington with officials who outranked him and "lectured" them about China's position in the talks, according to four senior U.S. businesspeople briefed on the trip. The sources spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private exchanges.

Li tried to meet U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, one of the businesspeople told Reuters, but ended up speaking to Commerce Department Undersecretary William Kimmitt and a lower-level Treasury official who matched his rank in protocol terms, though they were not authorised to negotiate on trade with China, according to another person briefed on the exchanges.

Regardless, he still "read the riot act" to his counterparts and conveyed demands from China's leadership to change their behaviour to get negotiations back on track, the person said.

In terms of ranking, Li is second only to the commerce minister, making him China's No. 2 commerce official. Vice Premier He Lifeng remains Xi's point person for overseeing the U.S.-China economic and trade relationship and is Bessent's counterpart in terms of seniority.

In public remarks, Bessent later called Li "very disrespectful." He also said Li threatened that China would “unleash chaos” on the global economic system if the U.S. imposed port-entry fees on Chinese vessels.

The comments, which included Bessent calling Li “unhinged,” threatened to derail a planned presidential summit in South Korea in October, after both sides took a series of retaliatory moves.

But Li and Bessent regrouped days later at the ASEAN summit in Kuala Lumpur, where they hashed out a framework trade agreement that successfully deferred 100% tariffs on Chinese goods and expanded export controls on rare earths.

In response to Reuters questions on Li, a White House official said: “He did come uninvited in August and did seek meetings above his level, which were denied.”

The U.S. Commerce and Treasury departments did not respond to Reuters requests for comment. The WTO declined to comment. China's commerce ministry did not respond to a request for comment.

Born in rural Anhui province, Li read law at the elite Peking University as well as Germany's University of Hamburg. He climbed the ranks at the Ministry of Commerce, including a period running its department of treaty and law from 2010 to 2017. In his current role, Li also oversees the export controls and anti-dumping probes that China uses with foreign companies to protect its rights and ensure a level playing field.

During his time as China's WTO representative in Geneva from 2021 to 2025, Li was a prolific networker who regularly hosted dinners and smoked Chinese cigarettes with other ambassadors in between meetings, four WTO sources told Reuters.

At the weekends, Li frequently scoured Swiss flea markets for discounted Chinese porcelain and could identify which dynasty the items came from, they said.

Norway's WTO ambassador Petter Olberg, who worked closely with Li, told Reuters he was "extremely well liked and respected" and "very constructive about seeking solutions."

"He's not one of those who shouts the loudest," Olberg said. "He thinks things through. He would always listen before he spoke at meetings."

As a token of his appreciation, Li threw a lavish farewell banquet for the Mauritian WTO representative at his residence in December 2024, Olberg and other attendees said.

Guests were served artfully presented hors d'oeuvres on plates hand-painted with karst mountains illustrating an ancient Chinese poem, according to a photograph provided by one attendee. A well-known poem by Tang dynasty scribe Li Bai celebrated the poet's profound love of friendship over natural beauty.

At the WTO, Li's tactics were not limited to poems and dinner parties. One aide recalled him getting “angry and agitated” while pursuing the Investment Facilitation for Development Agreement – a landmark deal that China played a key role in creating.

He is an advocate of Beijing's efforts to reshape the multilateral trade order, pitching China as a stabilising force in the face of turmoil created by Trump’s tariffs, said the Beijing-based Western trade diplomat.

In negotiations with the U.S., he would have a good grasp of policy details and how to advance China’s aims under the WTO legal framework, said one Western trade diplomat who met Li multiple times last year.

Li's competence in meetings has led some observers to say that China has a stronger, more cohesive team that is empowered to implement directives from the leadership.

One U.S. businessperson who met Li in September said Chinese negotiators “go in knowing what they can and cannot accept," while their American counterparts require Trump’s final approval after negotiating a framework.

"Li is someone who skillfully deploys legal instruments in the trade war," said Henry Gao, an associate law professor at Singapore Management University.

"I expect him to remain a leading figure in the U.S.-China trade negotiations for years to come."</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 01:52:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/TGINQS7D3BPIBKTY22YGCPGI64.jpg?auth=2435c173c712c2538640b0296463a55f1f0b76552f1a00be63dbe853a44aaa18&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Landmark Myanmar Rohingya genocide case to open at UN's top court</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/landmark-myanmar-rohingya-genocide-case-open-uns-top-court-2026-01-12/</link><description>THE HAGUE, Jan 12 (Reuters) - A landmark case accusing Myanmar of committing genocide against minority Muslim Rohingya will open at the United Nations' top court on Monday.

It will be the first genocide case the International Court of Justice (ICJ) will hear in full in over a decade. The outcome will have repercussions beyond Myanmar, likely affecting South Africa’s genocide case at the ICJ against Israel over the war in Gaza.

Myanmar has denied accusations of genocide.

"The case is likely to set critical precedents for how genocide is defined and how it can be proven, and how violations can be remedied," Nicholas Koumjian, head of the U.N.'s Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar, told Reuters.

The predominantly Muslim West African country of Gambia filed the case at the ICJ - also known as the World Court - in 2019, accusing Myanmar of committing genocide against the Rohingya, a mainly Muslim minority in the remote western Rakhine state.

Myanmar's armed forces launched an offensive in 2017 that forced at least 730,000 Rohingya from their homes and into neighbouring Bangladesh, where they recounted killings, mass rape and arson.

A U.N. fact-finding mission concluded the 2017 military offensive had included "genocidal acts" .

Myanmar authorities rejected that report , saying its military offensive was a legitimate counter-terrorism campaign in response to attacks by Muslim militants.

In 2019 preliminary hearings in the ICJ case, Myanmar's then leader, Aung San Suu Kyi , rejected Gambia's accusations of genocide as "incomplete and misleading".

The hearings at the ICJ will mark the first time that Rohingya victims of the alleged atrocities will be heard by an international court although those sessions will be closed to the public and the media for sensitivity and privacy reasons.

The hearings start at 10 a.m. (0900 GMT) on Monday and will span three weeks.

Myanmar has been in further turmoil since 2021, when the military toppled the elected civilian government and violently suppressed pro-democracy protests, sparking a nationwide armed rebellion.

The country is currently holding phased elections that have been criticised by the United Nations, some Western countries and human rights groups as not free or fair.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 01:52:47 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/SCLK5Z3RJJJWJOJS5XOTMSP76Q.jpg?auth=4aaa199d2bd9e533c989820dcf619ed6f011dabea9c8d86703ff84b450cee41f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russian overnight attack sparks fire in Kyiv, Ukraine military says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-overnight-attack-sparks-fire-kyiv-ukraine-military-says-2026-01-12/</link><description>KYIV, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Russia launched an overnight air attack on Kyiv, sparking a fire in one of the city's districts, Ukrainian military said on Monday.

"He's very good at that kind of thing, he's got a very good company," Trump told reporters in response to a question about whether he would engage with Musk's SpaceX company, which offers a satellite internet service called Starlink that has been used in Iran.

Musk and Trump have held an on-again, off-again relationship after the billionaire helped fund Trump's winning presidential campaign and subsequently orchestrated massive cuts to the federal government.

The pair had a public falling-out last year as Musk opposed Trump's signature tax bill, but the two men appear to have rekindled their relationship, eating dinner together at Trump's Mar-A-Lago resort this month.

Musk and SpaceX did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 01:53:12 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BOS7ZH75BJLZ7H4JXGHNVLDEW4.jpg?auth=455614811f0253bc61f20a2a7d76732f4f8b86cabf252efadaf69ea085f3898a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Truck plows into Los Angeles rally to support Iran demonstrations, KNBC reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/truck-plows-into-los-angeles-rally-support-iran-demonstrations-knbc-reports-2026-01-12/</link><description>CHICAGO, Jan 11 (Reuters) - A truck plowed into a crowd gathered in Los Angeles to show support for Iranian protesters, the KNBC news outlet reported on Sunday.

The move represents an unprecedented escalation in President Donald Trump's battle with the Fed, an independent agency he has repeatedly attacked for not cutting its key interest rate as quickly as Trump prefers.

The subpoena relates to his testimony before the Senate Banking Committee in June, Powell said, regarding the Fed's $2.5 billion renovation of two office buildings, a project that Trump criticised as excessive this summer.

In a video statement, Powell said the threat of criminal charges are “pretexts” to undermine the Fed's independence when it comes to setting interest rates.

“This is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions—or whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation,” Powell said.

The Justice Department in a statement Sunday said it can’t comment on any particular case, but added that Attorney General Pam Bondi “has instructed her US Attorneys to prioritise investigating any abuse of tax payer dollars.”

A spokesperson for US Attorney Jeanine Pirro’s office didn’t immediately respond Sunday to a text message and phone call seeking comment.

The potential indictment has already drawn concern from one Republican senator, who said he’ll oppose any future nominee to the central bank, including any replacement for Powell, until “this legal matter is fully resolved.”

“If there were any remaining doubt whether advisers within the Trump Administration are actively pushing to end the independence of the Federal Reserve, there should now be none,” said North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis, who sits on the Banking Committee, which oversees Fed nominations. “It is now the independence and credibility of the Department of Justice that are in question.”</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 01:53:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/634f5dd0-d610-11f0-bb0e-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/69117ba4596397f8d76fec1e3941ce63962d168d.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Australia PM Albanese recalls parliament early in wake of Bondi attack</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/australia-pm-albanese-recalls-parliament-early-wake-bondi-attack-2026-01-12/</link><description>SYDNEY, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Australia Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on Monday that Parliament would be recalled early to sit next week in the wake of the Bondi attack.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 03:50:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/L2UN5KORXVJU5GDPMJAQEWFUXY.jpg?auth=d4cca4c07cee8d05537383467521692b219d89438515fb79969ebe32e659950d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Cambodian, South Korean police arrest 26 for alleged scams, sex crimes, Blue House says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/cambodian-south-korean-police-arrest-26-alleged-scams-sex-crimes-blue-house-says-2026-01-12/</link><description>SEOUL, Jan 12 (Reuters) - A joint investigative team of Cambodian and South Korean police has arrested 26 suspects over alleged online scams and sex crimes targeting South Korean citizens, the Korean presidential office said on Monday.

The bilateral task force found that the suspects allegedly extorted about 26.7 billion won ($18.25 million) from 165 South Koreans through online scams, in which they pretended to be police or financial regulators, Kang Yu-jung, a spokeswoman at the Blue House, said at a briefing.

The suspects also allegedly coerced multiple female victims into filming sex videos and photos for distribution, Kang said, declining to elaborate on details.

Cambodian police made the arrests with assistance from the task force and South Korea's intelligence agency, she added.

The suspects will be extradited to South Korea to face punishment, she said.

The Cambodian government could not immediately be reached for comment on the arrests and allegations.

Paul Thomas Anderson's screwball thriller "One Battle," which centers on an aging revolutionary (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his teenage daughter (Chase Infiniti), entered the night with nine nominations.

Midway through the ceremony, it had collected awards for best director, best screenplay, and best supporting actress for Teyana Taylor.

But its star missed out to Chalamet's performance as an ambitious 1950s table tennis player in "Marty Supreme."

"Thank you so much from the bottom of my heart. I'm in a category with many greats -- this category is stacked. I look up to all of you," said Chalamet, who also bested the likes of George Clooney ("Jay Kelly") and Ethan Hawke ("Blue Moon").

Chalamet said his four previous Globes losses "make this moment that much sweeter" before thanking his girlfriend Kylie Jenner.

The lavish Globes ceremony is a key stepping point in Hollywood's awards season, which culminates in March with the Oscars.

As the night progresses, the politically charged "One Battle After Another" is still expected to convert more of its nominations into wins, including best comedy or musical film.

A rollicking ride featuring violent leftist radicals, immigration raids and white supremacists, the film has connected with audiences and critics at a time when the United States is deeply polarized.

The Globes offer separate awards for dramas and comedies/musicals -- widening the field of stars in attendance.

"Sinners," Ryan Coogler's period horror film about the segregated South of the 1930s, is expected to be the toughest competition for "One Battle" at the Oscars.

But at the Globes, they are in separate categories.

"Sinners" surprised moviegoers with its eclectic mix of vampires, politics, race relations and blues music.

It won best score and best cinematic and box office achievement, and is the frontrunner for the best drama film Globe, against rival "Hamnet," which stars Paul Mescal as William Shakespeare.

Jessie Buckley, playing Shakespeare's grief-stricken wife who struggles to cope with the death of their won, is the favorite for best drama actress honors.

"Sentimental Value," the Norwegian family dramedy starring Stellan Skarsgard, earned a strong eight nominations and is also in the running.

Skarsgard took home the award for best supporting actor.

Rose Byrne won for best comedy actress for "If I Had Legs I'd Kick You." Netflix's animated mega-hit "KPop Demon Hunters" won for best song.

The Globes also honor the best in television, with HBO's black comedy anthology "The White Lotus," sci-fi office thriller "Severance" leading the contenders, and searing teen murder saga "Adolescence" winning early awards.

Host Nikki Glaser kicked off the evening with jokes on wide-ranging topics, including the release of redacted US government files about convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

"The Golden Globe for best editing goes to the Justice Department," she said.

"There are so many A-listers, and by A-listers, I do mean people who are on a list that has been heavily redacted," Glaser added, referring to Epstein's many celebrity friends.

Several celebrities including Mark Ruffalo, Natasha Lyonne and Wanda Sykes walked the red carpet sporting pins with the message "BE GOOD."

The badges are part of a tribute to Renee Good, the US woman whose fatal shooting by a federal agent has sparked renewed protests against President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown.

"Let's do the right thing," said Jean Smart, after winning best comedy series actress for "Hacks." She also was wearing a pin.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 03:51:19 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/b4be9836-ef63-11f0-ac0b-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26012085378409.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Vietnam's Communist Party chief Lam seeks presidency in China-style expanded power mandate</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/vietnams-communist-party-chief-lam-seeks-presidency-china-style-expanded-power-2026-01-12/</link><description>HANOI, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Vietnam's Communist Party chief To Lam is seeking to combine his party role with the state presidency, officials said, in a move that would align Vietnam's political structure more closely to China's where President Xi Jinping heads the party and state.

Next week some 1,600 delegates will gather in Hanoi to kick off a week-long Communist Party congress , held every five years to select new leaders and set policy goals for the single-party state.

Lam, 68, bid for both top positions at a party meeting in December , seeking initial party approval ahead of the congress, three people briefed by the delegates and another three officials familiar with the matter told Reuters.

While the sources said the party meeting backed Lam to remain party chief, the three people briefed by delegates gave differing accounts on the question of the presidency, a largely ceremonial role but one currently held by the military.

Two said Lam won support for his bid, while the third said the conclusion was unclear. In any case, the final decision rests with delegates who will be elected at the congress.

The party's secretariat did not immediately reply to a request for comment.

The combination of the two top jobs for the next five years would mark a significant departure from Vietnam's traditional power-sharing model. Only in exceptional periods after the death of incumbents have the positions been merged, including in 2024 when Lam held both positions for about three months.

Should Lam succeed, the military, a powerful faction within the party, would give up the presidency in exchange for maintaining a broad autonomy over the promotion of its senior officers, two sources said.

One official said military leaders are negotiating "safeguards" to limit Lam's authority. The defence ministry was not immediately available for comment.

In possible signs of early concessions, some controversial economic policies pursued under Lam's first term were revised or faced unexpected hurdles ahead of the congress, including on credit growth and a high-speed railway.

Supporters of combining the two roles argue all other communist countries - China, North Korea, Cuba and Laos - vest both positions in a single leader, and note the move would bolster Lam's economic reform agenda and strengthen his standing in meetings with foreign leaders.

Sceptics see the change as emboldening a leader seen as a risk-taker who has already vastly expanded the powers of the security apparatus.

The merger would be "the natural outcome of streamlining Vietnam's political structure," said Carl Thayer, a senior expert on Vietnam at the Australian Defence Force Academy, noting Lam has already effectively taken over some of the president's powers with frequent overseas trips last year.

Starting January 19, the week-long congress will elect 200 members of the new central committee, with a large number of newcomers expected to join, raising questions about whether they will confirm decisions made by the roughly 140 delegates who voted in December.

The central committee will elect the party chief and the politburo. Lam in July said the new politburo will have 17-19 members, but the size will depend on delegates' votes on a pre-arranged shortlist.

The politburo will then nominate the president, prime minister and speaker of the parliament, whose appointments lawmakers must confirm.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 04:51:22 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/D2DSO5UUI5LAJG7ZGBDSAUZJFQ.jpg?auth=094f9a482ff33ee08d32b8fd3854e29e62c2dd850d953ff2f3850b74090a7478&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>South Korea to probe drones North Korea says violated its airspace</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/south-korea-probe-drones-north-korea-says-violated-its-airspace-2026-01-12/</link><description>SEOUL, Jan 12 (Reuters) - South Korean authorities have launched an investigation focused on the possibility civilians may have flown drones that North Korea said violated its airspace , the Defence Ministry said on Monday.

President Lee Jae Myung has vowed a swift probe and said on Saturday if civilians had indeed operated the unmanned aircraft, it would be a "serious crime" that threatened South Korea's security and peace on the Korean peninsula.

South Korea is willing to jointly conduct the investigation with North Korea but has not made the proposal, a defence ministry spokesperson said citing Minister Ahn Gyu-back.

North Korea has not responded to previous attempts by Lee's government to initiate dialogue.

North Korea's military on Saturday accused the South of "acts of provocation" by sending the drones, saying it had shot down the aircraft and disclosed what it said were pieces of the drones and aerial photos they took.

South Korea's military said it did not operate the drone model in question or operate any on the date cited by the North of the intrusion. It had no intention to provoke the North, it said.

Tensions frequently flare up between South Korea and its nuclear-armed northern neighbour.

Former South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol went on trial on Monday on charges of trying to provoke North Korea in 2024 as a pretext for declaring martial law later that year. He is facing a separate trial for insurrection over the martial law attempt.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 04:52:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5IKCYHHSNZOMPPR7SKX7MB7L2M.jpg?auth=187f33e75fc1e7bb558f5552dcfa3a182eaceb1c456645ca085c7871c88f9e3e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Australian arts festival decision to bar Palestinian author after Bondi attack spurs boycott</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/australian-arts-festival-decision-bar-palestinian-author-after-bondi-attack-2026-01-12/</link><description>SYDNEY, Jan 12 (Reuters) - A top Australian arts festival has seen the withdrawal of dozens of writers in a backlash against its decision to bar an Australian Palestinian author after the Bondi Beach mass shooting, as moves to curb antisemitism spur free speech concerns.

The shooting which killed 15 people at a Jewish Hanukkah celebration at Sydney's Bondi Beach on December 14 sparked nationwide calls to tackle antisemitism. Police say the alleged gunmen were inspired by the Islamic State militant group.

The Adelaide Festival board said last Thursday it would disinvite Dr Randa Abdel-Fattah from February's Writers Week in the state of South Australia because "it would not be culturally sensitive to continue to program her at this unprecedented time so soon after Bondi".

A Macquarie University academic who researches Islamophobia and Palestine, Abdel-Fattah responded saying it was "a blatant and shameless act of anti-Palestinian racism and censorship", with her lawyers issuing a letter to the festival.

Around 50 authors have since withdrawn from the festival in protest, leaving it in doubt, local media reported.

Among the boycotting authors, Kathy Lette wrote on social media the decision to bar Abdel-Fattah "sends a divisive and plainly discriminatory message that platforming Australian Palestinians is 'culturally insensitive'."

The Adelaide Festival said in a statement on Monday that three board members and the chairperson had resigned.

The festival's executive director, Julian Hobba, said the arts body was "navigating a complex and unprecedented moment" after the "significant community response" to the board decision.

In the days after the Bondi Beach attack, Jewish community groups and the Israeli government criticised Prime Minister Anthony Albanese for failing to act on a rise in antisemitic attacks and criticised protest marches against Israel's war in Gaza held since 2023.

Albanese said last week a Royal Commission will consider the events of the shooting as well as antisemitism and social cohesion in Australia. Albanese said on Monday he would recall parliament next week to pass tougher hate speech laws.

On Monday New South Wales state premier Chris Minns announced new rules that would allow local councils to cut off power and water to illegally operating prayer halls and impose bigger fines to curb "hate preachers".

Minns said the new rules were prompted by the difficulty in closing a Muslim prayer hall in Sydney linked to a cleric found by a court to have made statements intimidating Jewish Australians.

The mayor of the western Sydney suburb of Fairfield, which has a large Muslim community, said the rules were ill-considered and councils should not be responsible for determining hate speech.

"Freedom of speech is something that should always be allowed, as long as it is done in a peaceful way," Mayor Frank Carbone told Reuters.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 04:52:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/SRBRP4J7IBLIFCRFPEOZJWI5BM.jpg?auth=c7da7cbb03d844398c5f5eef42c310ab03349aa935fa9975cd487d6257007332&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump’s Justice Department subpoenas Fed Chair Powell over building renovation</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/economy/20260112-trump-s-justice-department-subpoenas-fed-chair-powell-over-building-renovation</link><description>Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Sunday that the central bank had been subpoenaed by the US Justice Department, blasting the move as part of President Donald Trump 's extraordinary pressure campaign on US monetary policy decisions.

Powell added in a statement that the bank received grand jury subpoenas "threatening a criminal indictment" on Friday related to his Senate testimony in June, which had been about a major renovation project of Federal Reserve office buildings.

He dismissed the possible threat of indictment over his testimony or the renovation project as "pretexts."

"The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President," Powell said.

"This unprecedented action should be seen in the broader context of the administration's threats and ongoing pressure," Powell said.

The Fed has a dual mandate to keep prices stable and unemployment low, and its main tool in doing so is by setting a key interest rate that influences the cost of borrowing across the economy.

Trump has consistently pressured Powell and the central bank to move faster in lowering interest rates, in a breach of the long-standing independence of the institution.

Trump on Sunday denied any knowledge of the Justice Department's investigation into the Federal Reserve.

"I don't know anything about it, but he's certainly not very good at the Fed, and he's not very good at building buildings," NBC quoted Trump as saying.

Senators from both sides of the aisle blasted the investigation.

"It is now the independence and credibility of the Department of Justice that are in question," Republican Thom Tillis said.

"I will oppose the confirmation of any nominee for the Fed - including the upcoming Fed Chair vacancy - until this legal matter is fully resolved," he added.

Democrat Elizabeth Warren accused Trump of trying "to complete his corrupt takeover" of the central bank by pushing Powell out and installing a "sock puppet" instead.

Powell's term as chairman of the Federal Reserve ends in May, and Trump told Politico in an interview last month that he would judge Powell's successor on whether they immediately cut rates.

The US president has openly spoken about ousting Powell but stopped short of doing so, and focused instead on cost overruns for renovation of the Fed's Washington headquarters.

In July, the cost of the Fed's facelift of its 88-year-old Washington headquarters and a neighboring building were up by $600 million from an initial $1.9 billion estimate.

That month, Trump made an unusual visit to the construction site during which the two men, clad in hard hats, bickered over the price tag for the makeover.

A significant driver of the cost is security, including blast-resistant windows and measures to prevent the building from collapsing in the event of an explosion.

The Federal Reserve, the world's most important central bank, makes independent monetary policy decisions and its board members typically serve under both Republican and Democratic presidents.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 04:53:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/634f5dd0-d610-11f0-bb0e-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/69117ba4596397f8d76fec1e3941ce63962d168d.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Top UN court to hear landmark Rohingya genocide case against Myanmar</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260112-top-un-court-rohingya-genocide-myanmar</link><description>Did Myanmar commit genocide against its Rohingya Muslim minority? That's what judges at the International Court of Justice will weigh during three weeks of hearings starting Monday.

The Gambia brought the case accusing Myanmar of breaching the 1948 Genocide Convention during a crackdown in 2017.

Legal experts are watching closely as it could give clues for how the court will handle similar accusations against Israel over its military campaign in Gaza, a case brought to the ICJ by South Africa.

Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims fled violence by the Myanmararmy and Buddhist militias, escaping to neighbouring Bangladesh and bringing harrowing accounts of mass rape, arson and murder.

Today, 1.17 million Rohingya live crammed into dilapidated camps spread over 8,000 acres in Cox's Bazar in Bangladesh.

From there, mother-of-two Janifa Begum told AFP: "I want to see whether the suffering we endured is reflected during the hearing."

"We want justice and peace," said the 37-year-old.

The Gambia, a Muslim-majority country in West Africa, brought the case in 2019 to the ICJ, which rules in disputes between states.

Under the Genocide Convention, any country can file a case at the ICJ against any other it believes is in breach of the treaty.

In December 2019, lawyers for the African nation presented evidence of what they said were "senseless killings... acts of barbarity that continue to shock our collective conscience".

In a landmark moment at the Peace Palace courthouse in The Hague , Nobel Peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi appeared herself to defend her country.

She dismissed Banjul's argument as a "misleading and incomplete factual picture" of what she said was an "internal armed conflict".

The former democracy icon warned that the genocide case at the ICJ risked reigniting the crisis, which she said was a response to attacks by Rohingya militants.

Myanmar has always maintained the crackdown by its armed forces, known as the Tatmadaw, was justified to root out Rohingya insurgents after a series of attacks left a dozen security personnel dead.

The ICJ initially sided with The Gambia, which had asked judges for "provisional measures" to halt the violence while the case was being considered.

The court in 2020 said Myanmar must take "all measures within its power" to halt any acts prohibited in the 1948 UN Genocide Convention.

These acts included "killing members of the group" and "deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part".

The United States officially declared that the violence amounted to genocide in 2022, three years after a UN team said Myanmar harboured "genocidal intent" towards the Rohingya.

The hearings, which wrap up on January 30, represent the heart of the case.

The court had already thrown out a 2022 Myanmar challenge to its jurisdiction, so judges believe they have the power to rule on the genocide issue.

A final decision could take months or even years and while the ICJ has no means of enforcing its decisions, a ruling in favour of The Gambia would heap more political pressure on Myanmar.

The summit in Japan's Nara City comes amid a growing diplomatic dispute between Beijing and Tokyo , and analysts expect Takaichi to highlight the stability of three-way ties between the United States, Japan and South Korea.

Lee has taken an approach of "pragmatic diplomacy" in seeking to balance ties with China and Japan, which could making it easier to reach pacts in business fields such as artificial intelligence (AI).

"Historically, disputes between China and Japan go on for a long time," said Yang Kee-ho, a Japanese studies professor at South Korea's Sungkonghoe University.

"It is very likely that the Sino-Japanese relationship will deteriorate throughout (Takaichi's) term in office."

Beijing was infuriated after Takaichi said in November a Chinese attack on democratically governed Taiwan could be deemed an existential threat to Japan, which could trigger a military response from Tokyo.

China regards Taiwan as part of its territory, a claim the island's government rejects.

In the face of the tension with China, Japan may seek to bolster diplomatic ties with South Korea, possibly through a strategic partnership, said Lee Chang-min, another Japan expert at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies.

"Not only has Japan's relationship with China deteriorated, the United States has also put a little distance from Japan in its (Taiwan) stance," said Lee.

South Korea's Lee and Takaichi may discuss the Japan-China dispute during their meeting, a security adviser to Lee, Wi Sung-lac said on Friday. However, South Korea is unlikely to take sides, analysts said.

"Our relationship with Japan is as important as our relationship with China," Lee told reporters during his state visit to China last week.

Perennial concerns, such as the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula and the fate of Japanese nationals abducted by neighbouring North Korea are also expected to figure on the agenda.

However, analysts said the areas offering the easiest scope for concrete agreements may lie in business, such as cooperation in artificial intelligence and chips, and easing travel for business executives between the countries.

The two leaders are expected to extensively discuss "areas directly related to people's livelihoods ... such as intellectual property and AI," Wi said.

The summit in Takaichi's home prefecture of Nara also offers Lee an opportunity to take up issues of regional cooperation, as part of a pledge to spur development in areas outside Seoul.

Ties are still plagued by longstanding tension on topics such as Japan's colonisation of Korea, including the treatment of Korean women forced to work in its wartime military brothels .

Such historical issues have moved from the centre stage of relations for now, analysts said, though some in South Korea still want them to stay high on the agenda.

Lee's two-day visit to Japan, shorter than his four-day trip to China, is part of "shuttle diplomacy" efforts that the two countries agreed last year.

Even if the trip has no tangible outcome, said Yang, "The most important thing is to keep the shuttle meetings going ... and eventually reaching concrete results."</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 05:56:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/2Q7HSYT5K5IJJIB25U7W5KY2RQ.jpg?auth=fd4135155c3f47f3b75f02c31edb28c679c182e21fbcf79de6f3bbf19811b32c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Le Pen's political fate hangs in the balance as French appeal begins</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/le-pens-political-fate-hangs-balance-french-appeal-begins-2026-01-12/</link><description>PARIS, Jan 12 (Reuters) - French far-right leader Marine Le Pen begins a crucial appeal in Paris this week that will determine whether she can run in the 2027 presidential election, after being barred from public office over a conviction for misusing EU funds.

Le Pen, the long-time leader of the far-right National Rally (RN), was seen as a likely frontrunner in the 2027 race until she was found guilty last year of misappropriating more than 4 million euros ($4.7 million) of EU funds and given a five-year ban from running for public office, effective immediately.

Le Pen appealed, as did the RN and 10 others found guilty of diverting European Parliament funds. The hearing begins on Tuesday and should end on February 12.

A ruling is expected before the summer, meaning her hopes of running in 2027 remain alive if her five-year ban is revoked or drastically curtailed.

If she cannot run, Le Pen has said her protege, 30-year-old RN party president Jordan Bardella, will do so in her stead.

U.S. President Donald Trump and senior members of his team voiced support for Le Pen after her conviction, and any move to stop her from running would likely be seized on by them in their campaign to portray European courts and officials as seeking to unfairly block far-right politicians from power.

Trump officials last year held internal discussions about sanctioning French prosecutors and judges involved in barring Le Pen, four sources told Reuters, although those talks no longer appear to be active.

The news, first reported by German magazine Der Spiegel, was denied by Under Secretary of State Sarah B. Rogers on X on Thursday, describing it as a "fake story".

A State Department spokesperson said: "We do not preview potential actions."

French government spokeswoman Maud Bregeon said on Thursday the government would remain vigilant to potential U.S. meddling after Peimane Ghaleh-Marzban, the president of the Paris judicial court, said any move against a French judge would "constitute an unacceptable and intolerable interference in the internal affairs of our country".

Over the past year, the U.S. has imposed sanctions against 11 International Criminal Court judges involved in cases against Israel.

Le Pen's lawyers, Rodolphe Bosselut and Sandra Chirac Kollarik, declined to comment ahead of the trial.

Following her conviction, Le Pen accused the judiciary of politically motivated targeting, echoing rhetoric used in the U.S.

"In the country of human rights, judges have implemented practices that we thought were reserved for authoritarian regimes," Le Pen told French TV channel TF1 at the time.

The judges explained in their ruling that they had decided to make the ban effective immediately "to avoid irreparable harm to democratic public order".

Opinion polls indicated that most French people supported the ruling.

The European Parliament's lawyer Patrick Maisonneuve said he hoped Le Pen and her co-defendants' convictions would be upheld, including more than 3 million euro awarded in damages to the European Parliament. The RN was also ordered to pay a 2 million euro fine, with half the amount suspended.

Judges said in last March's ruling that, between 2004 and 2016, Le Pen and others had used funds destined for work at the European Parliament to pay staff who were actually working for the party.

Le Pen said the way she and her co-defendants used the money was legitimate.

Le Pen's legal woes appear to have benefited Bardella. A poll last autumn found Bardella would win the presidency, no matter who his opponent was in the second round.

"French people have turned the page on Marine Le Pen," Stewart Chau, an analyst with Verian Group, told Reuters.

Trump said Iran called to negotiate its nuclear programme, which Israel and the U.S. bombed in a 12-day war in June. Trump has warned Iran's leaders that the United States would attack if security forces open fire on protesters.

U.S.-based rights group HRANA said it had verified the deaths of 490 protesters and 48 security personnel, with more than 10,600 people arrested.

Iran has not given an official toll and Reuters was unable to independently verify the tallies.

Trump was to meet with senior advisers on Tuesday to discuss options for Iran, a U.S. official told Reuters on Sunday. The Wall Street Journal had reported that options included military strikes, using secret cyber weapons, widening sanctions and providing online help to anti-government sources.

"The military is looking at it, and we're looking at some very strong options," Trump told reporters travelling on Air Force One on Sunday night.

Iranian Parliament Speaker Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf warned Washington against "a miscalculation."

"Let us be clear: in the case of an attack on Iran, the occupied territories (Israel) as well as all U.S. bases and ships will be our legitimate target," said Qalibaf, a former commander in Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards.

The protests began on December 28 in response to soaring prices , before turning against the clerical rulers who have governed since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.

Iranian authorities accused the U.S. and Israel of fomenting trouble and called for a nationwide rally on Monday to condemn "terrorist actions led by the United States and Israel," state media reported.

The flow of information from Iran has been hampered by an internet blackout since Thursday. Trump said on Sunday he would talk to Elon Musk about restoring internet access in Iran through his Starlink satellite service.

Footage posted on social media on Saturday from Tehran showed large crowds marching at night, clapping and chanting. The crowd "has no end nor beginning," a man is heard saying.

State TV showed dozens of body bags on the ground at the Tehran coroner's office, saying the dead were victims of events caused by "armed terrorists", as well as footage of loved ones gathered outside the Kahrizak Forensic Medical Centre in Tehran waiting to identify bodies.

Reuters verified the locations.

Authorities on Sunday declared three days of national mourning "in honour of martyrs killed in resistance against the United States and the Zionist regime," according to state media.

Three Israeli sources, who were present for Israeli security consultations over the weekend, said Israel was on a high-alert footing for the possibility of any U.S. intervention.

Israel and Iran fought a 12-day war in June 2025, which the United States briefly joined by attacking nuclear installations. Iran retaliated by firing missiles at Israel and an American air base in Qatar.

While Iranian authorities have weathered previous protests, the latest have unfolded with Tehran still recovering from last year's war and with its regional position weakened by blows to allies such as Lebanon's Hezbollah since the October 7, 2023 attacks against Israel .

Iran's unrest comes as Trump flexes U.S. muscles internationally, having ousted Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro , and discussing acquiring Greenland by purchase or force.

Alan Eyre, a former U.S. diplomat and Iran expert, thought it unlikely the protests would topple the establishment.

"I think it more likely that it puts these protests down eventually, but emerges from the process far weaker," he told Reuters, noting that Iran's elite still appeared cohesive and there was no organised opposition.

Trump, posting on social media on Saturday, said: "Iran is looking at FREEDOM, perhaps like never before. The USA stands ready to help!!!"</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 06:39:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/SRXM5IAH55PN7M2Y6MEVZYO4GM.jpg?auth=0fc36edbdc8446f8731959543a1afadb01cb1a49af1afe0eb7e3758ef554cb8d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>North Korea condemns multilateral sanction monitoring activity, KCNA says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/north-korea-condemns-multilateral-sanction-monitoring-activity-kcna-says-2026-01-12/</link><description>SEOUL, Jan 12 (Reuters) - North Korea has lashed out at a special sanctions monitoring team composed of multiple countries, calling its activities "illegal" and irrelevant to the United Nations, state media KCNA reported on Monday.

The Multilateral Sanctions Monitoring Team , opens new tab , composed of 11 countries including South Korea and the United States, is aimed at monitoring and reporting Pyongyang's violations and evasions of sanctions imposed by United Nations Security Council Resolutions.

A press statement by North Korea's permanent mission to the United Nations said that the United States was planning to hold a briefing session at U.N. headquarters, KCNA reported.

It said the body was "recklessly formed" outside the U.N. system and could not be recognised by the international community.

The mechanism under the new team was introduced after Russia in 2024 rejected the annual renewal of a U.N. panel of experts that had over the past 15 years overseen the implementation of sanctions aimed at curbing North Korea's nuclear and missile programs. China abstained from the vote.

In October 2025, the team issued , opens new tab a report on "deep connections" between U.N.-designated North Korean entities and Pyongyang's malicious cyber activities.

The allegation on North Korea's cyber threats is "a fabricated story based on imagination," KCNA cited the press statement as saying.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 06:39:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/OLQ4SG7XWRMB3PXB4JRZMDUXSQ.jpg?auth=dadaec6b0cdbe154e498e3eaa3794eb22a961690123935dc50fd0fdc267bb5a9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Live: Trump says Iran wants to 'negotiate' as US threatens military action after hundreds killed</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260112-live-trump-says-iran-wants-to-negotiate-after-us-threatens-military-intervention</link><description>Iran has summoned the British ambassador after protesters twice took down the Iranian flag at the Iranian embassy in London.

Iranian state television also said it complained about a “certain terrorist organisation that, under the guise of media, spread lies and promote violence and terrorism”. Britain is home to offices of the BBC’s Persian service and Iran International, both which long have been targeted by Iran.

Reza Pahlavi, the US-based son of Iran’s ousted shah, who has emerged as an anti-government figurehead, is prepared to return to his homeland and lead a democratic transition.

“I’m already planning on that,” he told Fox News on Sunday.

He later urged Iran’s security forces and government workers to join the demonstrators.

“Employees of state institutions, as well as members of the armed and security forces, have a choice: stand with the people and become allies of the nation, or choose complicity with the murderers of the people,” he said in a social media post.

The Norway-based NGO Iran Human Rights (IHR) has confirmed that at least 192 protesters have been killed so far, but fears that the actual toll could be much higher, perhaps in the thousands.

“Unverified reports indicate that at least several hundreds, and according to some sources, more than 2,000 people may have been killed,” IHR said.

The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, which has accurately reported on past unrest in Iran, said at least 544 people have been killed, including 496 protesters and 48 people from the security forces.

A video circulating on Sunday showed dozens of bodies accumulating outside a morgue south of Tehran. The footage, geolocated by AFP to Kahrizak, showed bodies wrapped in black bags, with what appeared to be grieving relatives searching for loved ones.

US President Donald Trump said Iran’s leadership has called him seeking “to negotiate” amid US threats to intervene militarily after reports that Tehran has killed hundreds of anti-government protesters.

“The leaders of Iran called” yesterday, Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One, adding that “a meeting is being set up... They want to negotiate”. He added, however, that “we may have to act before a meeting”.

The US-based Center for Human Rights in Iran (CHRI) has warned that “a massacre is unfolding”, saying it has received “eyewitness accounts and credible reports indicating that hundreds of protesters have been killed across Iran during the current internet shutdown”.

A former rebel leader who overthrew his predecessor in 1986, Museveni is now 81 and faces seven challengers. He says another four years in power - his seventh term - would allow him to "protect the gains" of Uganda's relative peace and stability.

The main opponent among his seven challengers is 43-year-old pop star Bobi Wine , who won 35% of the vote in the last election in 2021 and has energised young voters angry about widespread unemployment and corruption.

Museveni has changed the constitution twice to remove age and term limits, and his dominance of Ugandan institutions means there is little prospect of an upset in the East African country of 46 million, political analysts say.

But the election, and any unrest that accompanies the voting, will be an important test of his political strength at a critical moment, four years after the United States denounced the last election as neither free nor fair.

Uganda is a significant geopolitical player in East Africa and has troops deployed in Somalia, South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Equatorial Guinea as part of peacekeeping, anti-insurgency or military cooperation missions.

Economic growth, traditionally reliant on coffee, tourism and agro-processing, is expected to surge into double digits when crude oil production from fields run by France's TotalEnergies (TTEF.PA) , opens new tab and China's CNOOC (600938.SS) , opens new tab begins later this year.

Museveni is widely believed to favour his son, military chief Muhoozi Kainerugaba, to be his successor, though the president has denied grooming Kainerugaba for the role.

Kainerugaba, a prolific social media presence who often posts threats of violence against opposition leaders, has openly declared his desire to succeed his father.

But Kainerugaba's status as heir apparent is not accepted by all within the ruling National Resistance Movement and other party heavyweights are also positioning themselves for Museveni's eventual departure, analysts say.

As in previous elections, the campaign has been marred by violence, with security forces repeatedly using teargas and live bullets at Wine's campaign events. At least one person has been killed and hundreds arrested.

The government has defended the security forces' actions as a justified response to lawless conduct by opposition supporters.

Fears of unrest around the poll have been amplified by violent protests around Tanzania's elections in October, in which the United Nations estimates hundreds of people were killed. Anti-government protests over the past two years in Kenya, which also borders Uganda, have also been deadly.

"The possibility of a contagion effect in Uganda, inspired by its two neighbours, cannot be ruled out," said Kampala-based political analyst Timothy Kalyegira.

The first round of voting will be held alongside a parliamentary election. A presidential run-off will be held within a month if no candidate wins an outright majority.

Despite concerns about his human rights record, Museveni has won favour with Western countries by sending troops to regional hotspots such as Somalia and taking in millions of refugees.

More recently, he has curried favour with U.S. President Donald Trump by agreeing to take in U.S. deportees who are nationals of third countries.

Sarah Rusoke, a 26-year-old owner of a vehicle-washing business credited Museveni with building an "economy that allows us to start businesses and ... create our own footprints".

Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, has tapped into dissatisfaction among young people in a country where more than 70% of the population is under 30.

He has described the election as a "protest vote" against what he calls Museveni's "dictatorship", while pledging a wholesale clean-up of official corruption if he wins.

"I am inspired by his bravery," Simon Walusimbi, a 21-year-old mechanic, said of Wine. "He has put up with all the persecution the government has thrown at him."</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 07:29:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/MOX46BKJ2NNQDA6AF4T2TKONK4.jpg?auth=af541c819ea76be86c36640b5952eb592dffa283bd07f8979c9a1b7cf9529731&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Former Polish Minister Ziobro says he has been granted asylum in Hungary</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/former-polish-minister-ziobro-says-he-has-been-granted-asylum-hungary-2026-01-12/</link><description>WARSAW, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Former Polish Minister of Justice Zbigniew Ziobro said on Monday that he decided to use asylum granted to him by Hungarian government.

Trentini, a charity worker from Venice, was the most well-known among the more than 20 Italian nationals held in Venezuelan prisons.

Venezuela's leadership said on January 8 it was going to release a significant number of prisoners , including foreign nationals, as a gesture of goodwill.

The move, heeding demands from human rights groups, international bodies and opposition figures, came after the U.S. attacked Venezuela and captured its president, Nicolas Maduro .

"I welcome with joy and satisfaction the release of our compatriots Alberto Trentini and Mario Burlo, who are now safely at the Italian Embassy in Caracas," Meloni said in a statement.

Trentini was arrested in November 2024 with his Venezuelan driver Rafael Machado. He was working for Humanity &amp; Inclusion, an NGO that assists disabled people.

Burlo, a businessman from Turin, was also arrested in November 2024 and held in Trenitini's same prison, the El Rodeo I facility in Caracas.

Two other Italian nationals, journalist Biagio Pilieri and businessman Luigi Gasperin, were freed last week.

In her statement, Meloni thanked Venezuela's authorities, starting from interim President Delcy Rodriguez, "for the constructive cooperation demonstrated in recent days."</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 07:29:49 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/MJWYGIO7VVKIXDQWJJI4TST3YQ.jpg?auth=d14c4759c2b063b9c2a0e1ef74729684cfc023783940a1200ca1eeb655422bb9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China focuses anti-corruption drive on misconduct, highlighting former minister's conviction</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/china-focuses-anti-corruption-drive-misconduct-highlighting-former-ministers-2026-01-12/</link><description>BEIJING, Jan 12 (Reuters) - China will focus its corruption crackdown on preventing misconduct from escalating into graft, according to a state broadcaster documentary series that highlighted the crimes of a disgraced former minister.

The first episode of the CCTV-produced series titled "Unwavering in Our Resolve, Unyielding in Our Step" aired late Sunday, a day before China's top anti-graft watchdog, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) kicked off its three-day annual meeting.

The video heavily showcased former Agriculture Minister Tang Renjian who was convicted and sentenced for bribery last September, detailing how he enjoyed lavish banquets, entertainment and benefits for his family as some of the rural projects he was involved in were largely abandoned.

Tang appeared in the video clad in a plain black t-shirt, speaking remorsefully about his actions.

"Whether it was eating and drinking in violation of regulations or having fun, I was constantly thinking about such things at that time. In fact, in the end, it wears down your will," said Tang, who was given a suspended death sentence after admitting to receiving bribes worth more than 268 million yuan ($38 million).

The documentary also made examples of an official from central Henan province who died of excessive alcohol consumption after a banquet in March, held against the Communist Party rules, as well as a case of two grassroots officials who took advantage of vulnerabilities in China's pension fund system to commit embezzlement.

Last year, revised austerity regulations targeting Communist Party members and public sector workers banned lavish banquets, "white elephant" infrastructure projects, luxurious car fittings and ornamental plants in work meetings.

"We must cut off the chain of interests that spreads from misconduct to corruption and build a work chain to rectify corruption," a CCDI official, Wang Xinqi, said in the video.

Chinese President Xi Jinping last year called corruption " the biggest threat " to China's Communist Party in a signal that the ruling party would continue tackling the long-running problem entrenched in many strata of Chinese society.

Beijing has maintained a "high-pressure campaign" that has led to probes into high-profile individuals last year ranging from the former securities regulator chief Yi Huiman , ex-chairman of China Eastern Airlines Liu Shaoyong, to nine top military leaders including the country's No.2 general He Weidong .

"The Party's conduct is its image, affecting public support and even its very survival," the CCTV video said.

While political analysts say Museveni's stranglehold on Ugandan institutions makes victory for him and his National Resistance Movement (NRM) party a near certainty in presidential and parliamentary elections, how the vote unfolds could have important implications for the country's path forward.

Museveni, who came to power at the head of a rebellion in 1986, is aiming for a seventh term in office.

His main challenger is 43-year-old Bobi Wine, who finished runner-up in the 2021 election with 35% of the vote and is popular with young voters.

Other notable candidates are former military chief Mugisha Muntu, an anti-corruption campaigner, and Nandala Mafabi, a lawmaker who was previously the opposition leader in parliament.

Museveni has campaigned on a slogan of "protecting the gains", touting a record of relative peace and stability.

He has said he wants to make Uganda a middle-income country by boosting manufacturing, adding value to agricultural exports such as coffee and cotton and capitalising on the start of oil production expected later this year.

Wine has focused on restoring political freedoms, accusing Museveni of "40 years of dictatorship". The government has denied allegations of widespread human rights abuses.

Wine has also vowed to stamp out corruption, bolster youth employment and review production-sharing agreements with international oil firms if they do not favour Ugandan interests.

Successive elections in Uganda have been marred by violence and crackdowns on government opponents.

Security forces killed more than 50 people before the last election in 2021 while responding to protests triggered by Wine's arrest.

Hundreds of opposition supporters have been detained in the run-up to this year's vote, and at least one was killed at a campaign event.

Violent youth-led protests in neighbouring Kenya and Tanzania over the past two years have underscored the risks to the government of young people's frustration with political systems they see as corrupt and unresponsive to their needs.

Last week, Ugandan authorities said they were banning live broadcasts of riots, "unlawful processions" and other violent incidents.

Museveni's Uganda has been a strategic ally of Western countries, sending troops to fight Somalia's al Shabaab and other militant groups in the region. It also hosts the largest number of refugees in Africa.

The United States criticised the 2021 elections as neither free nor fair and imposed visa bans on some Ugandan officials, but Washington is unlikely to weigh in on this year's poll after U.S. diplomats were instructed in July not to comment on the integrity of foreign elections.

Museveni's government has curried favour with U.S. President Donald Trump's administration by entering an agreement in August to take in deportees from the U.S. who are nationals of third countries.

Uganda has expanded its economic ties with China and non-Western powers such as Russia and the United Arab Emirates in recent years. China National Offshore Oil Corporation [RIC:RIC:SASACY.UL] is one of the two lead partners in Uganda’s Lake Albert oil fields, which are due to start commercial crude production later this year.

There may be little suspense about the election outcome, but political observers will be watching the vote for what it says about a future presidential succession.

Museveni is widely thought to be lining up his son, military chief Muhoozi Kainerugaba, to succeed him.

Kainerugaba has fuelled the speculation by openly discussing his presidential ambitions, although Museveni has denied grooming his son to succeed him.

Political analysts say Kainerugaba's status as heir apparent is a source of controversy within the NRM and that other party heavyweights are also positioning themselves for Museveni's eventual departure from the scene.

One important metric will be Museveni's margin of victory. In 2021, he registered his lowest score in a presidential election with 58% of the vote. Any further slippage could weaken his political standing before a possible succession battle, analysts say.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 07:50:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/VTJTS67KOFOQDBN5GZV5QLDDR4.jpg?auth=77c03b1fac8625a4440ffc3ff7e1bf07ec03b2c5a7324304dfaf9578fd5be98e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Thailand's liberal opposition tops polls as election looms</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/thailands-liberal-opposition-tops-polls-election-looms-2026-01-12/</link><description>BANGKOK, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Thailand's progressive opposition People's Party and its leader are most favoured among voters for next month's general election , two surveys showed, underlining the stiff challenge facing Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul 's bid to stay in power.

Thailand's February 8 election could usher in a new round of turmoil in Thailand, and will be a showdown between the anti-establishment People's Party, Anutin's conservative Bhumjaithai and the former ruling party Pheu Thai , with bitter histories of betrayal that could complicate efforts to form a government.

The People's Party was backed by 34.2% of respondents in a January 6-9 poll by Suan Dusit released on Sunday, with Bhumjaithai second on 16.2% and the once-dominant Pheu Thai on 16.0%.

People's Party head and opposition leader Natthaphong Ruengpanyawut was the top choice for prime minister among 32% of the 2,682 people surveyed, followed by Pheu Thai's Yodchanan Wongsawat on 17.4% and Anutin third on 15.1%.

With huge support among young and urban Thais for its bold reform agenda, the People's Party's predecessor Move Forward won the most votes in the 2023 election but was blocked from power by lawmakers allied with the royalist military.

Move Forward was later dissolved by a court, one of a series of dramatic twists in an unrelenting cycle of upheaval that has seen three Thai premiers in less than three years.

Anutin called a snap election on December 12 after less than 100 days in office during a turbulent parliamentary session that could have led to a no-confidence vote and the collapse of his fragile minority government. It came also as Thailand's military was embroiled in a fierce three-week border conflict with Cambodia.

A poll released on Sunday by the National Institute for Development Administration also showed Natthaphong as the top choice for premier, backed by 24.7% of the people surveyed, followed closely by Anutin with 20.8% and Yodchanan fifth on 9.6%.

NIDA's January 5-8 survey of 2,500 people showed the People's Party as the most popular with about 30.5% of support, followed by Bhumjaithai at 22.3%.

The billionaire Shinawatra family's Pheu Thai was third, picked by 15.4% of respondents, indicating declining support for the populist outfit following the collapse of its government in September after Paetongtarn Shinawatra's sacking by a court and the jailing its influential founder, Thaksin Shinawatra .</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 09:35:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ENS4MLYHWZN77HUMW5TTLH7PVY.jpg?auth=bb0788efbac4f836bf04058e1162cdaf18685f0658562ac7386bd2de93713307&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump Greenland threat triggers search for shelter beyond gold, defence</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/trump-greenland-threat-triggers-search-shelter-beyond-gold-defence-2026-01-12/</link><description>LONDON/NEW YORK, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Investors have piled fresh bets on gold and European defence stocks in response to U.S. President Donald Trump's threats to take control of Greenland , fearing a geopolitical rift that could end NATO, shatter the global order and damage the dollar.

Although gains in both are expected to continue regardless of what happens to Greenland , investors face the dilemma of how to position for any longer-term fallout.

Trump wants to gain control of the Danish territory, through a purchase or even military means , while Greenland does not want to be part of the U.S., a stance supported by Europe and Canada .

While investors have previously largely ignored these aspirations, the U.S. seizure of Venezuela's Nicolas Maduro in a surprise military raid has suddenly made them more tangible.

For investors hoping for less risk after last year's tariff turmoil , the news makes for an uncomfortable start to 2026.

Trump has also weighed intervening in unrest in Iran , while the U.S. administration's threat to indict Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has reignited concerns about its independence.

Gold jumped more than 4% last week after Maduro's capture and hit a new record high on Monday. European defence stocks (.SXPARO) , opens new tab hit fresh all-time highs on Monday and last week posted their biggest weekly jump in over five years, with a 10% gain.

"You look at gold prices and they are just screaming that markets are concerned about geopolitical risk," Matthew Miskin, co-chief investment strategist at Manulife John Hancock Investments, said of the most recent rise in bullion.

Non-yielding gold is traditionally seen as a safe haven for investors during wider market uncertainty or volatility.

Many investors have already been calling for a large exposure to gold, including hedge fund manager Ray Dalio , who last year noted a big relative underperformance by U.S. stocks.

U.S. ambitions on acquiring Greenland could have far-reaching implications, not just for NATO but also efforts to end war in Ukraine and China's tensions with Japan and Taiwan.

If the U.S. forcibly took Greenland from fellow NATO member Denmark, it would likely not only mark the end of the military alliance but the wider balance of power, analysts say.

"It would call into question much more the global order that's essentially largely been established since Bretton Woods II, (or) the end of World War Two, when NATO was created," said Steve Kolano, CIO at Integrated Partners.

If Europe must rely less on the U.S. for its defence, it is no surprise that investors are buying European defence stocks, a sector that's more than tripled since Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine.

German tank maker Rheinmetall (RHMG.DE) , opens new tab rallied 19% last week, while Sweden's Saab (SAABb.ST) , opens new tab surged 22%.

"With the rhetoric about Greenland, the rally is being sustained," said Jeremie Peloso, chief European strategist at BCA Research.

Beyond buying gold and defence stocks, other trades are more difficult for investors to pick.

"Political (and) geopolitical risk is very hard to price and markets typically do a very poor job of it, given that these are big-impact, but low-probability events," said Idanna Appio, portfolio manager at First Eagle Investments, who does own some gold as a hedge against geopolitics.

"If you're positioning your portfolio for something that has a 1%, 5% chance of being realized, then you're already sort of saying: 'well, 95% of the time I'm going to be wrong.'"

That helps explain why there has been little broader impact, with world stocks at near record highs and Danish government bonds rallying alongside European peers.

Denmark's closely managed crown currency has been weakening, but rate differentials are a major factor and it is still close to the central rate at which it is pegged to the euro .

Things could change quickly if the U.S. took a military approach to Greenland, which Cresset Capital CIO Jack Ablin said, unlike Venezuela, "would be a big deal, sparking risk aversion in equities and (the) dollar ".

Traders reacted immediately when Moscow acted on its Ukraine threats, sparking major moves in oil, the euro and stocks.

"If the U.S. were to seize Greenland by force, or maybe not by force, but under some sort of coercion, ... you would have a rally towards Treasuries, you'd have a selloff in European government bonds, which quality investors wouldn't see as a haven," said Natixis' head U.S. economist Christopher Hodge.

Investors reckon that short-term, the dollar and Treasuries would benefit from a rush to safety.

However, a breakdown in transatlantic relations could see that U.S. pull fade and a return of worries about the dollar's status , which flickered around last April's tariff announcement.

It is too soon to see any signs of that shifting on the back of the U.S. action in Venezuela or its Greenland threats, with some saying it could prompt money to move out of the U.S.

"I remain nervous that actions that are seen as the U.S. breaking the rules of the road, could lead to shifts in asset allocation, bringing money back to Europe, back to Asia," said First Eagle's Appio.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 10:27:12 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7USQDTVMXNNQFA6MFBND5XLC7Q.jpg?auth=ceaaa8319a33dbadbb34899a7ddf29277759bc6c5a870ed1e69016c52053eaec&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Finnish police release Russia-linked ship held in cable sabotage case</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/finnish-police-release-russia-linked-ship-held-in-cable-sabotage-case-2026-01-12/</link><description>COPENHAGEN, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Finnish police said on Monday they had lifted the seizure of a ship which had been held on suspicion of sabotaging an undersea telecoms cable running from Helsinki to Estonia across the Gulf of Finland, although the investigation continues.

The Baltic Sea region is on high alert after a string of power cable, telecom link and gas pipeline outages since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, and NATO has boosted its military presence with frigates, aircraft and naval drones.

Finland seized the Fitburg cargo ship on December 31 while en route from Russia to Israel, and detained one crew member as part of the investigation. The ship will leave Finland's territorial waters on Monday, police said in a statement.

"Finnish and Estonian police have completed their work on board the vessel, and the seizure can therefore be lifted," head of the investigation at Finland's National Bureau of Investigation, Risto Lohi, said in the statement.

Some of the ship's crew remain under a travel ban, he added.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 10:27:19 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/P6USGJPGMRMLNCZUAZ7QZNWTFY.jpg?auth=99afd78878c4d34f1c7b57d3066dadab2ce983fdffce451bf6bed2b8f7b9b0d6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UK police chief says London getting safer despite Trump and others' remarks on crime wave</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-police-chief-says-london-getting-safer-despite-trump-others-remarks-crime-2026-01-12/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Britain's most senior police officer said on Monday that London's homicide rate had fallen to its lowest for more than a decade, showing the city was becoming safer, despite remarks by U.S. President Donald Trump and others on violent crime in the capital.

Mark Rowley, commissioner of London's Metropolitan Police, said the homicide rate in London was at an all-time low on a per capita basis and the city was safer than Los Angeles and New York as well as many other European capitals.

Rowley said serious violent crime in London was declining, according to police data and information from hospital admissions.

"Despite claims circulated online, including AI‑generated videos creating fictional violent scenarios, some commentators promote a narrative that suits them, regardless that the facts tell a very different story," he wrote in The Times newspaper.

Trump had suggested in November that there were "no-go" areas for police in London and accused Mayor Sadiq Khan of "letting crime go". The U.S. president has been critical of Khan for years.

"Look at the crime you have in London," Trump told British broadcaster GB News in November. "Today you have people being stabbed in the ass or worse."

In September, X owner Elon Musk told a large right-wing demonstration in the city via video link that "violence is coming".

Met police figures showed there were 97 homicides in London in 2025, an 11% reduction on 2024, and that violent incidents resulting in injury have fallen by a fifth since 2014.

"In London, the evidence is clear, we’re winning the battle against violent crime," Sadiq Khan wrote in the Guardian newspaper on Monday.

The figures covered violent crime, but many British people's perception of crime is the opposite given a jump in crimes such as shoplifting, which hit an all-time high last year.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 10:27:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/UYTXSDBMXFIE7PMH4FAZL43OKA.jpg?auth=a70cba43a48c8f03fb221c91e4191ed17ff9978bb8db8f8e0555a7f8d8c3b7fb&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Former French player, coach and commentator Courbis dies at 72</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sports/soccer/former-french-player-coach-commentator-courbis-dies-72-2026-01-12/</link><description>PARIS, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Former French footballer, coach and outspoken media commentator Rolland Courbis has died aged 72, his employer said on Monday.

Born in Marseille, Courbis dedicated his life to the game, ending up as one of the most recognisable voices in French sports media.

A former defender, he played for several clubs including Olympique de Marseille, AC Ajaccio, Olympique Lyonnais and AS Monaco before moving into management.

As a coach, he worked with clubs including Bordeaux, Montpellier, Rennes, Ajaccio and Marseille, which he led to the UEFA Cup final in 1999.

French radio station RMC announced Courbis' death without giving more details.

"His passion was expressed through his emblematic Marseille accent and a very direct closeness with listeners — a freedom of tone that preserved the language of supporters while sharing their questions and emotions," RMC said in tribute.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 10:28:08 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/F4BLA2J3BBMMHO2LTOPRLCXAAE.jpg?auth=1c5cad37b665d3c9919b318f8dabf06a028eeea109c5a29fe579c9cd05257b4e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Bulgaria's biggest party rejects offer to form new government, snap election likely</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/bulgarias-biggest-party-rejects-offer-form-new-government-snap-election-likely-2026-01-12/</link><description>SOFIA, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Bulgaria's biggest parliamentary grouping, the centre-right GERB-SDS, declined a request on Monday from the president to try and form a new government, increasing the likelihood of a snap election in the European Union's poorest member state.

Prime Minister Rosen Zhelyazkov's coalition government, backed by GERB-SDS, resigned last month after weeks of street protests against state corruption and a new budget that would have increased some taxes.

In line with the constitution, Bulgarian President Rumen Radev on Monday formally asked Zhelyazkov to try and build a new coalition, the local BTA news agency reported. However, Zhelyazkov immediately returned the mandate, it said, as he lacks enough support in parliament to build a stable majority.

Radev is now expected to offer the second largest grouping, the reformist PP-DB, a chance to govern but it is also likely to turn down the offer. Radev will then hand the mandate to a party of his choice and if no grouping can secure a parliamentary majority, he will dissolve the assembly and call a snap election, Bulgaria's eighth in just four years.

Despite such uncertainty, Bulgaria joined the euro zone on January 1 as scheduled. It needs political stability, however, to speed up the uptake of EU funds into its creaking infrastructure, to encourage foreign investment and to root out endemic state corruption.

The GERB-SDS coalition won the last election in October 2024 but only took power in January 2025 after months of talks and needed the support of other parties in the divided legislature.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 10:52:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US ramps up pressure on Cuba after Maduro capture</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/us-ramps-up-pressure-on-cuba-after-maduro-capture</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 10:55:08 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/b66a400a-ef7b-11f0-a637-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/063-2255277374.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Landmark genocide case against Myanmar to be heard by UN top court</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/landmark-genocide-case-against-myanmar-to-be-heard-by-un-top-court</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 10:55:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/069373b8-ef9e-11f0-ac48-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260112-103801-103953-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Son of Iran's shah remains divisive figure despite presenting as rallying figure</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/son-of-iran-s-shah-remains-divisive-figure-despite-presenting-as-rallying-figure</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 10:55:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/f36ccbf2-ef77-11f0-867e-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-11T192042Z-1032452122-RC26ZIAH78XA-RTRMADP-3-IRAN-ECONOMY-PROTESTS-BRITAIN.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuela says it has released 'large' number of political prisoners</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/venezuela-says-it-has-released-large-number-of-political-prisoners</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 10:55:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/d0d01166-ef9b-11f0-b6b3-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260112-101909-102042-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>What we know about the deadly anti-regime protests in Iran</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260112-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-unrest-in-iran</link><description>Nationwide protests in Iran sparked by the Islamic Republic’s ailing economy are putting new pressure on its theocracy as it has shut down the internet and telephone networks.

Tehran is still reeling from a 12-day war launched by Israel in June that saw the United States bomb nuclear sites in Iran. Economic pressure, which has intensified since September when the United Nations reimposed sanctions on the country over its atomic programme, has sent Iran’s rial currency into a free fall, now trading at over 1.4 million to $1.

Meanwhile, Iran’s self-described “ Axis of Resistance ” — a coalition of countries and militant groups backed by Tehran — has been decimated since the start of the Israel-Hamas war in 2023.

A threat by President Donald Trump warning Iran that if Tehran “violently kills peaceful protesters”, the US “will come to their rescue”, has taken on new meaning after American troops captured Venezuela’s Nicolas Maduro , a longtime ally of Tehran.

“We’re watching it very closely,” Trump has warned. “If they start killing people like they have in the past, I think they’re going to get hit very hard by the United States.”

More than 500 protests have taken place across all of Iran’s 31 provinces, the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency reported early Monday. The death toll had reached at least 544, it said, with more than 10,600 arrests. The group relies on an activist network inside of Iran for its reporting and has been accurate in past unrest.

The Iranian government has not offered overall casualty figures for the demonstrations. Foreign media have been unable to independently assess the toll, given that internet and international phone calls are now blocked in Iran.

Understanding the scale of the protests has been difficult. Iranian state media has provided little information about the demonstrations. Online videos offer only brief, shaky glimpses of people in the streets or the sound of gunfire. Journalists in general in Iran also face limits on reporting such as requiring permission to travel around the country, as well as the threat of harassment or arrest by authorities. The internet shutdown has further complicated the situation.

But the protests do not appear to be stopping, even after Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said “rioters must be put in their place”.

The collapse of the rial has led to a widening economic crisis in Iran. Prices are up on meat, rice and other staples of the Iranian dinner table. The nation has been struggling with an annual inflation rate of some 40 percent.

In December, Iran introduced a new pricing tier for its nationally subsidised gasoline, raising the price of some of the world’s cheapest gas and further pressuring the population. Tehran may seek steeper price increases in the future, as the government now will review prices every three months. Meanwhile, food prices are expected to spike after Iran’s Central Bank in recent days ended a preferential, subsidised dollar-rial exchange rate for all products except medicine and wheat.

The protests began in late December with merchants in Tehran before spreading. While initially focused on economic issues, the demonstrations soon saw protesters chanting anti-government statements as well. Anger has been simmering over the years, particularly after the 2022 death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody that triggered nationwide demonstrations.

Some have chanted in support of Iran’s exiled Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi, who called for protests Thursday and Friday night.

Iran’s “Axis of Resistance”, which grew in prominence in the years after the 2003 US-led invasion and subsequent occupation of Iraq, is reeling.

Israel has crushed Hamas in the devastating war in the Gaza Strip. Hezbollah , the Shiite militant group in Lebanon, has seen its top leadership killed by Israel and has been struggling since. A lightning offensive in December 2024 overthrew Iran’s longtime stalwart ally and client in Syria, former president Bashar al Assad, after years of war there. Yemen’s Iranian-backed Houthi rebels also have been pounded by Israeli and US airstrikes.

China meanwhile has remained a major buyer of Iranian crude oil, but hasn’t provided overt military support. Neither has Russia , which has relied on Iranian drones in its war on Ukraine .

Iran has insisted for decades that its nuclear programme is peaceful. However, its officials have increasingly threatened to pursue a nuclear weapon. Iran had been enriching uranium to near weapons-grade levels before the US attack in June, making it the only country in the world without a nuclear weapons programme to do so.

Tehran also increasingly cut back its cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ), the UN’s nuclear watchdog, as tensions increased over its nuclear programme in recent years. The IAEA’s director-general has warned Iran could build as many as 10 nuclear bombs, should it decide to weaponise its programme.

US intelligence agencies have assessed that Iran has yet to begin a weapons programme, but has “undertaken activities that better position it to produce a nuclear device, if it chooses to do so”.

Iran recently said it was no longer enriching uranium at any site in the country, trying to signal to the West that it remains open to potential negotiations over its atomic programme to ease sanctions. But there’s been no significant talks in the months since the June war.

Iran decades ago was one of the United States’ top allies in the Middle East under Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who purchased American military weapons and allowed CIA technicians to run secret listening posts monitoring the neighbouring Soviet Union. The CIA fomented a 1953 coup that cemented the shah’s rule.

But in January 1979, the shah fled Iran as mass demonstrations swelled against his rule. Then came the Islamic Revolution led by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, which created Iran’s theocratic government.

Later that year, university students overran the US Embassy in Tehran, seeking the shah’s extradition and sparking the 444-day hostage crisis that saw diplomatic relations between Iran and the US severed.

During the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s, the US backed Saddam Hussein . During that conflict, the US launched a one-day assault that crippled Iran at sea as part of the so-called “Tanker War”, and later shot down an Iranian commercial airliner that the US military said it mistook for a warplane.

Iran and the US have seesawed between enmity and grudging diplomacy in the years since. Relations peaked with the 2015 nuclear deal, which saw Iran greatly limit its programme in exchange for the lifting of sanctions. But Trump unilaterally withdrew America from the accord in 2018, sparking tensions in the Mideast that intensified after Hamas’s October 7, 2023, attack on Israel.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 10:55:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/7ecfa6aa-ed62-11f0-a0df-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26009447003699.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Syrian government forces take control of Aleppo after clashes with Kurdish fighters</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/syrian-government-forces-take-control-of-aleppo-after-clashes-with-kurdish-fighters</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 10:55:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/bd43e088-ef9f-11f0-82cc-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/000-92CV8KJ.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Number of prisoners released in Venezuela rises to 41, says rights group</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/number-prisoners-released-venezuela-rises-41-says-rights-group-2026-01-12/</link><description>Jan 12 (Reuters) - The number of prisoners released in Venezuela has risen to 41, local rights group Foro Penal said on Monday, after 24 people were freed overnight.

The meeting, listed among the pope's appointments for Monday in a daily Vatican statement, had not been included in an earlier advisory to the press about Leo's planned schedule for the day.

Leo, the first U.S. pope, has called for Venezuela to remain an independent country after the capture by U.S. forces of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on the orders of President Donald Trump.

In a major foreign policy speech on Friday, the pope decried the use of military force as a means of achieving diplomatic goals and called for human rights to be protected in Venezuela.

Machado a former National Assembly member, was barred from running in Venezuela’s 2024 general election by authorities aligned with Maduro.

She backed a stand‑in candidate who was widely considered to have won the vote, although Maduro claimed victory. Ballot audits by independent observers showed irregularities in the official results.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 11:42:56 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/6E52F3UYSRITBNSH74RQRIXLOQ.jpg?auth=fdf504d63c102f75b309abae2b938c0ffd3250d1b91032420da82a0b6295b91b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Norway gives $400 million to Ukraine for energy sector, administration</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/norway-gives-400-million-ukraine-energy-sector-administration-2026-01-12/</link><description>Jan 12 (Reuters) - Norway said on Monday it was providing 340 million euros ($397 million) in emergency funding to support Ukraine's energy sector and help the government maintain critical services, as part of the Nordic country's wider aid to the war-torn nation in 2026.

Russian attacks have long targeted Ukraine's energy network and have become more intense in recent months at a time of plunging winter temperatures.

The Norwegian parliament late last year allocated 85 billion crowns ($8.45 billion) for aid to Ukraine, with 70 billion going to military support and 15 billion to civilian and humanitarian aid.

The civilian package allotted 4.8 billion crowns to energy security and supply, followed by 4 billion for budget support and reconstruction and 3.5 billion for humanitarian assistance, with additional funding designated for business development, civil society and governance reforms, and support for Moldova.

European countries are backing Ukraine in its defence against Russia, with EU leaders recently agreeing to a 90 billion euro loan.

“Due to public strikes, the Musee du Louvre is closed today,” the museum said in a message posted on its website , informing disappointed tourists and art lovers that their entry tickets would be automatically reimbursed.

The museum closed for a full day last month and has been only partially open on several other days since.

Nearly three months after a daylight heist , which has heaped pressure on Louvre bosses, staff are calling for more recruitment and better maintenance of the vast former royal palace.

Questions continue to swirl since the October 19 break-in over whether it was avoidable and why thieves were able to steal crown jewels worth more than $100 million.

Two intruders used a truck-mounted extendable platform to access a gallery containing the jewels, slicing through a glass door with disk-cutters in front of startled visitors before stealing eight priceless items.

As well as the robbery, two other recent incidents have highlighted maintenance problems inside the building, which chief architect François Chatillon has described as “not in a good state”.

A water leak in November damaged hundreds of books and manuscripts in the Egyptian department, while management had to shut a gallery housing ancient Greek ceramics in October because ceiling beams above it risked giving way.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 11:43:48 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/4e3b473c-efa7-11f0-b652-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25349355343444.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israeli-backed group kills a senior Hamas police officer in Gaza, threatens more attacks</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-backed-group-kills-senior-hamas-police-officer-gaza-threatens-more-2026-01-12/</link><description>CAIRO, Jan 12 (Reuters) - An Israeli-backed Palestinian militia said on Monday it had killed a senior Hamas police officer in the southern Gaza Strip, an incident which Hamas blamed on "Israeli collaborators".

A statement from the Hamas-run interior ministry said gunmen opened fire from a passing car, killing Mahmoud Al-Astal, head of the criminal police unit in Khan Younis, in the south of the enclave. It described the attackers as "collaborators with the occupation".

Hussam Al-Astal, leader of an anti-Hamas group based in an area under Israeli control east of Khan Younis, claimed responsibility for the killing in a video he posted on his Facebook page. The surname he shares with the dead man, Al-Astal, is common in that part of Gaza.

"To those who work with Hamas, your destiny is to be killed. Death is coming to you," he said, dressed in a black military-style uniform and clutching an assault rifle.

Reuters could not independently verify the circumstances of the attack. An Israeli military official said the army was not aware of any operations in the area.

The emergence of armed anti-Hamas groups, though still small and localised, has added pressure on the Islamists and could complicate efforts to stabilise and unify a divided Gaza, shattered by two years of war.

These groups remain unpopular among the local population as they operate in areas under Israeli control, although they publicly deny they take Israeli orders. Hamas has held public executions of people it accuses of collaboration.

Under a ceasefire in place since October, Israel has withdrawn from nearly half of the Gaza Strip, but its troops remain in control of the other half, largely a wasteland where virtually all buildings have been levelled.

Nearly all of the territory's two million people now live in Hamas-held areas, mostly in makeshift tents or damaged buildings, where the group has been reasserting its grip. Four Hamas sources said it continues to command thousands of fighters despite suffering heavy losses during the war.

Israel has been allowing rivals of Hamas to operate in areas it controls. In later phases, U.S. President Donald Trump's plan for Gaza calls for Israel to withdraw further and for Hamas to yield power to an internationally backed administration, but there has so far been no progress towards those steps.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged Israeli backing for anti-Hamas groups in June, saying Israel had "activated" clans, but has given few details since then.

The ceasefire has ended major combat in Gaza over the past three months, but both sides have accused the other of regular violations. More than 440 Palestinians and three Israeli soldiers have been killed since the truce took effect.

Gaza health authorities said on Monday Israeli drone fire killed at least three people near the centre of Khan Younis.

The Israeli military did not have an immediate comment on the drone incident.

The war erupted on October 7, 2023 when Gazan militants invaded Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking some 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.

Israel’s subsequent military assault on Gaza has killed more than 71,000 Palestinians, according to the enclave’s health ministry, and led to accusations of genocide and war crimes, which Israel denies.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 12:50:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/OOH2FTVWPVJCFC6LCI2GBUK2I4.jpg?auth=c469e35e61abe68d9558124374332e2c6feef558454281794e7708e95d779d6b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UK regulator launches investigation into X over Grok sexualised imagery</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/uk-regulator-launches-investigation-into-x-over-grok-sexualised-imagery-2026-01-12/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Britain's media regulator launched an investigation into Elon Musk's X on Monday to determine whether sexually intimate deepfakes produced by its Grok AI chatbot violated its duty to protect people in the UK from content that could be illegal.

"There have been deeply concerning reports of the Grok AI chatbot account on X being used to create and share undressed images of people – which may amount to intimate image abuse or pornography – and sexualised images of children that may amount to child sexual abuse material," Ofcom said in a statement.

The regulator is under pressure to act after Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the images produced by Grok were "disgusting" and "unlawful".

Musk's X had to "get a grip" on Grok, Starmer said on Thursday, adding that Ofcom had the government's full support to take action.

Creating or sharing non-consensual intimate images or child sexual abuse material, including AI-generated sexual imagery, is illegal in Britain.

Additionally, tech platforms must prevent British users from encountering illegal content and remove it once they become aware of it.

X has faced condemnation in other countries over the feature, which can produce images of women and minors in skimpy clothing.

French officials have reported X to prosecutors and regulators, calling the content " manifestly illegal ," while Indian authorities have also demanded explanations.

X has restricted the feature to paying users . It said last week that it removes all illegal content on the platform and permanently suspends accounts involved.

"Anyone using or prompting Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content," it said.

Asked about the subject recently, xAI told Reuters: "Legacy Media Lies."

Ofcom will investigate whether X failed to assess the risk that people in Britain would see illegal content, and whether it considered the risk to children.

Ofcom said in the most serious cases of non-compliance it could ask a court to require "payment providers or advertisers to withdraw their services from a platform", or make internet service providers block access to a site in Britain.

X did not immediately reply to a request to comment on the Ofcom investigation.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 12:50:31 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/VU3G4YSWZ5IXNEEIEXVW57Q4PY.jpg?auth=2447f678233cef3c084f4db8550947448bcf93a719c4d2a91806742d3df320ac&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>France launches recruitment campaign for new voluntary military service</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/france-launches-recruitment-campaign-new-voluntary-military-service-2026-01-12/</link><description>PARIS, Jan 12 (Reuters) - France said on Monday it was launching a campaign to recruit thousands of young people for a new 10-month voluntary national military service, with the first participants starting their service in September.

The scheme , unveiled by President Emmanuel Macron in November, is open to all young French citizens aged 18-25 eager "to play a part in the nation's capacity to resist in an uncertain environment," the chief of staff of the armed forces, General Fabien Mandon told a press conference.

The move is part of a broader shift across Europe, where nations that for decades have had U.S. security guarantees are fretting about President Donald Trump's shifting priorities and what they see as Russia's aggressive posture.

From September, 3,000 young people will join either the army, navy or air force for missions on French soil, rising to 4,000 in 2027 and 10,000 annually by 2030.

They will receive about 800 euros ($935) a month and conduct tasks ranging from assistance during natural disasters to surveillance against terrorism, and serve in jobs ranging from drone operator to baker, mechanic, electrician and member of medical staff.

After the program, participants could integrate into civilian life, become a reservist, or stay in the armed forces, reflecting the "long-term evolution of the army toward a hybrid model," Defense Minister Catherine Vautrin told the same news conference.

The scheme is expected to cost 150 million euros in 2026 and a total of 2.3 billion euros between 2026-2030, she said.

Prosecutors for the Valais canton initially ordered the detention of Jacques Moretti on Friday after a lengthy hearing with him and his wife Jessica, pending a decision on whether it was warranted.

The couple have expressed their grief over the fire and said they would cooperate fully with the investigation.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 12:50:47 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7XLGTPIENRP4LBQGA76XERVLUE.jpg?auth=eaf695f31d2a1feb85b6a41e7a6964d78528947464c181265d943bdd2aed2e2b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>European commissioner says U.S. military takeover of Greenland would be end of NATO</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/european-commissioner-says-us-military-takeover-greenland-would-be-end-nato-2026-01-12/</link><description>SALEN, Sweden, Jan 12 (Reuters) - It would be the end of NATO if the U.S. took Greenland by force and European Union member states are under obligation to come to Denmark's assistance if it was faced with military aggression, the European Commissioner for Defence and Space said on Monday.

Trump has said the U.S. must own Greenland , an autonomous

part of the Kingdom of Denmark, to prevent Russia or China

occupying the strategically located and minerals-rich Arctic territory, arguing U.S. military presence there was not

enough.

Both Greenland and Denmark have said that Greenland is not for sale but Trump has not ruled out taking it by force.

"I agree with the Danish Prime Minister that it will be the end of NATO, but also among people it will be also very, very negative," Commissioner Andrius Kubilius told Reuters at a security conference in Sweden.

Kubilius also said that the European Union Treaty article 42.7 obliged member states to come to Denmark's assistance if faced with military aggression.

"It will depend on very much on Denmark, how they will react, what will be their position, but definitely there is such an obligation of member sates to come for mutual assistance if another member state is facing military aggression," he said.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 12:50:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CTMJUW4WEFN7HH5XE33G2NKIEQ.jpg?auth=2a363ba77c84f3cdd739f0ca716617758d13ba12d24fda0d598046b37faf2700&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>South Korea president says Japan-China dispute not desirable for regional peace</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/south-korea-president-says-japan-china-dispute-not-desirable-regional-peace-2026-01-12/</link><description>SEOUL, Jan 12 (Reuters) - South Korean President Lee Jae Myung said that a dispute between China and Japan was not desirable for regional peace, adding that Seoul would not meddle in the ongoing row.

Grok is facing growing international backlash for allowing users to create and share sexualised pictures of women and children using simple text prompts.

Ofcom described the reports as "deeply concerning".

It said in a statement that the undressed images of people "may amount to intimate image abuse or pornography – and sexualised images of children ... may amount to child sexual abuse material".

Britain's Technology Minister Liz Kendal welcomed the probe.

“It is vital that Ofcom complete this investigation swiftly because the public – and ‍most importantly the victims – ​will not accept any delay,” she said in ‌a statement.

“The content created and ‍shared using Grok in recent days has been deeply disturbing,” adding that she would ‍update parliament later on ‌Monday.

Contacted by AFP, X did not immediately respond.

Ofcom said it had contacted X on January 5, asking it to explain the steps it has taken to protect UK users.

Without sharing details of the exchange, the regulator said that X did respond within the given timeframe.

The formal investigation will determine whether X "failed to comply with its legal obligations".

Under Britain's Online Safety Act, which came into force in July, websites, social media and video-sharing platforms hosting potentially harmful content are required to implement strict age verification through tools such as facial imagery or credit card checks.

It is also illegal for media sites to create or share non-consensual intimate images or child sexual abuse material, including sexual deepfakes created with AI.

Ofcom has the power to impose fines of 10 percent of worldwide revenue for breaches of these rules.

Grok appeared to deflect the international criticism with a new monetisation policy at the end of last week, posting on X that the tool was now "limited to paying subscribers", alongside a link to a premium subscription.

UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has condemned the move as an affront to victims and "not a solution".

On Saturday, Indonesia became the first country to deny all access to the tool, with Malaysia following suit on Sunday.

The European Commission has said it is reviewing complaints about Grok.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 12:51:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/6499d4b8-ed49-11f0-b042-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/de7789c4b51d7945de475c9caf06632eef38256c.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'International influence' over 2026 edition of the Golden Globes</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/international-influence-over-2026-edition-of-the-golden-globes</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 12:51:52 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/abe51946-efaa-11f0-8b3d-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260112-120813-121218-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>There is a 'range of options' for US intervention in Iran as tension grows</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/there-is-a-range-of-options-for-us-intervention-in-iran-as-tension-grows</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 12:52:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/bda1a6e6-efa9-11f0-8c13-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260112-120116-120720-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>School resumes in tents under shadow of Gaza's 'yellow line'</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/school-resumes-tents-under-shadow-gazas-yellow-line-2026-01-12/</link><description>GAZA/CAIRO Jan 12 (Reuters) - She spends her lessons in the wintry cold on the floor of a crowded tent, her teacher interrupted by regular gunfire and explosions from Israeli-controlled territory less than 1,000 metres away. But Toulin Al-Hindi, 7, is grateful to be in school at last after more than two years of war.

She is one of some 400 children attending lessons at the makeshift North Educational School, set up in blue plastic tents in the ruins of northern Gaza's community of Beit Lahiya, within eyesight of the "yellow line" held by Israeli forces.

During a recent lesson, more than a dozen girls sat on the floor in two rows in one small tent, keeping warm in sweaters and puffy jackets, their notebooks out in front of them on a handful of slatted wooden crates. They cheerfully sang out numbers while their teacher drew shapes on a chalkboard.

"Although we do not sit on chairs, thank God we started attending school," said Toulin. "During the war, there were no schools, and we were bored."

Her mother, Yasmine Al-Ajouri, says she worries from the moment her daughter leaves for school until she comes home.

"Take care, take cover next to a wall, be quick on the road," Yasmine said she tells her daughter.

Under the ceasefire in place since October, Israel still occupies more than half of the Gaza Strip and bars civilians from other areas. Nearly all buildings in the Israeli-controlled sector have been levelled and residents driven out.

That leaves virtually the entire population of more than 2 million people confined to around a third of Gaza's territory, mostly in makeshift tents and damaged buildings, where life has resumed under control of an administration led by Hamas.

Although major fighting has been halted, Israel has routinely opened fire at Palestinians it accuses of approaching the yellow line, saying it aims to eliminate threats to troops.

More than 440 Palestinians have been killed since the October deal came into effect, while militants have killed three Israeli soldiers. Palestinians say Israeli forces have been moving some of the yellow concrete markers westward, encroaching into unoccupied territory. Israel denies this.

Staff at Toulin's school said they hear fire daily.

"We taught the children that as soon as we hear fire...to lie down. This is not safe, and safety depends on God, but this is what we can do," said Yara Abu Ghalweh, a school supervisor.

Israel’s assault on Gaza has killed more than 71,000 people, according to the enclave’s health ministry. The war was triggered by a Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on October 7, 2023, which killed about 1,200 people, according to Israeli tallies.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 13:44:04 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/RYFCSHA7OBKQRB75NODNMQJ5KQ.jpg?auth=713176fb6ba89068aff46e9635e6a5eb53eb1f36956d126689951df0338e4770&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Spain to tighten rental rules with room rent caps, seasonal lease curbs</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/spain-tighten-rental-rules-with-room-rent-caps-seasonal-lease-curbs-2026-01-12/</link><description>MADRID, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Spain's leftist government will further tighten rental rules and restrict medium-term leases to contain soaring rents and prevent price abuse under a decree to be approved in the coming weeks, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said on Monday.

One of the world's most-visited countries by tourists, Spain suffers from a severe housing shortage exacerbated by a tourism boom, and has faced mass protests undefined in the past years over soaring housing costs.

"We will continue intervening in the rental market," Sanchez said at an event marking the start of works at Spain's largest public housing project.

The long-delayed Campamento project will transform a former military site in western Madrid into 10,700 state-owned, affordable homes.

Sanchez said the decree would include a 100% personal income tax rebate for landlords who renew leases without raising rents.

It would also set a limit for combined room rents at the level of a full apartment to rein in room rentals and apply rent controls in designated high-pressure areas.

In addition, the government would also tighten conditions for seasonal rental contracts and introduce sanctions for their use as a substitute for long-term leases, Sanchez said.

Homeowners' associations and experts say that the current regulations favour short-term leases over long-term rentals.

However, most housing measures must be enforced by the regions, many of which are run by the opposition that may be reluctant to comply.

Still, wealthy northeastern Catalonia has adopted ceilings for seasonal and room rents, and several cities, including Madrid, have curbed tourist apartment rentals.

Average Spanish rents have doubled over the past decade, far outpacing salary growth.

According to the Bank of Spain, there is a housing deficit of 500,000 homes, and official data show that only about 120,000 new homes are built in Spain every year - a sixth of the levels before the 2008 financial crisis.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 13:44:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KJX45ADGTNKMRMCONRJT7KZZCI.jpg?auth=a2d1f5e278059c980ee3c72a305f752d9aaac606cf029c1b4e0a8a89b6d935ed&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Spanish police seize record 10 tons of cocaine hidden in cargo of salt</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/spanish-police-seize-record-10-tons-cocaine-hidden-cargo-salt-2026-01-12/</link><description>MADRID, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Spanish police have made their largest-ever cocaine seizure on the high seas, intercepting a vessel carrying almost 10 metric tons of the drug concealed in a shipment of salt en route from Brazil to Europe, police said on Monday.

The operation led to the arrest of 13 people on board. The vessel, which ended up running out of fuel, had to be towed to port by coastguards in Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Canary Islands, police said in a statement.

Officers recovered 294 bales of the drug and a handgun.

Footage showed police officers using shovels and digging with their hands to remove cocaine from beneath the salt, and then forming a line to move the bales to the pier.

The international effort also involved the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, Brazil's Federal Police, Britain's National Crime Agency and authorities in France and Portugal.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 13:44:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Sweden urges EU ban on support to Russian oil, gas-shipping fleet</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/sweden-urges-eu-ban-support-russian-oil-gas-shipping-fleet-2026-01-12/</link><description>STOCKHOLM, Jan 12 (Reuters) - The European Union should ban companies from providing any support to Moscow's oil and gas-shipping fleet, introduce sanctions against Russian fertilisers and stop luxury goods exports to Russia, Sweden's foreign minister said on Monday.

The 27-nation bloc is currently preparing its 20th sanctions package aimed at punishing Russia for its war in Ukraine . Previous sanctions have focused heavily on hobbling its oil and gas sector, the Kremlin's primary source of revenues.

"The pressure on Russia has to be increased," Foreign Minister Maria Malmer Stenergard said at an annual security conference in the town of Salen, in western Sweden.

Stenergard said the EU's next sanctions package should include a total ban on European companies providing services to Russian ships carrying oil, gas and coal.

"No transport, no reloading of goods between ships, no insurance and no port repairs," she said.

The EU should also impose sanctions on exports of Russian fertiliser , Russia's third-biggest export to the EU.

The EU imposed tariffs on fertiliser imports from Russia in July last year. Russia produces more than 20% of the world's fertiliser and supplies around 25% of the EU's fertiliser imports.

"And we want to put an end to exports of luxury goods from the EU to Russia," she said. "It irritates me that rich Russian consumers can wear expensive Italian clothing brands and drink fine French wines."

The EU has imposed 19 packages of sanctions against Russia since its invasion of Ukraine in 2022.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 13:44:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4UY7LSNVXVMPDBNFQR4T23OONE.jpg?auth=90f9facf8ff89b2f6ac4e4aed66d878ef57565b5d38ab413e7fa2623974499b8&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuela says it has released 116 prisoners</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/venezuela-says-it-has-released-116-prisoners-2026-01-12/</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 13:44:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Spanish police seize record 10 tons of cocaine hidden in cargo of salt</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/spanish-police-seize-record-10-tons-cocaine-hidden-cargo-salt-2026-01-12/</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 13:44:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Sweden urges EU ban on support to Russian oil, gas-shipping fleet</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/sweden-urges-eu-ban-support-russian-oil-gas-shipping-fleet-2026-01-12/</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 13:44:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Venezuela says it has released 116 prisoners</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/venezuela-says-it-has-released-116-prisoners-2026-01-12/</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 13:44:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Co-owner of Swiss bar that caught fire to remain in preventive detention for three months</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260112-co-owner-of-swiss-bar-that-caught-fire-to-remain-in-preventive-detention-for-three-months</link><description>The court said in a statement ‍that Jacques Moretti ​will be held for a provisional period of ‌three months, but this could ‍be reviewed if measures are taken to counter the risk of flight, such as ‍demanding a security deposit.

Moretti was taken into custody after he and his wife, Jessica, who co-owned Le Constellation bar in the ski resort of Crans-Montana, were interviewed by prosecutors in Switzerland 's southwestern Wallis canton on Friday.

The Morettis are under criminal investigation, facing charges of manslaughter by negligence, bodily harm by negligence and arson by negligence.

The fire broke out early on New Year's Day when the bar was filled with partygoers, killing 40 people and injuring 116, most of them teenagers.

In Switzerland, the presumption of innocence applies until a final conviction is pronounced.

Initial findings suggest that the fire was caused by sparklers igniting soundproofing foam installed on the ceiling of the establishment's basement.

Questions are also being raised regarding the presence and accessibility of fire extinguishers and whether the bar's exits were in compliance with regulations.

Moretti told investigators a service door had been locked from the inside and that he had found out about the locked door just after the deadly fire.

When he arrived at the scene, he forced open the door, according to excerpts from police reports published by several French and Swiss media outlets.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 13:45:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/dc4cd2cc-ed2a-11f0-8c43-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-07T110415Z-489520278-RC2AWIAYPPYA-RTRMADP-3-SWISS-BLAST.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israel prepares for potential Iranian attack as tension grows with US</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/israel-prepares-for-potential-iranian-attack-as-tension-grows-with-us</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 13:45:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/6277c6e6-efb4-11f0-8d01-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260112-133358-133520-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'One Battle After Another' and 'Hamnet' win top Golden Globe awards</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/one-battle-after-another-and-hamnet-win-top-golden-globe-awards</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 13:45:17 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/3f3568ba-ef77-11f0-a855-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-12T050151Z-1400113544-HP1EM1C0DEPT1-RTRMADP-3-AWARDS-GOLDEN-GLOBES.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Cuba's Diaz-Canel says there are no current talks with US government</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/cubas-diaz-canel-says-there-are-no-current-talks-with-us-government-2026-01-12/</link><description>HAVANA,  Jan 12 (Reuters) - Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel said on Monday there are no talks with the United States government in an apparent response to comments the day before by U.S. President Donald Trump suggesting the two longtime rivals were in conversations.

Diaz-Canel denied any ongoing conversations except for technical contacts in the migration field.

"As history demonstrates, in order for the relations between the United States and Cuba to advance, they must be based in international law instead of hostility, threats and economic coercion," Diaz-Canel said.

Images of the attack showed the mangled wreckage of the vehicle overturned on the roadside.

Tank deputy police chief Pervez Shah said five police personnel were killed on the spot after the remote-controlled bomb went off, while two others had died in hospital.

"The brave policemen sacrificed their today for the peaceful future of the nation," Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said in a statement.

No group has claimed responsibility for Monday's blast.

Pakistan's northern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where Tank is located, has battled a resurgence of militant violence carried out primarily by the Islamist Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan.

Pakistan has blamed the Afghan Taliban for providing a safe haven to TTP militants, saying they use Afghan soil to plan their strikes on targets in Pakistan. Kabul has denied the charges, saying Pakistan's security is an internal problem.

Pakistan and Afghanistan are in the midst of a fragile truce following border clashes in October that killed dozens, their worst fighting since the Taliban took power in 2021.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 14:28:21 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Exclusive: Israel poised to launch defence privatisations in months, says government official</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-poised-launch-defence-privatisations-months-says-government-official-2026-01-12/</link><description>JERUSALEM, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Israel plans to begin the long-awaited privatisation of two of its largest defence companies as early as the second quarter of this year, a senior government official said.

Roi Kahlon, director of the Government Companies Authority, said union and regulatory issues should be resolved in the next few months to allow initial public offerings by Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) (ISRAI.UL) and Rafael Advanced Defense Systems in the second quarter.

Defence privatisation has been discussed on and off for the past 20 years, but robust financial results bolstered by Israel's two-year war with Palestinian militant group Hamas in Gaza have strengthened the case to act now.

The government plans an initial sale of 25-30% of each company on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange in small tranches this year and next to avoid overwhelming the market and to retain controlling stakes for now.

"If you want to maximise valuation of the sale, we must make it in steps," Kahlon told Reuters, adding that the companies and Defence Ministry were in agreement on this.

IAI, which makes missile defence and unmanned aerial systems, is valued at about $20 billion. Rafael, which makes the Iron Dome anti-missile system as well as a new Iron Beam anti-missile laser, is valued at about $10 billion.

"We have an opportunity now ... because of the high value of both companies," Kahlon said.

Accountant General Yali Rothenberg said in November that plans to privatise IAI were taking shape after a ministerial panel approved a plan to sell up to 49% through an IPO.

Rafael has also begun IPO preparations, Kahlon said, citing discussions with company officials and the company's desire not to hand any advantage to rivals.

A Rafael spokesperson declined to comment.

IAI Chief Executive Boaz Levy told Reuters an IPO is crucial to the company's expansion plans. "We should look toward the future," he said. "It's very important for the company because (IAI) needs to grow."

Private ownership will also free the companies of bureaucracy that can hamper decision-making, Kahlon said, pointing to the success Israel Military Industries since it was bought by Elbit (ESLT.TA) , opens new tab in 2018. IMI is now valued at four times its 1.8 billion shekel ($571 million) purchase price, he said.

Ashdod port could also be privatised next year, Kahlon added without disclosing further detail.

Garibashvili, who served as prime minister from 2021 to 2024 and previously from 2013 to 2015, had been a longtime loyalist of Bidzina Ivanishvili , the billionaire ex-prime minister widely regarded as Georgia's de facto ruler.

His jailing marks the first time a senior figure from the governing elite has faced prosecution during a broader crackdown targeting opposition leaders.

Law enforcement raided Garibashvili's home - and those of two other associates of Ivanishvili - in October and said they had recovered $6.5 million in cash at the former business executive's residence.

Garibashvili, who has not publicly commented on the raid or the charges, was not available for comment on Monday. His lawyer told local media that he had been taken into custody.

Prosecutors said Garibashvili, 43, would also be fined 1 million lari ($375,230).

The ruling Georgian Dream party has cracked down on its pro-Western opponents over the past year, jailing opposition figures and launching a process to ban the three largest opposition groups outright. Anti-government street protesters are regularly arrested and dozens remain in jail.

Georgian Dream, in power since 2012, has broadly defended law enforcement's response to the demonstrations and accuses the opposition of trying to stage violent coups d'etat . The parties reject those charges as politically motivated.

This clampdown has run concurrently with a slate of prosecutions targeting ex-officials and associates of Ivanishvili, who briefly served as premier from 2012 to 2013.

Alongside Garibashvili, former State Security Service chief Grigol Liluashvili faces up to 15 years in a bribery case.

Georgia was once the former Soviet Union's most democratic and pro-Western successor state, but its ties with the West have soured since the 2022 start of the war in Ukraine over what the European Union casts as the country's authoritarian turn .

Garibashvili, who spent his career before politics working for Ivanishvili's businesses, helped engineer Georgia's anti-Western pivot, declaring in a speech in Slovakia in 2023 that NATO expansion was to blame for Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

The NATO member will buy unmanned systems including long-range attack drones, electronic warfare systems and surveillance drones as well as marine surveillance and minesweeping drones.

"No one knows what the next war will look like but one thing is clear, the future battle field will be characterised by unmanned systems and long-range capacity," Jonson said at Sweden's annual defence conference in Salen, northern Sweden.

"Anyone who doesn't understand that is going to be either dead or defeated. War is, as we know, a cruel teacher."

In addition, the government will invest 1.3 billion crowns in new military satellites, Jonson said.

European Union member Sweden, which joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in March 2024, has been ramping up permanent military spending since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

The Swedish government is also borrowing 300 billion crowns to speed up the acquisition of new equipment such as air defence systems, submarines and surface ships .

Sheinbaum said on X the two leaders discussed security with respect for Mexico's sovereignty, reducing drug trafficking, as well as trade and investment.

On Sunday, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke with Mexican Foreign Minister Juan Ramon de la Fuente about the need for stronger cooperation to dismantle Mexico's violent narco-terrorist networks and stop the trafficking of fentanyl and weapons, State Department spokesperson Tommy Pigott said in a statement.

Trump last week in remarks to Fox News said cartels were running Mexico and suggested the U.S. could strike land targets to combat them.

His comments were the latest in a series of escalating threats to deploy U.S. military force against drug cartels within Mexican territory.

Sheinbaum said in her post on X that "collaboration and cooperation within a framework of mutual respect always yield results."</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 14:56:27 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/EI4PK36HWBKVFL6ROLDPYCRYZA.jpg?auth=09116e109e6540a164114f6859e070b9f8014ce450be50dc3013ea9a260be3ff&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Germany's Klingbeil, on Powell probe, says central bank independence is 'clear line'</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/germanys-klingbeil-powell-probe-says-central-bank-independence-is-clear-line-2026-01-12/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 12 (Reuters) - German Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil on Monday said that central bank independence was a "clear line" for him, when asked about the U.S. Justice Department's probe into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.

"We in Germany attach great importance to the independence of central banks," Klingbeil said in Washington. "For me, as finance minister, this is a clear line."

President Donald Trump's administration has ramped up its pressure campaign on the Federal Reserve, threatening to indict Powell over comments to Congress about a building renovation project , an action Powell called a "pretext" to gain more influence over interest rates Trump wants cut dramatically.

The finance minister, who defined himself as "very transatlantic", said Germany is using every possibility to stay in dialogue with American partners but discussions are becoming more difficult and differences are getting larger.

"I believe it is bad for the world if Europe and the U.S. are divided from one another, and that is why I am here, to send a clear signal: We want cooperation, we want collaboration," said Klingbeil.

The German minister is in Washington for a meeting of finance ministers from the Group of Seven advanced economies, in which Australia, Mexico, South Korea and India will also participate.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 14:56:33 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/XKPQIT7RKBNXDOEQHRTJVOH5TQ.jpg?auth=971608fa20f9fefb57639917e6fee235f96c07fa00d5f872e5f1395fd82487ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Sweden to spend $440 million on unmanned military drone systems</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/sweden-spend-440-million-unmanned-military-drone-systems-2026-01-12/</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 14:57:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Mexico’s Sheinbaum says had 'good conversation' with Trump on security, drugs</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/mexicos-sheinbaum-says-had-good-conversation-with-trump-security-drugs-2026-01-12/</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 14:57:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Germany's Klingbeil, on Powell probe, says central bank independence is 'clear line'</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/germanys-klingbeil-powell-probe-says-central-bank-independence-is-clear-line-2026-01-12/</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 14:57:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Cuba's Diaz-Canel says there are no current talks with US after Trump threats</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260112-cuba-diaz-canel-says-there-are-no-current-talks-with-us-after-trump-threats</link><description>Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel said on Monday there are no talks with ​the United States government in ‍an apparent response to comments the day before by ​US President Donald Trump suggesting the ​two longtime rivals were in conversations.

Trump told reporters on Sunday that the US was "talking to Cuba". He did not specify what had been discussed in the alleged conversations but said "you´ll ‍find out pretty soon".

Trump on Sunday warned Havana to "make a deal" soon, pledging to cut off all oil and money Venezuela had provided before seizing Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro in a lightning raid on January 3 .

"THERE WILL BE NO MORE OIL OR MONEY GOING TO CUBA – ZERO!" Trump said on his Truth Social platform. "I strongly suggest they make a deal, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE."

Diaz-Canel denied any ongoing conversations ​except for technical contacts in the migration field.

"As history demonstrates, in order for ‌the relations between the United States and Cuba to advance, they ‍must be based in international law instead of hostility, threats and economic coercion," Diaz-Canel said.

Vincent Lemire was head of the French Research Centre in Jerusalem from 2019 to August 2023, before Palestinian militant group Hamas led an attack against Israel on October 7, 2023 , triggering an Israeli military response that has ravaged Gaza and killed more than 70,000 Palestinians in the besieged territory, according to the Gaza health ministry.

The academic, who specialises in the history of Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories, has since publicly spoken out about the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza and called for France to sanction Israel over the conflict's mounting death toll. He has also called for the release of Israeli hostages .

He was due to travel to Israel on Sunday with a two-year electronic travel authorisation for the country (ETA-IL) that he had previously obtained, but four days earlier, he received an email.

"Due to a change in circumstances in your case, the ETA-IL approval ... which was granted to you as of 27/02/2025 is revoked," it read, according to a screenshot Lemire sent AFP.

Contacted by AFP, the Israeli authorities did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

"My positions are not new, but I have never boycotted Israel. I have regularly issued invitations to Israeli academics and I have been going to Israel for 25 years, so I am very surprised," Lemire said.

"In terms of academic freedom, it's very problematic," said the researcher, who had planned some 20 meetings and seminars with Israeli and Palestinian researchers and students during his trip.

His ban comes after Israel at the start of the month banned 37 foreign humanitarian organisations from accessing the Gaza Strip after they refused to share lists of their Palestinian employees with government officials.

"As with the 37 NGOs banned from working in Gaza, it feels like we're in a dynamic of settling scores," said Lemire, who is trying to have the ban revoked.

Lemire and former Israeli ambassador to France Elie Barnavi in August urged President Emmanuel Macron in French daily newspaper Le Monde to slap sanctions on Israel to avoid having to recognise a "graveyard" as a Palestinian state.

Macron recognised Palestinian statehood in September, before a fragile ceasefire took hold in Gaza the following month.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 14:57:58 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/c0ee9462-efbd-11f0-b481-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/71ff0180ae3c0a249cf7dd2ecd1e967224be7409.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Exclusive: Pakistan and Indonesia closing in on jets and drones defence deal, sources say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/pakistan-indonesia-closing-jets-drones-defence-deal-sources-say-2026-01-12/</link><description>ISLAMABAD/JAKARTA Jan 12 (Reuters) - Indonesia's defence minister met Pakistan's air force chief in Islamabad to discuss a potential deal that includes the sale of combat jets and killer drones to Jakarta, three security officials with knowledge of the meeting on Monday said.

The talks come as Pakistan's defence industry moves forward with a series of defence procurement negotiations, including deals with Libya's National Army and Sudan's army , and looks to establish itself as a sizable regional player.

Indonesia's Defence Ministry confirmed the meeting between Defence Minister Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin and Pakistan's Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu.

"The meeting focused on discussing general defence cooperation relations, including strategic dialogue, strengthening communication between defence institutions, and opportunities for mutually beneficial cooperation in various fields in the long term," defence ministry spokesperson Brigadier General Rico Ricardo Sirait told Reuters, adding the talks had not yet led to concrete decisions.

One source said the talks revolved around the sale of JF-17 jets, a multi-role combat aircraft jointly developed by Pakistan and China, and killer drones designed for surveillance and striking targets. The other two sources said the talks were in an advanced stage and involved more than 40 JF-17 jets. One of them said Indonesia was also interested in Pakistan's Shahpar drones.

The sources did not share any discussions about delivery timelines and the number of years a proposed deal would span.

The Pakistani military's public relations wing did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

One additional security source with knowledge of military procurement talks said Pakistan was discussing the sale of JF-17 Thunder jets, air defence systems, training for junior, mid-level, and senior Indonesian air force officials, and engineering staff.

"The Indonesia deal is in the pipeline," retired Air Marshal Asim Suleiman, who remains briefed on air force deals, told Reuters, adding that the number of JF-17 jets involved was close to 40.

Indonesia's President Prabowo Subianto was in Pakistan last month for a two-day visit for talks on improving bilateral ties, including defence.

Indonesia has put in a slew of orders for jets in the past few years, including 42 French Rafale jets worth $8.1 billion in 2022 and 48 KAAN fighter jets from Turkey last year to strengthen its air force and replace its ageing air force fleet.

Jakarta has also considered buying China's J-10 fighter jets and is in talks to purchase U.S.-made F-15EX jets.

Interest in the Pakistani military's weapons development programme has surged since its jets were deployed in a short conflict with India last year.

The JF-17s have been at the centre of that growing attention, figuring in a deal with Azerbaijan and the $4 billion weapons pact with the Libyan National Army.

Pakistan is also eyeing a defence pact with Bangladesh that could include the Super Mushshak training jets and JF-17s, as ties improve with Dhaka.

Reuters has also reported that Islamabad was in talks with Riyadh for a defence deal that could be worth between $2 billion and $4 billion and involves the conversion of Saudi loans into military supplies.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 15:27:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/FSB4ZX6KHJMRZAHYKG7KFUVKX4.jpg?auth=7249ec8a02b59889ff68ca2ab1e378f001f6a6251c2607c1ef7e3a3018759c72&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Turkey cautions against foreign intervention in Iran</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/turkey-cautions-against-foreign-intervention-iran-2026-01-12/</link><description>ANKARA, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Turkey said on Monday that any foreign intervention in neighbouring Iran would lead to greater crises in the country and the region, and it called for U.S. and Iranian negotiations to resolve existing problems.

Iran is facing its biggest demonstrations since 2022 and U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to get involved if force is used against protesters.

NATO member Turkey does not wish to see chaos in Iran despite "certain problems within Iranian society and government", Omer Celik, spokesperson for Turkey's ruling AK Party, said.

"As Iranian President (Masoud) Pezeshkian has stated, these problems must be resolved through the internal dynamics of Iranian society and the national will of Iran," Celik told a press conference after a meeting of the ruling party.

"We believe that foreign intervention will lead to even worse consequences, and that intervention provoked by Israel in particular will lead to even greater crises."

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Saturday that Israel was closely monitoring the protests in Iran, adding: "We all hope that the Persian nation will soon be freed from the yoke of tyranny."

Trump and Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan have close personal ties.

Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan has said the protests, which evolved from complaints over dire economic hardships to defiant calls for the fall of the deeply entrenched clerical establishment, send a very strong message to Tehran.

"These demonstrations, stemming from genuine reasons and structural problems, are also being manipulated from abroad by Iran's rivals," Fidan told Turkish state broadcaster TRT on Friday.

"What we're trying to do... is to support an agreement with Iran that benefits both sides, primarily the Americans, because the stability of the region depends on it."

U.S.-based rights group HRANA said it had verified the deaths of 544 people and the arrests of 10,681 people since the protests began on December 28.

Ukraine and its European backers condemned the Russian missile strike on Friday, which they said was intended to intimidate the West in a week when European countries offered troops for a potential post-war reassurance force in Ukraine.

It was only the second time Russia has used the intermediate-range ballistic missile during the war. A Ukrainian official told Reuters the missile, capable of carrying nuclear weapons, was armed with inert dummy warheads and damaged a workshop at a state enterprise in Lviv, near the Polish border.

Russia's defence ministry said the Lviv State Aviation Repair Plant was disabled as a result of the strike, which it said hit production workshops and warehouses.

"This enterprise carried out repairs and maintenance of Ukrainian armed forces aviation equipment, including F-16 and MiG-29 aircraft transferred by Western countries," the ministry said.

"The company also produced long- and medium-range attack drones used to strike Russian civilian targets deep within Russian territory."

Russia said on Friday that the missile strike was a response to a Ukrainian attack on one of President Vladimir Putin's residences in northern Russia at the end of December. Kyiv has denied carrying out such an attack.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 15:27:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/YLTTQF4NEBLEDAJPACTBQQUE2U.jpg?auth=633c5465babb47e00b404b446d79a67fa5de7c0735473359b3f6b540e02501a8&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Greenland says it should be defended by NATO</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/greenland-says-it-will-boost-efforts-ensure-its-defence-is-supported-by-nato-2026-01-12/</link><description>STOCKHOLM, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Greenland's government said on Monday it will increase its efforts to ensure that the defence of the Arctic territory takes place under the auspices of NATO, and again rejected U.S. President Donald Trump's ambition to take over the island.

"All NATO member states, including the United States, have a common interest in the defence of Greenland," the island's coalition government said in a statement.

However, the tough-talking, gun-carrying nationalist has observed the latest battle in his turbulent career from afar, choosing not to return to Poland to face 26 charges that include abuse of power and leading a criminal group.

Ziobro, 55, says he is the victim of a witch hunt waged by the pro-EU government of Prime Minister Donald Tusk, who has vowed to bring to justice members of the right-wing former Law and Justice (PiS) administration accused of wrongdoing.

The ex-minister, who denies any wrongdoing, has been preparing for a showdown ever since PiS lost power in 2023.

Then, in a fiery address to parliament, he taunted his opponents over a previous failed attempt to prosecute him for exceeding his authority during his first stint as justice minister in 2005-2007.

"I'm counting on you," he cried, addressing the benches of Tusk's Civic Coalition (KO). "I hope you won't turn out to be the same losers you were during the time of the State Tribunal!"

Prosecutors say Ziobro and several of his deputies misused millions of zlotys from a fund intended for victims of crime.

They say the cash went towards purchasing Pegasus spyware that was used against political opponents or buying everything from fire engines to equipment for country housewives' associations to curry favour with rural voters.

Ziobro does not deny that money from the fund went towards Pegasus, but says that this and all the other spending was in Poland's national interests. He accuses the KO government of seeking revenge because he had investigated suspected corruption among Tusk's associates.

Ziobro studied law at the prestigious Jagiellonian University in his native Krakow. He joined PiS at its inception in 2001 and rose to prominence during an inquiry into bribery allegations involving the centre-left government of the time.

His no-nonsense approach to sittings of the commission formed in 2003 to investigate the allegations gained him the nickname "the sheriff".

In 2006 the event that many political observers say had the biggest effect on him took place.

Ziobro's father Jerzy died after a heart operation and his family blamed the doctors involved. Now Poland's justice minister, he directly attacked surgeon Miroslaw Garlicki, telling reporters: "No one will ever again be deprived of life by this man."

Garlicki sued Ziobro and the minister was forced by a court to issue a public apology.

Critics said Ziobro sought to influence the investigation into his father's death and that his exasperation with judges who failed to pin responsibility on Garlicki fuelled his confrontational approach to a profession he said regarded itself as an "exceptional caste".

The judicial reforms he spearheaded when he returned as justice minister in 2015 were central to a conflict between Warsaw and Brussels over democratic standards that resulted in billions of euros in EU funds being withheld.

Critics said the changes politicised the process for appointing and disciplining judges.

Ziobro also combined the roles of prosecutor general and justice minister, a move critics said compromised prosecutors' independence. PiS said the reforms removed communist influence in the judicial system and improved efficiency.

The clashes with the EU caused disputes within government, especially between Ziobro and then-Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, who favoured a more conciliatory approach towards Brussels.

"In negotiations you can't be... a softy, you have to be tough," Ziobro said in 2020.

His decision to seek asylum in Hungary from the right-wing government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban - another long-term critic of the EU - prompted a senior minister in Tusk's administration, Tomasz Siemoniak, to say Ziobro was fleeing Polish justice "like a coward".

On the day the new parliament was sworn in in 2023, Ziobro was diagnosed with oesophageal cancer.

While a parliamentary commission in Warsaw examined his role in alleged wrongdoing relating to Pegasus spyware, Ziobro underwent multiple operations and chemotherapy in Belgium.

PiS leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski said putting a man in Ziobro's condition in prison would be "equivalent to a death sentence".

But Ziobro himself has remained typically combative.

"For using brutal and unlawful methods, members of Donald Tusk's regime currently ruling Poland will face severe consequences," he said in a post on X on Monday. "I will personally contribute to this fight."</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 15:28:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/YXO6ORA7ZVPN5H6S5HXTLRDK6Q.jpg?auth=ed5bd1ba687e8fffd23ebcff05922f07ea77943ad2386bd9168460ec9f1d0167&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>German military rocked by abuse reports as recruitment drive starts</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/german-military-rocked-by-abuse-reports-recruitment-drive-starts-2026-01-12/</link><description>BERLIN, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Germany's military has been rocked by reports of widespread sexual harassment and right-wing extremism in an elite paratroop unit, as an initiative begins to expand the armed forces with thousands of new recruits.

Extensive reporting by the weekly Der Spiegel and the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung in recent days of allegations of sexual harassment, the use of Nazi greetings and drug abuse have put pressure on the military's leadership, just as new measures begin to register 18-year-olds for military service.

The German military confirmed the reported abuse, which it said emerged last year after female soldiers from the 26th Parachute Regiment relayed their experiences to the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Armed Forces, the military ombudsman.

A spokesperson said extensive investigations had identified 55 suspects, of whom 19 would be dismissed from the armed forces, while 16 cases had been referred to prosecutors and a number of other disciplinary procedures instituted.

It said a package of measures had been introduced aimed at improving command structures, strengthening prevention and resilience and improving education and reinforcing values.

The latest case comes as authorities have begun registering 18-year-olds as part of a series of measures to increase the size of the serving military from around 182,000 uniformed troops to 255,000 to 270,000, with another 200,000 reservists.

Military service will not be compulsory, so long as recruitment targets are met, and the government is offering a range of inducements, including higher pay and training offers to boost interest among young people.

The military said it expected soldiers and civilian personnel to actively support Germany's democratic order and took consequential steps when this did not happen, including disciplinary and, where applicable, legal action.

"Our aspiration and goal is to protect the internal structures of the military and offer all members a secure environment within a solid community of values," the spokesperson said in an emailed statement.

According to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, female soldiers regularly reported being subject to abusive and degrading comments of a sexual nature and said numerous cases where soldiers used Nazi terms and expressions had also been reported.

Over the years, the German military has faced similar scandals, one of which almost saw its KSK special forces unit disbanded before the then-defence minister ruled that efforts to stamp out right-wing extremism in the unit were enough to ensure its survival.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 15:51:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/DLGNTKRE6BLVDGRVVSXIQI2PGE.jpg?auth=cbc908a0d06cce361352bd28f50bbcbe7486fec5bbcf54936b18d2952cd076c7&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Oscar predictions are on as voting for awards starts</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/oscar-predictions-are-on-as-voting-for-awards-starts</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 15:53:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/8ab78a8a-ef71-11f0-8726-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-12T034846Z-1432563267-HP1EM1C0AL7Q5-RTRMADP-3-AWARDS-GOLDEN-GLOBES.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Key French budget talks to resume as government faces two no-confidence motions</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/key-french-budget-talks-to-resume-as-government-faces-two-no-confidence-motions</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 15:53:17 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/1a12d66c-d73f-11f0-a546-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/000-87RQ2Z2.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump 'open' to meeting with Venezuelan interim leader a week after capture</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/trump-open-to-meeting-with-venezuelan-interim-leader-a-week-after-capture</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 15:53:19 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/9ae0873e-efc3-11f0-b094-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260112-143438-144129-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>What is Starlink, the satellite service Iranians use to post about the protests?</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/what-is-starlink-the-satellite-service-iranians-use-to-post-about-the-protests</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 15:53:21 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/a69de5d2-efc1-11f0-83f1-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260112-143236-143437-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>French government faces no-confidence motions despite Mercosur opposition</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/french-government-faces-no-confidence-motions-despite-mercosur-opposition</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 15:53:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/cf5f53cc-efc4-11f0-ab58-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260112-152506-152642-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Civilian casualties in Ukraine up sharply in 2025, UN monitor says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/civilian-casualties-ukraine-up-sharply-2025-un-monitor-says-2026-01-12/</link><description>ZURICH, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Last year was the deadliest for civilians in Ukraine since 2022, driven by intensified hostilities along the front line and the expanded use of long-range weapons, the U.N. Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine said on Monday.

Conflict-related violence in Ukraine killed 2,514 civilians and injured 12,142 in 2025, a 31% rise in the number of victims from 2024, the monitor said in a monthly update on civilian harm.

The vast majority of the casualties verified by the watchdog occurred in Ukrainian government-controlled territory from attacks launched by Russian armed forces, the statement added. Ukrainian officials generally cite the U.N. figures as accurate.

Increased efforts by Russian armed forces to capture territory in 2025 resulted in the killing and injuring of civilians, destruction of vital infrastructure, halting of essential services and new waves of displacement in frontline areas, the monitor said.

Almost two-thirds of all casualties last year occurred in frontline areas, with older persons particularly affected as they remained in their villages. Civilian casualties caused by short-range drones also increased sharply, it added.

"The expanded use of short-range drones has rendered many areas near the frontline effectively uninhabitable," said Danielle Bell, head of the monitoring mission.

"In 2025, many people who had endured years of hostilities were ultimately compelled to leave their homes."

Hundreds of thousands of soldiers on both sides are believed to have been injured or killed in Europe's deadliest war since World War Two, although neither side releases full figures.

Thousands of Ukrainian civilians have been killed, particularly in 2022, the war's first year, during a long Russian siege of the port of Mariupol and assaults on cities before the front line hardened in place.

Since then, Moscow has continued to use missiles and drones to strike cities across Ukraine. Russia denies deliberately targeting civilians, but says its attacks on Ukrainian civil infrastructure are justified because it hinders the war effort. Ukraine also targets civil infrastructure in Russia and Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine, though on a far smaller scale.

The U.N. statement said an increase in the use of long-range weapons by the Russian armed forces starting in June 2025 also caused an increase in civilian harm in urban centres across Ukraine.

"The sharp increase in long-range attacks and the targeting of Ukraine's national energy infrastructure mean that the consequences of the war are now felt by civilians far beyond the frontline," Bell said.

Russian authorities reported that attacks by Ukrainian armed forces killed 253 civilians and injured 1,872 in the Russian Federation last year, the monitor said. Due to lack of access and limited publicly available information, the watchdog could not verify these numbers, it added.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 16:28:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/UTNLS3RWKNNC5LSVOIB43QANP4.jpg?auth=1addd758168aa3edf048dc27bb03934cc403346d2e8ac2ff3e28333172c991c4&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Nigeria reopens some schools in the north, defying threats of kidnap</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/nigeria-reopens-some-schools-north-defying-threats-kidnap-2026-01-12/</link><description>MAIDUGURI, Nigeria, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Schools across parts of northern Nigeria started reopening on Monday, after months of closure triggered by the abduction of hundreds of students in November.

The abductions last year had underlined the vulnerability of education facilities in a region plagued by criminal gangs and Islamist insurgents.

Schools resumed academic activities this term after the federal government said in a circular last month that enhanced security measures had created a safer environment for students to return. It did not provide details.

In northern Kaduna state, a 17-year-old student said it was difficult for her to return to school after two months away.

"What I love most about our school is being together at lunchtime and spending time with my teachers and friends. I miss it so much," she said at her home before leaving for Federal Government College boarding school in the state.

Her father, Haruna Danjuma, said the decision to return his daughter to school was difficult, but fear of kidnapping should not deprive children of their right to education.

“A child is a gift from Almighty Allah, and it is my responsibility to educate her,” he said. “But it is the responsibility of government to secure the children.”

In Niger State, central Nigeria, where more than 300 students and staff were abducted in November, a majority of the schools remained shut for security reasons, state officials said.

Saint Mary’s Catholic School in the Papiri hamlet was among those that would not reopen yet, the Christian Association of Nigeria said, citing a statement from the state government directing areas facing security challenges to remain closed until further notice.

Explaining the continued closure of schools, Niger commissioner for education Hadiza Mohammed said "the safety of students, teachers, and school communities remains paramount."</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 16:28:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/3L3KYLG44FOB7ME5OEK2UNC7TA.jpg?auth=e8a9b8645a2e5f66d6b9534528a07514b85ccbf6fed8d412ee191a2fe6b22630&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran's traders, frustrated by economic losses, turn against clerics</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/irans-traders-frustrated-by-economic-losses-turn-against-clerics-2026-01-12/</link><description>DUBAI, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Iran's bazaar merchants, the trader class who were the financial backbone of the 1979 Islamic Revolution, have turned against the clerics they helped bring to power, fuelling unrest over an economy that has morphed into full-blown anti-government protests .

Frustration among bazaar merchants, from small-scale shopkeepers to large wholesale traders, has grown as their political and economic clout in Iran has diminished over the decades while the elite Revolutionary Guards have tightened their grip on the economy, building sprawling and tightly held networks of power.

"We are struggling. We cannot import goods because of U.S. sanctions and because only the Guards or those linked to them control the economy. They only think about their own benefits," said a trader at Tehran’s centuries-old Grand Bazaar, speaking on condition of anonymity.

The wave of protests that has engulfed the country, posing one of the toughest challenges ever to the clerical leadership, erupted in late December in Tehran's Grand Bazaar, where hundreds of shopkeepers denounced the sharp fall in the rial currency.

The demonstrations quickly swelled and turned political, challenging the Islamic Republic's legitimacy. Protesters burned images of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and chanted "Death to the dictator" - undeterred by security forces armed with tear gas, batons, and, in many cases, live ammunition.

Iran’s rulers, while acknowledging economic difficulties, have blamed their longtime foes the U.S. and Israel for fomenting the unrest. They appear intent on holding onto power at any cost, backed by a security apparatus refined over decades of suppressing ethnic revolts, student movements, and protests over economic hardship and social freedoms.

A combination of international sanctions and the Guards' sprawling economic empire has limited the government's ability to ease the dire economic situation.

Tehran-based analyst Saeed Laylaz said the government has lost control over the situation.

"What is striking is that the unrest began in the bazaar. For merchants, the core issue isn’t inflation - it’s price volatility, which leaves them unable to decide whether to buy or sell," he said.

Economic disparities between ordinary Iranians and the clerical and security elite, along with economic mismanagement and state corruption - reported even by state media - have fanned discontent at a time when inflation is pushing the price of many goods beyond the means of most people.

Iran's rial currency has lost nearly half its value against the dollar in 2025, with official inflation reaching 42.5% in December.

Created by the Islamic Republic's late founder Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the Guards first secured an economic foothold after the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s, when clerical rulers allowed them to invest in leading Iranian industries.

Their influence expanded exponentially over decades, benefiting from Khamenei's full backing and from opportunities created by Western sanctions, which effectively excluded Iran from the global financial and trading system.

The Guards now control vast sectors of the economy, from oil to transportation, communications, and construction.

Another trader said the crisis was not over, as the Guards have long proved adept at defending their economic interests.

"The government wants to resolve the problem, but it lacks the means and power in this system. The economy is not controlled by the government," said the trader, a 62-year-old carpet seller in Tehran.

All aspects of the country's sanctions-hit oil business have come under the growing influence of the Guards - from the shadow fleet of tankers that secretly ship sanctioned crude, to logistics and front companies selling the oil, mostly to China.

"No one knows how much of the oil money that the Guards get from selling Iran’s oil returns to the country ... they are too powerful to be questioned about it,” said a senior Iranian official, who asked not to be named.

During his 2013–2021 presidency, pragmatist Hassan Rouhani repeatedly clashed with the Guards, accusing them publicly of resisting budget cuts, while his attempts to curb their commercial networks and assets were largely frustrated.

Even as it has relinquished economic power, the clerical establishment has relied on its loyal forces - the Guards and its affiliated Basij paramilitary - to violently crush ethnic uprisings, student unrest, and protests over economic hardship, preserving the political order.

"Given the sensitive circumstances when the country faces foreign threats, Khamenei cannot upset the Guards by curbing their economic influence. The establishment needs them to quell the protests and confront foreign threats," said an insider, close to Rouhani.

U.S.-based rights group HRANA said it had verified the deaths of 544 people - 496 protesters and 48 security personnel - with 10,681 people arrested since the protests began on December 28 and spread around the country. Reuters was unable to independently verify the tallies.

The authorities have not given numbers of casualties, but officials say many members of the security forces have been killed by "terrorists and rioters" linked to foreign foes, including the U.S. States and Israel.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 16:28:49 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/VFBEXTWBJVOF3HW7ELSTFH5RUA.jpg?auth=c92566d658da40d35fc2c293d32644ff52d8dbff10f2e1a6040e3d2f4240acc6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia says hypersonic Oreshnik missile hit Ukrainian aircraft repair plant</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260112-russia-says-hypersonic-oreshnik-missile-hit-ukrainian-aircraft-repair-plant</link><description>Russia 's defence ‍ministry said on ​Monday that the target it hit last week in ⁠ a strike with a hypersonic Oreshnik missile was a Ukrainian aircraft repair plant, which was disabled.

Ukraine and its European backers ​condemned the Russian missile strike on Friday, which ‍they said was intended to intimidate the West in a week when ​European countries offered troops for a potential post-war reassurance ​force in Ukraine.

It was only the second time Russia has used the intermediate-range ballistic missile during the war. Russian President Vladimir Putin has claimed that Oreshnik, an intermediate-range missile that can reach targets between 3,000 and 5,500 kilometres away, is "impossible" to intercept by modern air defences.

A Ukrainian official said the missile, capable of carrying nuclear weapons , was armed with inert dummy warheads and damaged a workshop at a state ‍enterprise in Lviv, near the Polish border.

Russia's defence ministry said the ​Lviv State Aviation Repair Plant was disabled as a result of the strike, which it said hit production workshops and ‌warehouses.

"This enterprise carried out repairs and maintenance of Ukrainian armed forces aviation equipment, including ‍F-16 and MiG-29 aircraft transferred by Western countries," the ministry said.

"The company also produced long- and medium-range attack drones used to strike Russian civilian targets deep within Russian territory."

Asked about Russia's claim on Monday, Ukrainian air force spokesman Yuriy Ignat said: "We never comment on where the hit was."

Russia said on Friday that the missile strike was a response to a Ukrainian attack ‍on one of Putin's residences in northern Russia at the ‌end of ​December.

The judicial overhaul separating the career paths of prosecutors and judges is a flagship reform of Meloni's right-wing coalition and faces fierce opposition from magistrates and the centre-left opposition.

The government, which has accused magistrates of undue interference in areas from public works to immigration, says the move is necessary to prevent conflict of interest between the two groups and prevent political bias.

Recent polls show Italians split on an issue that has roiled domestic politics for decades.

The judiciary has accused the government of seeking control over prosecutors to dictate which crimes they can and cannot investigate -- a charge the centre-left opposition has echoed.

Last week, Meloni dismissed media speculation that the government might seek to capitalise on a successful referendum campaign by calling early general elections, and said she would not resign in the event of a defeat.

The justice reform was approved by parliament in October but must go to a referendum before becoming law because it entails a change to the constitution.

Currently, magistrates enter the legal profession through a single exam and can switch between roles throughout their careers.

Under the reform, candidates must choose at the outset whether to become a judge or prosecutor, with no possibility of changing.

The council which oversees appointments and disciplinary matters would be split into two separate self-governing bodies, with members selected by lottery rather than election, a change aimed at preventing lobby groups from gaining the upper hand.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 16:58:49 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/A6BPJZS4SFOKRG47DH4JPGANUA.jpg?auth=9c7eb750d88ce5faaae0b8f59649c3b4c7ac55cd08d1c5be574f9d05b19513e9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Italy to hold referendum on judicial reform on March 22-23</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/italy-hold-referendum-judicial-reform-march-22-23-2026-01-12/</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 16:59:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>French far-right leader Marine Le Pen faces high-stakes trial ahead of presidential race</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260112-french-far-right-leader-marine-le-pen-faces-high-stakes-trial-ahead-of-presidential-race</link><description>Marine Le Pen is set to learn her political fate. Her appeal trial , opening in Paris on Tuesday and set to run for a month, could dash her hopes of standing in the 2027 presidential election, for which she is currently the frontrunner.

The case centres on the long-running scandal over fictitious National Rally (RN) party assistants at the European Parliament . In March 2025, Le Pen was sentenced to four years in prison – including two years in custody – fined €100,000, and given a five-year ban from public office with immediate effect.

If the Paris appeal court upholds the ruling, it would send shockwaves through the far-right RN party, which has led opinion polls for several months.

In the first ruling, judges found the three-time presidential candidate (2012, 2017 and 2022) guilty, along with 24 former MEPs, parliamentary assistants, an accountant, and the National Rally as a legal entity, of operating a “system” between 2004 and 2016 using European Parliament funds to pay party employees.

The Paris criminal court assessed the financial damage to the European Parliament at €3.2 million, after deducting €1.1 million that had already been reimbursed by some of the defendants.

Only 12 of those convicted in March 2025, along with the party itself, have appealed. They include Perpignan Mayor Louis Aliot, MP Julien Odoul, MEP Nicolas Bay, and senior party figures Wallerand de Saint-Just and Bruno Gollnisch.

Judges ruled that the case did not stem from “administrative errors” or confusion over European rules but amounted to “embezzlement as part of a system designed to reduce the party’s operating costs”.

As in the first trial, Le Pen plans to plead her innocence on appeal and to argue that the case is politically motivated, aimed at preventing her from running for president.

“The trial judge wrote that the goal was not only to stop me from running but also from being elected,” Le Pen told the economic weekly La Tribune Dimanche on December 28. “There was a time when people were shot. Today, you are shot judicially. It means political death.”

Since the verdict was handed down, Presiding Judge Bénédicte de Perthuis has received death threats and been placed under police protection.

In its ruling, the court cited Le Pen’s refusal to acknowledge the facts, the seriousness of the offences and the risk of reoffending to justify the sentence's severity.

The judges also defended the immediate enforcement of her ban from office, saying it was necessary to ensure that elected officials “do not benefit from preferential treatment incompatible with public trust in political life”.

In December, Germany’s Der Spiegel reported that Washington had considered imposing sanctions on the judges who convicted Le Pen. US President Donald Trump had previously criticised the ruling, calling for Le Pen’s “liberation” and dismissing the case as a “witch hunt”.

“If such actions were confirmed or implemented, they would constitute unacceptable and intolerable interference in our country’s internal affairs,” said Peimane Ghaleh-Marzban, president of the Paris criminal court, on January 6.

He pointed to recent US sanctions targeting judges abroad, including a French judge at the International Criminal Court involved in the arrest warrant against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu .

France’s top prosecutor, Rémy Heitz, later played down the claims, saying there was “nothing tangible” at this stage to suggest interference in the appeal proceedings and dismissing the reports as “press rumours”.

The US State Department also denied the allegations, with Under Secretary Sarah B. Rogers calling the reported leak “stale and false”.

The RN dismissed what it described as a “rumour spread by a hostile media outlet”, arguing that the Paris court president’s remarks risked giving credibility to a “fake news story” and amounted to undue pressure on appeal judges.

The appeal court’s decision is expected by the summer of 2026. If Le Pen is acquitted, she would be free to run in the 2027 presidential election. If the conviction and ban are upheld, she will be barred from standing.

She could still take the case to the Court of Cassation, France's highest court. Its president, Christophe Soulard, has said the court would aim, “if possible”, to rule before the presidential election.

A third scenario is possible: Le Pen could be convicted again but without a ban from office, or with a shorter period of ineligibility. She would then be legally able to run but politically weakened by a criminal conviction.

In that case, pressure could grow for her to step aside in favour of National Rally president Jordan Bardella , 30, who is increasingly viewed as a leading contender for 2027. A poll published in late November put Bardella ahead of all potential rivals in a hypothetical presidential race.

Rainfall levels so far this winter are up 95% from a year earlier and 17% above the seasonal average, Baraka told members of parliament.

The average dam-filling rate has risen to 46%, with several key reservoirs now at full capacity, official data showed.

The rainfal has provided relief to the agricultural sector after years of water restrictions.

Seven years of drought had depleted Morocco's dams, cut the wheat harvest, reduced the national cattle herd, caused heavy job losses in farming and pushed the country to accelerate its desalination plans.

Morocco aims to supply 60% of its drinking water from treated seawater by 2030, up from a previous 25%, while leaving dam water for the inner regions of the country, Baraka told Reuters in December.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 17:26:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/TYD7LWL45NMVPH26ISD6USZIUY.jpg?auth=66b12d0ccb1a86e53cf4517fe2702da9a0c4b5204872b8160ca8f1fcb3616817&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Moldova's President Sandu says she would vote to join Romania</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/moldovas-president-sandu-says-she-would-vote-join-romania-2026-01-12/</link><description>CHISINAU, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Moldovan President Maia Sandu has said she would vote in favour of unification with neighbouring European Union and NATO member Romania if a referendum were to take place to help protect its fragile democracy against Russian pressure.

Sandu, whose pro-EU ruling party won a new mandate last September, has repeatedly accused Russia of meddling in Moldova, a former Soviet republic of around 2.4 million with a Romanian-speaking majority and a Russian-speaking minority.

"If we have a referendum, I would vote for the unification with Romania," she said in an interview for the British podcast 'The Rest is Politics', broadcast on Sunday.

"Look at what is happening in the world. It is getting more and more difficult for a small country like Moldova to survive as a democracy, as a sovereign country, and of course to resist Russia."

Around 1.5 million Moldovans hold Romanian citizenship, but recent polls have shown that only around one-third support reunification with Bucharest.

Sandu said she recognised most Moldovans do not support her position, adding that EU integration was a "more realistic objective".

Her government has set its sights on joining the EU by 2030 but will have to implement difficult reforms in the face of opposition from Russia. Moldova's pro-Russian Socialists were in power as recently as 2020.

Moldova, which also borders Ukraine, was part of Romania in the interwar period but was annexed by the Soviet Union during World War Two. It gained its independence in 1991 as the Soviet Union collapsed.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 17:26:21 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CGWEOYAGXFIIPKRVHCMEF2Y6PQ.jpg?auth=2747a4af8b0c1ca8db01e2214be4e4ef8a80c8355c21cf8c48733f61df516934&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russian drones hit two foreign vessels near Ukraine's port, source says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-drones-hit-two-foreign-vessels-near-ukraines-port-source-says-2026-01-12/</link><description>KYIV, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Russian drones on Monday hit two foreign-flagged vessels near Ukraine's southern port of Chornomorsk, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters.

The FRANCE 24 Observers team in Paris has verified videos showing dozens of bodies accumulating at a morgue in Kahrizak, a suburb south of Tehran, as families attempt to find and identify their loved ones.

Medical sources say that hundreds of bodies are currently at the morgue.

Protests that began on December 28, 2025, following the collapse of the Iranian rial have been violently repressed by the regime of the Islamic Republic. The regime has put in place a total ban on internet and cellphone communications.

A nurse at a hospital in northern Iran told the Observers team on Sunday:

“We have received around 50 bodies at our hospital. Most had been killed by shots to the head.

There are many injured people, and the hospital has no capacity to treat them all. We cannot even call in surgeons; there is no connection to do so.

A colleague of mine at another hospital counted 18 bodies in their morgue yesterday.”

According to the Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA), at least 538 people have died since the demonstrations began. But the real toll could be much higher.

A resident of Tehran sent us this account:

“They shot at people and even ran people over with anti-riot vehicles. There was blood everywhere. The streets were covered in people’s blood, and we had to run through it to escape. My shoes are soaked in blood.

We were running away when suddenly a member of the security forces put a gun to my friend’s temple and screamed, ‘What the f*** are you doing here? Get lost.’ For a second, I thought he was going to kill him. Fortunately, he didn’t, and we just ran.”

She said she told Trump that any US troop deployment in Mexico was "not on the table".

"We spoke about various topics, including security with respect for our sovereignties, reducing drug trafficking , trade, and investments," Sheinbaum said on social media.

Trump again said last week that land attacks against drug cartels would follow recent US maritime operations in the Pacific and Caribbean, without specifying where or when.

Mexico extradited dozens of cartel leaders to the United States in 2025 and reinforced border cooperation, but Sheinbaum has repeatedly voiced opposition to any military intervention from outside.

Trump recently told Mexico it had to "get their act together" following months of pressure over drugs and trade on the United States' southern neighbour.

He said Sheinbaum – whom he met in Washington in December – was a "terrific person" but added he was pushing her to let him send US troops to tackle drug cartels in Mexico, an offer he said she has previously rebuffed.

Sheinbaum said at her press conference ‍that fentanyl trafficking from Mexico to the United States had fallen by about 50 percent over the past year.

Since US troops seized Venezuela 's President Nicolas Maduro from Caracas, Trump has also made threats against other leftist governments in the region , including Cuba , Colombia and Mexico.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 17:26:44 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/e165da20-efd1-11f0-afc0-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25332538038143.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Sweden makes record three-ton seizure of cocaine from South America</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/sweden-makes-record-three-ton-seizure-cocaine-south-america-2026-01-12/</link><description>Jan 12 (Reuters) - Sweden on Monday confiscated an estimated three metric tons of cocaine, the country's single-biggest seizure of the drug, in the port of southwestern city Helsingborg, daily Sydsvenskan reported, citing customs.

"The ‍stakes are too high to look the other way: if the Federal ​Reserve loses its independence, the stability of our markets ​and the broader economy will suffer," Murkowski wrote on X.

Murkowski is one of a small handful of Trump's fellow Republicans who have shown themselves willing to vote against his wishes at times in the Senate, where his party holds a 53-47 majority.

The Alaska lawmaker said she had spoken earlier on Monday with ‍Powell, who on Sunday said the US central bank had received subpoenas last week that he called "retaliation" for the Fed's basing interest rates on policy rather than Trump's preferences.

Murkowski called the DOJ threat "nothing more than an attempt at coercion", adding ‍that Congress should investigate the department if it believes probing the Fed ‌was ​warranted over renovation cost overruns, which she called "not unusual".

Since ‍returning to office last year, Trump has been increasingly publicly pressuring the Fed ​to cut interest rates , breaking with long-standing practice meant to insulate the central bank from political pressure and allowing ‌it to focus on economic data.

Trump has repeatedly attacked Powell for not cutting its short-term interest rate, and even threatened to fire him. Powell’s caution has infuriated Trump, who has demanded the Fed cut borrowing costs to spur the economy and reduce the interest rates the federal government pays on its debt. That anger has not subsided even after the Fed cut interest rates in three of the final four months of 2025.

Powell said in his statement that "the threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the president".

Murkowski's statement came as every living former US central bank chief issued a joint criticism of the criminal probe into Powell, saying that the Justice Department's move had "no place" in the country.

"The reported criminal inquiry into Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell is an unprecedented attempt to use prosecutorial attacks to undermine that independence," said the statement, which was also signed by other former US economic leaders.

The extent of the revocations reflects the broad immigration crackdown initiated when Trump returned to the White House last year, deporting an unprecedented number of migrants including some who held valid visas. The administration has also adopted a stricter policy on granting visas, with tightened social media vetting and expanded screening.

"The State Department has now revoked over 100,000 visas, including some 8,000 student visas and 2,500 specialized visas for individuals who had encounters with U.S. law enforcement for criminal activity. We will continue to deport these thugs to keep America safe," the department said in a post on X.

The four leading causes for revocations were overstays, driving under the influence, assault and theft, State Department deputy spokesperson Tommy Pigott said. The revocations marked a 150% increase from 2024, he added.

The State Department has also launched a Continuous Vetting Center aimed at ensuring "all foreign nationals on American soil comply with our laws — and that the visas of those who pose a threat to American citizens are swiftly revoked," Pigott said.

In November, the State Department said it had revoked around 80,000 non-immigrant visas since Trump's inauguration on January 20, 2025, for offenses ranging from driving under the influence to assault and theft.

Directives from the State Department this year have ordered U.S. diplomats abroad to be vigilant against any applicants whom Washington may see as hostile to the U.S. and who have a history of political activism.

Trump administration officials have said that student visa holders and lawful permanent residents with "green cards" are subject to deportation over their support for Palestinians and criticism of Israel's conduct in the war in Gaza, calling their actions a threat to U.S. foreign policy and accusing them of being pro-Hamas.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 18:34:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/Z5AQP7OCTJJ53IFYJQQ3SN4QFU.jpg?auth=3ebaf715cd02c51b1add5aaf0eb5b1d09058f6fee123f09414dd62c5917fd267&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump to meet Venezuela's Machado on Thursday, White House official says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/trump-meet-venezuelas-machado-thursday-white-house-official-says-2026-01-12/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 12 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump will meet with Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado on Thursday, a White House official said on Monday.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 18:35:26 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ZSNHRB54BROSTFF4R4H5DS77RU.jpg?auth=3abbc1246e45e87262c2e5b24dcdd0a7b2ff31822340a1e53a93f254ab34ac5a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Supertankers that would pick up debt-paying Venezuelan oil cargoes for China make u-turn -ship data</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/supertankers-that-would-pick-up-debt-paying-venezuelan-oil-cargoes-china-make-u-2026-01-12/</link><description>HOUSTON, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Two China-flagged supertankers that were sailing to Venezuela to pick up debt-paying crude cargoes amid the U.S. oil embargo on the OPEC country have made u-turn and are now heading back to Asia, LSEG shipping data showed on Monday.

Following the U.S. announcement last week of a $2 billion deal to export up to 50 million barrels of Venezuelan oil stuck in storage, U.S. president Donald Trump said China would not be deprived of Venezuela's crude.

But the Asian country, the first market of the South American nation's oil, has not received any cargoes since last month as Washington says the embargo remains in force.

The very large crude carriers Xingye and Thousand Sunny had remained anchored in the Atlantic Ocean for weeks, waiting for directions amid the blockade and Venezuela's political crisis, triggered by the U.S. capture of President Nicolas Maduro.

The vessels are part of a group of three supertankers that only cover the Venezuela-China route to carry crude that pays Venezuela's debt service to the Asian country.

The loans that are part of Venezuela's overall debt to China, which used to be its first lender. Shortly after Venezuela was put under U.S. energy sanctions in 2019, China granted a grace period to receive capital payments and negotiated a temporary deal with Caracas so debt service would be compensated with crude cargoes.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 18:35:54 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Former Corsican separatist leader Orsoni shot dead at mother's funeral</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/former-corsican-separatist-leader-orsoni-shot-dead-mothers-funeral-2026-01-12/</link><description>PARIS, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Former Corsican separatist leader Alain Orsoni was shot dead during his mother's funeral on Monday in Vero, a village 30 km (18.6 miles) east of Ajaccio, the capital of the Mediterranean French island, the city's public prosecutor said.

"He was hit by a long-range shot," prosecutor Nicolas Septe, told Reuters. Local police confirmed the assassination.

Orsoni, 71, led a separatist movement called the Corsican Movement for Self-Determination, which French police considered to be the legal front for the armed group, the Corsican National Liberation Front-Traditional Wing.

Authorities linked the Corsican National Liberation Front-Traditional Wing to a series of attacks on the island in the 1990s, some of which the group claimed.

Orsoni was also charged, convicted and later pardoned in connection with a machine gun attack on the Iranian embassy in Paris in 1980.

Orsoni was also the president of Corsican soccer club AC Ajaccio in the late 2000s and early 2010s.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 19:21:10 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iranians tap Musk's Starlink to skirt internet blackout, sources say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/iranians-tap-musks-starlink-skirt-internet-blackout-sources-say-2026-01-12/</link><description>Jan 12 (Reuters) - Some Iranians are still using Elon Musk’s Starlink satellite internet service despite a nationwide communications blackout, three people inside the country said, the latest example of Starlink being used to counter internet shutdowns in geopolitical flashpoints.

Iranian authorities have in recent days launched a deadly crackdown on nationwide protests , including the near-complete shutdown of internet service, which is provided through fiber-optic cables and cellphone towers.

But Starlink, which beams its service directly from thousands of low-earth orbit satellites, is still working in some places in Iran , despite being banned by authorities there, three people using Starlink in the country told Reuters. One of them, in Western Iran, said he knew dozens of people using Starlink and that users in border towns and cities were largely unaffected.

Alp Toker, founder of internet monitoring group NetBlocks, said he has heard from people in the region that there is still some Starlink access in Iran, though service appears reduced.

“It is patchy, but still there,” he said.

While it’s not clear how Starlink’s service was being disrupted in Iran, some specialists said it could be the result of jamming of Starlink terminals that would overpower their ability to receive signals from the satellites.

Starlink, which is part of privately held U.S. company SpaceX, didn't respond to requests for comment. Authorities in Iran could not be reached on Monday, amid phone and internet outages. Iranian authorities have blamed the unrest on terrorists and vowed to safeguard the governing system.

The communication lifeline Starlink has provided for some protesters in Iran is the latest sign of the influence Musk and his satellite internet service have in global conflicts and unrest around the world.

Starlink has been a critical tool for Ukrainian forces since Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022. In Myanmar , where the military junta has imposed repeated internet shutdowns, rebel groups, aid organizations and medics have used Starlink for communications. In Sudan , Starlink has also been used by both sides in a years-long civil war due to prolonged blackouts.

U.S. President Donald Trump said on Sunday he plans to speak with Musk about restoring internet in Iran , without mentioning Starlink.

Musk previously shipped free Starlink terminals, which are slightly larger than a laptop, to Ukraine and offered free internet service there. Standard Starlink terminals cost around $599, plus a monthly service fee, making it unaffordable for many Iranians.

Musk's ability to tip the balance in global conflicts was demonstrated when he shut down Starlink as Ukraine retook territory from Russia in 2022, Reuters previously reported .

Starlink isn't licensed to operate in Iran, but Musk has previously said that the service is active there. In December 2022, he posted on his social media platform X that the company was “approaching 100 Starlinks active in Iran," a modest figure given Iran's population of 92 million.

In June last year, in response to a post on X calling for him to provide Starlink access to Iran, Musk posted “beams are on.”

Following the 12-day war between Iran and Israel in June, Iran’s parliament passed a law formally banning the use of Starlink, introducing severe penalties for those who use or distribute the unlicensed technology, according to Iranian state media.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 20:25:54 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/YWUDLBVX5RKQZNGRXZMHBTKFSE.jpg?auth=1258bb9b3eaaa7737fd109082555de36f684aaf7c1db3dfe45e89ce0cdc9c8b7&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Two Canadian members of parliament end Taiwan trip ahead of Carney's China visit</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/two-canadian-members-parliament-end-taiwan-trip-ahead-carneys-china-visit-2026-01-12/</link><description>TORONTO, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Two Canadian Members of Parliament are ending a trip to Taiwan early this week ahead of Prime Minister Mark Carney's visit to China, they said in a statement on Monday.

Helena Jaczek and Marie-France Lalonde, who are both members of Carney's Liberal Party, said they had been pleased to work with members of all political parties on the delegation.

"As this portion of the visit concludes, informed by advice from the government, we are returning home," their statement said. "It's important that we avoid confusion with Canada's foreign policy, given the overlap with the Prime Minister's engagement in Beijing, which was only confirmed last week."

They said Canada’s position on Taiwan has not changed. The Globe and Mail newspaper reported three Conservative members of parliament remained in Taiwan on a trip sponsored by Taiwan's government.

Carney's office said the focus this week is on the prime minister's meetings in China. The Conservative Party did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

China, which claims Taiwan as its own territory, has not ruled out using force to bring the island under its control. Taiwan rejects China's claims.

The department said Luis Nino-Moncada will make a court appearance on Monday to face charges of aggravated assault of a federal officer and depredation of federal property. It said he repeatedly rammed his car into agents' vacant vehicle.

The Portland shooting came amid heightened tensions over President Donald Trump's aggressive mass deportation efforts after an ICE immigration agent shot and killed a woman in Minneapolis , Minnesota last week.

Authorities said Nino-Moncada, who was shot in the arm and is in FBI custody, has ties to Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua and is in the U.S. illegally.

The border patrol agent shot him and a woman in the car out of fear that Nino-Moncada "could strike them and other Border Patrol agents with the target vehicle," the Justice Department said.

The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees the border patrol, said last week Nino-Moncada "weaponized" his car.

The woman was identified by DHS as Yorlenys Betzabeth Zambrano-Contreras, who federal officials say was also in the U.S. illegally. She was shot in the chest.

The Justice Department alleges that she also has ties to the Venezuelan gang, was involved in prostitution and was previously involved in a shooting in Portland.

After the shooting, the pair fled in their vehicle, driving about two miles northeast before calling for medical help.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 20:27:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ZJFBL6DHDVI4VOTQRXUQ4EATVM.jpg?auth=9b81860a562504fd85ec18e1a5336fd6f938c2d07fe20bb747a8b8cdf55978bb&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US charges man shot by Border Patrol agent in Portland</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-charges-man-shot-by-border-patrol-agent-portland-2026-01-12/</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 20:27:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Ukraine's Zelenskiy: world must help Iran engineer change</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/ukraines-zelenskiy-world-must-help-iran-engineer-change-2026-01-12/</link><description>Jan 12 (Reuters) - Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Monday that the world had to help Iranians build on protests to engineer change to free them from rule that brought evil to their own and other countries, including Ukraine.

Zelenskiy, speaking in his nightly video address, described the nationwide protests gripping Iran as an "uprising".

He said the unrest showed that Russia had to rethink its close links with Iran, which have included its wide use of Iranian-made "Shahed" drones in the nearly four-year-old war against Kyiv.

"Every normal person on Earth very much wants the people of Iran to finally be fortunate enough to free themselves from the regime that exists there and that has brought so much evil, including to Ukraine and to other countries," Zelenskiy said.

"It is important that the world not miss this moment, when change is possible. Every leader, every country, international organisations must engage now and help people remove those who are responsible for Iran unfortunately being what it has been."

U.S.-based rights group HRANA said it had verified the deaths of 572 people and the arrests of more than 10,000 in protests which began on December 28.

The protests have evolved from complaints about economic hardships to calls for the fall of the clerical establishment.

Russia and Iran have developed closer ties since the Kremlin ordered the invasion of Ukraine in 2022. President Vladimir Putin and Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian signed a 20-year strategic partnership pact last year that deepened military ties and boosted cooperation in a range of areas.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 20:47:44 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/MQS75TTA7FNHTLPDO5SNVRXWQ4.jpg?auth=9cdf4932da9ab4cabe2cb1fe93f898cfab544dd38ba171b4ff4ef4a8bad7ee18&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Greenland rejects US takeover 'under any circumstance', government says</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/greenland-rejects-us-takeover-under-any-circumstance-government-says</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 20:48:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/006702e4-eff7-11f0-961e-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260112-211242-211429-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'Absence of credible alternatives' has allowed Iranian regime to survive, analyst says</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/absence-of-credible-alternatives-has-allowed-iranian-regime-to-survive-analyst-says</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 20:48:27 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/4c3f9c60-eff4-11f0-9b76-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260112-210550-211207-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Malaysia and Indonesia become the first countries to block Musk’s Grok over sexualized AI images</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/malaysia-and-indonesia-become-the-first-countries-to-block-musk-s-grok-over-sexualized-ai-images</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 20:48:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/eb674c64-eff1-11f0-9330-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/capture-833844252696553d4092667-91773306.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iranians being kept in the dark about crackdown, observer says</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/iranians-being-kept-in-the-dark-about-crackdown-observer-says</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 20:48:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/4dc4cf22-eff1-11f0-be4e-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/capture-478819749696552cb8f7970-61876481.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran has 'secretly released' Greek-owned tanker it held for two years, monitoring service says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-has-secretly-released-greek-owned-tanker-it-held-two-years-monitoring-2026-01-12/</link><description>Jan 12 (Reuters) - Iran has "secretly released" a Greek-owned tanker it seized for two years, monitoring service Tanker Trackers said in a post on X on Monday.

"He was ​hit by a long-range shot," prosecutor Nicolas ​Septe said. Local police confirmed the assassination.

“It was a moment of sorrow and grief. Suddenly we heard a gunshot, and Alain collapsed, dead,” Father Roger Polge, who officiated at the funeral service, told France 3 Corse ViaStella channel. “What is happening in our home?"

Le Monde newspaper said the prosecutor had opened an investigation into murder by an organised gang.

Orsoni, 71, led a separatist movement called the Corsican Movement for Self-Determination, which French police considered to be the legal front for the ‍armed group, the Corsican National Liberation Front-Traditional Wing.

Authorities linked ​the Corsican National Liberation Front-Traditional Wing to a series of attacks on the island ‌in the 1990s, some of which the group claimed.

Orsoni was also ‍charged, convicted and later pardoned in connection with a machine gun attack on the Iranian embassy in Paris in 1980.

Orsoni was also the president of Corsican football club ‍AC Ajaccio in the late 2000s and early 2010s.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 21:45:32 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/9bb1b4c6-eff0-11f0-b352-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/21f7240a72da53c195178d2614ac96f20181bf9a.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Writer Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie accuses Lagos hospital of negligence after son’s death</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/writer-chimamanda-ngozi-adichie-accuses-lagos-hospital-of-negligence-after-son-s-death</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 21:45:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/ea749da6-effc-11f0-b417-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/WB011690-O-01-20260112-01.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump says countries doing business with Iran face 25% tariff</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/trump-says-countries-doing-business-with-iran-face-25-tariff-2026-01-12/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 12 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday that any country that does business with Iran will be subjected to a tariff rate of 25% on any business conducted with the United States.

Officials said hundreds of apartment blocks in the capital remained without heat despite round-the-clock efforts by the crews. Humanitarian centres, dubbed "resilience points," were open for people to keep warm and charge electronic devices.

Russia has systematically attacked Ukraine's energy system since it invaded its neighbour in 2022 and the air strikes have intensified in recent months.

Zelenskiy, speaking in his nightly video address, said a programme was being launched to raise wages and provide support for participants in emergency work brigades.

He issued a new warning to heed air raid alerts as night-time temperatures sank to minus 15 Celsius (5 F) or lower.

"There is intelligence information. The Russians are preparing a new massive strike," he said.

"Drones to exhaust air defence systems and missiles. They want to take advantage of the cold. The strike may occur in the coming days. Please take care of yourselves. Protect Ukraine."

Deputy Prime Minister Oleksiy Kuleba, writing on Telegram, said 90% of Kyiv's apartment buildings have had heating restored, leaving fewer than 500 dwellings still to be connected.

Mayor Vitali Klitschko put the number with no heating at 800, most on the west bank of the Dnipro River. He said a meeting of the Kyiv city council would be convened on Thursday to debate the most pressing issues facing residents.

Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko, presenting the programme for bonus payments, said the work conducted by emergency crews stood "at the very limit of human endurance, often involving life-threatening risks across the entire country.

"This applies to specialists who, in freezing conditions, go directly to the sites of strikes and restore supplies of heat, electricity, water and gas."

Residents made their way to one of the humanitarian centres on the east bank of the river in the evening - two tents pitched on a small area of open ground.

They charged their devices and chatted, while outside, the din of whining generators filled the air.

"It's dark in the apartment. I have an electric stove, so it's impossible to heat up lunch or dinner, or make tea," said Kateryna Zubko, 67, an engineer who has lived without power, heating and water since the latest attack.

"We support each other. Ukrainians are such resilient people, I think that this war will end someday, it can't go on forever."</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 22:19:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/GKY35P4KDROEZMKZGQ56WWAIDI.jpg?auth=b993a25b43d337ca90f2310d633e7a8f9a2c010d64a15dd692b972c962335531&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Four migrants die in US ICE custody over first 10 days of 2026</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/four-migrants-die-us-ice-custody-over-first-10-days-2026-2026-01-12/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Four migrants died while in custody of U.S. immigration authorities over the first 10 days of 2026, according to government press releases, a loss of life that followed record detention deaths last year under President Donald Trump.

The incidents involved two migrants from Honduras, one from Cuba and another from Cambodia, and occurred from January 3-9, according to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

The spate of in-custody deaths coincided with the fatal shooting of a Minnesota mother of three by an ICE officer, an incident that sparked protests in Minneapolis and cities around the country.

The Trump administration aims to ramp up deportations and has increased the number of migrants in detention. As of January 7, ICE statistics showed that the agency was detaining 69,000 people. The numbers were expected to rise following a massive ICE funding infusion passed by the U.S. Congress last year.

At least 30 people died in ICE custody in 2025 , the highest level in two decades, agency figures showed.

Setareh Ghandehari, advocacy director at Detention Watch Network, called the high number of deaths "truly staggering" and urged the administration to shutter detention centers. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security and ICE did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The Cuban detainee, Geraldo Lunas Campos, 55, died on January 3 in Camp East Montana, a detention site opened by the Trump administration on the grounds of Fort Bliss in Texas.

ICE said it was investigating the death of Lunas, adding that he had become disruptive, was placed in isolation, and later found in distress. He was pronounced dead by emergency medical technicians, ICE said.

The two Honduran men - Luis Gustavo Nunez Caceres, 42, and Luis Beltran Yanez–Cruz, 68 - died in area hospitals in Houston and Indio, California, on January 5 and 6, respectively, both following heart-related issues, ICE said.

Parady La, a Cambodian man, 46, died on January 9 following severe drug withdrawal symptoms at the Federal Detention Center in Philadelphia, ICE said. The administration began using that space last year, it said.

The Trump administration has greatly reduced the number of migrants released from detention on humanitarian grounds, driving some to accept deportation.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 22:44:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/YSM3HITNWNIDFARRR6SIHRGIC4.jpg?auth=9ffc6b730d934c1a943b7bfe4d13d9236186008c27ef875d10272c764f576954&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Australia's US ambassador Rudd to step down early</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/australias-us-ambassador-rudd-step-down-early-2026-01-12/</link><description>SYDNEY, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Australia's ambassador to the United States Kevin Rudd is stepping down, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on Tuesday, a year earlier than expected following criticism from U.S. President Donald Trump.
Rudd, a former Australian prime minister, is returning to head the Asia Society think tank, Albanese told a news conference.
An announcement of Rudd's replacement would be made at a later date, he said.
"Australia and the United States are the closest of friends and allies, and this will never change," he said. "We will continue to take forward the important work that Kevin has done, some of it is, of course, ongoing work."
Rudd made several comments criticising Trump before he became ambassador, including calling him "the most destructive president in history." He later deleted that comment from social media when he was appointed ambassador.

When asked during an October event at the White House during a visit by Albanese about Rudd's past comments, Trump gestured to the ambassador across the table and said “I don’t like you either, and I probably never will”.
Following criticism from Australia's opposition, who called for him to be sacked over his remarks about Trump, Albanese said in October that Rudd would serve out his four-year term.

A White House official told Reuters when asked about Rudd's departure: "Ambassador Rudd worked well with President Trump and the administration. We wish him well."</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 22:44:16 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/DE76KOYFE5K2LNXQOVOAT4UISI.jpg?auth=2453132d886c9ff4aa1dcdbcd1fef3c3e0e6e63169240589eadc781c81e00190&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Australian writers festival in turmoil over decision to bar Palestinian author</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/australian-writers-festival-turmoil-over-decision-bar-palestinian-author-2026-01-13/</link><description>SYDNEY, Jan 13 (Reuters) - The director of one of Australia's top writers festivals resigned on Tuesday saying she could not be party to silencing a Palestinian author and warning government moves to ban protests and slogans in the aftermath of the Bondi mass shooting threatened free speech.

Louise Adler, the Jewish daughter of Holocaust survivors, said on Tuesday she was quitting her role at Adelaide Writers Week, after 180 international and Australian authors also boycotted the event following a decision by the festival's board to disinvite a Palestinian-Australian author.

Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on Tuesday announced a national day of mourning would be held on January 22 to remember the 15 people killed in last month's shooting at a Jewish Hanukkah celebration on Bondi Beach.

Police say the alleged gunmen were inspired by the Islamic State militant group, and the incident sparked nationwide calls to tackle antisemitism, and state and federal government moves to tighten hate speech laws.

The Adelaide Festival board said last Thursday it would disinvite novelist and university academic Randa Abdel-Fattah from next month's writers week because "it would not be culturally sensitive to continue to programme her at this unprecedented time, so soon after Bondi".

Abdel-Fattah said the move was "a blatant and shameless act of anti-Palestinian racism and censorship".

Adler wrote in the Guardian that the board's decision "weakens freedom of speech and is the harbinger of a less free nation, where lobbying and political pressure determine who gets to speak and who doesn't".

Adler said she was disappointed the premier of South Australia state, Peter Malinauskas, had backed the board's decision.

"With alarming insouciance protests are being outlawed, free speech is being constrained and politicians are rushing through processes to ban phrases and slogans," she added.

Former New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, British author Zadie Smith, Australian author Kathy Lette, Pulitzer Prize-winning American Percival Everett and former Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis are among the authors who said they would no longer appear at the festival in South Australia state next month, Australian media reported.

Three festival board members and the chairperson have since resigned.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 01:44:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/OR5VY6ZJCVJU7HIGHB6ZMN7XYI.jpg?auth=ffc826349225ffcc39d653c26b18477661941fc64d33b0d8840b42f5ea18be90&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Senior Russian official says Greenland could vote to join Russia if Trump does not hurry</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/senior-russian-official-says-greenland-could-vote-join-russia-if-trump-does-not-2026-01-13/</link><description>Jan 13 (Reuters) - Russian Security Council Deputy Chairman Dmitry Medvedev said Greenlanders could vote to join Russia if U.S. President Donald Trump did not move quickly to secure the Arctic island, Interfax reported on Monday.

“Trump needs to hurry. According to unverified information, in a few days there could be a sudden referendum, at which the entire 55,000-strong Greenland could vote to join Russia," Interfax reported, quoting Medvedev, a former Russian president.

"And then that’s it. No new little stars on the (U.S.) flag."

Trump has revived his push for the United States to take control of Greenland, a self-governing Danish territory, arguing Washington needs to own it to deter Russia. The U.S. president has said its location and resources make Greenland vital for national security, prompting firm objections from Denmark and Greenland.

While Russia makes no claim to Greenland, it has long monitored the island’s strategic role in Arctic security, given its position on North Atlantic routes and the presence there of a major U.S. military and space surveillance facility.

The Kremlin has not commented on Trump's renewed push but calling the Arctic a zone of Russia’s national and strategic interests, it said last year that was watching the “ rather dramatic ” debate around Greenland closely.

Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine fractured much Arctic cooperation. As climate change opens new routes and resource prospects, the region has become more contested.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 01:45:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7GM6JBHNWJISLKER26BD35BBCE.jpg?auth=f64945e966c809d55bfa3a54a82e4244ff5cfde18780abc997d176d75b6bf599&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russian missiles strike Kyiv, one dead in Kharkiv, Ukrainian officials say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/russian-missiles-strike-kyiv-one-dead-kharkiv-ukrainian-officials-say-2026-01-12/</link><description>KYIV, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Russian forces launched attacks on Ukraine's two largest cities early on Tuesday, Ukrainian officials said, killing one person in the northeastern city of Kharkiv.

Reuters witnesses heard explosions in the city, but there was no immediate word on casualties or damage.

Machado has been sidelined by Washington since US forces seized long-time authoritarian leader Nicolas Maduro on January 3 and the Trump administration announced it would be “running” Venezuela.

Disregarding Machado and her ally Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia, Trump has instead been working with acting president Delcy Rodriguez , who was left in power alongside other Maduro loyalists.

Trump has warned Rodriguez to toe Washington’s line or face consequences — particularly over granting access to the South American country’s vast oil reserves.

A US administration official told AFP that the Republican president will meet Machado at the White House on Thursday.

Venezuela , meanwhile, announced it had freed 116 more people jailed under Maduro — many detained for taking part in protests after his disputed 2024 election.

Rights groups questioned the figures, and family members clamoured for faster releases promised by Caracas under pressure from Washington.

Relatives have been camped outside prisons for days, growing increasingly restless as loved ones have failed to appear.

“We simply ask that they keep their word,” said Manuel Mendoza, who had driven six hours to be at El Rodeo prison, about 30 kilometres (19 miles) from Caracas, for his son Jose Daniel’s anticipated release.

“It’s already been four nights waiting out in the open air, suffering.”

UN experts and the opposition said only about 50 prisoners have been freed so far, out of the 800 to 1,200 that rights groups estimate are being held.

Machado on Monday urged Pope Leo XIV to “intercede” on behalf of prisoners.

“I asked him to intercede for all Venezuelans who remain kidnapped and disappeared,” Machado said after an audience with the pontiff at the Vatican.

Gonzalez Urrutia — who ran as the opposition’s presidential candidate in 2024 after Machado was disqualified by institutions loyal to Maduro — said “every hour that passes is a new form of violence against families” of prisoners.

Rodriguez, despite being a staunch Maduro ally, is negotiating with Washington, which is seeking to take advantage of Venezuela’s vast oil reserves.

US envoys visited Caracas last week to discuss reopening Washington’s embassy there, seven years after diplomatic ties were severed.

On Sunday, Trump said he was open to a meeting with Rodriguez and that his administration was working “really well” with hers.

He said he hoped the freed prisoners “will remember how lucky they got that the USA came along and did what had to be done”.

But experts mandated to a UN fact-finding mission said in a statement on Monday that the dozens of people freed so far fell “far short of Venezuela’s international human rights obligations”.

Frustration was growing among about 40 relatives still camped outside El Rodeo prison, where some had set up tents.

Rights NGO Foro Penal said 15 people had been released from the facility, but family members told AFP they were whisked away through a back exit without seeing the loved ones waiting for them.

The government in Caracas said a review of prisoner files was ongoing.

Machado said she had underscored Urrutia’s “legitimacy” in her talks with Leo and sought the pope’s backing for “the prompt advancement of the transition to democracy in Venezuela”.

The opposition and much of the international community consider Urrutia the legitimate victor of Venezuela’s last presidential election.

Machado was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize last year and dedicated it to Trump, who has made no secret of his frustration at being passed over for the award.

In Caracas on Monday, Rodriguez announced a series of ministerial changes, naming a former Maduro bodyguard as minister of the presidential office — tasked with managing her agenda and liaising with state agencies.

She also replaced the head of the presidential guard, who leads the feared counter-intelligence unit.

Her government said it was ready to pursue a “new agenda” with the European Union and Britain following talks on Monday with their envoys.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 01:45:44 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/ef91ade4-eafa-11f0-93de-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/2025-12-15T151553Z-1901097027-RC29EIAZQ1GH-RTRMADP-3-NOBEL-PRIZE-PEACE-MACHADO.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US lawmakers plan Denmark visit as Trump threatens Greenland takeover</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us-lawmakers-plan-denmark-visit-trump-threatens-greenland-takeover-2026-01-13/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 12 (Reuters) - A bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers will visit Denmark this week as President Donald Trump threatens a takeover of Greenland , an autonomous part of the kingdom of Denmark that houses a U.S. airbase.

The delegation will be led by Democratic U.S. Senator Chris Coons and will include Republican U.S. Senator Thom Tillis and Democratic Senators Jeanne Shaheen and Dick Durbin along with some members of the House of Representatives, Coons' office said in a statement on Monday.

Democratic and Republican U.S. lawmakers said last week they expected the U.S. Senate would eventually vote on legislation seeking to rein in Trump's ability to attempt to seize Greenland from Denmark, a long-time U.S. ally.

Trump has repeatedly said Washington must own Greenland to prevent Russia or China from occupying the strategically located and minerals-rich Arctic territory. He says a U.S. military presence there is not enough.

"One way or the other we are going to take Greenland," Trump has said while adding he would prefer to make a deal with Denmark.

Greenland and Denmark have said that Greenland is not for sale , but Trump has not ruled out taking it by force. Denmark and the U.S., both NATO members, are scheduled to meet this week to discuss the issue.

"As co-chair of the Senate NATO Observer Group, I believe it is critical that Congress stands united in supporting our allies and respecting the sovereignty of Denmark and Greenland," Senator Tillis from Trump's Republican Party said.

Trump's "continued threats toward Greenland are unnecessary and would only weaken our NATO alliance," Durbin added.

The delegation will be in Copenhagen on Friday and Saturday, Coons' office noted.

Republican U.S. Representative Randy Fine introduced a bill on Monday - called the Greenland Annexation and Statehood Act - that, if passed, would give Trump the authority to annex Greenland. Democratic U.S. Representative Jimmy Gomez planned a competing bill - called Greenland Sovereignty Protection Act - that would block federal money from being used to fund any of Trump's plans to takeover Greenland.

While Trump has previously threatened a takeover of the island, concerns about it were renewed after he ordered a deadly U.S. military raid earlier this month in Venezuela to seize its now ousted leader Nicolas Maduro, who was subsequently brought to New York and remains in custody.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 03:29:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/Z6SNQPUTEJM75OHLEISNAN65WY.jpg?auth=7b82848634e81523493fb324fe6b527874892c286432a1e90eb6d7f547cd295b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>G7, other allies discuss ways to reduce dependence on Chinese rare earths</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/us-urges-partners-allies-increase-critical-minerals-supply-chain-resiliency-2026-01-12/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Finance ministers from the G7 and other major economies met in Washington on Monday to discuss ways to reduce dependence on rare earths from China, including setting a price floor and new partnerships to build up alternative supplies, ministers said.

The meeting, convened by U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, included finance ministers from G7 members Japan, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Canada and the U.S. as well as officials from Australia, Mexico, South Korea and India.

U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and representatives from the U.S. Export-Import Bank and JP Morgan also attended, but no joint statement was issued by the meeting's participants.

The Treasury said in a statement that Bessent sought "to discuss solutions to secure and diversify supply chains for critical minerals, especially rare earth elements," and expressed optimism that countries would pursue "prudent de-risking over decoupling" from China.

A U.S. official said on Sunday that Bessent was going to urge participants to step up efforts to reduce reliance on critical minerals from China, which has imposed strict export controls on rare earths, most recently on supplies to Japan.

Japanese Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama told reporters on Monday evening that there was "broad agreement on the need to swiftly reduce reliance on China for rare earths."

She said she outlined short-, medium- and long-term policy approaches for G7 and like-minded countries to bolster non-Chinese rare earth supplies.

"These include creating markets based on standards such as respect for labor conditions and human rights, as well as deploying a range of policy tools - support from public financial institutions, tax and financial incentives, trade and tariff measures, quarantine measures and minimum price setting," Katayama said. "I stressed the importance of committing to these measures."

A spokesperson for China's embassy in Washington could not be immediately reached for comment.

The gathering's participating countries and the EU account for 60% of global demand for critical minerals. But China dominates the supply chain, refining between 47% and 87% of copper, lithium, cobalt, graphite and rare earths, according to the International Energy Agency.

The minerals are essential for defense technologies, semiconductors, renewable energy components, batteries and refining processes.

Last week, China banned exports of items destined for Japan's military that have civilian and military uses, including some critical minerals.

German Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil said discussions at the meeting included a potential rare-earths price floor and partnerships to boost supplies, but noted the talks had just begun with many unresolved issues.

He said rare earths and critical mineral supplies would be a central topic under the French presidency of the Group of Seven advanced economies this year.

However, he warned against an anti-China coalition, stressing that Europe needs to move faster on its own to develop supplies of important raw materials.

"What is very important to me is that we in Europe do not sit back," Klingbeil said. "Neither complaining nor self-pity helps us, we have to become active."

He added that the EU needed more financing at the bloc level, pointing to a new German raw materials fund.

The EU must also move forward urgently on recycling, Klingbeil said, citing its "big potential" for reducing dependencies and broadening supply.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 03:30:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/X3IIBJD5PZONPAHPBXJXHGQCVI.jpg?auth=8bdce6ab741b12fb9829451c9bca47c8045a28aa8108a878019330cf58151f1e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Exxon Mobil still interested in Venezuela visit despite Trump rebuke</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/exxon-mobil-still-interested-venezuela-visit-despite-trump-rebuke-2026-01-13/</link><description>HOUSTON, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) , opens new tab remains interested in visiting Venezuela and is prepared to send an assessment team there, a source familiar with the company's strategy told Reuters on Monday, a day after U.S. President Donald Trump said he might keep the oil company out of the country.

During a White House meeting on Friday alongside other top oil executives, Exxon CEO Darren Woods said Venezuela needed to make legal changes and protect investments before Exxon would commit to operating in the country.

Days later, Trump told reporters on Air Force One that he "didn't like Exxon's response," adding that he was inclined to keep the oil major out .

Exxon executives were surprised by the events, the source said, because Woods also told Trump he believed the administration could help solve Venezuela's problems.

Woods said Exxon could send a technical team to the country within weeks to begin evaluating oil infrastructure and other assets.

Exxon Mobil did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The White House meeting took place less than a week after American forces captured and removed Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro in an overnight raid. Trump has urged American energy firms to invest $100 billion to rebuild Venezuela's oil industry.

Exxon, ConocoPhillips (COP.N) , opens new tab and Chevron (CVX.N) , opens new tab were key partners of Venezuela's state oil company, PDVSA, before former President Hugo Chavez nationalized the industry between 2004 and 2007.

Chevron negotiated a deal and remained in the country, but ConocoPhillips and Exxon left and are now owed more than $13 billion collectively after lengthy arbitration cases.

Exxon and ConocoPhillips (COP.N) , opens new tab face long-term concerns that impact a decision about whether to re-enter Venezuela, which remain unchanged even after they met with Trump last week, three industry experts told Reuters.

Chevron is the only American oil major currently operating in Venezuela and it emerged from the meeting in a stronger position because it has room to invest in its existing operations to increase production, said one of the sources, a former oil executive.

"Exxon is not going to break a sweat if they're not the first in the queue to get in," one energy analyst said, declining to speak publicly about a client, adding that Trump's comments would not necessarily influence the long-term plans of any of the companies, given that big energy projects take several years to build and many more to provide a return on the investment.

On Monday, American Petroleum Institute President Mike Sommers said before the oil industry moves into Venezuela, it would need to have greater workforce security and policy reforms, including measures covering contract sanctity.

Debts from previous asset expropriations will be a "significant hurdle for many companies that may be concerned about investing in this resource," Sommers said during a briefing.

Still, he said energy assets in the country were large enough to attract significant interest and he believes the Trump administration understands industry concerns.

"The asset base in Venezuela is huge and the potential for investment is very significant," Sommers said.

The state, joined by Minneapolis and St Paul, said the Department of Homeland Security is violating the First Amendment and other constitutional protections. The lawsuit seeks a temporary restraining order to halt the enforcement action or limit the operation.

“This is, in essence, a federal invasion of the Twin Cities in Minnesota, and it must stop,” state Attorney General Keith Ellison said at a news conference. “These poorly trained, aggressive and armed agents of the federal state have terrorised Minnesota with widespread unlawful conduct.”

Homeland Security has pledged to deploy more than 2,000 immigration officers to Minnesota and says it has made more than 2,000 arrests since December. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has called the surge its largest enforcement operation ever.

Tensions flared again on Monday, five days after Renee Good was shot in the head by an ICE officer while behind the wheel of her SUV. From a large school walkout to emotional visits to a flower-covered memorial for Good, and agents firing tear gas to disperse crowds, Minneapolis remained on edge in the aftermath of the shooting.

There have been dozens of protests or vigils across the US in recent days to honour the 37-year-old mother of three and to sharply criticise the Trump administration’s tactics.

Since the deployment in the Twin Cities, whistle-blast warnings by activists are commonly heard when immigration agents flood the streets. Witnesses have frequently posted video of federal officers using tear gas to discourage members of the public from following them.

The Minnesota lawsuit accuses the Republican Trump administration of violating free speech rights by focusing enforcement on a progressive state that favours Democrats and welcomes immigrants .

“They’re targeting us based on what we look and sound like. Our residents are scared. And as local officials, we have a responsibility to act,” said St Paul Mayor Kaohly Her, who was born in Laos .

In response, Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin accused Minnesota officials of ignoring public safety.

“President Trump’s job is to protect the American people and enforce the law — no matter who your mayor, governor or state attorney general is,” McLaughlin said. “That’s what the Trump administration is doing; we have the Constitution on our side on this, and we look forward to proving that in court.”

The Trump administration has repeatedly defended the immigration agent who shot Good, saying she and her vehicle posed a threat. That explanation has been widely criticised by Minnesota Governor Tim Walz , Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and others, citing videos of the confrontation.

The federal government also faces a new lawsuit over a similar immigration crackdown in Illinois. More than 4,300 people were arrested last year in “Operation Midway Blitz” as masked agents swept the Chicago area. The lawsuit by the city and state says the campaign had a chilling effect, leaving residents afraid to leave their homes.

The Minnesota lawsuit seeks restrictions on certain tactics, among other remedies. McLaughlin called it “baseless”.

Hundreds of students on Monday walked out of Roosevelt High School in Minneapolis, where federal agents had deployed tear gas on students and staff last week. Adults wearing safety vests cleared traffic, and many parents who are Roosevelt alumni arrived wearing old school clothing.

Marchers held signs reading “ICE out” and “Welcome to Panem”, a reference to the dystopian society in "The Hunger Games" book series.

Agents also fired tear gas to disperse a crowd that gathered to see the aftermath of a car crash just a few blocks from where Good was killed. The crowd emerged as agents questioned a man whose car had been rear-ended.

“I’m glad they didn’t shoot me or something,” Christian Molina told reporters.

Standing near his mangled fender, he asked aloud: “Who’s going to pay for my car?”

In St Cloud, 65 miles (104 kilometres) northwest of Minneapolis, hundreds of people gathered outside a strip of Somali -run businesses after news spread that dozens of ICE officers were in the area.

Meanwhile, in Portland, Oregon, federal authorities filed charges against a Venezuelan national who was one of two people shot there by US Border Patrol officers on Thursday. The US Justice Department said the man used his pickup truck to strike a Border Patrol vehicle and fled the scene with a woman.

Both were shot and later arrested. Their injuries were not life-threatening. The FBI said there was no video of the incident, unlike the shooting of Good.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 03:31:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/60edb7e0-ef28-11f0-affe-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-10T220515Z-1169860487-RC2KYIA5TRK8-RTRMADP-3-USA-TRUMP-MINNESOTA.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Pacts, patronage and fear: how Myanmar's junta chief holds on to power</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/pacts-patronage-fear-how-myanmars-junta-chief-holds-power-2026-01-13/</link><description>BANGKOK, Jan 13 (Reuters) - His name is not on the ballot, and his photographs don't appear on campaign posters. But one man looms large over the general election underway in Myanmar: junta chief Min Aung Hlaing.

The 69-year-old general has ruled the impoverished Southeast Asian nation since ousting Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi's elected government in a 2021 coup. That sparked a civil war of unprecedented violence, which has displaced millions and left much of Myanmar's borderlands in rebel hands.

The general said in a New Year address, as votes for the first phase of the three-stage election were being counted, that he intends to hand over "state responsibilities" to the next government.

Suu Kyi's party, however, has been dissolved and other major opposition parties are not contesting the polls, which have been widely criticised as an exercise to keep the junta in power via proxies. The United Nations and Western rights groups have said the elections are neither free nor fair.

Reuters interviewed six people familiar with Min Aung Hlaing as well as two analysts of junta politics who offered insight into the thinking of the enigmatic general. Since the coup, he has only had limited diplomatic contact with many of Myanmar's regional neighbours and has rarely spoken to non-state-controlled media.

The junta chief and acting president is a rigid military leader, but also a political creature with a fine-tuned sense for managing the country's elites, according to three of the people and the two analysts.

Those qualities, the people said, have helped him keep power through battlefield defeats that have dented the military's prestige and hold over the country, exposing Min Aung Hlaing to criticism from supporters of the armed forces . At least 16,600 civilians have died in conflict since the coup, according to Armed Conflict Location &amp; Event Data Project, a coalition of independent international researchers.

Pulling back from absolute rule and sharing power through elections functions as "an elite management strategy, diffusing responsibility and preserving regime cohesion," said Naing Min Khant, program associate at the Institute for Strategy and Policy - Myanmar, a think-tank in Thailand.

"He became the leader not only because of military ruthlessness but because of his subtle skills that help reduce all sorts of pressure around him," said another of the people, a foreign former official who has met Min Aung Hlaing.

"I think if another person was put in that position, there may have been even more pressure on them."

Myanmar's information ministry did not reply to a request for comment on Reuters' findings.

Min Aung Hlaing has handed some generals lucrative positions atop military-linked businesses, even as he occasionally detained other senior officers, including court marshalling one likely successor.

Such moves have helped control potential rivals, according to Naing Min Khant.

"Power-sharing is managed through elite pacts embedded within the officer corps, where regime survival is closely tied to collective officer survival," the analyst said.

At the same time, Min Aung Hlaing has prioritised keeping important positions for loyalists, including some experienced at dealing with foreign leaders, two of the people said.

Diplomatic backing from China, in particular, has bolstered the general's position and supported the junta's recent limited comeback on some frontlines, Reuters reported in December .

Among the loyalists is retired military officer and former U.N. ambassador Than Swe, who serves as junta foreign minister, the people said. One of them added that the diplomat has been coaching Min Aung Hlaing as he emerges from diplomatic isolation .

Than Swe has also since been part of efforts to rebuild diplomatic relationships with the Association of Southeast Asian Nation bloc that froze ties with the generals soon after the coup.

Min Aung Hlaing's interest in politics was clear even before the coup, when he was serving as armed forces commander-in-chief, said another person familiar with the general.

A previous junta had pared back the military's outsized role in administering the country and handed power to a quasi-civilian government in the 2010s, but the general continued meeting community and religious leaders, the person said.

"All that didn't make sense, if you were only a professional soldier," they said.

The fourth of five siblings born to a family from Myanmar's south, Min Aung Hlaing read law at university in Yangon, then the country's capital.

In 1977, he passed out of the Defence Services Academy, the crucible of the officer corps and made a steady ascent through the ranks. This included time as a commander in Myanmar's historically restive borderlands.

The academy's motto - "The Triumphant Elites of the Future" - signals the institution's central role , opens new tab in shaping generations of military brass.

Most leave seeing the military as the self-appointed guardian of national unity, as well as of the rights of the majority Bamar ethnic group and the Buddhist religion many of them follow.

That sense of the generals as the country's ultimate protectors pushed Min Aung Hlaing to take absolute control in February 2021, months after a military-backed party was crushed at polls by Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy, said one of the officials familiar with his thinking.

"He felt justified in doing the coup," the official said. "Suu Kyi was not listening to him, to his concerns ."

Suu Kyi, now 80, is serving a 27-year sentence for offences including incitement, corruption and election fraud. She denies the charges.

The politician has spent previous bouts of detention in the relative comfort of house arrest. This time, the junta has not released specifics on her whereabouts or wellbeing, though it insists she is in good health.

Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim made a failed diplomatic push for the release of Suu Kyi last year, according to the foreign former official.

"Min Aung Hlaing quickly closed the door on that," the person said. "I know that this was their red line."

Anwar's office and a lawyer who previously represented Suu Kyi did not respond to requests for comment.

After casting his vote inside the heavily-guarded capital of Naypyitaw on December 28, a smiling Min Aung Hlaing walked up to a gaggle of reporters, where he was asked if he planned to become president following the polls.

"I can't simply say that I want to do this or that. I am not a leader of a political party," he said.

However, the general has recently indicated he is considering appointing a successor as armed forces chief and will himself likely move into a fully political role, said the official familiar with his thinking, without specifying what position he might take.

"There will be a new government," the source said. "He won't be holding on to (absolute) power."

Under the military-drafted constitution, the president wields significant executive power but does not have authority over the armed forces.

The president is picked by a college of elected and military-appointed lawmakers, according to the constitution. The military retains the right to select ministers in charge of national security.

Early results from the general elections put the Union Solidarity and Development Party, headed by retired generals, in the lead. The date when the final results will be announced has not been declared.

The next generation of military leaders isn't likely to take a significantly different approach toward Suu Kyi or the resistance movement, said Maj. Naung Yoe, who left the junta after the coup and now researches the civil war.

"There might be some who don't like the way the military is handling things and they don't like Min Aung Hlaing," he said.

"But that does not mean that they like the revolution."</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 04:27:48 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/E6FK432RMZKPVDJ2VAPY27FP6I.jpg?auth=75b9708bd7e22215b4530ecb62edac6a9cdb52022ca54f5020f1823f6db742c2&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Live: Vance urges diplomacy as Trump weighs possible strikes on Iran</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260113-live-vance-urges-diplomacy-as-trump-weighs-possible-strikes-on-iran</link><description>China said late on Monday that it opposed “any illicit unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction” after US President Donald Trump posted on social media that nations doing business with Iran would face a 25% tariff on US trade.

“China’s position against the indiscriminate imposition of tariffs is consistent and clear. Tariff wars and trade wars have no winners, and coercion and pressure cannot solve problems,” a spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Washington said on X.

“China firmly opposes any illicit unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction, and will take all necessary measures to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests.”

US President Donald Trump announced a 25 per cent tariff on any country doing business with Iran, ramping up pressure as a rights group estimated that a crackdown on protests has killed at least 648 people.

Trump, who has repeatedly threatened Iran with military intervention, said in a social media post on Monday that the new levies would “immediately” hit the Islamic republic’s trading partners that also do business with the United States.

“This Order is final and conclusive,” he wrote, without specifying which countries would be affected.

Iran’s main trading partners are China, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and Iraq, according to the economic database Trading Economics.

Some senior aides in President Donald Trump’s administration, led by Vice President JD Vance, are urging Trump to try diplomacy before launching strikes against Iran, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday, citing U.S. officials.

The White House was weighing an offer from Tehran to engage in talks over its nuclear programme as Trump appeared to be considering authorising military action against Iran.

A spokesman for Vance said the Journal’s report was not accurate.

“Vice President Vance and Secretary of State Rubio together are presenting a suite of options to the President, ranging from a diplomatic approach to military actions,” said William Martin, Vance’s communications director.

“They are presenting those options without bias or favour.”

Welcome to our liveblog dedicated to the ongoing situation in Iran.

US President Donald Trump is considering air strikes on Iran to stop a crackdown on protesters, the White House said, adding that people were being "killed on the streets".

Trump said that any country that does business ​with Iran will ‍be subjected to a ​tariff rate of 25 percent ​on any business conducted with the United States.

At least 648 protesters have been killed in the crackdown by Iranian security forces on a protest movement that has shaken the Islamic republic, Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHR) said, warning the actual toll could be far higher.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 04:28:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/3624ce26-eff6-11f0-93be-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-12T180515Z-1315397747-RC2RZIAW1GCL-RTRMADP-3-IRAN-ECONOMY-PROTESTS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russian attack on Ukrainian city of Kharkiv kills two, wounds several others</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260113-russian-attack-on-ukrainian-city-of-kharkiv-kills-two-wounds-several-others</link><description>A Russian attack on Ukraine’s northeastern city of Kharkiv killed two people and wounded several others, the regional governor said early on Tuesday.

Moscow has pummelled Ukraine with daily drone and missile barrages in recent months, targeting energy infrastructure and cutting power supplies during the frigid depths of winter.

Russia ’s use last week of a nuclear-capable Oreshnik ballistic missile against Ukraine drew condemnation from Kyiv’s allies, including Washington , which described the strike as a “dangerous and inexplicable escalation of this war”.

Moscow said on Monday the missile struck an aviation repair factory in the Lviv region and was fired in response to what it claimed was a Ukrainian attempt to strike one of Russian President Vladimir Putin ’s residences — an allegation Kyiv has denied.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 04:28:39 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/9f0c6484-f02e-11f0-b8ce-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26002523298155.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Japan's Takaichi, South Korea's Lee meet to discuss security, economic ties</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/japans-takaichi-south-koreas-lee-meet-discuss-security-economic-ties-2026-01-13/</link><description>TOKYO, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi and South Korean President Lee Jae Myung met in Japan on Tuesday as the two East Asian neighbours look to bolster security and economic cooperation.

The two leaders are widely expected to discuss denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula, the fate of Japanese nationals abducted by North Korea and cooperation in areas such as artificial intelligence and semiconductors.

The meeting in Nara, Takaichi's home prefecture, comes a week after Lee met Chinese President Xi Jinping. Tokyo and Beijing remain locked in a diplomatic dispute following remarks by Takaichi that Japan could deploy its forces if a Chinese attack on Taiwan posed an existential threat.

China regards Taiwan as part of its territory, a claim the self-governing island rejects.

Lee, who will spend two days in Japan, said earlier that while the diplomatic stand-off was not desirable for regional peace, he would not intervene in the dispute.

Takaichi and Lee will deliver a joint statement after their summit.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:34:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5WBR5X67D5NTRMFQ2DLEXO7OOQ.jpg?auth=e383be07a873dc1bc36570c130936fb6a7a901cb5d44ad3cd80e0128b763fbf0&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Indonesia's Prabowo affirms commitment to new capital city in first visit as president</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/indonesias-prabowo-affirms-commitment-new-capital-city-first-visit-president-2026-01-13/</link><description>JAKARTA, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Indonesia's Prabowo Subianto reiterated his commitment to a $32 billion project to build the country's new capital city as he made his first overnight stay there as president, the government said.

Questions about the fate of the Nusantara capital city project have lingered since Prabowo took office in October 2024.

The project is a legacy of his predecessor, Joko Widodo, who first announced his plan to move the capital 1,200 km (745 miles) away from overcrowded and sinking Jakarta in Java island in 2019.

Construction of the city in a remote, southeastern part of Borneo island only began in 2022 after delays due to the pandemic and Widodo missed his target of moving the government by the end of his second and final term in 2024.

Analysts have said Prabowo is unlikely to have the fiscal space to fund his key programmes while continuing to build Nusantara, which Widodo had envisioned as a green, futuristic capital surrounded by forest.

Prabowo's visit, scheduled until Tuesday, "marks an important momentum for the journey to build the Nusantara capital city," his office said in a statement late on Monday.

"President Prabowo's presence in Nusantara demonstrates the government's commitment to ensuring the development in the area proceeds according to plan and is sustainable," it said.

The Nusantara National Capital Authority, which oversees the development, said in a separate statement that offices and supporting infrastructure for the executive branch were ready.

Construction was underway to meet a completion target of 2028 for buildings for the legislative and judicial branches of government, it said.

Prabowo last year approved a budget of 48.8 trillion rupiah ($2.89 billion) for the project until 2029, only about 60% of what Widodo spent between 2022 and 2024.

Prabowo's government ran a budget deficit of 2.92% of GDP in 2025, among the largest in two decades and close to a legal deficit ceiling of 3% of GDP.

The Constitutional Court last year halved the maximum duration of land rights for investors in Nusantara, dealing another blow to the project.

Le Pen was in March handed a five-year ban from holding public office , effective immediately, after she and eight other former National Rally (RN) lawmakers were found guilty of misappropriating over 4 million euros ($4.67 million) of EU funds, while the party itself and a dozen parliamentary assistants were found guilty of receiving it.

Judges said that between 2004 and 2016, Le Pen and others had used funds destined for work at the European Parliament to pay staff who were actually working for the party.

Le Pen said the way she and her co-defendants used the money was legitimate.

"My only line of defence for this appeal trial will be the same as during the first trial: telling the truth," Le Pen told reporters on Monday.

"The case will be reset and judged by new judges," she added. "I hope to convince them of my innocence."

Le Pen also initially received a four-year prison sentence -- two years of which were suspended and two years to be served under home detention, and a 100,000 euro ($116,830) fine. Unlike the ban, those penalties did not take effect because she appealed.

The RN and 10 others found guilty of diverting European Parliament funds or receiving these funds have also appealed.

The hearing begins on Tuesday and is due to end on February 12.

Le Pen's lawyers, Rodolphe Bosselut and Sandra Chirac Kollarik, declined to comment ahead of the hearing.

The European Parliament's lawyer Patrick Maisonneuve said he hoped Le Pen and her co-defendants' convictions would be upheld, including more than 3 million euro awarded in damages to the European Parliament. The RN was also ordered to pay a 2 million euro fine, with half the amount suspended.

A ruling is expected before the summer, meaning Le Pen's hopes of running in 2027 remain alive if her five-year ban is revoked or drastically curtailed.

If she cannot run, her protege, 30-year-old RN party president Jordan Bardella , is expected to step in.

Farmers in France, the European Union's largest agricultural producer, and other member states have been protesting for months over the EU-Mercosur deal and numerous local grievances.

The demonstration on Tuesday was organised by the FNSEA, which is one of France's largest farm unions.

The Paris police said it estimated around 350 tractors at the demonstration. One convoy of tractors had converged by the Arc de Triomphe, while another convoy arrived by the French parliament building.

"The Mercosur agreement was approved even though the European Parliament hasn't had its say. This is going to lead to imports of foreign goods that we are perfectly able to produce in France and that don't respect standards which are imposed on French farming," said Damien Greffin, vice president of the FNSEA and a farmer from the Paris region.

Greffin said farmers would protest in front of the French parliament on Tuesday, and were also planning to demonstrate at the European Parliament in Strasbourg on January 20.

The Mercosur deal's approval by most EU states on Friday, despite France's rejection, has intensified pressure on the government from farmers and opposition parties, some of which have filed no-confidence motions .

A separate farmers' union, the Coordination Rurale, had already brought tractors below the Eiffel Tower and the Arc de Triomphe last Thursday in a surprise demonstration.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 06:36:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/2INP47D55NNPRMBQBEK56KTHPY.jpg?auth=7054bb52c92e500aad7293ec0a7138e6759401558d0c055e5c2688167ef86a13&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni seeks seventh term after four decades in power</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/ugandan-president-yoweri-museveni-seeks-seventh-term-after-four-decades-power-2026-01-13/</link><description>Jan 13 (Reuters) - When Yoweri Museveni seized power in Uganda in 1986, he said "the problem of Africa in general and Uganda in particular is not the people but leaders who want to overstay in power."

The 81-year-old president and former rebel is seeking a seventh term in office on Thursday after nearly four decades leading the East African nation, the vast majority of whose citizens have never known any other leader.

Museveni came to power on a wave of optimism after leading insurgencies against autocratic governments. That goodwill was soon squandered amid allegations of graft and authoritarianism.

"Corruption has been central to his rule from the beginning," Kristof Titeca, a professor at the University of Antwerp, told Reuters.

Museveni has acknowledged that some government officials have engaged in corrupt practices but says all those who have been caught have been prosecuted.

The canny political strategist has also cultivated foreign allies by embracing the security priorities of Western powers, deploying peacekeepers to hotspots such as Somalia and South Sudan and welcoming huge numbers of refugees to Uganda.

In his own country, his record has been mixed.

His government won praise for tackling the AIDS epidemic and for beating back the Lord's Resistance Army rebel group that brutalised Ugandans for nearly 20 years.

But widespread corruption hollowed out state services and just one in four Ugandan children entering primary school makes it to secondary school, according to the United Nations children's agency UNICEF, while well-paid jobs remain largely out of reach for many.

Born to Christian nomadic pastoralists, Museveni secured admission to an elite secondary school and went on to study political science at a university in neighbouring Tanzania.

There, he founded a militant movement that eventually helped force out President Idi Amin, with Milton Obote taking over as Uganda's leader in 1980.

Obote was toppled in a coup in 1985. The following year, the military wing of Museveni's National Resistance Movement overthrew Tito Okello, who had become president.

"This is not a mere change of guard," Museveni said at his swearing-in. "This is a fundamental change in the politics of our government."

His efforts to attract foreign investment, establish order and raise the standard of living were initially applauded by the West. But as Uganda's economy picked up, so did public anger over corruption.

Under a privatisation programme, dozens of state enterprises were sold to Museveni's relatives and cronies at fire-sale prices, according to parliamentary reports which said some of the proceeds were embezzled.

Kizza Besigye, Museveni's doctor during his years in the bush, fell out with him, accusing him of presiding over corruption and rights abuses.

Museveni has won all six presidential elections he has contested, including four against Besigye, who was arrested in 2024 and faces treason charges.

In 2005, parliament scrapped presidential term limits, a move critics said was aimed at letting him keep power for life.

Museveni's election opponents rejected election results over alleged irregularities. The authorities denied the allegations and police cracked down on demonstrations by opposition supporters.

Museveni dismissed criticism from Western powers, saying in 2006: "If the international community has lost confidence in us, then that is a compliment because they are habitually wrong."

He also sought to cultivate ties with other countries, including China, Russia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates, to reduce Uganda's dependence on the West.

The discovery of substantial oil deposits buoyed his status, leading to agreements with energy giants TotalEnergies and CNOOC to build an export pipeline.

Muzeveni's main rival in Thursday's presidential election is Bobi Wine , a 43-year-old pop star. Political analysts say that while victory for Museveni is all but certain, the road ahead is clouded by uncertainty, with the president starting to show signs of frailty .

"The big question looming over the election is the question of succession," university professor Titeca said, reflecting on the rapid rise of Muhoozi Kainerugaba, Museveni's son and Uganda's military chief.

Uganda's opposition has accused Museveni of fast-tracking Kainerugaba's military career to prepare him to eventually succeed him, despite the 51-year-old frequently taking to X to make inflammatory remarks, while veteran politicians who once fought alongside Museveni in the bush have sidelined.

The election outcome could determine Museveni's next move, with a poor showing potentially prompting him to promote other party members and deflect criticism of an outright dynastic succession, said former newspaper editor Charles Onyango-Obbo.

"This is less about the results that will be announced, and more about the mood on the ground," said Onyango-Obbo, adding that a handover could be some years away.

"Museveni is more frail now, but he is a workaholic... he will not leave even if he needs to use a walking stick," he said.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 06:36:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/I5CY4BWVSJNEHPISG24X45P6MM.jpg?auth=9117e9d3d166ea48506474718d835bf73bac71555a934978e27daebd5231f9b6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Pop star Bobi Wine sets sights on Ugandan presidency despite campaign violence</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/pop-star-bobi-wine-sets-sights-ugandan-presidency-despite-campaign-violence-2026-01-13/</link><description>Jan 13 (Reuters) - Ugandan pop star and opposition candidate Bobi Wine says he has been beaten, tasered and attacked with teargas and pepper spray while campaigning against long-serving President Yoweri Museveni.

Now 43, and nearly a decade into his political career, violence on the campaign trail , opens new tab comes as no surprise to a man who has built his political identity on uncompromising opposition to what he calls Museveni's "dictatorship".

Wine, whose legal name is Robert Kyagulanyi, is not widely thought to have any chance of winning Thursday's election against a president who has been in power since 1986, when Wine was just three.

But by mobilizing millions of disenchanted young Ugandans in his second bid for the presidency, Wine has emerged as Museveni's most formidable challenger in years, at a time when the 81-year-old Museveni is thought to be planning his succession.

"Every time we go through this treacherous atmosphere and we get to the people, it's like a breath of fresh air," Wine told Reuters this month.

"The knowledge that the regime is actually doing this to 'break my back', that they're doing this to demoralize us - we choose to deliberately not stop, just to show them that we can keep going."

The government has said the security forces intervened only when Wine supporters violated campaign rules by blocking traffic or holding events outside prescribed times.

Museveni has often dismissed Wine as an agent of foreign interests, including those who wanted to promote homosexuality.

The charge aims to erode Wine's support in the predominantly Christian and conservative country, which has some of the world's harshest anti-gay laws.

Wine took on Museveni in 2021 in an election marred by the security forces killing more than 50 opposition supporters on the campaign trail and by accusations of widespread fraud. Wine was detained several times during the campaign and started wearing a bullet-proof jacket and helmet.

He later withdrew a court case challenging the result, in which Museveni was credited with winning 58% of the vote, and accused the judges hearing it of bias. The U.S. government said the poll was neither free nor fair, charges rejected by Museveni's government.

During this campaign, security forces have repeatedly fired live bullets and teargas at Wine's campaign events, killing at least one person, and have arrested hundreds of his supporters.

With Museveni's election victory all but assured, attention has focused on the vote's implications for the president's eventual succession.

Museveni is widely believed to want to hand power eventually to his son and military chief, Muhoozi Kainerugaba, and is seeking a wide margin of victory to assert his authority. He will also be keen to avoid widespread protests that might undermine his position and fuel divisions in the ruling party.

Museveni has denied grooming Kainerugaba to succeed him.

The 20th child in a polygamous family of 33 siblings, Wine has said his music and politics were inspired by the struggles his mother faced as she hawked street food in the capital Kampala's Kamwokya slum.

His musical career took off in the early 2000s with songs decrying urban poverty and political oppression, backed by catchy, feel-good beats that made him one of East Africa's most popular artists.

"When the going gets tough, the tough must get going especially when leaders become misleaders and mentors become tormentors," he sang in a 2016 song titled "Situka", which means "Rise Up" in the local Luganda language.

He joined parliament in 2017 after securing a surprise landslide victory in an election for a constituency near Kampala and increased his political clout by channeling the anger of young people.

Over 73% of Uganda's about 46 million people are under the age of 30, and the percentage of young people not working, studying or training is over 42%, according to a government census from 2024.

Wine says that if he were elected, he would focus on restoring the rule of law, boosting employment and stamping out corruption.

Some Ugandans, including government critics, have bemoaned the lack of specificity in Wine's proposals. LGBTQ rights activists have criticised him for not more vigorously opposing a 2023 law that imposed the death penalty for certain same-sex acts.

Wine criticised the law as a political ploy and has pledged not to persecute LGBTQ people, but did not directly condemn its contents.

He has also been unable to unite Uganda's opposition behind him, so six other candidates are also challenging Museveni.

Writing on social media in 2024, Wine attributed the opposition's lack of unity to Museveni's success in co-opting it.

Some people, he wrote, are "zero concerned about removing Museveni as long as they're comfortable in the opposition".

The Australian Federal Police said their investigation began after receiving FBI intelligence about an Australian-based member of an online crime network suspected of being linked to major "swatting" hoax calls.

Police executed a search warrant at the boy’s home in regional New South Wales state last month, seizing a number of electronic devices and a prohibited firearm.

They charged him with 12 counts of telecommunications offences, alleging the boy made multiple hoax calls to emergency services falsely claiming mass shootings were taking place at U.S. retail and educational institutions.

The boy was also charged with one count of unauthorised possession of a prohibited firearm.

"In this investigation, a young boy from regional NSW allegedly caused widespread alarm and turmoil to thousands of people, businesses and services in the United States, resulting in significant financial implications," said Graeme Marshall, AFP acting assistant commissioner.

Marshall said such crimes were often perpetrated by young males aged 11-25 to achieve status, notoriety and recognition in their online groups.

FBI International Operations Division Assistant Director Jason Kaplan said swatting was a dangerous and disruptive crime that endangered lives and drained critical emergency resources.

"This case demonstrates that anonymity online is an illusion, and we are committed to working with the AFP, our international partners, and private sector partners to identify and hold accountable those who exploit technology to cause harm to communities," he said.

The boy was investigated through AFP’s Taskforce Pompilid, launched in October last year to target members of decentralised crime networks.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 06:37:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Canadian prime minister visits China after nearly a decade of tense relations</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/canadian-prime-minister-visits-china-after-nearly-decade-tense-relations-2026-01-13/</link><description>OTTAWA, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney departs for China on Tuesday, where he will discuss trade and international security at a time when Canada faces uncertain relations with the U.S. due to a trade war and annexation threats from President Donald Trump.

It is the first visit to Beijing by a Canadian prime minister since 2017 and could mark a critical shift in ties between the two countries as Canada seeks new trade and security partnerships.

Carney agreed to visit China last October when he and Chinese President Xi Jinping met in South Korea. It was an encounter that offered no breakthroughs but suggested potential for deeper ties after a fractious relationship under former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau , which had soured after Canada arrested the chief financial officer of Chinese firm Huawei in 2018.

This time, experts expect some deals - or at least promises of future deals - to be struck. Senior Canadian officials said Carney would sign a number of memoranda that are still under discussion.

Greg MacEachern, a former senior Liberal ministerial adviser, said he expected the trip would yield results beyond mere symbolism.

"When the Prime Minister is invited to China, it is not for window dressing," he said, adding the trip would be monitored in Washington.

"There's a political risk this could upset President Trump, but Prime Minister Carney clearly wants to send the message that Canada is open for business. And the Canadian government has made the calculation that it's worth it."

Deals could include more exports of Canadian crude to China, according to a source informed of the discussions.

Canada exports some 90% of its oil to the United States but a planned increase in U.S. oil imports from Venezuela could decrease U.S. demand for Canadian crude.

Senior Canadian officials said they expected progress but not the definitive elimination of Chinese tariffs on Canadian canola exports during the visit.

China looks forward to deepening mutual trust with Canada during the January 14-17 visit, the Chinese foreign ministry said.

“Both Canada and China want to signal their good intentions, so they each need to give away something,” said Lynette Ong, a professor of Chinese politics at the University of Toronto.

China announced preliminary anti-dumping duties on Canadian canola imports in August, escalating a year-long trade dispute that began with Ottawa's imposition of tariffs on Chinese electric vehicle imports a year earlier. The tariffs have virtually eliminated all canola exports to China, which was previously the biggest export market for Canadian canola.

Ong said the EV tariff was introduced during the administration of former U.S. President Joe Biden and the recent rupture in Canada’s relationship with the U.S. made keeping it unnecessary, because alignment with Washington had become less of a priority for Ottawa. China is Canada’s second-biggest trading partner after the U.S.

Doug Ford , premier of Ontario, Canada’s most populous province and auto hub, urged Carney not to "back down," saying the EV tariffs should only be lifted if China opens a manufacturing facility in Ontario.

Colin Hornby, head of the Manitoba farm group Keystone Agricultural Producers, said he did not expect an agreement to eliminate the canola tariffs during the trip but was optimistic something could happen in the coming weeks or months.

Vina Nadjibulla, vice-president of the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada, warned more cooperation with China in sectors like AI and critical minerals could jeopardize Canadian security, however.

“There are clear red lines not to be crossed,” she said.

Canada has previously voiced concerns about human rights violations in China, including the jailing of pro-democracy media mogul Jimmy Lai, the secret execution of four Canadians in China last year and past interference in Canadian elections .

Cheuk Kwan, co-chair of the Toronto Association for Democracy in China, said he hoped Canada would “not fall into the trap of appeasing China just to secure bilateral trade agreements.”

Two Canadian Members of Parliament said on Monday they were ending a trip to democratically governed Taiwan, which China claims as its own territory, early this week ahead of Carney's visit to China to avoid confusion with Canada's foreign policy.

China's plans to welcome Carney at Beijing's Great Hall of the People, arguably the country's grandest government building, may be part of a "charm offensive," said Joseph Torigian, an expert in Chinese politics at American University.

Torigian suggested China might be looking to burnish its global reputation after the U.S. seizure of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro earlier this month.

Farmers in France , the European Union 's largest ‍agricultural producer, and other member states have been protesting for months over the EU-Mercosur ​deal and numerous local grievances.

The demonstration on Tuesday ​was organised by the FNSEA, which is one of France's largest farm unions.

"The Mercosur agreement was approved even though the European Parliament hasn't had its say. This is going to lead to imports of foreign goods that we are perfectly able to produce in ‍France and that don't respect standards which are imposed on French farming," ​said Damien Greffin, vice president of the FNSEA and a farmer from the Paris region.

Greffin said farmers would protest ‌in front of the French parliament on Tuesday, and were also planning to demonstrate at the ‍European Parliament in Strasbourg on January 20.

The Mercosur deal's approval by most EU states on Friday , despite France's rejection, has intensified pressure on the government from farmers and opposition parties, some of which have filed no-confidence motions.

A separate farmers' union, the Coordination ‍Rurale, had already brought tractors below the Eiffel Tower and the ‌Arc de Triomphe ​last Thursday in a surprise demonstration.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 06:38:48 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/a7ac98b8-f045-11f0-ae18-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/000-92EG4XQ.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>France's far-right Le Pen appeals graft conviction with 2027 presidential bid on the line</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260113-france-le-pen-returns-to-court-with-2027-presidency-bid-on-the-line</link><description>Far-right leader Marine Le Pen , who needs to have a graft conviction overturned to seize her best chance at the French presidency, risks seeing her life's work upended if she loses her appeal.

Le Pen took over leadership of the National Front (FN) in 2011 from her father Jean-Marie, who co-founded France 's main postwar far-right movement.

In a move to distance it from the legacy of her father, who openly made antisemitic and racist statements, she renamed the party the National Rally (RN) and embarked on a policy she dubbed "de-demonisation".

The work bore fruit. In snap legislative polls in summer 2023, the RN emerged as the largest single party in the National Assembly – although without the outright majority it had targeted.

Critics accuse the party of still being inherently racist, taking too long to distance itself from Russia after its invasion of Ukraine and resorting to corrupt tactics to ease its strained finances, allegations Le Pen denies.

But by playing on people's day-to-day concerns about immigration and the cost of living, Le Pen was seen as having her best chance to become France's president in 2027 after three unsuccessful attempts.

But her conviction last year, involving the use of fake jobs at the European Union parliament to channel funds to her party to employ people in France, has posed a potentially insurmountable hurdle to her long-sought end goal.

She was banned from standing for office for five years, which effectively disqualified her from running in next year's presidential election.

Le Pen, 57, has said prosecutors wanted her "political death", adding that she was being put on trial as a "political target".

With her own ambitions hanging in the balance, she has backed her young lieutenant and protege, 30-year-old Jordan Bardella, to run in her place if needed.

"Bardella can win instead of me," she told La Tribune Dimanche in December.

A poll in November predicted that Bardella – who is the RN party chief and not among those accused in the trial against Le Pen – would win the second round of the 2027 elections, no matter who stands against him.

After coming third in the 2012 presidential polls, Le Pen made the run-off in 2017 and 2022 but was beaten both times by Emmanuel Macron.

Yet 2027 could be different, with Macron not allowed to stand again under France's constitution.

Le Pen's life has been marked by the legacy of her outwardly racist father, a veteran of the long war in Algeria that ultimately led to the former French colony's independence.

She expelled her father, who once called the gas chambers of the Holocaust a "detail of history", from the party in 2011, helping to temper its toxic image.

But his death last year at the age of 96 plunged his daughter into grief.

"I will never forgive myself" for expelling him, she said, describing him as a "warrior" in a tribute.

"I know it caused him immense pain," she said of the man opponents nicknamed "the devil of the republic".

"This decision was one of the most difficult of my life. And until the end of my life, I will always ask myself the question: 'Could I have done this differently?'," she said.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 07:26:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/767e2e1a-f035-11f0-b1be-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26012632115284.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>French museums hike prices for non-Europeans, sparking ‘dual pricing’ row</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260113-french-museum-fare-hikes-for-non-european-tourists-spark-outcry</link><description>Should foreign tourists pay more for state-funded galleries than locals, or should art be accessible to all, without discrimination ? France is hiking prices for non-Europeans at the Louvre this week, provoking debate about so-called "dual pricing".

From Wednesday, any adult visitor from outside the European Union , Iceland , Liechtenstein and Norway will have to pay 32 euros ($37) to enter the Louvre – a 45-percent increase – while the Palace of Versailles will up its prices by three euros.

Americans , UK citizens and Chinese nationals, who are some of the museum's most numerous foreign visitors, will be among those affected, as will tourists from poorer countries.

The French move has few precedents elsewhere in Europe, but is more common in developing countries, where tariffs at sites such as Machu Picchu in Peru or the Taj Mahal in India vary.

Trade unions at the Louvre have denounced the policy as "shocking philosophically, socially and on a human level" and have called for strike action over the change, along with a raft of other complaints.

They argue that the museum's vast collection of 500,000 items, including many from Egypt, the Middle East or Africa, hold universal human value.

While rejecting discriminatory pricing on principle, they are also worried for practical reasons, as staff will now need to check visitors' identity papers.

French academic Patrick Poncet has drawn a parallel between France's move and the policies of US President Donald Trump , whose administration hiked the cost for foreign tourists of visiting US National Parks by $100 on January 1.

The French policy was "symptomatic of the return, as elsewhere in the world, of unabashed nationalism", Poncet wrote in Le Monde newspaper last month.

Other state-owned French tourist hotspots are also hiking their fees, including the Chambord Palace in the Loire region and the national opera house in Paris.

The government has justified the increases on financial grounds, looking to raise 20-30 million euros annually at a time when it is under pressure to boost revenues and cut spending.

Some of the funds will go towards a colossal plan to renovate the Louvre, which French President Emmanuel Macron announced last year.

Estimated to cost around a billion euros, unions and some art critics have called the project wasteful.

Everyone agrees the Louvre is in poor shape, however, with a recent water leak, structural problems and an embarrassing daylight robbery in October focusing minds.

"I want visitors from outside the EU to pay more for their entry tickets and for that surcharge to go toward funding the renovation of our national heritage," Culture Minister Rachida Dati said at the end of 2024 as she announced the hikes.

"The French are not meant to pay for everything all by themselves," she added.

It remains to be seen whether the break with European convention by the continent's most-visited country will spur other cultural destinations to follow suit.

Pricing based on age is commonplace in Europe, with access for under-18s free at places such as the Acropolis in Athens, the Prado in Madrid or the Colosseum in Rome to encourage them to visit.

The Louvre will remain free for minors from all countries and Europeans under 26.

Other destinations, such as the Doge's Palace in Venice, offer free entrance for city residents.

Britain has long had a policy of offering universal free access to permanent collections at its national galleries and museums.

But the former director of the British Museum, Mark Jones, backed fee-paying in one of his last interviews in charge, telling The Sunday Times newspaper in 2024 that "it would make sense for us to charge overseas visitors for admission".

The proposal prompted debate but has not been adopted.

A research paper published last year by The Cultural Policy Unit, a British museum think tank, opposed it for both practical and philosophical reasons.

It would reduce entries, lengthen queue times and overturn a centuries-old policy, the report concluded.

"Britain holds its national collections for the world – not just its own residents," it objected.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 07:26:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/7977114a-b250-11f0-b753-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/ab60a476cb60b3827e1aee4437aff129ff660a65.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Georgians set decorative tree ablaze to usher in hope for new year</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/georgians-set-decorative-tree-ablaze-usher-hope-new-year-2026-01-13/</link><description>TEZERI, Georgia, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Outside a wooden cabin in central Georgia, local villager Natia Gedenidze places an ornamental tree no more than one metre (3.28 ft) tall in the packed snow, and with the swift strike of a match, sets it ablaze.

"This is the Georgian Christmas tree with which we celebrated the New Year," she said.

"Now that the New Year celebrations are over, we burn and throw away everything old and we greet the New Year with new hopes and new love."

Made by stripping back the branches from dried walnut or hazelnut trees, the "chichilaki", as the trees are known, are designed to look like the beard of the fourth-century Saint Basil, who was known for caring for the poor and destitute.

Popular in western Georgia but found throughout the country, chichilaki are traditionally put on display in homes on Georgian Orthodox Christmas, on January 7, and are ceremonially burned on Epiphany, which falls on January 19, to symbolise the shaking off of the previous year's woes.

Another villager, Mariam Gulordava, sitting in her workshop surrounded by dozens of chichilaki, runs her knife down the length of the tree with an expert hand, adding satisfying new bunches of curlicues to the bushy white beard at the tree's base.

"Hazelnuts... are a symbol of prosperity and well-being," she said, adding that after the old chichilaki is burned, a new one is brought into the home and kept there for the whole year.

At local plant shop Gardenia, owner Zura Shevardnadze hawks chichilaki in the hopes of keeping the traditions of his ancestors alive. When he was a child, a chichilaki always stood in his parents' home in wintertime.

"All Georgians believe, especially in western Georgia, that without chichilaki, the real New Year will not come," Shevarnadze said.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 08:32:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/JHEIHZ5QWZJMXA5WU4LDZLXNJA.jpg?auth=9337ab60a9c24df1fe32dabce02912171c0ee5d2cd55edfdd585ff314680c83f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Uganda orders two rights groups to halt work days before election</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/uganda-orders-two-rights-groups-halt-work-days-before-election-2026-01-13/</link><description>KAMPALA, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Uganda's government has ordered two local rights groups to halt their work days before Thursday's election, which the United Nations Human Rights Office says is taking place in an atmosphere of repression and intimidation.

The authorities have detained hundreds of opposition supporters, the UN agency had said in a report in November, ahead of the January 15 election in which President Yoweri Museveni, 81, is looking to extend his four-decade rule .

Museveni, who came to power in 1986 after leading a five-year rebellion, is Africa's third-longest ruling head of state.

He has changed the constitution twice to remove age and term limits, and his dominance of Ugandan institutions means there is little prospect of an election upset in the East African country of 46 million, political analysts say.

The two watchdogs told to stop their work, Chapter Four Uganda and Human Rights Network for Journalists-Uganda (HRNJ-U), have denounced rights violations including the alleged arbitrary detention and torture of opposition supporters and journalists.

The state-run National Bureau for NGOs, in a letter to Chapter Four seen by Reuters on Tuesday, said it had received information the watchdog was involved in activities "prejudicial" to Uganda's security and "should cease operations ... with immediate effect."

The UN Human Rights Office said in a report on Friday that the police and military had used live ammunition to disperse peaceful rallies, conducted arbitrary detentions and abducted opposition supporters ahead of the vote.

A Ugandan government spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment on the report.

Robert Ssempala, who heads HRNJ-U, told Reuters he had received the same letter ordering his organisation to stop operating.

Stephen Okello, head of the state NGO bureau, confirmed to Reuters that he had written the letters.

Last month, police raided the house of Sarah Bireete, an outspoken critic of rights violations and a frequent guest on local political talk shows and radio stations, and detained her.

She was charged with offences related to unlawful disclosure of voter information. She denied the charges and remains in jail.

The government has defended the security forces' actions as a justified response to what it called lawless conduct by opposition supporters.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 08:32:26 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HA57JWWSPZLTFF7HKTNIUJ4DZQ.jpg?auth=d176f0632274c87a6e6c5c715b33f38cd2e2c6fe618797f6c941686edd5d9a97&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>BBC seeks to have Trump's $10 billion lawsuit dismissed</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/bbc-seeks-have-trumps-10-billion-lawsuit-dismissed-2026-01-13/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 13 (Reuters) - The BBC will file a motion to dismiss U.S. President Donald Trump's $10 billion lawsuit over its editing of a speech that made it appear he had directed supporters to storm the U.S. Capitol.

In a filing late on Monday, the broadcaster argued that the court in Florida lacked personal jurisdiction in the case because it did not broadcast the programme in Florida, and that the president could not prove damages because he was re-elected after it aired.

Trump said Britain's publicly owned broadcaster defamed him by splicing together parts of a January 6, 2021, speech, including one section where he told supporters to march on the Capitol and another where he said "fight like hell." It omitted a section in which he called for peaceful protest.

Trump's lawsuit alleges the BBC violated a Florida law that bars deceptive and unfair trade practices. He is seeking at least $5 billion in damages for each of the lawsuit's two counts.

The BBC has apologised for the editing which appeared on its Panorama documentary programme but said it would defend the case.

In the filing on Monday, the BBC said Trump could not plausibly allege that the documentary was published with "actual malice."

It said it would move to dismiss the complaint and asked the court to stay the merits-based discovery phase, when both sides can obtain evidence from other parties in the lawsuit.

The BBC said engaging in unbounded merits-based discovery while the motion to dismiss was pending would subject the defendants to "considerable burdens and costs" that will be unnecessary if the motion is granted.

The BBC is funded by a mandatory licence fee on all television-watching households.

"As Plaintiff failed to plead actual damages, claiming only vague 'harm to his professional and occupational interests,' his claim fails," the BBC filing stated.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 09:29:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/QLHOPXPCQJPRFMMFQZWP7HAH4A.jpg?auth=47d79285439b0a0ee7ca71d7d74d55c525bbb38830452e740bb469a40194101e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran's leadership is in its 'final days and weeks', Germany's Merz says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/irans-leadership-is-its-final-days-weeks-germanys-merz-says-2026-01-13/</link><description>BENGALURU, Jan 13 (Reuters) - German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said on Tuesday he assumes Iran's leadership is in its "final days and weeks" as it faces widespread protests .

Demonstrations in Iran have evolved from complaints about dire economic hardships to calls for the fall of the clerical establishment in the Islamic Republic.

"I assume that we are now witnessing the final days and weeks of this regime," Merz said during a trip to India , questioning the Iranian leadership's legitimacy.

"When a regime can only maintain power through violence, then it is effectively at its end. The population is now rising up against this regime."

Merz said Germany was in close contact with the United States and fellow European governments on the situation in Iran, and urged Tehran to end its deadly crackdown on protesters.

He did not comment on Germany's trade ties with Iran.

U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday that any country that does business with Iran will face a tariff rate of 25% on trade with the United States.

Germany maintains limited trade relations with Iran despite significant restrictions, making Berlin Tehran's most important trading partner in the European Union.

German exports to Iran fell 25% to just under 871 million euros ($1.02 billion) in the first 11 months of 2025, representing less than 0.1% of total German exports, according to federal statistics office data seen by Reuters on Tuesday.

Poland arrested archaeologist Alexander Butyagin last month at the request of Ukraine, which accuses him of conducting unauthorised excavations and plundering historical artefacts in Crimea.

The Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement that it had called in Polish ambassador Krzysztof Krajewski on Monday and told him that the Ukrainian charges were "absurd".

The statement said that Butyagin, an employee of the renowned Hermitage museum in St Petersburg, had been working in Crimea for decades, and all his finds had been transferred to a museum there.

"It is emphasized that the Russian Federation demands the immediate release of the Russian citizen and that he not be handed over to the Kyiv regime's punitive machine, which has no resemblance to justice," it said.

Ukraine says it is defending not just its people and territory but also its cultural heritage in the war against Russia.

It has accused Russia of taking precious historical items from Crimea, which Moscow annexed in 2014, and from other parts of the country following Russia's invasion of its neighbour in February 2022.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 09:29:12 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Global central banks work on statement in solidarity with Fed's Powell, Bloomberg News reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/global-central-banks-work-statement-solidarity-with-feds-powell-bloomberg-news-2026-01-13/</link><description>Jan 13 (Reuters) - Global central bank officials are working on a statement to express support for Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell after the Trump administration opened a criminal investigation into him, Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday, citing a person familiar with the matter.

The joint statement, which will be open for all central banks to sign, is expected to be issued under the Bank for International Settlements banner, the report said, adding that it could be issued as early as Tuesday.

The Bank for International Settlements is a central bank umbrella body, often dubbed as the central bank to the world's central banks.

Reuters could not immediately verify the report. The BIS and the U.S. Federal Reserve did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The U.S. Justice Department issued subpoenas last week over comments Powell made to Congress last summer about cost overruns on a $2.5 billion renovation of the central bank's Washington headquarters.

The Trump administration's decision drew condemnation from former Fed chiefs and a chorus of criticism from key members of Trump's Republican Party on Monday, following an unusually sharp public rebuke from Powell calling the move a "pretext" to win presidential influence over interest rates.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 09:29:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/RN6IAZ4U7VPDFMCNOOWL6JUX2A.jpg?auth=595edbd8004bff913d7a0a66ef9e5819992f8c571853de2dd2bcf66d38084215&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia opens criminal investigation into death of nine babies at Siberian hospital</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/russia-opens-criminal-investigation-into-death-nine-babies-siberian-hospital-2026-01-13/</link><description>MOSCOW, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Russia has opened a criminal investigation into the deaths of nine newborn babies this month at a Siberian maternity hospital, authorities said on Tuesday.

The government has responded to the wave of unrest over dire economic conditions with a crackdown that a rights group says has killed hundreds and led to the arrest of thousands.

"We should not forget one point: people have dissatisfactions and officials in government and parliament needs to solve them, otherwise the same events will occur with greater intensity," Mohammadreza Sabaghian, who represents several counties in central Yazd province, said during a parliamentary session.

Adding to the pressure on Iran as authorities face one of the biggest challenges since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, President Donald Trump announced late on Monday that exports to the U.S. from any country doing business with Iran - a major oil exporter - will be subject to a new tariff of 25% .

Tehran has not yet responded publicly to this move, but it was swiftly criticized by China, the main buyer of Iranian oil .

Iranian authorities said on Monday they were keeping communication channels with Washington open as Trump considered how to respond to Iran's crackdown, including threatening possible military action.

"We have the duty to do dialogue and we will certainly do so," government spokesperson Fatemeh Mohajerani told a news conference on Tuesday.

Mohajerani added that President Masoud Pezeshkian has ordered the creation of workshops made up of sociologists to understand the reasons behind youth anger.

"The government sees defenders (security forces) and protesters as its children. To the best of our abilities, we have tried and will try to listen to their voices even if some have tried to confiscate (hijack) such protests.”

The protests began on December 28 over the fall in value of the local currency and have grown into wider demonstrations over dire economic hardships and defiant calls for the fall of the deeply entrenched clerical establishment.

There are no signs of splits in the Shi'ite clerical leadership, military or security forces. The demonstrators have no clear central leadership and the .

In a social media post late on Monday announcing new tariffs, Trump said that: "Effective immediately, any Country doing business with the Islamic Republic of Iran will pay a Tariff of 25% on any and all business being done with the United States of America".

Iran, already under heavy U.S. sanctions, exports much of its oil to China, with Turkey, Iraq, the United Arab Emirates and India among its other top trading partners.

The Chinese embassy in Washington criticized Trump's approach, saying China will take "all necessary measures" to safeguard its interests and opposed "any illicit unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction."

There was no official documentation from the White House of the new tariff policy on its website, nor information about the legal authority Trump would use to impose the tariffs. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

Iran's mission to the United Nations in New York declined to comment.

U.S.-based rights group HRANA said that by late Monday it had verified the deaths of 646 people, including 505 protesters, 113 military and security personnel and seven bystanders, and was investigating 579 more reported deaths.

Since the protests began, 10,721 people have been arrested, the group said. Reuters was unable to confirm the figures independently.

HRANA said it received reports and videos on Monday from Tehran's Behesht Zahra Cemetery where family members of victims "gathered at burial sites and chanted protest slogans".

Iran, which has not given an official death toll from the protests, blames the bloodshed on U.S. interference and what it calls Israeli- and U.S.-backed terrorists. State-run media has focused attention on the deaths of security forces.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Monday that while airstrikes were one of many alternatives open to Trump, "diplomacy is always the first option for the president".

"What you're hearing publicly from the Iranian regime is quite different from the messages the administration is receiving privately, and I think the president has an interest in exploring those messages," she said.

Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said Tehran was studying ideas proposed by Washington, though these were "incompatible" with U.S. threats.

"Communications between (U.S. special envoy Steve) Witkoff and me continued before and after the protests and are still ongoing," he told Al Jazeera on Monday.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 09:52:17 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CLBLKGQROJKQNHANXK4D7CDTTA.jpg?auth=6ad472da0d4a162b877f85e698b035909899408ffcb2e6698f4f6c391194e037&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Swiss fire victims' lawyer seeks expansion of criminal probe</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/swiss-fire-victims-lawyer-seeks-expansion-criminal-probe-2026-01-13/</link><description>GENEVA, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Switzerland's criminal investigation into a fire in a bar in the ski town of Crans-Montana should be broadened to include local authorities, a lawyer acting for some of the victims said, adding he would seek millions in compensation.

The fire killed 40 people , most of them teenagers, and injured 116. Romain Jordan, who represents more than 20 burn victims from the New Year's blaze, said he would claim damages of up to several million for each injury and up to 100,000 Swiss francs ($125,390) for each death.

"For me, there is absolutely no doubt that the municipality must be put on the list of those responsible and it should be asked to give answers," Jordan said in an interview late on Monday, saying he expected total claims in the hundreds of millions of francs.

"What is certain is that we will request for (officials) to be heard (by prosecutors), to obtain the documents, for the full correspondence, to understand how so many errors, so many safeguards that are normally in place in a risk management system, could all fail."

The mayor's office for Crans-Montana did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Prosecutors believe sparkling candles set the soundproof foam on the basement ceiling of "Le Constellation" bar alight early on New Year's Day. Panicked crowds then fled up a narrow staircase to a narrow exit , which became a fatal choke point as the inferno spread, witnesses said.

The town's mayor said last week that the venue had missed multiple annual safety checks , and expressed regret.

For now, only the French owners are under investigation for crimes including suspected negligent homicide. The couple, Jacques and Jessica Moretti, say they are cooperating with the investigation and have voiced grief over the tragedy. The husband has been detained .

Jordan called it a "bad joke" that the upscale town sought to be a party in the case - a request that has not been granted. "That cynicism hurt the families."

Jordan's clients are Swiss, French and Italian and most were injured, with all but two of them in artificial comas or unresponsive in European hospitals.

"They (the families) feel like they are in a nightmare from which they will never wake up, and what they ask me for is answers about who is responsible," he said.

Under Swiss law, victims of a criminal act can seek emergency financial assistance, but Jordan said a state fund was needed to cover further expenses until a ruling.

"Ideally there should be direct compensation for victims - no double punishment."

"If the field gets demolished, this will destroy our dreams and our future. We cannot play any other place but this field, the camp does not have spaces," said Rital Sarhan, 13, who plays on a girls' soccer team in the Aida refugee camp near Bethlehem.

The Israeli military issued a demolition order for the soccer field on December 31, saying it was built illegally in an area that abuts the concrete barrier wall that Israel built in the West Bank.

"Along the security fence, a seizure order and a construction prohibition order are in effect; therefore, the construction in the area was carried out unlawfully," the Israeli military said in a statement.

Mohammad Abu Srour, an administrator at Aida Youth Center, which manages the field, said the military gave them seven days to demolish the field.

The Israeli military often orders Palestinians to carry out demolitions themselves. If they do not act, the military steps in to destroy the structure in question and then sends the Palestinians a bill for the costs.

According to Abu Srour, Israel's military told residents when delivering the demolition order that the soccer field represented a threat to the separation wall and to Israelis.

"I do not know how this is possible," he said.

Israeli demolitions have drawn widespread international criticism and coincide with heightened fears among Palestinians of an organised effort by Israel to formally annex the West Bank, the area seized by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war.

Israel accelerated demolitions in Palestinian refugee camps in early 2025, leading to the displacement of 32,000 residents of camps in the central and northern West Bank. Human Rights Watch has called the demolitions a war crime . Israel has said they are intended to disrupt militant activity.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 10:25:26 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/N7IGJBOE5VPBZG5NCBHWO742XA.jpg?auth=53d5a93a6d1dd8c3157561f3011a6412b164560a6d7728ea8fa19bee16ede70b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Taiwan thanks Canada for its support ahead of prime minister's China trip</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/taiwan-thanks-canada-its-support-ahead-prime-ministers-china-trip-2026-01-13/</link><description>TAIPEI, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Taiwan President Lai Ching-te thanked Canada on Tuesday for its support during recent Chinese military drills and praised the deepening of ties between the two sides, shortly ahead of a visit to China by Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney.

Canada, like most countries, has no official diplomatic ties with Chinese-claimed Taiwan, but the economic and political exchanges between the two sides have increased as Beijing ratchets up military threats against the democratic island.

Still, two lawmakers from Carney's Liberal Party this week ended a visit early to Taiwan citing advice from the Canadian government and to "avoid confusion with Canada's foreign policy" before Carney visits Beijing from Wednesday.

Meeting the three remaining members of the delegation, from the opposition Conservative Party, Lai said that over the past three years, Taiwan and Canada have made substantive progress in areas such as trade and technology, including 2023's signing of a landmark investment agreement.

"Bilateral relations continue to deepen and yield fruitful results," Lai said at the presidential office in Taipei.

He also expressed appreciation for the Canadian government's public concern over last month's Chinese war games around Taiwan.

"I would like to thank the Canadian government for soon releasing a statement expressing its concern and opposing any unilateral attempt to change the status quo," he added.

"This once again demonstrated that maintaining the peaceful and stable status quo across the Taiwan Strait is not only in the interest of all parties, but also the international consensus."

Canadian warships on occasion sail through the sensitive Taiwan Strait , to Beijing's anger, which happened most recently last September.

Lai made no mention of Carney's visit to China in front of media.

Melissa Lantsman, deputy co-leader of Canada's Conservatives, told Lai that Taiwan was a trusted partner.

"We are here with a clear and sincere purpose to say to Taiwan and the people of Taiwan that you have friends in Canada's parliament," she said.

Taiwan's foreign ministry earlier on Tuesday played down the early departure of the two other lawmakers, saying the government will continue to further deepen exchanges and cooperation with Canada.

Carney will discuss trade and international security while in China, at a time when Canada faces uncertain relations with the United States due to a trade war and annexation threats from President Donald Trump.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 10:25:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ZPYBJYEZJ5N35OEWFZ2ARQYXUQ.jpg?auth=061232a624d610fa7aaf77168e2a2678a906ad68d930ac7c7f764944cdcaa90d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Despite criticism, DJ priest hits a high note with some Lebanese</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/despite-criticism-dj-priest-hits-high-note-with-some-lebanese-2026-01-13/</link><description>BEIRUT, Jan 13 (Reuters) - In a packed Beirut nightclub, electronic beats pulsed alongside projected videos of popes in white robes as Catholic priest Father Guilherme Peixoto spun tracks on the turntable.

The performance drew 2,000 attendees, but it also sparked opposition from some Christians in Lebanon, the first time the man known as Padre Guilherme to his 2.6 million Instagram followers says he has faced such vocal objection.

“If you don't feel comfortable with what I'm doing, please pray for me. Because I cannot do anything more about that. It's a free world and it needs to be free,” he told Reuters.

Peixoto’s foray into electronic music started in his native Portugal more than a decade ago as a way to raise funds for parish debts. Since then, he has toured the world. Pope Francis blessed his headphones. A recent performance in Slovakia incorporated a special message from Pope Leo.

But in Lebanon, a small yet vocal group, including some clergy, filed a formal complaint seeking to cancel Peixoto’s event, claiming it distorted Christian images and customs and violated the church's morals.

Beirut has a vibrant electronic music scene and is seen as one of the most socially liberal cities in the region, though religious and political leaders have had some success in censoring films, plays and other performances they deem offensive.

To some, the complaint against Peixoto felt inconsistent with the support he has won from Catholic leaders.

“I don’t see why the priests in Lebanon are unhappy with this idea, because two popes didn’t have a problem with it,” said Charbel Hatem, a 19-year-old student who attended Peixoto’s Mass at a local university hours before the DJ set.

The show went ahead after a judge rejected the complaint, with Peixoto performing in a t-shirt printed with loaves and fishes, a reference to a biblical miracle.

“Not all need to like what I'm doing, but they need to respect,” he said, adding that if he returns to Lebanon, he hopes to explain his music to his critics.

“It's music to bring the church outside of the church,” he said.

As she left the club, Cecile Freiha, 36, told Reuters that the image of a dove, projected throughout the concert, reminded her of Pope Leo’s December visit to Lebanon , part of his first foreign tour.

“We felt it was a continuity and message for us also. Religion is a message of love, of openness,” she said.

Like Leo, Peixoto hopes to bring a message of peace to a country grappling with Israel’s near-daily strikes and fears of further escalation .

“We need to live as a family, of course with different religions or even without religion. But this is our house. And if you live in Lebanon, Lebanon is your house – for all,” he said.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 10:25:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KBFG4PW5GBNRBK4AUJXHTGTXII.jpg?auth=062749280d714ae575849f6db1463c68efa758526be7c1cbb78d05afc9609a27&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Hong Kong trial of media tycoon Jimmy Lai concludes mitigation phase</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/hong-kong-trial-media-tycoon-jimmy-lai-concludes-mitigation-phase-2026-01-13/</link><description>HONG KONG, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Hong Kong's High Court wrapped up mitigation hearings on Tuesday for media tycoon and China critic Jimmy Lai, in a final step before the sentencing phase of a years-long national security trial that has drawn international scrutiny.

Lawyers for Lai and eight defendants, including senior former staffers of his pro-democracy Apple Daily newspaper, laid out the case for lighter sentences over two days, with a sentencing date to be announced later.

"There are a lot of legal issues, and important questions of law that need to be handled," said Alex Lee, one of the panel of three judges.

Lai, 78, the founder of the now shuttered paper, was found guilty last month on two counts of conspiracy to collude with foreign forces under a China-imposed national security law, and a conspiracy to publish seditious materials.

Lai denied all the charges against him, saying in court he was a "political prisoner" facing persecution from Beijing.

His trial began in December 2023 and he has spent more than 1,800 days in solitary confinement.

Foreign diplomats from countries including Britain, the European Union and the United States, attended Tuesday's hearing.

Lai's judgment had found him guilty of colluding with individuals, officials and politicians in various countries to seek the "downfall of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)".

Hong Kong authorities say Lai has received a fair trial and the national security law has restored stability to the Asian financial hub after mass pro-democracy protests in 2019.

Erik Shum, the lawyer for Lam Man-chung, the paper's former senior editor, said he should receive a lighter sentence for his "very limited role" in the conspiracy.

Those with less significant roles should get more lenient sentences, Shum added, citing the national security law and previous judgements, irrespective of whether the nature of the conspiracy was found to be "grave".

Lee, the judge, however, suggested that such offences could fall within the heaviest sentencing band, starting from 10 years to life, under certain articles of the national security law.

Marco Li, the lawyer for Chan Pui-man, the paper's former associate publisher, said her limited responsibility in overseeing the print edition merited a starting point of 10 years if the court put her in the upper sentencing band.

Lai and his family did not submit any mitigation letters, his family said, but his worsening health has been a factor in an international push to free him.

U.S. president Donald Trump asked China's leader Xi Jinping to release Lai in an October meeting in South Korea, but still awaits a reply. The leaders are set to meet again in April.

In a social media video on Tuesday, one of Lai's daughters, Claire, rebutted prosecution claims that Lai had sought solitary confinement for his own protection.

"My father is in a cell on his own that is smaller and older than most," she said, adding that Lai was denied outdoor exercise and placed in a cell with a blocked-off window that let in no sunlight.

Hong Kong's correctional services department made no response to a request for comment on Lai's jail conditions.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 10:26:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/QEEHITPH6VJO7G7HPXKMDWRX3Y.jpg?auth=b25eeb88645b21de53b5100f812f3e578bb7a0430428baff0113d5e762462de2&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Over 100 children killed in Gaza since ceasefire, UNICEF says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/over-100-children-killed-gaza-since-ceasefire-unicef-says-2026-01-13/</link><description>GENEVA, Jan 13 (Reuters) - The U.N. children's agency said on Tuesday that over 100 children have been killed in Gaza since the October ceasefire, including victims of drone and quadcopter attacks.

“More than 100 children have been killed in Gaza since the ceasefire of early October," UNICEF spokesperson James Elder told reporters at a U.N. briefing by video link from Gaza.

"Survival remains conditional, whilst the bombings and the shootings have slowed, have reduced during the ceasefire, they have not stopped."

He said that nearly all the deaths of the 60 boys and 40 girls were from military attacks including air strikes, drone strikes, tank shelling, gunfire and quadcopters and a few were from war remnants that exploded.

The tally is likely an underestimate since it is only based on deaths for which sufficient information was available, he said.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 10:26:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/TOMAHB4HRVJYFNRE5DRRHHSIWQ.jpg?auth=8885d2a5d867cf635a3231cc525a7425a295e19a910d20b921791515d109b118&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Two oil tankers attacked near key CPC loading terminal, Bloomberg News reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/two-oil-tankers-attacked-near-key-cpc-loading-terminal-bloomberg-news-reports-2026-01-13/</link><description>Jan 13 (Reuters) - Two oil tankers were attacked near the Black Sea loading terminal for the Caspian Pipeline Consortium, Bloomberg news reported on Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter.

Iran became a major flashpoint in U.S.-China ties during Trump's first term in the White House, as Washington tightened sanctions on the Islamic Republic and put China's Huawei, accused of selling technology to the country, in its cross-hairs. The arrest of its founder's daughter in Canada at the U.S.'s request sparked bitter recriminations that lingered over the remainder of that administration.

With Iran in his sights once again, a fresh 25% duty would see Chinese shipments to the U.S. incurring levies exceeding 70%, higher than the effective 57.5% tariffs in place before the two leaders struck a deal in October to de-escalate their trade war.

It remains unclear which countries with Iranian business links Trump might target, and he has not named China. The U.S. president has also made offhand remarks that threatened to upend U.S. foreign policy without acting on them before.

"China is just an excuse, a kind of disguise for the Trump administration, to impose new pressure toward Iran," said Wang Jin, fellow at the Beijing Club for International Dialogue think tank.

"But it's an exaggeration, as China does not have that much business with Iran."

China has sharply reduced Iranian imports in recent years, according to Chinese customs data, with Chinese companies wary of being sanctioned by the U.S. government. China bought just $2.9 billion of Iranian goods in the first 11 months of last year, the latest customs data shows, compared with a peak of $21 billion in 2018 during Trump's first presidency.

"China and Iran are not as close as in the public imagination," said a Beijing-based Chinese academic who advises the foreign ministry on Iran policy, and requested anonymity as they were not authorised to speak to media.

China and Iran's commercial relationship is built around oil, and while Beijing has been unable to broaden the two countries' trade ties, political relations have grown closer, they added.

Beijing moves around 80% of Iran's shipped oil through small independent refiners trading off the books to skirt U.S. sanctions over the country's nuclear ambitions. China's state-backed oil majors have not done any business with the country since 2022.Some analysts say the independents' shipments take the total value of China's purchases into the tens of billions of dollars.

When asked at Tuesday's regular press conference on Trump's tariff threat, China's foreign ministry said its stance on tariffs was very clear, that there were no winners in a tariff war, and that China would "resolutely safeguard its legitimate rights and interests."

Days into the New Year, the U.S. captured Venezuela's leader Nicolas Maduro.

The raid took place hours after Maduro and China's Special Envoy for Latin America had toasted their ties, analysts said.

Maduro was produced in a New York court to face drug charges and Trump met U.S. oil company bosses to discuss Venezuela's oil industry.

Venezuela is one of China's " all-weather " strategic partners while Iran is a lower-ranking "comprehensive strategic partner" in China's diplomatic lexicon.

Analysts said Trump's renewed push to cut it off from global trade flows was likely to deepen scrutiny of Xi's flagship Belt and Road Initiative, where Iran is a strategic hub for the flow of Chinese goods to the Middle East, and the Chinese president's vision of a global security framework based on China's longstanding tenets of foreign policy including non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries.

"Trump is, again, bluffing, and China will call the bluff. I can assure you that Trump has no guts to impose the extra 25% tariffs on China," said Wu Xinbo, dean of the Institute of International Studies at Fudan University.

The U.S. president has said he is expecting to visit Beijing in April, with analysts anticipating the announcement of a sweeping trade agreement with Xi.

"Whether Trump's tariffs are enforceable remains a question," said Xu Tianchen, a Beijing-based analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit.

"Last year he announced tariffs related to 'illicit' Russian oil trade, but their implementation was patchy."

The stakes with China were higher, he added.

"Trump is also the kind of person who likes bullying the weak," Xu said. "He should manage his actions to avoid these tariffs escalating into direct confrontation with China."</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 10:50:58 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HLQTAAM3DJM5LKXEL6QLCJ4X4M.jpg?auth=e973c694d07b1ed3c31828a34caacfed7253b41c66155a7cab4681c7a596fa48&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Denmark, Greenland foreign ministers to meet Vance, Rubio on Wednesday amid Trump's threat</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/denmark-greenland-foreign-ministers-meet-vance-rubio-wednesday-amid-trumps-2026-01-13/</link><description>COPENHAGEN, Jan 13 (Reuters) - The foreign ministers of Denmark and Greenland will meet with U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Wednesday, the Danish foreign minister said on Tuesday, amid President Donald Trump's push to take control of the Arctic island.

Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen and his Greenlandic counterpart Vivian Motzfeldt had requested a meeting after Trump recently stepped up threats to take over Greenland, an autonomous territory under the Kingdom of Denmark .

Trump first floated the idea of a U.S. takeover of Greenland in 2019 during his first term in office, although he faces opposition in Washington, including from within his own party.

While Denmark has ruled Greenland for centuries, the territory has gradually been moving towards independence since 1979, a goal shared by all political parties elected to the island's parliament.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 10:51:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/RITDCRP425JI3BYNB5EQLFLEYI.jpg?auth=e769e96e5cd3b06ed5243ca8deb63ca9eec945c0f179535cde7f977fb3dafa6e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Hungarian president sets April 12 as date for parliamentary election</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/hungarian-president-sets-april-12-date-parliamentary-election-2026-01-13/</link><description>BUDAPEST, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Hungary's President Tamas Sulyok set April 12 as the date for the country's parliamentary election, the president's office said in statement on Tuesday.

The demonstrations moved from protesting economic grievances to demanding a wholesale change from the clerical system that has ruled Iran since the 1979 revolution that ousted the shah.

The authorities have unleashed a crackdown that, according to rights groups, has left hundreds dead while the rule of supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , now 86, remains intact.

"These protests arguably represent the most serious challenge to the Islamic republic in years, both in scale and in their increasingly explicit political demands," Nicole Grajewski, professor at the Sciences Po Centre for International Studies in Paris told AFP.

She said it was unclear if the protests would unseat the leadership, pointing to "the sheer depth and resilience of Iran's repressive apparatus".

The Iranian authorities have called their own counter rallies, with thousands attending on Monday.

Thomas Juneau, professor at the University of Ottawa, said: "At this point, I still don't assess that the fall of the regime is imminent. That said, I am less confident in this assessment than in the past."

These are the key factors seen by analysts as determining whether the Islamic republic's leadership will hold on to power.

A key factor is "simply the size of protests; they are growing, but have not reached the critical mass that would represent a point of no return," said Juneau.

The protest movement began with strikes at the Tehran bazaar on December 28 but erupted into a full-scale challenge with mass rallies in the capital and other cities from Thursday.

The last major protests were the 2022-2023 demonstrations sparked by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini who had been arrested for allegedly violating the Islamic dress code for women . In 2009, mass rallies took place after disputed elections.

But a multi-day internet shutdown imposed by Iranian authorities has hampered the ability to determine the magnitude of the current demonstrations, with fewer videos emerging.

Arash Azizi, a lecturer at Yale University, said "the protesters still suffer from not having durable organised networks that can withstand oppression".

He said one option would be to "organise strikes in a strategic sector" but this required leadership that was still lacking.

While the situation on the streets is of paramount importance, analysts say there is little chance of a change without cracks and defections in the security forces and leadership.

So far there has been no sign of this, with all the pillars of the Islamic republic from parliament to the president to the Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) lining up behind Khamenei's defiant line expressed in a speech on Friday.

"At present, there are no clear signs of military defections or high-level elite splits within the regime. Historically, those are critical indicators of whether a protest movement can translate into regime collapse," said Sciences Po's Grajewski.

Jason Brodsky, policy director at US-based group United Against Nuclear Iran, said the protests were "historic".

But he added: "It's going to take a few different ingredients for the regime to fall," including "defections in the security services and cracks in the Islamic republic's political elite".

US President Donald Trump , who has threatened military retaliation over the crackdown, announced 25 percent tariffs on Monday against Iran's trading partners.

The White House said Trump was prioritising a diplomatic response, and has not ruled out strikes, after having briefly joined Israel's 12-day war against Iran in June.

That war resulted in the killing of several top Iranian security officials, forced Khamenei to go into hiding and revealed Israel's deep intelligence penetration of the Islamic republic.

US strikes would upend the situation, analysts say.

The Iranian foreign ministry said on Monday it has channels of communication open with Washington despite the lack of diplomatic relations.

"A direct US military intervention would fundamentally alter the trajectory of the crisis," said Grajewski.

Juneau added: "The regime is more vulnerable than it has been, domestically and geopolitically, since the worst years of the Iran-Iraq war" that lasted from 1980-1988.

The US-based son of the ousted shah, Reza Pahlavi, has taken a major role in calling for protests and pro-monarchy slogans have been common chants.

But with no real political opposition remaining inside Iran, the diaspora remains critically divided between political factions known for fighting each other as much as the Islamic republic.

"There needs to be a leadership coalition that truly represents a broad swathe of Iranians and not just one political faction," said Azizi.

Khamenei has now been in power since 1989 when he became supreme leader, a post for life, following the death of revolutionary founder Ruhollah Khomeini.

He survived the war with Israel and appeared in public on Friday to denounce the protests in typically defiant style.

But uncertainty has long reigned over who could succeed him, with options including his shadowy but powerful son Mojtaba or power gravitating to a committee rather than an individual.

Such a scenario between the status quo and a complete change could see "a more or less formal takeover by the Revolutionary Guards", said Juneau.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 10:53:33 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/99f8a93a-e6c1-11ee-9116-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/img-default-F24.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump’s exercise of raw power upends world order, sending friends and foes reeling</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/trumps-exercise-raw-power-upends-world-order-sending-friends-foes-reeling-2026-01-13/</link><description>WASHINGTON/TOKYO/LONDON/MOSCOW/BEIJING/MEXICO CITY, Jan 13 (Reuters) - He has toppled Venezuela’s leader, vowed to control its vast oil reserves and threatened other Latin American countries with similar military action. He has talked openly about annexing Greenland, even by force. And, beyond the Western Hemisphere, he has warned Iran that the U.S. could strike it again.

Ushering in the new year with a flurry of aggressive moves and fiery rhetoric just days before the first anniversary of his inauguration, President Donald Trump has taken a wrecking ball to the rules-based global order that the U.S. helped build from the ashes of World War Two.

That has left much of the world reeling, with friends and foes alike struggling to adjust to seemingly altered geopolitical realities. Many are uncertain of what Trump will do next and whether the latest changes will be long-lasting or can be undone by a more traditional future U.S. president.

“Everyone expected Trump to return to office with bluster,” said Brett Bruen, a former foreign policy adviser in the Obama administration and now head of the Global Situation Room consultancy. “But this bulldozing of the pillars that have long undergirded international stability and security is taking place at an alarming and disruptive pace.”

SPHERES OF INFLUENCE

While much is still unclear, Trump in a matter of months has demonstrated a taste for exercising raw American power, as he did with the bombing of Iran’s nuclear sites in June and the January 3 attack on Venezuela.

And he has signaled that he may intervene again, especially in the Western Hemisphere, where he has vowed to restore U.S. dominance, despite having campaigned on an “America First” agenda of avoiding new military entanglements.

This assessment of Trump's shakeup of the global system draws on interviews with more than a dozen current and former government officials, foreign diplomats and independent analysts in Washington and capitals around the world.

On the global stage, Trump is resuscitating what much of the international community had long spurned as an outdated worldview – spheres of influence carved out by the big powers.

The inspiration is the 19th century Monroe Doctrine that prioritized U.S. supremacy in the Western Hemisphere and which Trump has embraced and reworked into the “Donroe Doctrine.”

Experts say that while the revival of this playbook may have unnerved some U.S. allies, it could also serve the interests of Russia, locked in a war in Ukraine, a former Soviet republic, and China, which has long had its sights set on Taiwan.

Following the U.S. attack on Venezuela – and Trump’s transparent play for the OPEC state’s vital resources - some of America’s staunchest allies have shown increasing concern about the undoing of the world order.

At stake is an international system that has taken shape over the past eight decades largely under U.S. primacy and though subject to occasional reversals had helped stave off worldwide conflict. It has come to be based on free trade, rule of law and respect for territorial integrity.

A White House official said the policies Trump is pursuing, including heavy focus on the Americas, the display of military might, a border crackdown and sweeping use of tariffs, were what he was elected to do and "we are seeing world leaders respond accordingly."

Stephen Miller, an influential White House adviser, appeared to summarize the administration's worldview when he told CNN on January 5: “We live in a world, in the real world ... that is governed by strength, that is governed by force, that is governed by power."

Europeans, already shaken by doubts about Trump’s willingness to defend Ukraine against Russia, have spoken out more openly in recent days, especially over his fixation with Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark, a fellow NATO member.

German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier last week accused the U.S. of a “breakdown of values” and urged the world not to let the international order disintegrate into a "den of robbers.”

Trump said on Friday that the U.S. needs to own the Arctic island to prevent Russia or China from occupying it, though Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has warned that a U.S. move to take Greenland would mean the end of the transatlantic alliance.

Amid the growing unease, some European leaders have suggested NATO should deploy forces in the Arctic to address U.S. security concerns.

Even before the latest developments, some U.S. allies had begun taking steps to safeguard against Trump’s sometimes erratic policies, including growing European efforts to boost its own defense industry.

Trump also has stirred anxiety among Washington’s Asian partners.

Itsunori Onodera, an influential Japanese ruling party lawmaker and former defense minister, wrote on X that the U.S. operation in Venezuela was a clear example of “changing the status quo by force.”

Trump’s berating of European allies and seeming tilt toward Russia last spring prompted a contingent of senior Japanese lawmakers to consider that the only nation to have been attacked with atomic bombs might have to develop one of its own.

In South Korea, Kim Joon-hyung, lawmaker of the progressive Rebuilding Korea Party, said Trump’s actions in Venezuela “opens a Pandora’s box where the strong can use force against the weak.”

In contrast, former Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba told Reuters he did not see Trump’s Venezuela action as an “earth-shattering development” for the world order, though he questioned whether Trump’s increased focus on the Western Hemisphere was a message that “Europe, you’re on your own.”

Most friendly governments have had a largely muted response on Venezuela, reluctant to antagonize the U.S. president.

“Publicly scolding Trump is not going to help achieve our aims,” said one British official, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Leftist-governed Mexico was quick to criticize the U.S. ouster of Nicolas Maduro, Venezuela’s authoritarian socialist leader, but with so much at stake in relations with its northern neighbor, a senior Mexican official said it “will not go beyond publicly condemning the use of force."

Trump, who has threatened unilateral military action targeting drug cartels inside Mexico and Colombia, told the New York Times in an interview last week that his authority as commander in chief is constrained only by his “own morality,” not by international law.

While critics accuse Trump of a new imperialism in Latin America, his defenders say it is long overdue, especially given China’s economic and diplomatic inroads in the region.

The White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Trump was "rightfully restoring American influence," especially by taking out Maduro, who he had accused of "poisoning" Americans with a flow of illegal drugs and sending Venezuelan migrants to the U.S.

“While the administration’s actions in Venezuela have shocked the world and sent a strong message to U.S. rivals in Beijing, Moscow, Havana, and Tehran, they are likely only the starting point for a longer-term and more comprehensive reappraisal of U.S. core interests in the hemisphere,” Alexander Gray, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council and former foreign policy adviser in Trump’s first term, wrote on the think-tank’s website.

Trump's approach carries risks for the U.S.

Key regional players such as Brazil could be pushed even closer to China as they hedge their bets against Trump's pressure, some analysts say.

Most unsettling for U.S. allies has been Trump’s focus on Venezuela’s oil as a driving force behind the removal of Maduro. Washington has left the deposed president’s loyalists in power for now while strong-arming them to grant U.S. companies privileged access.

That use of U.S. power without any reference to international norms could, experts warn, embolden China and Russia to intensify coercive moves against their own neighbors. The White House official countered that U.S. adversaries had "undoubtedly taken note of the president's strength."

Zhao Minghao, an international affairs expert at Shanghai's Fudan University, said the U.S. had “hyped up the notion of a ‘China threat’ in Latin America." Soon after taking office, Trump spoke of taking back the Panama Canal and pressed the Panamanian government to reconsider Chinese-run facilities near the strategic waterway.

But Zhao also noted that Trump appeared supportive of major powers’ spheres of influence, an approach that many believe carries appeal for Beijing.

The prevailing view in Russia is that the U.S. attack on Venezuela, including taking Maduro to New York to face “narco-trafficking” charges, was a pure power play.

"That Trump just 'stole' the president of another country shows that there is basically no international law - there is only the law of force,” Sergei Markov, a former Kremlin adviser, told Reuters. “But Russia has known that for a long time.”

Trump’s appetite for further foreign military action may continue for targets well beyond the Western Hemisphere.

Even amid the fallout over Venezuela, he has threatened to intervene on behalf of protesters in Iran where Muslim clerical rulers are facing one of the stiffest challenges to their control since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.

On Sunday, Trump told reporters on Air Force One he was weighing possible responses, including military options.

"We may have to act because of what is happening," he said.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 11:21:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/I76AATROWRLSREE3IP4U76MYVE.jpg?auth=ae6b892072bdf9de75a274e60c9645a187a51b8c6025604fe8fb4fee56e95b52&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Clock ticks in Cuba as Trump cuts off Venezuelan oil</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/clock-ticks-cuba-trump-cuts-off-venezuelan-oil-2026-01-13/</link><description>HAVANA/HOUSTON, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Cubans are bracing for impact after U.S. President Donald Trump vowed to cut off a lifeline of Venezuelan oil from reaching Cuba, setting up a siege scenario for an island already reeling from crippling blackouts and shortages.

Venezuela, once the island's top supplier, has not sent crude or fuel to Cuba for about a month, according to shipping data and internal documents from state company PDVSA, with cargoes falling off due to a U.S. blockade even before the U.S. capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro in early January.

The last cargo for refining on the island was sent from PDVSA's Jose port in mid-December onboard a tanker that sailed with its transponder off, carrying some 600,000 barrels of Venezuelan crude.

In 2025, Venezuela was Cuba's largest oil supplier with 26,500 barrels per day (bpd), or roughly one third of the island's daily needs, followed by Mexico with some 5,000 bpd, the data and documents showed.

"I just don't see any light at the end of the tunnel for Cuba to survive the next few months facing zero deliveries of oil from Venezuela," said Jorge Pinon, an energy researcher at the University of Texas at Austin.

"The situation is going to be catastrophic."

Trump has made no secret of his expectation that the recent U.S. intervention in Venezuela could push Cuba over the edge, but in recent days he has doubled down on the communist-run island, pushing the neighboring nation on Sunday to strike a deal "before it is too late."

The question of how long Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel and the country's communist-run government can hold out in the face of vastly reduced oil imports is now top of mind for the island's struggling residents, who already face daunting hurdles to find food, medicine and fuel.

"It's very stressful because we don't know what decision the Cuban government will make or what actions the United States government will take," said 75-year-old former state worker Victor Romero, of Havana.

Diaz-Canel has made clear his government will stand firm against U.S. threats.

"Nobody tells us what to do," he said Sunday after Trump vowed to shut off Venezuelan oil. "Cuba is...prepared to defend the homeland until the last drop of blood."

Much of rural Cuba, in far-flung provinces with little economic output, already resembles a caricature of 19th-century life.

Horse-drawn carriages and bicycles provide transportation in many villages and even in urban areas. The internet falters often, if it works at all, and electricity is fleeting, with more hours without power than with it.

Deyanira Gonzalez, a 57-year-old housewife who lives in Havana's countryside, already prepares her morning coffee and her children's lunch over charcoal, she says, with electricity spotty and liquefied gas largely unavailable or too expensive.

"What will happen now? If Donald Trump doesn't let fuel into Cuba we'll be in the dark with our kids suffering," she said.

Cuba's capital Havana has not yet felt the impacts of the plummeting Venezuelan fuel cargoes, observations backed by Cuba's daily generation deficit tallies.

Many city residents report that blackouts have subsided somewhat in early January amid decreased power demand since a peak in December, and gasoline and diesel service at the pump, while rationed in the peso currency, continues unabated.

There is no public information about how much oil Cuba may be holding in reserve. It is also unclear whether Cuba's political allies would be willing to risk Trump's ire to help bail out Cuba.

"We have not seen any support whatsoever from Cuba's political allies, who are also exporters of oil, like Angola, Algeria, Brazil," said energy expert Pinon.

"No one is coming to Cuba's aid, with the exception of maybe Mexico, in limited amount, and also Russia, in limited amount."

A tanker bound from Mexico, the Ocean Mariner, arrived in Havana on Friday, carrying some 85,000 barrels of fuel from the state company Pemex's terminal of Pajaritos/Coatzacoalcos, according to a Reuters witness and ship tracking data.

But Mexico's contribution, albeit a fraction of Venezuela's former exports, is far from enough to keep the lights on across the island of around 10 million inhabitants, a concern not lost on many Cubans.

"It's the uncertainty of not knowing what's going to happen," said Ivet Rodriguez, a 39-year-old entrepreneur in Havana. "I try not to even think about it."</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 11:21:19 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HVQQ2QBGRRNFDJFOWGTDUGGRWE.jpg?auth=9bd7a8d0a162a617d1db27add8de628f139de902b4883b1ddf59077f6e1573e1&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Video of Minneapolis shooting convinced these Trump voters it was justifiable</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/video-minneapolis-shooting-convinced-these-trump-voters-it-was-justifiable-2026-01-13/</link><description>Jan 13 - Video of a U.S. immigration agent fatally shooting a Minneapolis mother in her car on Wednesday has divided the nation, becoming a political Rorschach test that elicits different verdicts depending on who views it.

President Donald Trump and his administration have defended the agent and branded 37-year-old Renee Good a domestic terrorist. Local leaders and protesters across the country have condemned the shooting, saying the fact that Good turned her wheels away from the officer as she drove past him proved her peaceful intentions.

Since the shooting last Wednesday, Reuters has spoken to six Americans who voted for Trump in 2024 - part of a group of 20 whom Reuters has interviewed monthly since February - to better understand how they assess an incident caught on video , opens new tab that has been viewed by millions.

Each of these half-dozen voters, who vary in their assessments of Trump's immigration policy and overall performance, came away from the video with the same conclusion: The agent feared for his life and his decision to shoot Good was justifiable.

Their verdict mirrors that of the Trump administration. U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem told reporters hours after the incident that Good had refused agents’ orders to move and then “proceeded to weaponize her vehicle.” Trump said on social media that the woman "ran over the ICE Officer."

Many Americans disagree. Tens of thousands of people marched through Minneapolis this weekend to decry the killing and the city's mayor, Jacob Frey, called the Trump administration's assessment "bullshit." Frey said the video showed an "agent recklessly using power that resulted in somebody dying, getting killed."

But the video left all six voters convinced that the agent shot Good because he thought she was trying to kill him. All expressed sympathy for the stressful conditions under which ICE and other law enforcement officers work, and many blamed Democratic leaders for inflaming anti-ICE sentiment, thereby making agents fear attacks from members of the public.

Amanda Taylor, 52, an insurance firm employee near Savannah, Georgia, who considers herself "always pro-police," said the agent was "protecting the community and protecting himself" when he fired at Good.

Taylor, who voted for Democratic President Joe Biden in 2020 and has had mixed feelings about Trump's economic policies and governing style, said the moment in the video when Good defied agents' orders to stop her car showed the agent she was a potential public threat.

"If they're running from you, what else are they gonna do?" she said.

The first videos , opens new tab to widely circulate showed two masked officers approaching Good's car, which was stopped at a perpendicular angle on a Minneapolis street. As one officer ordered Good out of the car and grabbed at her door handle, the car briefly reversed and then began driving forward, turning to the right.

Another officer, since identified as Jonathan Ross, was positioned in front of her car on the left. He drew his gun and fired three times, with the last shots aimed through the driver's side window. How much contact the car made with the officer, who stayed on his feet, has been widely debated.

Several other voters also argued that Good's own actions led to her death. "When I saw the video only one word came to mind, and that is 'disrespectful': another person failed to respect the law," said Herman Sims, 66, a night operations manager for a trucking company in Dallas, Texas.

"We won't ever know what would have happened if she kept going. Would she have run over someone else in the street blocks away?" Sims said.

Chad Hill, 50, a supervisor at a nuclear power plant near his home in northwestern Ohio, also said the ICE agent was "100% correct" to use deadly force against Good once she had ignored officers' orders to stop.

"Putting a vehicle in drive and moving it toward a law enforcement officer is the same as drawing and pointing a gun," Hill said. He added that the "political landscape in liberal cities has demonized ICE agents" for merely doing their jobs.

"There is no doubt in my mind it was self-defense," said Jon Webber, 45, a Walmart retail worker in Indiana who fully supports Trump's immigration crackdown. "The moment she threw her car in [drive] and revved up, even if she was trying to avoid the ICE agents, she came way too close."

Even voters who had mixed feelings about the administration’s deportation drive felt the agent should not face legal consequences.

Don Jernigan, 75, has previously told Reuters that some footage of ICE raids reminds him of Nazi Germany . But after viewing video of this incident, the Virginia Beach retiree said he thinks the ICE agent who shot Good should not be prosecuted, just retrained.

"When he was out of the way and she was beside him, yes, indeed, he shouldn't have shot at her," said Jernigan. "But at that point, he didn't know. All he knew was somebody tried to kill him."

Although Lou Nunez, 83, shares Jernigan's qualms about the aggressive tactics some ICE agents have used during raids, he said he would not prosecute the one who shot Good. The Des Moines-based veteran said the officers "work in a pressure-cooker situation" and that the onus was on Good to follow their orders.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 11:21:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4EXDF7O5FRLGLHLDDIS3UDAZKM.jpg?auth=ab8015190e949c3a99abe8f3a9ff25bf347149023eb492531ddeac9272edcc26&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Massive cyberattack on Polish power system in December failed, minister says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/massive-cyberattack-polish-power-system-december-failed-minister-says-2026-01-13/</link><description>WARSAW, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Poland's power system faced its largest cyberattack in years in the last week of December that also followed a different pattern, the country's energy minister said on Tuesday.

The failed attack aimed to disrupt the communication between renewable installations and the power distribution operators, Milosz Motyka told reporters, adding in the past large power units or transmission networks have been targeted.

"The command of the cyberspace forces has diagnosed in the last days of the year the strongest attack on the energy infrastructure in years," Motyka said.

Poland's critical infrastructure has been subject to a growing number of cyberattacks by Russia since the war in Ukraine began in February 2022.

Russia's military intelligence trebled its resources for such action against Poland last year, the country's digital affairs minister told Reuters.

Motyka declined to provide details on who was responsible for the attack or the recommendations made by the administration following the incident.

Of the 170,000 cyber incidents that were identified in the first three quarters of 2025, a significant portion was attributed to Russian actors.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 11:22:26 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/X3ZMX45MKNKMHJDXCIDBTZMAYY.jpg?auth=f5bc9e9a1ef2288dabac023fea2e3d70ef5c699d7a8d873ce5feb7a9cf5b0c84&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UN rights office says hundreds killed in Iran protests</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/un-rights-office-says-hundreds-killed-iran-protests-2026-01-13/</link><description>GENEVA, Jan 13 (Reuters) - The U.N. human rights chief said on Tuesday that he was "horrified" by mounting violence by Iran's security forces against peaceful protesters, with the U.N. citing its own sources as saying that hundreds have been killed so far.

The Islamic Republic's clerical authorities are facing the biggest demonstrations since 2022 and on Sunday a rights group said that unrest has killed more than 500 people. An Iranian official indicated on Tuesday it was higher , at around 2,000.

"This cycle of horrific violence cannot continue. The Iranian people and their demands for fairness, equality and justice must be heard," U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk said in a statement read out by U.N. rights office spokesperson Jeremy Laurence.

Asked to comment on the scale of the killings, Laurence, citing the United Nations' sources in Iran, said: "The number that we're hearing is hundreds."

Turk also voiced concern that the death penalty might be used against thousands of protesters who have been arrested.

The unrest has prompted U.S. President Donald Trump to reissue threats to intervene militarily on behalf of Iran's protesters.

"There's concern that (the protests) have been instrumentalised, and they shouldn't be instrumentalised by anyone," said Laurence on a possible U.S. intervention.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 11:22:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/QEGZ3U6QOVP5DLZNRXQEYBW6XQ.jpg?auth=bc007ef81c9efeba20e6c6ac57aa6a46fcb8ce4a313f0fb18388865868446ab7&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Who's actually running Venezuela?</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/whos-actually-running-venezuela-2026-01-13/</link><description>NEW YORK, Jan 13 (Reuters) - A small but powerful cabal of political and military officials has long commanded power in Venezuela, supported by a wide network of loyalists and security agencies. That system has remained intact despite the U.S. ouster of President Nicolas Maduro, who was being held in New York on narcoterrorism charges as his successor was sworn in as interim leader.

Who are the most powerful people in Venezuela? And who are the U.S. officials deciding the country’s future?

Here’s a breakdown:

Venezuela

DELCY RODRIGUEZ

Who she is: 
 Venezuela’s interim president

Portfolio: 
 Maduro’s former vice president, she’s running the country under the oversight of the United States.

Why she matters: 
 A seasoned lawyer and longtime party official, she’s known as the “tsarina” for the economic power she accrued as vice president, oil minister and finance minister. She’s technically under sanction for serving in the Maduro government, but she has won the trust of the U.S. government (for now) and is seen by U.S. oil company executives as most able to work with them to rebuild the country’s degraded energy infrastructure.

Who he is: 
 The brother of interim President Delcy Rodriguez, he is head of Venezuela’s National Assembly, a position he has held since 2021.

Portfolio: 
 He leads the legislature where the ruling socialist party has a supermajority.

Why he matters: 
 Rodriguez has long led the Maduro government’s outreach efforts to the U.S. and political opposition, leading past negotiations to hammer out election conditions and prisoner releases. According to sources in Washington and Caracas, he is seen, along with his sister, as a reasonable interlocutor for foreign governments and is expected to spearhead moves to modify oil legislation to allow the presence of additional foreign companies.

Who he is: 
 Venezuela’s interior minister

Portfolio: 
 Cabello is feared for the control he exerts over Venezuela’s military counterintelligence agency, DGCIM, and so-called “colectivos,” motorcycle gangs allied to the ruling party and known for intimidating opposition supporters.

Why he matters: 
 Cabello is seen as the main enforcer of oppression , and the leading torch-carrier for “Chavismo” in Venezuela. He has been indicted by the U.S. on narcoterrorism charges, which he denies, and there is a $25 million reward for his capture. Washington has warned he could become a prime target for arrest if he does not cooperate with Rodriguez.

Who he is: 
 Venezuela’s defense minister

Portfolio: 
 Commands the armed forces, seen as crucial by U.S. officials to avoid a power vacuum during transition.

Why he matters: Less dogmatic than Cabello, he’s pledged allegiance to Delcy Rodriguez and is considered more likely to toe the U.S. line while eventually seeking his own safe exit. Padrino has held his position for more than 11 years despite a U.S. drug smuggling indictment and a $15 million reward for his capture.

Who she is: 
 Venezuela’s top opposition leader and Nobel Prize laureate

Portfolio: 
 Machado has spent her career trying to unseat the ruling party and decrying abuses by Maduro’s government, which accuses her of treason.

Why she matters: Machado swept the opposition primary ahead of the 2024 presidential elections before Maduro’s government barred her from running in the general election. Despite Machado’s close coordination with some members of the administration, U.S. President Donald Trump has downplayed the possibility that she could lead the country, saying she “doesn’t have the support to govern.”

United States

MARCO RUBIO

Who he is: U.S. secretary of state and acting national security advisor

Portfolio: 
 Apart from Trump, the former U.S. senator is the most public face of the administration's Venezuela operation, and is deeply involved in U.S. efforts to pressure Venezuela's leaders into following U.S. directions.

Why he matters: 
 The Cuban-American and Spanish speaker has long taken interest in Latin American affairs. Unseating Maduro is the fulfillment of his long-sought ambition and he has said since that he would like the Cuban government to come next. He is in direct contact with interim President Delcy Rodriguez to ensure Venezuela acts in U.S. interests.

Who he is: U.S. director of the Central Intelligence Agency

Portfolio: 
 Ratcliffe heads the main U.S. intelligence-gathering organization and is part of the core team that has been working on Venezuela for months.

Why he matters: 
 Trump ally Ratcliffe is on the sometimes-daily leadership meetings and calls with a Venezuela team that includes Rubio, White House aide Stephen Miller and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. The CIA played a crucial role in the operation that spirited Maduro out of Venezuela, sources told Reuters. It had a small team on the ground starting in August who were able to monitor his movements and pinpoint his exact location as the operation unfolded, they said.

Who he is: White House deputy chief of staff for policy

Portfolio: 
 Architect of the president's immigration crackdown, which has focused on Latin America, including Venezuela.

Why he matters: 
 Miller wields immense power over multiple areas of the West Wing. Under his leadership, the administration dramatically ramped up immigration arrests, and pushed the legal limits of deportations. Now he is articulating a view that the world is “governed by strength,” whether that’s removing a foreign government or taking Greenland by any means necessary.

Who he is: U.S. secretary of defense

Portfolio: 
 Responsible for U.S. military operations worldwide, including the operation that removed Maduro from Venezuela.

Why he matters: 
 Hegseth orchestrated a massive U.S. military buildup in the Caribbean in recent months, unleashing deadly strikes on suspected drug-smuggling boats, and using those forces to carry out the lightning raid that led to the capture of Maduro. Hegseth carries the stick of potential additional raids on Venezuela if the current government does not cooperate with Washington.

Who he is: U.S. secretary of energy

Portfolio: 
 Responsible for U.S. energy policy worldwide, including Venezuela’s future oil industry and trade.

Why he matters: 
 The climate-change skeptic and former Trump donor is charged with carrying out Trump’s plan to rebuild Venezuela’s oil sector. He said he expects to see U.S. firm Chevron grow its activities there along with ConocoPhillips and Exxon Mobil, which have not been active in Venezuela for decades. Wright also said Washington would not allow Venezuela to be a client state of China, though it has allowed oil sales to China to continue.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 11:22:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/APAF5DGYC5PS7KIGDEX7W3OADE.jpg?auth=b22f063511e67152406811845c143e816cc059d57ab89eccc5c001c85ba408a4&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>EU-Mercosur trade pact signals limits of Trump’s hardball diplomacy in Latin America</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/eu-mercosur-trade-pact-signals-limits-trumps-hardball-diplomacy-latin-america-2026-01-13/</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 11:22:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Germany's SPD, conservatives in coalition clash over inheritance tax reform</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/germanys-spd-conservatives-coalition-clash-over-inheritance-tax-reform-2026-01-13/</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 11:22:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Trump’s Detroit trip to put manufacturing back in focus amid US factory job slump</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trumps-detroit-trip-put-manufacturing-back-focus-amid-us-factory-job-slump-2026-01-13/</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 11:23:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>US probe into Fed hits global markets as worry of its independence grows</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/us-probe-into-fed-hits-global-markets-as-worry-of-its-independence-grows</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 11:23:07 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/99a4567e-f069-11f0-9d5a-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260113-103830-104024-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>New 'controversial' US food guidelines include 'focus on animal protein and full-fat dairy'</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/new-controversial-us-food-guidelines-include-focus-on-animal-protein-and-full-fat-dairy</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 11:23:10 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/ef078876-f068-11f0-91c4-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260113-081046-081737-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Six dead as Gaza’s displaced struggle to hold ground in torrential rain</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/six-dead-gazas-displaced-struggle-hold-ground-torrential-rain-2026-01-13/</link><description>CAIRO/GAZA, Jan 13 (Reuters) - A rainstorm swept across the Gaza Strip on Tuesday, flooding hundreds of tents, collapsing homes sheltering families displaced by two years of war and killing at least six people, local health officials said.

Medics said five people, including two women and a girl, died when homes collapsed near Gaza City’s beach, while a one-year-old boy died of extreme cold in a tent in Deir Al-Balah in central Gaza.

Tents were torn from their stakes, some flying dozens of meters before crashing to the ground. Others lay crumpled in muddy pools as families scrambled to salvage what they could.

Residents tried to resecure remaining shelters, hammering in loosened pegs and stacking sandbags around the edges to keep floodwaters from pouring inside.

“We didn’t realize what was happening until the wall started collapsing — an eight-meter-high wall, a strong concrete wall. Because of the speed and force of the wind, the wall fell on top of us, onto three tents,” said Bassel Hamuda, a displaced man in Gaza.

“The elderly man, 73 years old, was martyred. His son’s wife was killed, and his son’s daughter was killed,” he told Reuters.

Three months since a ceasefire halted major combat, Israeli forces have ordered the near-total depopulation of nearly two thirds of Gaza, forcing its more than 2 million people into a narrow strip near the coast where most live either in makeshift tents or damaged buildings.

Dozens of relatives gathered at a hospital morgue on Tuesday for special prayers over bodies laid on medical stretchers before the funerals.

The Hamas-run Gaza government media office said at least 31 Palestinians had died since the start of the winter season from exposure to cold or the collapse of unsafe buildings damaged by previous Israeli strikes.

It said about 7,000 tents were damaged in the past 48 hours, most of whose occupants have no alternative shelter.

Municipal and civil defense officials said they were unable to cope with the storm because of fuel shortages and damaged equipment. During the war Israel had destroyed hundreds of vehicles needed to respond to the weather emergency, including bulldozers and water pumps.

In December, a U.N. report said 761 displacement sites hosting about 850,000 people were at high risk of flooding, and thousands had moved in anticipation of heavy rain.

U.N. and Palestinian officials said at least 300,000 new tents were urgently needed for the roughly 1.5 million people still displaced. Most existing shelters are worn out or made of thin plastic and cloth sheeting.

"In Gaza, winter weather is adding to the suffering of families already pushed to the brink by over two years of war," UNRWA, the U.N. Palestinian refugee agency, said in a post on X on Tuesday.

“Flooding, cold temperatures, and damaged shelters are exposing displaced people to new risks, while humanitarian access remains severely constrained,” it added.

In a statement on Tuesday, Hamas urged mediators of the Gaza ceasefire deal that began in October to compel Israel to allow the unconditional flow of aid, shelter, and rebuilding materials.

Israel says hundreds of trucks enter Gaza daily carrying food, medical supplies and shelter equipment. International aid organisations say the supplies are still insufficient.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 12:49:49 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/MU4TGMN545PCBFVXRG4B6H6DJI.jpg?auth=f103e14017af852441dc71e58dd542165e3f4e492f75a7b76ac09bc48ec12dbc&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Davos begins new era grappling with global order shaken by Trump</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/davos/davos-begins-new-era-grappling-with-global-order-shaken-by-trump-2026-01-13/</link><description>ZURICH, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Business and political elites head to the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos next week with its vision of a rules-based global economic order being tested to the limits.

U.S. President Donald Trump's expected appearance in the Swiss mountain resort highlights the gap between his agenda and the consensus-driven approach of the WEF, which has faced enduring criticism that it is a talking shop of the rich.

His "America First" policy has led to trade tariffs being used as punishment, military intervention in Venezuela, the threat of taking over Greenland by force and a U.S. retreat from cooperation on climate, health and other global challenges.

The Trump administration has also threatened Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell with a criminal indictment, prompting many top central bankers to issue a statement defending him and central bank independence.

Dubbing its 56th edition "A Spirit of Dialogue", the WEF's leaders say that given the current uncertainty, getting together to map out a way forward in business and politics is crucial.

"Dialogue is not a luxury, it is a necessity," said WEF president and CEO Borge Brende, a former Norwegian minister.

But others say that with the U.S. and China leveraging power to suit national interests, the WEF risks obsolescence.

"Who is going to be making the case for the rules-based international order?" said Daniel Woker, a former Swiss ambassador and foreign relations expert.

"To be very blunt, in a system where everyone is only looking out for themselves, it has no reason to exist. It's an event from the past."

Davos-watchers are also looking at whether the event has lost impetus since its 87-year-old founder Klaus Schwab stepped down as chair in April.

The Geneva-based organisation said in August an internal investigation had found no evidence of material wrongdoing by Schwab, after a whistleblower letter alleging misconduct. It named BlackRock (BLK.N) , opens new tab CEO Larry Fink and Roche (ROG.S) , opens new tab vice-chair Andre Hoffmann as interim co-chairs.

The latest forum has much to discuss, from how to handle Trump's version of the Monroe Doctrine establishing U.S. supremacy in the Western hemisphere, to the ways artificial intelligence is changing the world.

It comes just after one of Switzerland's worst modern tragedies , a ski resort bar fire that killed 40 people.

In pre-event briefings, the WEF has put a brave face on the global tumult, highlighting how companies have sought to adapt to the highest U.S. tariff rates since the Great Depression and pointing to an easing of trade tensions in late 2025.

Still, a WEF survey of executives released last week showed that doing business got harder in 2025. The poll also painted a downbeat picture of cooperation on peace and security.

With several European leaders expected to attend, eyes will be on how they respond to U.S. challenges, including Trump's threats to take over Greenland, and attacks on European efforts to regulate American tech firms.

"The politicians need to stand strong," said Christy Hoffman, General Secretary of the UNI Global Union representing 20 million service-sector workers worldwide, urging policymakers to address how AI and new technologies impact jobs.

One feature of this year's WEF meeting will be top oil executives eager to hear Trump promoting his energy dominance agenda, which encourages them to drill for more oil and gas while snubbing alternatives like wind and solar.

The CEOs of Exxon Mobil, Shell, TotalEnergies, Equinor and ENI are all expected after much more sporadic attendance in past years, when oil players saw the forum as anti-fossil fuel.

It remains to be seen whether China, which in recent years has sent top officials, will field a sizeable Davos presence.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 12:49:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/3FNONICTIJOQBOIGAYCBTK3ZIU.jpg?auth=9b355b0075f51fe41fe66dafb335fdfd24dd748d5f51a70051e9a8533fc691ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Why Iran’s clerical regime still holds as protests rage</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/why-irans-clerical-regime-still-holds-protests-rage-2026-01-13/</link><description>DUBAI, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Despite Iran's nationwide protests and years of external pressure, there are as yet no signs of fracture in the Islamic Republic's security elite that could bring an end to one of the world's most resilient regimes.

Adding to the stress on Iran's clerical rulers, U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened military action over Tehran's severe crackdown on the protests, which follow an Israeli and U.S. bombing campaign last year against Iran's nuclear program and key officials.

But unless the street unrest and foreign pressure can prompt defections at the top, the regime, though weakened, will likely hold, two diplomats, two government sources in the Middle East and two analysts told Reuters.

Around 2,000 people have been killed in the protests, an Iranian official told Reuters , blaming "terrorists" for the deaths of civilians and security personnel. Human rights groups had previously tallied around 600 deaths.

Iran's layered security architecture, anchored by the Revolutionary Guards and Basij paramilitary force, which together number close to one million people, makes external coercion without internal rupture exceedingly difficult, said Vali Nasr, an Iranian-American academic and expert on regional conflicts and U.S. foreign policy.

“For this sort of thing to succeed, you have to have crowds in the streets for a much longer period of time. And you have to have a breakup of the state. Some segments of the state, and particularly the security forces, have to defect," he said.

Iran's mission to the U.N. in Geneva, the U.S. State Department and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment sent by email out of office hours.

Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, 86, has survived several past waves of unrest. This is the fifth major uprising since 2009, evidence of the regime's resilience and cohesion even as it confronts a deep, unresolved internal crisis, said Paul Salem of the Middle East Institute.

For that to change, protesters would have to generate enough momentum to overcome the state’s entrenched advantages: powerful institutions, a sizeable constituency loyal to the clerical rule, and the geographic and demographic scale of a country of 90 million people, said Alan Eyre, a former U.S. diplomat and Iran expert.

Survival, however, does not equal stability, the analysts said. The Islamic Republic is facing one of its gravest challenges since 1979. Sanctions have strangled the economy with no clear path to recovery. Strategically, it is under pressure from Israel and the United States, its nuclear program degraded, its regional “Axis of Resistance” proxy armed groups weakened by crippling losses to allies in Lebanon, Syria and Gaza.

Nasr said that while he didn't think the Islamic Republic had reached the “moment of fall," it was "now in a situation of great difficulty going forward."

The protests began on December 28 in response to soaring prices , before turning squarely against clerical rule. Politically, the violent crackdown has further eroded what remained of the regime's legitimacy.

U.S.-based rights group HRANA says it has verified the deaths of 573 people, 503 protesters and 69 security personnel. More than 10,000 have been arrested, the group said.

Iran has released no official toll, and Reuters was unable to independently verify the figures.

What sets this moment apart, and raises the stakes, analysts say, is Trump’s explicit warnings that the killing of demonstrators could trigger an American intervention.

Trump will meet with senior advisers on Tuesday to discuss options for Iran, a U.S. official told Reuters on Sunday . Iran said it is keeping communications open with Washington. Trump, who says he may meet Iranian officials , on Monday threatened tariffs on countries that trade with Iran. China is Tehran's top trade partner.

In a phone call on Saturday , Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio discussed the possibility of U.S. intervention in Iran, according to an Israeli source present for the conversation.

Trump’s interest in the protests, the analysts said, is likely tactical rather than ideological, Salem said. The aim could be regime pliability - weakening the state enough to extract concessions such as curbs on Tehran's nuclear programme, he said.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment about Trump's goals in Iran.

The idea of a “Venezuela model” has growing appeal in some circles in Washington and Jerusalem, a diplomat and three of the analysts said. It envisions the removal of Iran's top authority while signaling to the remaining state apparatus: stay in place, provided they cooperate, they said.

Applied to Iran, however, it collides with formidable obstacles - a security state entrenched for decades, deep institutional cohesion and a much larger and ethnically complex country.

Two regional officials and two of the analysts told Reuters foreign military action could fracture Iran along ethnic and sectarian lines, particularly in Kurdish and Sunni Balush regions with histories of resistance.

For now, constraints remain. U.S. military assets are stretched elsewhere, though the diplomats said that deployments could shift quickly.

David Makovsky at The Washington Institute, a think tank, said that if Trump acts, he expects a swift, high-impact action rather than a prolonged campaign - consistent with the president's preference in recent conflicts for a single decisive action rather than deploying ground troops.

"He looks for this one gesture that might be a game changer, but what is it?," said Makovsky.

Options range from maritime pressure on Iranian oil shipments to targeted military or cyber strikes, all carrying serious risks.

Some measures, all the sources said, could stop short of force, such as restoring internet access via Starlink to help protesters communicate.

The White House and State Department did not respond to Reuters questions about what action, if any, Trump might take.

Russian national Vladimir Motin, 59, was captain of the Portuguese-flagged Solong that hit the Stena Immaculate tanker, which was anchored, on March 10 2025.

Motin was charged four days later with causing the death of Filipino national and Solong crew member Mark Pernia, 38, whose body has never been found and is presumed dead.

He has pleaded not guilty to one count of gross negligence manslaughter and is on trial at London's Old Bailey court, where prosecutor Tom Little said Pernia's death was "entirely avoidable".

"He would still be alive if it was not for the grossly negligent conduct of the man in the dock," Little told jurors.

He said the Solong was on a collision course with the Stena Immaculate, which was carrying "very large quantities of aviation fuel", for over half an hour before the crash.

Little told the court that Motin owed Pernia a duty of care as the Solong's captain and as he was "on sole watch duty on the bridge" before the fatal crash.

"Ultimately, he did nothing, absolutely nothing, to avoid the collision," Little added.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 13:41:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/NNVXWFLYXRIIBAMEAQ2UAC2KLI.jpg?auth=6cece4206b712571aee6f7019955c34511e8fc0285da7adca4038682f55be1e1&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Deaths outnumber births in France for first time since World War Two</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/deaths-outnumber-births-france-first-time-since-world-war-two-2026-01-13/</link><description>PARIS, Jan 13 (Reuters) - France recorded more deaths than births in 2025 for the first time since the end of World War Two, a development that erodes its long-held demographic advantage over other European Union nations, official figures showed on Tuesday.

The national statistics institue INSEE reported 651,000 deaths last year and 645,000 births, which have collapsed in number since the global COVID pandemic.

France has traditionally had stronger demographics than most of Europe, but an aging population and falling birth rates show it is not immune to the demographic crunch straining public finances across the continent.

INSEE said the fertility rate dropped to 1.56 children per woman last year, its lowest level since the World War One and well below the 1.8 assumed in pension funding forecasts by the pension advisory council.

In 2023, the most recent year with EU comparisons, France ranked second highest with a fertility rate of 1.65, behind Bulgaria's 1.81.

The demographic shift will push public spending back to pandemic-era highs in the coming years while eroding the tax base, the national public audit office warned last month.

"Given the retirement of the large generations born in the 1960s, labour market tensions and workforce problems are likely to increase rapidly in the coming years," said economist Philippe Crevel with the Cercle d'Epargne think tank.

Despite deaths outnumbering births, France's population grew slightly last year to 69.1 million, due to net migration, which INSEE estimated at 176,000.

Life expectancy reached record highs last year - 85.9 years for women and 80.3 for men - while the share of people aged 65 or older climbed to 22%, nearly matching those under 20.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 13:42:03 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/QUWJTGDA3VI7ZHHIERUUSKLRN4.jpg?auth=41f47ff30228a1ee824b4f2b95f159cb2b843fb8d1c18d94b2384ed2731e19c9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US to end temporary protected status for Somalis in US, Fox News reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-ends-temporary-protected-status-thousands-somalis-us-fox-news-reports-2026-01-13/</link><description>Jan 13 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's administration is ending temporary protected status for thousands of Somalis in the United States, Fox News reported on Tuesday, requiring them to leave by March 17.

"Country conditions in Somalia have improved to the point that it no longer meets the law’s requirement for Temporary Protected Status," the report cited Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem as saying. Representatives for DHS could not be immediately reached to confirm the report.

Trump in November said he was immediately terminating temporary deportation protections for Somalis living in Minnesota, accelerating the end of a program that began in 1991 under former Republican President George H.W. Bush.

Trump has previously called Minnesota a "hub of fraudulent money laundering activity" under Democratic Governor Tim Walz, an apparent response to unverified media reports, shared by several Republican lawmakers, that the Al-Shabaab militant group in Somalia had benefited from fraud committed in Minnesota.

In the last few days, tens of thousands of people have marched through Minneapolis to protest the fatal shooting of a woman by an federal immigration agent.

There are 2,471 Somalis nationals in the United States under TPS with another 1,383 with pending TPS applications, Fox News reported, citing US Citizen and Immigration Services sources. According to the non-partisan Congressional Research Service, 2025 data showed 705 Somali-born individuals nationwide have TPS status.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 13:42:08 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/DNK2YOZECROH5HHKKT2PEBY5FQ.jpg?auth=3e7ea1ebc2086c7f0a83027cff0b78e04122aad3c0213cca903a87e6b1e32c14&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US to end temporary protected status for Somalis in US, Fox News reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-ends-temporary-protected-status-thousands-somalis-us-fox-news-reports-2026-01-13/</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 13:42:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Hamas to elect first leader since Sinwar killed by Israel, sources say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/hamas-elect-first-leader-since-sinwar-killed-by-israel-sources-say-2026-01-13/</link><description>CAIRO, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Hamas is expected to elect a new leader this month, two sources in the group told Reuters, filling the role left vacant since Israel killed Yahya Sinwar in 2024 despite concerns that a successor could suffer the same fate.

Khalil Al-Hayya and Khaled Meshaal are seen as frontrunners for the helm at a vital moment for the militant Islamist group, battered by two years of war ignited by its October 7, 2023 attack on Israel and facing international demands to disarm.

Both men reside in Qatar and sit on a five-man council that has run Hamas since Israel killed Sinwar, a mastermind of the October 7 attack. His predecessor, Ismail Haniyeh, was assassinated by Israel while on a visit to Iran in 2024.

The election process has already begun, the sources said. The leader is chosen in a secret ballot by Hamas' Shoura Council, a 50-member body that includes Hamas members in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, the Gaza Strip, and exile.

A Hamas spokesperson declined to comment.

The sources said a deputy leader will also be elected to replace Saleh Al-Arouri, who was killed by an Israeli airstrike in Lebanon in 2024.

Sources close to Hamas said it was determined to conclude the vote, though some preferred an extension of collective leadership.

Hamas watchers regard Meshaal as part of a pragmatic wing with good ties to Sunni Muslim countries, and Hayya, the group's lead negotiator, as part of a camp that deepened its relations with Iran.

Hamas faces some of the toughest challenges since it was founded in 1987. While fighting has largely abated in Gaza since the U.S.-brokered ceasefire in October, Israel still holds almost half the coastal enclave, attacks continue , and conditions for Gaza's 2 million people remain dire.

Hamas has also drawn criticism within Gaza because of the heavy toll inflicted by the war, with much of the enclave reduced to ruins and more than 71,000 people killed, according to Gaza health authorities.

Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people and abducted 251 others in the October 7 cross-border assault on Israel.

U.S. President Donald Trump's ceasefire plan for Gaza demands Hamas disarm and foresees the enclave being run by a technocratic Palestinian administration overseen by an international body called the Board of Peace.

Hamas has so far refused to disarm, saying the question of armed resistance is a matter for wider debate among Palestinian factions and that it would be ready to surrender its weapons to a future Palestinian state, an outcome Israel has ruled out.

Hamas is designated as a terrorist organization by Western powers including the United States.

Born in Gaza, Hayya was among Hamas leaders targeted by an Israeli airstrike on Qatar in September.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu later expressed regret to the emir of Qatar - a U.S. ally - in a three-way call with Trump and affirmed Israel would not conduct such an attack again in the future, the White House said at the time.

Meshaal previously led Hamas for almost two decades. Israeli agents tried to assassinate him in Jordan in 1997 by injecting him with poison.

His relations with Iran were strained in 2012 when he distanced Hamas from Tehran's Syrian ally, the now-ousted President Bashar al-Assad, early in the Arab Spring uprisings.

Hamas was founded as the Palestinian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood and is the main rival to the Palestinians' Fatah national movement led by 90-year-old President Mahmoud Abbas.

Hamas' founding charter called for the destruction of Israel, although its leaders have at times offered a long-term truce with Israel in return for a viable Palestinian state on all Palestinian territory occupied by Israel in the 1967 war.

Israel regards this approach as a ruse.

Analyst Reham Owda said there were limited differences between Hayya and Meshaal over the conflict with Israel but believed Meshaal had better chances as he could "market (Hamas) internationally and help rebuild its capabilities".</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 14:26:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WJSVJ3A7NVLKDPDDQ7D43QZZK4.jpg?auth=44db36be3c1abbcccb4021f1451b83298a2bb6dee514f50665c860c225a28099&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Pope Leo to visit Angola as part of an Africa tour, Vatican envoy says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/pope-leo-visit-angola-part-an-africa-tour-vatican-envoy-says-2026-01-13/</link><description>LUANDA/VATICAN CITY, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Pope Leo plans to visit Angola as part of a multi-nation trip across Africa, the Vatican's ambassador to the country announced on Tuesday, in what could be the pontiff's first overseas trip in 2026.

Archbishop Kryspin Dubiel, the Vatican's envoy, told journalists at a briefing in Luanda that Leo had accepted an invitation from President Joao Lourenco to visit, but the date and other details had yet to be decided.

"The Holy Father has accepted the invitation … (but) we are currently in the process of preparing the plan and programme," said Dubiel.

The Vatican press office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Leo, elected in May to succeed the late Pope Francis as head of the Catholic Church, has made only one overseas trip so far, visiting Turkey and Lebanon in November and December.

The pope said in a December press conference that he wished to visit Africa but did not mention Angola. Leo, a member of the Augustinian religious order, said he wanted to visit Algeria , birthplace of St. Augustine of Hippo.

The last papal trip to Africa was in 2023, when Francis visited Democratic Republic of Congo and South Sudan. Pope Benedict XVI was the last pontiff to visit Angola, in 2009.

Leo, the first U.S. pope , previously travelled to Africa many times as a cardinal and the head of his religious order.

Another trip Leo is expected to make in 2026 is to Spain and to the Canary Islands, which has become a major point of entry for migrants trying to get to Europe . A Spanish cardinal told reporters at the Vatican last week that the trip is in the planning phase.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 14:26:49 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/I2DTBHX3K5MHRFXZPTDOV5MXCU.jpg?auth=2babad890c0d963456a67cd86578e5043a8bca40dfc8dd8b796a6565ba528b36&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Lebanon charges ex-central bank governor Salameh over alleged $44.8 mln embezzlement</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/lebanon-charges-ex-central-bank-governor-salameh-over-alleged-448-mln-2026-01-13/</link><description>BEIRUT, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Lebanese prosecutors have indicted former central bank governor Riad Salameh and two lawyers on charges including embezzlement of public funds, forgery and illicit enrichment, judicial authorities said on Tuesday.

Salameh , who headed the Lebanese Central Bank for three decades, was detained for about 13 months over alleged financial crimes committed during his tenure and was released in September after paying record bail of more than $14 million. He remains in Lebanon and is subject to a travel ban.

According to a copy of the indictment issued by Beirut's indictment chamber seen by Reuters, the panel accused Salameh alongside lawyers Marwan Issa el-Khoury and Michel John Tueni of embezzling $44.8 million from what it described as a central bank "consultancy account".

It said the chamber also approved a request by the financial public prosecutor to widen investigations into how funds were moved into and out of banks without senior bank managers notifying the central bank's Special Investigation Commission.

The indictment follows earlier moves by the central bank to file a criminal complaint against a former senior bank official at the central bank, a former banker and a lawyer over alleged illicit enrichment through misuse of public funds, the bank's acting governor Wassim Mansouri has said.

Salameh, whose 30-year term ended amid a cascade of domestic and international investigations, has been under scrutiny over allegations that more than $300 million was siphoned off between 2002 and 2015. He denies any wrongdoing.

The central bank has said it will act as a principal plaintiff in a state investigation into Forry Associates, a company suspected of receiving commissions from commercial banks and transferring them abroad. The company is controlled by Salameh's brother Raja, who also denies wrongdoing.

The Salameh brothers are under investigation in France, Germany, Switzerland and other countries over alleged embezzlement.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 14:27:02 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/S553ERODZROOPHQTY6C63H7MQY.jpg?auth=84150824db647e0f15d872f03dcfa623124e77ada41288f246d1e2b98edd95e0&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Somali regions reject Mogadishu's move to cut ties with UAE</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/somali-regions-reject-mogadishus-move-cut-ties-with-uae-2026-01-13/</link><description>NAIROBI, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Three self-governing regions in Somalia that have close relations with the United Arab Emirates have dismissed a decision this week by the central government to sever ties with the UAE, a longterm sponsor.

On Monday Somalia annulled all agreements with the UAE, including in the field of security, accusing the Gulf country, which has trained and funded Somalia's army and invested in its ports, of undermining Somalia's national sovereignty.

Somalia did not provide further explanation of its reasons for the move. Mogadishu is investigating allegations that the UAE whisked a separatist leader out of Yemen via Somalia. Separately, the UAE has been linked to Israel's recognition last month of Somaliland, a breakaway region of northern Somalia, as an independent state.

The UAE's Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Somalia's decision. The UAE has longstanding interests in the Horn of Africa and Red Sea regions, where it has frequently vied with other wealthy Gulf states for influence.

Somaliland and two semi-autonomous states, Puntland in the north and Jubbaland in the south, said they would not recognise the decision by Mogadishu to cut ties with the UAE.

"Somalia’s daydreaming changes nothing ... The UAE is here to stay, no matter what a weak administration in Mogadishu says," Khadar Hussein Abdi, Minister of the Presidency of the Republic of Somaliland, said late on Monday.

The Jubbaland regional government said Mogadishu's decision was "null and void" and existing "security and development agreements will continue to exist".

Puntland said the decision would have no impact on relations between it and the UAE, including over the coastal city of Bosaso where a subsidiary of the UAE's DP World has a 30-year concession to run the port.

The UAE has long leveraged its wealth to expand its influence across the Horn of Africa, using a mix of economic, military and diplomatic clout to exert regional power.

For decades Somalia's federal government has possessed only limited authority across the country, and has failed to defeat Islamist militants , despite years of international support, including African peacekeepers and U.S. air strikes.

The UAE trained hundreds of Somali troops from 2014-2018, and still covers salaries and provides logistics for around 3,400 Somali military police and special forces troops in and around the capital, according to senior Somali sources.

It has also forged bonds directly with regional governments, committing hundreds of millions of dollars to ports and military infrastructure on the coast along global shipping routes.

Two Somali officials, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomacy, told Reuters that in place of UAE military funding the country could turn to the UAE's wealthy Gulf rivals Qatar or Saudi Arabia for help.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 14:27:04 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LLAQQKEMYBIMNCPV4L2VHJQVBA.jpg?auth=978e4dea65aa2726dd30bc42288ce676ff34150fe2f4143437a016e5d266f894&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Germany indicts Ukrainians over alleged Russian exploding parcels plot</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/germany-indicts-ukrainians-over-alleged-russian-exploding-parcels-plot-2026-01-13/</link><description>BERLIN, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Germany indicted two Ukrainians linked to an alleged plot on behalf of Russian spy services to detonate packages while they were being transported across Europe, prosecutors said on Tuesday.

Their case, together with incidents of parcels detonating at European depots in 2024, underlined security officials' warnings of a growing threat of hybrid attacks by Russia in the wake of its invasion of Ukraine.

Russia has denied any involvement.

In March 2025, suspects identified under German privacy law only as Daniil B, Vladyslav T and Yevhen B, who is being prosecuted separately, sent two packages with GPS trackers from the western German city of Cologne to Ukraine on the orders of Russian intelligence intermediaries in Mariupol, the prosecutors' statement said.

The purpose was to investigate logistics routes in order to later send packages with incendiary devices that would ignite in Germany or elsewhere en route to parts of Ukraine not occupied by Russia, causing as much damage as possible, it said.

Daniil B and Vladyslav T were arrested in Germany in May and remain in pre-trial detention.

Their case, together with incidents of parcels detonating at European depots in 2024, underlined security officials' warnings of a growing threat of hybrid attacks by Russia in the wake of its invasion of Ukraine.

Russia has denied any involvement.

In March 2025, suspects identified under German privacy law only as Daniil B, Vladyslav T and Yevhen B, who is being prosecuted separately, sent two packages with GPS trackers from the western German city of Cologne to Ukraine on the orders of Russian intelligence intermediaries in Mariupol, the prosecutors' statement said.

The purpose was to investigate logistics routes in order to later send packages with incendiary devices that would ignite in Germany or elsewhere en route to parts of Ukraine not occupied by Russia, causing as much damage as possible, it said.

Daniil B and Vladyslav T were arrested in Germany in May and remain in pre-trial detention. Yevhen B, who was arrested in Switzerland that same month, was extradited to Germany on December 23, with charges expected to be filed shortly.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 14:27:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>North Korea's Kim Yo Jong says South's hopes for better relations are an illusion</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/north-koreas-kim-yo-jong-says-souths-hopes-better-relations-are-an-illusion-2026-01-13/</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 14:27:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Germany indicts Ukrainians over alleged Russian exploding parcels plot</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/germany-indicts-ukrainians-over-alleged-russian-exploding-parcels-plot-2026-01-13/</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 14:27:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>North Korea's Kim Yo Jong says South's hopes for better relations are an illusion</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/north-koreas-kim-yo-jong-says-souths-hopes-better-relations-are-an-illusion-2026-01-13/</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 14:27:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>UK launches investigation into Musk's Grok amidst global backlash</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/uk-launches-investigation-into-musk-s-grok-amidst-global-backlash</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 14:28:19 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/3fc52334-ee0e-11f0-a9fb-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/capture-10768024676962285d178cf4-10617529.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Donald Trump pushing for strikes in Iran while advisors push for diplomacy</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/donald-trump-pushing-for-strikes-in-iran-while-advisors-push-for-diplomacy</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 14:28:22 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/86a95ca0-f031-11f0-ac4f-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26012117241272.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Donald Trump threatens 25 percent tariffs for Iranian trade partners</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/donald-trump-threatens-25-percent-tariffs-for-iranian-trade-partners</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 14:28:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/fd303a9c-f07c-11f0-a2c0-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-09T194014Z-630852772-RC2VXIASG8LU-RTRMADP-3-USA-TRUMP-IRAN.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukraine's parliament votes against appointing Denys Shmyhal as energy minister</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/ukraines-parliament-votes-against-appointing-denys-shmyhal-energy-minister-2026-01-13/</link><description>KYIV, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Ukrainian lawmakers on Tuesday voted against naming outgoing Defence Minister Denys Shmyhal as energy minister after President Volodymyr Zelenskiy proposed him for the top job.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 14:54:17 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/FQ7OV3AFQFJKFIAUNBISE2TNOE.jpg?auth=ae41b9c934f0378af22a83485e994d2e94a7cd245b1aeef6bd1fc7b25c6e47ae&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Britain takes to TikTok to highlight immigration raids</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/britain-takes-tiktok-highlight-immigration-raids-2026-01-13/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Britain's government has launched a TikTok account showing raids on migrants accused of working illegally, with the aim of convincing voters and potential new arrivals that it is tackling what many see as Britain's most pressing problem: immigration.

The securebordersuk account posted a 20-second clip showing a sequence of doors being smashed in by armoured officers, people being led from workplaces in handcuffs and planes taking off, all set to a soaring soundtrack and on-screen text trumpeting an increase in raids and deportations.

The video ends with the message "And it's just getting started."

The effort to portray a hardline stance on immigration is one of Prime Minister Keir Starmer's moves to win back public support after 18 months in power which have seen his Labour Party fall far behind Nigel Farage's right-wing Reform UK party .

A spokesperson for Starmer said the channel would help reach a wider audience, tackle false narratives online and directly reach migrants considering coming to Britain.

Many European governments are also taking a tougher line on migration.

Polling consistently puts immigration as a top concern for British voters, and Ipsos polling from 2025 showed Reform was ranked as the most trusted party on the issue.

The government said since it took power in July 2024, arrests of illegal workers and raids have reached the highest level in British history, with raids up 77% and arrests up 83%, at businesses such as nail bars, car washes and barbers.

The black economy is frequently cited as one of the pull factors drawing tens of thousands of migrants to enter Britain illegally in small boats from France.

Set against a backdrop of public service cuts and higher taxes that is squeezing many voters, illegal arrivals by boat have become a focal point. More than 40,000 arrived in 2025.

Illegal arrivals accounted for only a small portion of overall net immigration to Britain, which is falling sharply as tighter visa rules take effect.

Tuesday's TikTok video attracted criticism from both sides, such as that the government should do more, or that it was insensitive to the people depicted.

"This government is clearly hooked on the cheap political points it can score by turning the brutality of enforcement raids into click-bait online entertainment," said Sile Reynolds, Head of Asylum Advocacy at charity Freedom from Torture.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 14:54:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/FJ5VCCI4FFLVJINJNNQ3W36TXI.jpg?auth=222985b87fec6839a6ab2d9f85a66ab41ede3e09b941453bf0c5d3d4767dbb5d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Syria's Kurds protest Aleppo violence as fears of wider conflict grow</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/syrias-kurds-protest-aleppo-violence-fears-wider-conflict-grow-2026-01-13/</link><description>QAMISHLI, Syria, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Several thousand people marched under the rain in northeast Syria on Tuesday to protest the expulsion of Kurdish fighters from the city of Aleppo the previous week after days of deadly clashes.

The violence in Aleppo has deepened one of the main faultlines in Syria , where President Ahmed al-Sharaa's promise to unify the country under one leadership after 14 years of war has faced resistance from Kurdish forces wary of his Islamist-led government.

Five days of fighting left at least 23 people dead, according to Syria's health ministry, and saw more than 150,000 flee the two Kurdish-run pockets of the city. The last Kurdish fighters left Aleppo in the early hours of January 11.

On Tuesday, several thousand Syrian Kurds protested in the northeastern city of Qamishli. They carried banners bearing the logos of Kurdish forces and faces of Kurdish fighters who died in the battles - some of whom had detonated explosive-laden belts as government forces closed in.

Other posters featured the faces of Sharaa and Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan, crossed out with red "X"s and carrying the caption "Killers of the Kurdish people."

Turkey accuses the Syrian Democratic Forces - the main Kurdish fighting force which runs a semi-autonomous zone in northeast Syria - of links to the Kurdistan Workers' Party, which Ankara considers a terrorist organization.

Many Kurds say last week's bloodshed has deepened their scepticism about Sharaa's promises to govern for all Syrians.

"If they truly love the Kurds, and if they sincerely say that the Kurds are an official and fundamental component of Syria, then the rights of the Kurdish people must be recognized in the constitution," said Hassan Muhammad, head of the Council of Religions and Beliefs in Northeast Syria, who attended Tuesday's protest.

Others worry that the bloodshed will worsen. Syria's defense ministry on Tuesday declared eastern parts of Aleppo still under SDF control to be a "closed military zone," and ordered all armed forces in the area to withdraw further east.

Idris al-Khalil, a Qamishli resident who protested on Tuesday, said the Aleppo violence reminded him of the sectarian killings last year of the Alawite minority on Syria's coast and the Druze minority in the country's south.

"Regarding the fears of a full-scale war - if they want a full-scale war, the people will suffer even more, and it will lead to division among the peoples of the region, preventing them from living together in peace," Khalil said.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 14:54:33 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/YJQJRD4C6BNPTAEE33OCVUYWTQ.jpg?auth=32dbbce4bfa9272a74a90aa8c78d416346c088bf15868338686410f58d8c7ca7&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US bolsters Nigeria's military with supplies in security partnership</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/us-bolsters-nigerias-military-with-supplies-security-partnership-2026-01-13/</link><description>LAGOS, Jan 13 (Reuters) - The United States has delivered critical military supplies to Nigeria to bolster the West African nation's operations, the U.S. military's Africa Command (AFRICOM) said on Tuesday.

The delivery came after the U.S. carried out a strike targeting Islamic State militants in northwest Nigeria last month.

AFRICOM said in a post on X that the delivery in the Nigerian capital Abuja "supports Nigeria's ongoing operations and emphasises our shared security partnership".

AFRICOM did not specify what kinds of equipment it had delivered to Nigeria, which has been battling Islamist insurgents in the northeast for the past 15 years as well as criminal kidnapping gangs, mostly in the northwest.

Last month, AFRICOM said the U.S. military had carried out an airstrike in Sokoto state in coordination with Nigerian authorities and had killed multiple Islamic State militants.

Nigeria’s foreign ministry said the strike was part of ongoing security cooperation with the U.S., involving intelligence sharing and strategic coordination to target militant groups.

Reuters reported last month that the U.S. had been conducting intelligence-gathering flights over large parts of Nigeria since late November.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 14:54:49 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/C6LHWI5OZBOWPJTQ7X77DEIVSE.jpg?auth=65704f1847002fc3210d8dd63c2218a9b911f6e1cb6a8e8ceed2f22f6c660854&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Paris's annual agriculture show will be cow-free for first time ever due to lumpy skin disease</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260113-paris-annual-agriculture-show-cow-free-for-first-time-ever-du-lumpy-skin-disease</link><description>There will be ‍no cows ​at Europe's largest agricultural show in Paris this year for the first time ever ⁠after an outbreak of lumpy skin disease in France sparked fears of contamination, organisers said on Tuesday.

The 500 to 600 cattle usually present at the International Agriculture ​Show are a major attraction at the annual event, which ‍draws about 600,000 people, including children who have never seen some of the farm animals before.

"We ​took the decision last night that there would be no cattle ​at the international farm show 2026," SIA Chairman Jérôme Despey told reporters.

"This is a historic decision that has saddened us," he added, stressing that the show would still feature many other animals including pigs, sheep, horses, dogs and cats.

Lumpy skin disease, mainly spread by biting insects, causes fever and painful skin lumps, weakens animals and reduces milk output. There ‍have been more than 100 outbreaks detected in France, mostly near the Alps and in southwestern France.

The ​farm ministry said the disease was under control in France thanks to vaccination. Still, some farmers want to avoid taking any risk while others want ‌to express their solidarity with affected farmers, Despey said.

Some French farmers have criticised the government's handling of the virus , which has involved ‍culling all animals in a contaminated herd. Opposition to the policy was one of the reasons behind farmer-led protests in Paris last week .

France's main farmers' union FNSEA, which was staging a protest in Paris on Tuesday, backs the government's policy.

The organisers were hoping the protests would not extend to the show, which attracts top politicians every ‍year .

"We have no problem with debate but we do with fighting," SIA Director Arnaud ‌Lemoine said.

The cow ​used as a mascot for the show will be replaced by other animals, he said.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 14:55:10 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/303055e2-f089-11f0-b1a4-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25053359905473.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Hearing in Marine Le Pen appeal trial expected summer 2026</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/hearing-in-marine-le-pen-appeal-trial-expected-summer-2026</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 14:55:12 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/376fa460-f080-11f0-9e6a-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-12T060029Z-710323561-RC2MHHA3C5X4-RTRMADP-3-FRANCE-POLITICS-LE-PEN.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ex-Corsican nationalist leader Alain Orsoni shot dead at mother's funeral</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/ex-corsican-nationalist-leader-alain-orsoni-shot-dead-at-mother-s-funeral</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 14:55:17 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/5d1fc4a4-f087-11f0-9cd0-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260113-143954-144146-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Marine Le Pen to switch legal strategy in appeal as case opens in Paris</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/marine-le-pen-to-switch-legal-strategy-in-appeal-as-case-opens-in-paris</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 14:55:19 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/a17792e6-f085-11f0-b53e-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260113-133414-133754-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump tells Iranians to keep protesting, says 'help is on its way'</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/trump-tells-iranians-keep-protesting-says-help-is-its-way-2026-01-13/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 13 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday told Iranians to keep protesting and said help was on the way, but did not give details.

Charalambos Charalambous, who ran President Nikos Christodoulides' private office and was one of two people at the presidency overseeing a fast-track process for investments in Cyprus, denied wrongdoing but resigned on Monday.

The eight-minute video, posted on X on January 8, showed current and former senior officials including Charalambous discussing how to invest in Cyprus with people who introduce themselves as business figures.

It has dominated local media headlines, overshadowing Cyprus's assumption of the European Union presidency on January 1 - a position it will hold for six months.

It is not clear who made the video and Reuters was unable to verify its authenticity.

"My own participation, through deliberate distortions, selective excerpts and references in a different context, guided by misleading conclusions, is being exploited," Charalambous, who is related to the president by marriage, said in a statement. "Under no circumstances will I allow anyone to cast aspersions on my honesty."

In the video, Charalambous is heard suggesting to an unidentified person on a video call that they can direct money to corporate social responsibility projects and that he could call Charalambous if there were problems with red tape.

Christodoulides said in response to the video that he has zero tolerance for corruption, adding: "I will not let anyone, but anyone, accuse me of corruption."

Police are investigating the origins of the video and some of the allegations it contains, a spokesperson said, without providing further details.

The video says some donations ended up in a scholarship fund run by his wife, Philippa Karsera, who quit the role on Sunday, calling the video and uproar around it "merciless attack of false news and defamatory allegations".

"That I am the spouse of the President is no excuse for these unsubstantiated attacks and claims," she wrote on Facebook, saying it was an affront to her and her family.

Cypriot lawmakers have expressed concerns about the fund's refusal to disclose its benefactors.

The conversations shown in the video posted online last week appeared to be secretly recorded on hidden cameras. Several scenes were taken at restaurants, and others in hotel rooms.

A voiceover in English alleges that the conversations reveal corruption, but provides no evidence to support this. It is not clear who is speaking in the voiceover.

Opposition parties say the government's response suggests authorities turned a blind eye to corruption.

"Unfortunately, your stance confirms that you are simply recycling the old practices of not taking political responsibility, covering up scandals and impunity," Stefanos Stefanou, head of the Communist AKEL party, wrote in a letter to Christodoulides.

Government sources told Reuters individuals heard in the video introduced themselves as investors wanting to make a 150-million-euro ($175-million) investment in energy projects in Cyprus. The whereabouts of these people is now unknown, and their corporate website is no longer online, the sources said.

Cypriot police and intelligence services have sought assistance from the United States, Israel, France and Greece to track the origins of the video, one government source said.

"The United Kingdom condemns in the strongest of terms the horrendous and brutal killing of Iranian protesters, and we demand that the Iranian authorities respect the fundamental rights and freedoms of their citizens," Cooper told parliament.

She said her office had called in the Iranian ambassador to Britain to underline "the gravity of this moment and to call Iran to answer for the horrific reports that we are hearing."

Reuters reported on Tuesday that Iran acknowledged about 2,000 deaths during two weeks of nationwide protests over economic hardship, as the U.S. considers new tariffs and possible military action.

Cooper told lawmakers Britain would bring forward legislation to implement full and further sanctions and sectoral measures against Iran.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 15:29:04 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/IS5IW6J7LVNOTGMOUCSDQHC6EY.jpg?auth=f4e25c46fa92852c678a87130e685c6bbbc0692f05ecdbfe7ddbd5829f4fc0ad&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Deaths overtake births in France for first time since World War II</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260113-deaths-overtake-births-france-first-time-since-world-war-ii</link><description>France recorded more deaths than births in 2025 for the first time since the end ​of World War II , a development that erodes its long-held demographic advantage ‍over other European Union nations, official figures showed on Tuesday.

The national statistics institute INSEE reported 651,000 deaths ​last year and 645,000 births, which have collapsed in number since ​the global COVID pandemic.

France has traditionally had stronger demographics than most of Europe , but an aging population and falling birthrates show it is not immune to the demographic crunch straining public finances across the continent.

INSEE said the fertility rate dropped to 1.56 children per woman last year, its lowest level since World War I ‍and well below the 1.8 assumed in pension funding forecasts by the pension advisory council.

In 2023, the ​most recent year with EU comparisons, France ranked second highest with a fertility rate of 1.65, behind Bulgaria 's 1.81.

Watch more Should we panic about plummeting birthrates?

The demographic shift will push public ‌spending back to pandemic-era highs in the coming years while eroding the tax base, the national public audit office warned last ‍month.

"Given the retirement of the large generations born in the 1960s, labour market tensions and workforce problems are likely to increase rapidly in the coming years," said economist Philippe Crevel with the Cercle d'Epargne think-tank.

The boy, now 16 and who cannot be named for legal reasons, downloaded and shared videos of attacks, shootings and beheadings, expressed his admiration for Adolf Hitler, and kept notebooks where he wrote of his hatred for Jews and black people, prosecutor Michelle Heeley said.

When police raided the home he shared with his father in a remote village in northern England, they found knives, crossbows, military clothing and evidence that he was actively planning to turn his anger into action, Heeley said.

"He wanted to be a terrorist. He believed in a race war, in white supremacy and he planned to carry out acts of terrorism in furtherance of his beliefs," she said.

The boy denies the charges of preparing acts of terrorism, being a member of a proscribed group, possessing terrorist documents and disseminating terrorist publications.

The prosecutor told Leeds Crown Court that from the age of 13 the boy had demonstrated his extremist obsession, saying his notebooks showed how he had rated white supremacist killers and glorified their actions.

Messages on his computer showed he had contacted The Base, a banned far-right organisation, and showed his support by putting up its posters around his village, Heeley said.

He had researched local synagogues as part of identifying targets, and downloaded material on making weapons and explosives, she added.

"These were not empty words, these were the words of a teenage boy filled with hate and racism, a boy who was planning to channel his anger into committing an act of terrorism, who idolised those who had carried out such atrocities previously," Heeley said.

The trial continues.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 15:52:47 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Swiss Olympic snowboard medallist Ueli Kestenholz dies in avalanche</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sports/swiss-olympic-snowboard-medallist-ueli-kestenholz-dies-avalanche-2026-01-13/</link><description>ZURICH, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Swiss snowboarder and Olympic medallist Ueli Kestenholz, 50, has died after being buried in an avalanche on Sunday in the Loetschental region of Canton Valais, the Swiss skiing federation Swiss‑Ski said on Tuesday.

Kestenholz won a bronze medal in snowboarding's inaugural Olympic event, the giant slalom at Nagano in 1998.

He also secured multiple World Cup podiums, and retired from competition in 2006.

A statement from Valais police, which did not identify Kestenholz by name, said the avalanche swept the snowboarder from the eastern flank of the Hockuchriz peak around 2,400 metres (7,874 feet) up the mountainside.

A skiing companion he was with managed to escape the avalanche, police said.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 15:53:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/QIBUEDFJEZPXDGROJ3Y6ZOAMYM.jpg?auth=b3b5f4762970109f0de8a7e98910c165af48a44981417b2a9ac5d6263ee57dc4&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Macron brandishing 'threat of dissolution' as budget talks resume, although 'unlikely'</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/macron-brandishing-threat-of-dissolution-as-budget-talks-resume-although-unlikely</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 15:54:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/e338e8da-f092-11f0-90eb-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260113-160354-160859-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump tells Iranian protesters 'help is on its way' and cancels talks with officials</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/trump-tells-iranian-protesters-help-is-on-its-way-and-cancels-talks-with-officials</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 15:54:27 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/fcb9d1f4-f06d-11f0-8ea0-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/Iran-protests.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iranian stands trial in France over social media posts ahead of possible prisoner swap</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260113-iranian-translator-stands-trial-in-france-over-social-media-posts-ahead-of-possible-prisoner-swap</link><description>An Iranian went on trial in France Tuesday accused of promoting "terrorism" on social media in a case linked to a possible prisoner swap with two French citizens held by the Islamic Republic for more than three and a half years.

Mahdieh Esfandiari, a 39-year-old Iranian working as a translator in the French city of Lyon, was arrested in France in February on charges of promoting and inciting "terrorism" on social media over comments she is said to have made, including on the Hamas-led October 7, 2023 attacks on Israel , according to French authorities.

Esfandiari was released in October pending her trial, whose date was scheduled long before the current protests erupted in Iran against the Iranian authorities.

"I'm here today to finally speak about the facts, as there have been a lot of wrong stories about me in the media, and a lot of lies," she said as she entered the courtroom for the four-day trial, in which several groups battling anti-Semitism are plaintiffs.

French citizens Cecile Kohler and Jacques Paris were arrested in Iran in May 2022, but they were freed in November after more than three years in prison on espionage charges their families vehemently denied.

They were immediately taken by French diplomats to France's mission in Tehran, but are still waiting to leave Iran.

Tehran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said in November that Iran would allow Kohler and Paris to return home in "exchange" for France freeing Esfandiari.

France has neither confirmed nor denied the existence of such an exchange deal.

But it has downsized its staff at its embassy in Tehran after mass protests erupted nationwide last week, in one of the biggest challenges to the clerical leadership since the 1979 Islamic revolution that ousted the shah.

Relatives of Paris and Kohler said that they were in good health and being well looked after by the remaining embassy staff.

The demonstrations have triggered a deadly crackdown by authorities and an internet blackout.

The death toll from the protests and brutal government crackdown has risen to at least 2,000 people killed , including more than 130 people affiliated with the government, the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency said Tuesday.

France has described Kohler and Paris as "state hostages" taken by Tehran in a bid to extract concessions. They were convicted on espionage charges their families have always condemned as fabricated.

Dozens of Europeans, North Americans and other Western citizens have been arrested in the last few years in similar circumstances.

Iran has previously carried out exchanges of Westerners for Iranians held by the West, but insists foreigners are convicted fully in line with the law.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 15:54:44 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/5014a5da-f088-11f0-b167-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/8237be2a1d772f674f2dca421d29c063cc23eba5.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>With Maduro gone, Rubio's political fortunes are tied to Venezuela's</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/with-maduro-gone-rubios-political-fortunes-are-tied-venezuelas-2026-01-13/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Marco Rubio's sweeping influence in Trump's second administration — juggling posts from secretary of state to national security advisor — has sparked a wave of AI-generated memes, including a recent one portraying him in military garb as Venezuela's ruler.

The online joke is particularly resonant for Rubio, a son of Cuban immigrants who long has trained his ire on the Communist-run nation's most important regional ally, Venezuela, and its longtime leader, Nicolas Maduro, who was seized by U.S. forces on January 3 on allegations of drug trafficking.

The military success was a personal triumph for Rubio. But it could be a mixed political blessing for a man who ran for president in 2016 and is widely regarded as a leading contender in 2028.

He is now charged with steering Venezuela from potential chaos in the vacuum created by Maduro's capture toward the democratic future he once envisioned as a junior senator, tightly binding his political fortunes to those of the country itself.

Rubio mounted an unsuccessful presidential bid in 2016, losing a bruising primary to Donald Trump, and in 2028 could find himself competing with Vice President JD Vance for the Republican nomination. Vance favors restraint in foreign policy, a contrast to Rubio's hawkish record, which has drawn criticism from some in Trump's MAGA movement who view him as a neoconservative who advocates for more U.S. intervention abroad.

"The administration is going to be dealing with Venezuela for months and probably years to come, and this could well be a millstone around Marco Rubio's neck, politically and otherwise," said Justin Logan, director of defense and foreign policy studies at the Cato Institute.

Vance's office did not have a comment for this story.

Tommy Pigott, Principal Deputy Spokesperson at the State Department, disputed there was any difference in approach within the administration and said Washington's phased plan for Venezuela included political reconciliation and ultimately normalization.

"The entire administration is unified in fulfilling President Trump's goal - moving Venezuela from a country oppressed by a narcoterrorist illegitimate regime that threatens our security, to a stable country that is a partner in the region," Pigott said.

The Venezuela operation has already burnished Rubio's image among some online supporters who see him as the competent face of an often chaotic administration.

It has also given him a boost in his home state of Florida, where he spent part of his childhood among Miami's staunchly anti-communist Cuban community, an experience that former aides say fundamentally shaped his worldview.

The fight against communism and socialism is "part of his DNA" and "central to his political identity," said Cesar Conda, a Republican strategist who was Rubio's chief of staff from 2011 to 2014.

"This is OUR hemisphere, and President Trump will not allow our security to be threatened," a social media post from Rubio's State Department read this week.

Rubio's political base in Florida would be energized by a return to democracy in Venezuela, and even more so if the administration can use its removal of Maduro to bring about change in Cuba, which relies on Venezuela for subsidized oil imports. Trump has said no more Venezuelan oil or money will go to Cuba and suggested Havana should strike a deal with Washington.

The Venezuela operation was immensely popular among Venezuelan and Cuban Americans in South Florida, a potential help to Republicans in the 2026 mid-terms, Ford O'Connell, a Florida-based Republican political strategist, argued.

Still, he added, Latin American policy was unlikely to affect the make-up of the Republican 2028 presidential ticket. Trump is the kingmaker, and as of now is leaning toward Vance, O'Connell said.

Trump himself has repeatedly nodded to both Rubio and Vance as potential successors, making clear both are frontrunners in his eyes, as well as possible running mates for each other.

"I think if they ever formed a group, it'd be unstoppable," Trump said in October.

Rubio, 54, made his mark in the Senate railing against the socialist government in Caracas and in particular its close ties with Havana, and worked with the first Trump administration from 2017-2021 on ramping up sanctions on Venezuela.

His first foreign trip as secretary of state underscored his focus. In February, during a swing through Central America and the Caribbean, he oversaw the formal seizure of a plane used by Delcy Rodriguez, then Maduro's vice president, that had been held by Dominican authorities.

Rubio has backed Trump's decision to allow Rodriguez to remain in power, and has led the administration's contacts with the new leader. But he has longstanding ties to Venezuelan opposition leaders, including Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Corina Machado, and has spoken of his hopes of democracy for Venezuelans.

On Wednesday, he outlined a three-phase plan where the U.S. would ensure stability in Venezuela, oversee a recovery in which U.S. companies would help rebuild the country's energy sector and members of the opposition would be released from jail or allowed to return from exile, before finally moving to a transition.

On Friday, Venezuela began releasing prisoners, and Trump has met with oil executives to push them to invest.

But the road to a democratic Venezuela remains long.

Will Freeman, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, said it remained unclear whether other top administration officials were invested in overseeing the full transition.

"How is he going to convince Trump, most importantly, and a critical mass of other administration officials, that it's in their interests for things to advance beyond that phase two?" Freeman asked.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 17:27:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/YWOPIGUPUFLVTNHASMIEEVDA3Y.jpg?auth=07c1904dea7bd345d22df857ada208aae71416971e89b015fe72cdb66fd90536&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US designates three Muslim Brotherhood chapters as global terrorists</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-designates-three-muslim-brotherhood-chapters-global-terrorists-2026-01-13/</link><description>Jan 13 (Reuters) - The United States on Tuesday designated the Egyptian, Lebanese and Jordanian branches of the Muslim Brotherhood as global terrorists, citing in part what it called their support for Palestinian militant group Hamas.

The move, which Washington formally set in motion last November , will bring sanctions against one of the Arab world's oldest and most influential Islamist movements.

The Treasury said it was labeling the three chapters as specially designated global terrorists. It has accused the trio of supporting or encouraging violent attacks against Israel and U.S. partners.

"Chapters of the Muslim Brotherhood purport to be legitimate civic organizations while, behind the scenes, they explicitly and enthusiastically support terrorist groups like Hamas," the Treasury Department said in a statement.

There was no immediate response to emails seeking comment, sent by Reuters to representatives of Iglesias, 82. The star's record label, Sony, declined to comment.

The women, said to have worked in Iglesias' Caribbean residences in the Dominican Republic and Bahamas over a 10-month period in 2021, were cited in a three-year investigation by U.S. broadcaster Univision and Spanish outlet elDiario.es published on Tuesday.

Both women reported suffering sexual assault and workplace harassment while working for the singer, the outlets reported. The reports said Iglesias pressured them into sexual encounters and subjected them to additional physical and verbal abuse.

The prosecutor's office said it had opened preliminary proceedings after a claim was filed on January 5. Details of the case were covered by secrecy rules that prevented it from providing further information.

Iglesias is one of the world's best-selling Latin artists, with more than 300 million records sold in 14 languages. A former aspiring soccer player, he turned to music after a 1963 car accident ended his sports career.

The allegations sparked a noisy reaction in Spain, where he is considered a national treasure.

Ana Redondo, the Socialist-led government's Equality Minister, said in a statement she respected Iglesias' presumption of innocence but that she believed the women's testimony.

"He's a great singer but people can have a dark side," she said, praising the women for raising their complaints.

Leftist party Mas Madrid suggested the right-wing government of Madrid region should strip Iglesias of the keys to the city he was awarded as the capital's most famous son. Iglesias has backed conservative political candidates in the past.

Regional president Isabel Diaz Ayuso issued a furious response on X, saying: "The Community of Madrid will never contribute to attacks on the prestige of artists, not least the most universal singer of all: Julio Iglesias."</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 17:28:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/77H3CQBRCZPBTGFKJSI62EHKVI.jpg?auth=7919f56bcdbb5599e8698e9c99af48c3a2a982a02ef9f0b724b0a06887a727a7&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US gives terrorist designation to Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260113-us-gives-terrorist-designation-muslim-brotherhood-in-egypt-lebanon-jordan</link><description>The United States on Tuesday designated the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt as well as Lebanon and Jordan as terrorist organisations, fulfilling a long-held demand of Arab allies and US conservatives .

"These designations reflect the opening actions of an ongoing, sustained effort to thwart Muslim Brotherhood chapters' violence and destabilisation wherever it occurs," Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement.

Muslim Brotherhood leaders have said they renounce violence.

The Muslim Brotherhood is a pan-Islamist organisation founded in Egypt in 1928 that later spread across the Arab world . Its founder, Egyptian schoolteacher Hassan al-Banna, argued that reviving Islamic principles in society could enable the Muslim world to resist Western colonialism .

The Muslim Brotherhood is already outlawed as a terrorist group in some countries, including Egypt and Saudi Arabia . Jordan banned it in April of this year, accusing the group of manufacturing and stockpiling weapons and planning to destabilise the kingdom, where it remains widely popular.

A US designation as a foreign terrorist group allows Washington to take punitive measures such as freezing any assets the group might have in the United States and denying entry to group members.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 17:28:58 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/ca6cb58a-f09b-11f0-8a43-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/000-9AH37H.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Clintons refuse to testify in Epstein probe as Republicans threaten contempt charges</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260113-clintons-refuse-testify-epstein-probe-as-republicans-threaten-contempt-charges</link><description>Former US President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said they will refuse to comply with a congressional subpoena for them to testify in an investigation into disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein .

The Clintons have slammed a Republican-controlled committee’s attempts as “legally invalid” as GOP lawmakers prepare contempt of Congress proceedings against them.

In a letter released on social media Tuesday, the Clintons told the chair of the House Oversight Committee, Republican congressman James Comer, that he’s on the cusp of a process “literally designed to result in our imprisonment”.

The Clintons said they had tried to provide what "little information" they had ‍to help with the investigation and accused Comer of shifting focus away from the ​Trump administration's failures.

"We've done so because Mr. Epstein's crimes were horrific. If the Government didn't do all it could to investigate and prosecute these ‌crimes, for whatever reason, that should be the focus of your work ... There is no evidence that ‍you are doing so," they wrote.

Comer says he’ll begin contempt of Congress proceedings next week. It potentially starts a complicated and politically messy process that Congress has rarely reached for.

“No one’s accusing the Clintons of any wrongdoing. We just have questions," Comer told reporters after Bill Clinton did not show up for a scheduled deposition at House offices Tuesday.

Clinton has never been accused of wrongdoing in connection with Epstein but had a well-documented friendship with Epstein , a wealthy financier, throughout the 1990s and early 2000s. Republicans have zeroed in on that relationship as they try to wrestle control over demands for a full accounting of Epstein's wrongdoing.

“Anyone would admit they spent a lot of time together,” Comer said.

Epstein was arrested in 2019 on federal sex trafficking and conspiracy charges. He was found dead in a New York jail cell while awaiting trial, apparently by suicide.

Multiple former presidents have voluntarily testified before congress, but none has been compelled to do so.

Comer also indicated that the committee would not attempt to compel testimony from President Donald Trump , a fellow Republican, saying that it could not force a sitting president to testify.

Under pressure from the Trump's political base, the administration has ordered the US Justice ‍Department to release files tied to criminal probes of Epstein, who was once friends ‌with Trump ​and the Clintons, in compliance with a transparency law passed by Congress.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 17:53:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/019db34e-f09f-11f0-9c2f-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-13T163503Z-339867903-RC2NDCAR4CM1-RTRMADP-3-USA-TRUMP-EPSTEIN-CLINTONS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'Little appetite for regime change’: Trump offers 'help' for Iran's protesters, but what can he do?</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260113-trump-tells-iran-protesters-help-on-its-way-weighs-military-strikes</link><description>It has been 10 days since US President Donald Trump warned Iran against cracking down on street protests, stressing that the United States was ready to "come to the rescue" of Iranian demonstrators .

As he put it, the US was “locked and loaded and ready to go”.

Trump has since repeated that threat and said he was looking at “very strong options” against Tehran – even as the death toll from the regime’s ferocious crackdown soared to more than 2,000 , according to rights groups.

In a social media post on Tuesday, the US president urged Iranians to continue protesting and said “help is on its way”. He gave no details about what “help” he was leaning towards and when it might come.

The enigmatic message came a day after he exercised economic leverage by announcing 25 percent tariffs on any country that trades with Iran, and spoke of ways to restore internet access shut by Tehran.

Trump was to meet with senior advisers later on Tuesday to discuss possible course of action, with options reported to include military strikes, using secret cyber weapons, widening sanctions and providing online help to anti-government sources.

"Nobody knows what President Trump is going to do except for President Trump," White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters. "The world can keep waiting and guessing."

Buoyed by the successful capture of Venezuela’s Nicolas Maduro earlier this month, Trump may be tempted to give America’s foes – and the wider world – another taste of US military might.

The US president has already proven his readiness to strike directly at Iran – first with the killing of Iran’s top military commander Qasem Soleimani in January 2020, and more recently with the strikes on Iranian nuclear sites last June .

The latter raid, which involved flying bunker-busting bombs from a base in Missouri and dropping them on two of Iran's most important nuclear sites, showed that Washington is perfectly capable of mounting large-scale operations from a distance.

Both attacks also reflected Trump’s preference, as seen again recently in Venezuela , for one-off military operations he quickly claims as successes.

“Trump clearly has the means to strike key targets within the Iranian regime, but he’s likely to want to do so in a manner that is both decisive and does not drag the US into something long-term and indefinite,” said Anthony Samrani, chief editor of Beirut-based publication L’Orient-Le Jour.

The trouble, Samrani added, “is that there’s no guarantee a US attack would knock out the regime or even coerce it into being more compliant.”

Citing unnamed officials in the Trump administration, the New York Times reported on Sunday that the president was “seriously considering” military strikes against Iran but “has not made a final decision”.

The NYT said advisers presented Trump with a range of potential strike targets, including unspecified non-military sites in Tehran and facilities linked to Iranian security services involved in suppressing protests.

Striking military installations comes with a high risk. Some bases of elite military and security forces may be located in heavily populated areas so any attack ordered by Trump could inflict large civilian casualties.

Iranian authorities have vowed to retaliate against any attack, with parliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf warning Washington against "a miscalculation".

“Let us be clear: in the case of an attack on Iran, the occupied territories (Israel) as well as all US bases and ships will be our legitimate target," said Qalibaf, a former commander in Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards.

Despite the damage incurred during last year’s 12-day war with Israel , Iran still has a significant arsenal of ballistic missiles. And while its regional proxies are much diminished, they are still capable of action.

Analysts say the scope of any US attack is likely to prove crucial in terms of either emboldening the protest movement or further hardening the regime’s response.

Ray Takeyh, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, said Trump could target forces including the Revolutionary Guards that have taken the lead in repressing the protests. Such a move might ease Iranians' fears and “affect the fence-sitters in thinking about joining the protests or not”, he told AFP.

Others argue that the mere threat of US intervention has had the opposite effect, galvanising the regime’s crackdown on what it regards as foreign-backed “terrorists”.

“We've seen on the surface a consolidation of the government as well as no defections at all,” said Iran expert Trita Parsi, deputy head of the Washington-based Quincy Institute.

“The idea that threats would result in the Iranian regime backing off is not at all what we're seeing,” Parsi added. “On the contrary, we're probably seeing the most brutal level of violence used against people since the start of the Islamic Revolution .”

Senior lawmakers have also voiced contrasting opinions, with Republican Senator Lindsey Graham urging Trump to “embolden the protesters and scare the hell out of the regime”.

“If I were you, Mr. President, I would kill the leadership that are killing the people,” Graham, who has often touted a ‍muscular approach to foreign policy, told Fox News on Sunday. “You’ve got to end this.”

But at least two Senate colleagues have sounded notes of caution.

“I don’t know that bombing Iran will have the effect that is intended,” Republican Senator Rand Paul told ABC News, warning that a military attack on Iran could rally the people against an outside enemy.

History shows the dangers of US intervention, added Democratic Senator Mark Warner, ‍who argued that the US-backed 1953 overthrow of Iran's government set in motion a chain of events that gradually led to the rise of the country's Islamic regime.

Reza Pahlavi, whose father the late shah of Iran was overthrown during the 1979 Islamic Revolution, has been one of the most prominent voices calling for a US intervention in the country.

In a message designed to flatter and galvanise Trump, the exiled Pahlavi publicly encouraged the US president to choose a different course from his predecessor Barack Obama , who hesitated at supporting Iran’s massive protest movement in 2009 for fear of co-opting a homegrown movement.

Pahlavi's name has surfaced in protesters’ slogans urging a restoration of the monarchy. On Sunday he said he was prepared to return to Iran to lead a shift to a ‍democratic government.

But Washington has given no indication so far that it plans to back the son of the shah, or indeed push for regime change.

“Unlike what happened in Afghanistan and Iraq in the early 2000s, there is little appetite within the Trump administration for regime change,” said Clément Therme, a historian and Iran expert at the Université Paul-Valéry in Montpellier.

“Instead, the administration’s preference goes to one-off operations aimed at destabilising opponents,” said Therme, noting that the Venezuelan opposition is no closer to power today than it was before Maduro’s capture.

He added: “I very much doubt that Trump will want to invest American military capital in the restoration of the Pahlavi dynasty.”</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 18:35:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/643a1f98-f0a3-11f0-916e-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-13T154555Z-815588752-RC2F0JASSB9S-RTRMADP-3-USA-TRUMP.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UN chief warns he could refer Israel to world court over action against UN Palestinian refugee agency</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/un-chief-warns-he-could-refer-israel-world-court-over-action-against-un-2026-01-13/</link><description>UNITED NATIONS, Jan 13 (Reuters) - U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has warned Israel in a letter that he could refer the country to the International Court of Justice if it does not repeal laws targeting U.N. Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA and return seized assets and property.

In a January 8 letter to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Guterres said the United Nations cannot remain indifferent to "actions taken by Israel, which are in direct contravention of the obligations of Israel under international law. They must be reversed without delay."

Israel's parliament passed a law in October 2024 banning the agency from operating in the country and prohibiting officials from having contact with the agency. It then amended that law last month to ban electricity or water to UNRWA facilities.

Israeli authorities also seized UNRWA's East Jerusalem offices last month. The U.N. considers East Jerusalem occupied by Israel. Israel considers all of Jerusalem to be part of the country.

Israel's U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon on Tuesday dismissed Guterres' letter to Netanyahu.

"We are not fazed by the Secretary-General's threats," Danon said. "Instead of dealing with the undeniable involvement of UNRWA personnel in terrorism, the Secretary-General chooses to threaten Israel. This is not defending international law, this is defending an organization marred by terrorism."

Israel has long been critical of UNRWA, which was created by the General Assembly in 1949 following the war surrounding the founding of Israel. It provides aid, health and education to millions of Palestinians in Gaza, the West Bank, Syria, Lebanon and Jordan.

The United Nations has said that nine UNRWA staff may have been involved in the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel and were fired. A Hamas commander in Lebanon - killed in September by Israel - was also found to have had a UNRWA job.

The U.N. has vowed to investigate all accusations made and has repeatedly asked Israel for evidence, which it says has not been provided.

The Hamas attack in 2023 triggered the war between Israel and the Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip. Top U.N. officials and the U.N. Security Council have described UNRWA as the backbone of the aid response in Gaza, where the two-year war between Israel and Palestinian militant group Hamas unleashed a humanitarian catastrophe.

The United Nations' top legal body, the International Court of Justice, in October gave an advisory opinion saying Israel is under the obligation to ensure the basic needs of the civilian population in Gaza are met.

The ICJ opinion was requested by the 193-member U.N. General Assembly. Advisory opinions of the ICJ, also known as the World Court, carry legal and political weight, but they are not binding and the court has no enforcement power.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 19:21:17 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KWMCS72VSZNU7FDXZAWYAHBS2E.jpg?auth=bd892e88ad5ddb5663b06315da54cf787641f6b7baee0dfc22fa7abb47423872&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US envoy Witkoff, Reza Pahlavi discussed Iran protests, Axios reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-envoy-witkoff-reza-pahlavi-discussed-iran-protests-axios-reports-2026-01-13/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 13 (Reuters) - White House envoy Steve Witkoff over the weekend met with Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of Iran's last shah and a prominent voice in the fragmented opposition, to discuss the protests roiling that country, Axios reported on Tuesday, citing an unidentified senior U.S. official.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 19:22:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/B2KWWK3ZARLMPB7CWLLFOOJUIA.jpg?auth=bf5c2c385a0eeafa21c20f1d6bcbf7e97b9202a09b305cf16b3a587a25a9b084&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US to revoke citizenship of naturalized migrants convicted of fraud, Trump says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-revoke-citizenship-naturalized-migrants-convicted-fraud-trump-says-2026-01-13/</link><description>DETROIT, Jan 13 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that his administration is going to revoke the citizenship of any naturalized immigrant from Somalia or any other country who is convicted of defrauding "our citizens."

The number of dead climbed to at least 2,003 , as reported by the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency. That figure dwarfs the death toll from any other round of protest or unrest in Iran in decades and recalls the chaos surrounding the country's 1979 Islamic Revolution .

Iranian state television offered the first official acknowledgment of the deaths, quoting an official saying the country had “a lot of martyrs” and that it did not release a toll earlier because of the dead suffering gruesome injuries. However, that statement came only after activists reported their toll.

The demonstrations began a little over two weeks ago in anger over Iran’s ailing economy and soon targeted the theocracy, particularly 86-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei . Images obtained Tuesday by the Associated Press from demonstrations in Tehran showed graffiti and chants calling for Khamenei's death – something that could carry a death sentence.

Iranian state media has said dozens of members of the security forces have been killed, with their funerals turning into large pro-government rallies. Authorities have declared three days of national mourning for those killed.

Soon after the new death toll became public, US President Donald Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform: “Iranian Patriots, KEEP PROTESTING – TAKE OVER YOUR INSTITUTIONS!!!”

He added: “I have cancelled all meetings with Iranian Officials until the senseless killing of protesters STOPS. HELP IS ON ITS WAY.” Trump did not give details.

Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, speaking to the Qatar-funded satellite news network Al Jazeera in an interview aired Monday night, said he had continued to communicate with US envoy Steve Witkoff .

But after Trump's message Tuesday, top Iranian security official Ali Larijani responded by writing: “We declare the names of the main killers of the people of Iran: 1- Trump 2-” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu .

The activist group said 1,850 of the dead were protesters and 135 were government-affiliated. Nine children were killed, along with nine civilians it said were not taking part in protests. More than 16,700 people have been detained, the group said.

With the internet down in Iran, gauging the demonstrations from abroad has grown more difficult. Outlets have been unable to independently assess the toll. Iran’s government has not offered overall casualty figures.

Skylar Thompson with the Human Rights Activists News Agency said the new toll was shocking, particularly since it reached four times the death toll of the months-long 2022 Mahsa Amini protests in just two weeks.

“We’re horrified, but we still think the number is conservative," she said, warning that the toll would still rise.

Speaking by phone for the first time since their calls were cut off from the outside world, Iranian witnesses described a heavy security presence in central Tehran, burned-out government buildings, smashed ATMs and few passersby. Meanwhile, people were concerned about what comes next, including the possibility of a US attack.

“My customers talk about Trump’s reaction while wondering if he plans a military strike against the Islamic Republic,” said shopkeeper Mahmoud, who gave only his first name out of concern for his safety.

“I don’t expect Trump or any other foreign country cares about the interests of Iranians.”

Reza, a taxi driver who also gave just his first name, said protests are on many people's minds.

“People – particularly young ones – are hopeless, but they talk about continuing the protests,” he said.

Several people in Tehran were able to call the AP on Tuesday and speak to a journalist. The AP bureau in Dubai, United Arab Emirates , was unable to call those numbers back. Witnesses said text messaging was still down, and internet users in Iran could connect to government-approved websites locally but nothing abroad.

Anti-riot police officers wore helmets and body armour while carrying batons, shields, shotguns and tear gas launchers, according to the witnesses. Police stood watch at major intersections. Nearby, witnesses saw members of the Revolutionary Guard's all-volunteer Basij force, who carried firearms and batons. Security officials in plainclothes were visible in public spaces.

Several banks and government offices were burned during the unrest, witnesses said. Banks struggled to complete transactions without the internet, they added.

Shops were open, though there was little foot traffic in the capital. Tehran's Grand Bazaar, where the demonstrations began December 28 over the collapse of Iran's rial currency, opened Tuesday. A witness described speaking to multiple shopkeepers who said security forces ordered them to reopen no matter what. Iranian state media did not acknowledge that order.

The witnesses spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal.

It also appeared that security service personnel were searching for Starlink terminals, as people in northern Tehran reported authorities raiding apartment buildings with satellite dishes.

While satellite television dishes are illegal, many in the capital have them in homes, and officials broadly had given up on enforcing the law in recent years.

On the streets, people also could be seen challenging plainclothes security officials, who were stopping passersby at random.

State television also read a statement about mortuary and morgue services being free – a signal that some likely charged high fees for the release of bodies amid the crackdown.

Khamenei, in a statement carried by state TV, praised the tens of thousands who took part in pro-government demonstrations nationwide on Monday.

“This was a warning to American politicians to stop their deceit and not rely on traitorous mercenaries,” he said. “The Iranian nation is strong and powerful and aware of the enemy.”

State TV on Monday aired chants from the crowd, which appeared to number in the tens of thousands. They chanted “Death to America!” and “Death to Israel !” Others cried out, “Death to the enemies of God!” Iran’s attorney general has warned that anyone taking part in protests will be considered an “enemy of God”, a death-penalty charge.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 21:44:02 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/a05df8dc-f0bc-11f0-882c-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/000-92H27ZQ.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>NAACP says Trump being deceptive about history after reverse discrimination remark</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/naacp-says-trump-being-deceptive-about-history-after-reverse-discrimination-2026-01-13/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 13 (Reuters) - The largest U.S. civil rights group on Tuesday said President Donald Trump was being deceptive in his comments about "reverse discrimination" and in his claims that civil rights hurt white people, with the NAACP adding that "deception is the point" of such remarks to lay groundwork for rolling back social progress.

In an interview from last week published by the New York Times, Trump said he believed civil rights-era protections resulted in white people being treated unfairly.

"White people were very badly treated, where they did extremely well and they were not invited to go into a university to college," the newspaper quoted Trump as saying in an apparent reference to affirmative action in college admissions.

The comments came after Trump was asked whether protections that began in the 1960s with passage of the Civil Rights Act resulted in discrimination against white men, according to the newspaper.

"It accomplished some very wonderful things, but it also hurt a lot of people — people that deserve to go to a college or deserve to get a job were unable to get a job," Trump was quoted as saying. "It was a reverse discrimination."

NAACP President Derrick Johnson denounced the comments.

"Donald Trump knows he is lying through his teeth. The issue isn't that he is unaware of the history or lacks education, it's that deception is the point," Johnson said in a statement. There is "zero evidence, none, that the civil rights movement harmed white people in any way," Johnson added.

"Trump does this all the time. He deliberately invents a false reality to lay the groundwork for policies that further benefit the top one percent by privatizing government services and stripping resources away from underserved communities."

Trump has been criticized by rights groups over his immigration crackdown , assault on diversity initiatives , funding freeze against universities over pro-Palestinian protests , opens new tab and attacks against cultural institutions for focusing on issues like slavery .

Trump cites security reasons for his immigration crackdown and says he is fighting against what he calls " anti-American views ."</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 22:23:07 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/C7UWJIU6UBM2NFWPF5YE3P6K5Y.jpg?auth=e74742a3793792d276355eff227ac5154d72aa1a955ef302f696dedcc1cfbe1e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>German Foreign Minister Wadephul says there is more consensus than disagreement with the US</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/german-foreign-minister-wadephul-says-there-is-more-consensus-than-disagreement-2026-01-13/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 13 (Reuters) - German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said on Tuesday that there is more consensus than disagreement with the United States.

"I am really returning calm, but also with the feeling that it is good to remain in close exchange in the future," he said ahead of his return to Berlin following two days of meetings in the U.S.

Wadephul's comments came amid increasing tensions over Washington's aims toward Greenland, an autonomous region of Denmark which U.S. President Donald Trump says is vital for U.S. security.

Wadephul reiterated that Greenland and Denmark should decide the future of the island.

"Questions of sovereignty over the territory of the Kingdom of Denmark will be decided by Denmark, by no one else," he said.

The standoff over Greenland has fueled deepening fears in Europe over the future of the NATO alliance and transatlantic relations but Wadephul said almost all his interlocutors said they want to attend the Munich Security Conference in February.

"That shows the United States' broad interest — across party lines— in a close relationship with Germany and Europe," Wadephul said.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 22:23:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/AFOGF566CVMV3ENG6BRIUGENCM.jpg?auth=ea39ebb8008a72d6fc2a26ac276b53f80dd24003b8420165dd2ca3d9a7511e40&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Exclusive: US files for warrants to seize dozens more Venezuela-linked oil tankers, sources say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/us-files-warrants-seize-dozens-more-venezuela-linked-oil-tankers-sources-say-2026-01-13/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 13 (Reuters) - The U.S. government has filed for court warrants to seize dozens more tankers linked to the Venezuelan oil trade, four sources familiar with the matter said, as Washington consolidates control of oil shipments in and out of the South American country.

The U.S. military and Coast Guard have seized five vessels in recent weeks in international waters that were either carrying Venezuelan oil or have done so in the past. The seizures were part of Washington's campaign to force Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro out of power that culminated in U.S. forces capturing him on January 3.

Since then, the administration of President Donald Trump has said it plans to control Venezuela's oil resources indefinitely as it seeks to rebuild the country's dilapidated oil industry.

Trump imposed a blockade to prevent sanctioned tankers from shipping Venezuelan oil in December that brought exports close to a standstill. Shipments have resumed this week under U.S. supervision.

The U.S. government has filed multiple civil forfeiture actions in district courts, primarily in Washington, D.C., enabling the seizure and confiscation of oil cargoes and ships that have been involved in the trade, the sources told Reuters. They declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter.

The exact number of seizure warrants the U.S. has filed for, and how many it has already received, is unclear, the sources said, because the filings and legal orders are not public. Dozens have been filed, they added.

The Department of Justice did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The vessels already intercepted were either under U.S. sanctions or part of a "shadow fleet" of unregulated ships that disguise their origins to move oil from key sanctioned producers Iran, Russia or Venezuela.

There are still many tankers at sea carrying Venezuelan crude to top buyer China, or that have previously done so. The U.S. has imposed sanctions on many of those vessels for facilitating oil trade with Venezuela or Iran.

SEIZURES PAUSED SINCE FRIDAY: SOURCES

There has been a pause in U.S. action to seize vessels since Friday, the sources said. Action could resume against vessels and cargoes not authorized by the U.S., they said.

The Department of Defense, together with other U.S. agencies, would "hunt down and interdict ALL dark fleet vessels transporting Venezuelan oil at the time and place of our choosing", Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell said on Friday on X , opens new tab .

The United States has targeted both the vessels and the cargoes on them in recent seizures. That is an escalation from previous seizures of Iranian cargoes between 2020 and 2023, shipping industry sources said. In those earlier cases, U.S. law enforcers confiscated the oil cargo but not the vessel itself.

The Department of Justice was "monitoring several other vessels for similar enforcement action", U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said on social media on January 7, after the seizure of the Bella-1 tanker, which was empty of any cargo and the first time in recent memory that the U.S. military has seized a Russian-flagged vessel.

Russia, like Venezuela, relies on the shadow fleet to carry oil that is under sanctions.

Russia's Foreign Ministry described the action as "the illegal use of force" , opens new tab by the U.S. military, adding that the application of U.S. sanctions was "without legal foundation."</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 22:23:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/54K3SJSKLZP5TBYLYSN76V3DCM.jpg?auth=50d187a2add5554c94082e6489027472c3b1422ad4a03a46707f7577a1fc7d69&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Judge suggests visa for college student deported mistakenly to Honduras</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/judge-suggests-visa-college-student-deported-mistakenly-honduras-2026-01-13/</link><description>BOSTON, Jan 13 (Reuters) - A U.S. federal judge on Tuesday urged the Trump administration to resolve a "bureaucratic mess" by issuing a student visa to a college student who was deported to Honduras after being arrested at Boston's airport while trying to visit her family for Thanksgiving.

U.S. District Judge Richard Stearns during a hearing in Boston raised that prospect as a "practical solution" to how to resolve a lawsuit by Any Lucia Lopez Belloza, a 19-year-old student at Babson College who was sent to Honduras in violation of a court order.

Lopez Belloza, who was brought to the U.S. from Honduras by her parents when she was 8, was arrested on November 20 based on a removal order she says she did not know existed.

Her lawyer filed a lawsuit challenging her detention the next day.

A federal judge in Massachusetts issued an order on November 21 barring Lopez Belloza from being deported or transferred out of Massachusetts for 72 hours.

But by that time, Lopez Belloza had already been flown to Texas, potentially stripping Stearns' court of jurisdiction. She was flown to Honduras on November 22.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark Sauter acknowledged the court's order was violated, a development he blamed on a "mistake" by an officer with Immigration and Customs Enforcement who thought the order no longer applied and failed to properly flag it.

"On behalf of the government, we want to sincerely apologize," Sauter said.

He said there were no grounds to hold anyone in contempt, however. He called it a rare instance of the government not following an order in the over 700 cases filed in Massachusetts by migrants challenging their detention since President Donald Trump took office last year with a hardline immigration agenda.

Stearns, who was appointed by Democratic President Bill Clinton, commended Sauter for acknowledging the mistake and asked what the remedy should be, saying "we don't want to lose sight that we have a real human being here."

Todd Pomerleau, Lopez Belloza's lawyer, urged Stearns to order the government to facilitate the return of his client and to hold officials in contempt.

"The rule of law ought to matter," Pomerleau said.

Stearns did not immediately rule. But he floated an alternative, recommending the State Department issue Lopez Belloza a student visa allowing her to finish her studies.

"We all recognize a mistake was made," Stearns said. "She's a very sympathetic person, and there should be some means to addressing this."</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 22:24:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/D3OGZCMKARIZ7PG2HEFABSQ26U.jpg?auth=3a2cec9f2bca19e74d0fb1ab340c95c2d3f41f37761be69c35405b09a2c360cf&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US will take 'very strong action' if Iran hangs protesters, Trump tells CBS News</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-will-take-very-strong-action-if-iran-hangs-protesters-trump-tells-cbs-news-2026-01-13/</link><description>Jan 13 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Tuesday the United States would take "very strong action" if the Iranian government starts hanging protesters, but did not elaborate on what those actions would be.

Rights groups have said that the number of releases ranges between 60 and 70, while complaining about the slow pace and lack of information. On Monday, Venezuela's penitentiary authority said that 116 people had been freed from prison.

Foro Penal, a leading local NGO that works on legal support for detainees, said at least 800 political prisoners were behind bars at the beginning of the year.

The government says it does not hold political prisoners and that those arrested have been charged with legitimate crimes.

Opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Corina Machado, who is expected to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday, has been one of the leading voices demanding the release of prisoners, some of whom are her close allies.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 22:24:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CK5UVW6Q2RMRZE2DVMN5JILCDQ.jpg?auth=e8625d140615543ac7cf9f65c3b9bf6cd0139a17d03a41b509c1997a58c2a175&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Japan PM Takaichi mulls Feb 8 snap election, Yomiuri reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/japan-pm-takaichi-mulls-feb-8-snap-election-yomiuri-reports-2026-01-13/</link><description>TOKYO, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi is considering calling a snap lower house election on February 8 after dissolving the house next week, the Yomiuri newspaper reported on Wednesday.

In a short video posted on the Japanese Prime Minister's office Youtube channel on Wednesday morning, the two leaders played the drums to global hits from the likes of BTS and Kpop Demon Hunters.

Takaichi, a keen drummer and fan of heavy metal, complemented Lee's new found chops.

"The president learned to play the drums in just 5, 10 minutes," she said in the video.

"Although our tempos were a bit different, we both tried to match the rhythm together - we will create a future-oriented relationship with one heart," Lee posted on X on Wednesday morning.

While ties between Tokyo and Seoul have often been strained in the past, Takaichi and Lee have forged a friendlier relationship and on Wednesday morning the two also visited Horyuji Temple in Nara, Takaichi's hometown.

In statements on Tuesday, Takaichi and Lee said they aimed to deepen security and economic ties in the face of growing tensions in East Asia and to continue "shuttle diplomacy", with Takaichi next due to visit South Korea.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 01:50:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/R6VBNXUEZBLFBHG3PNCCAI73MQ.jpg?auth=2343ae3e544feef01f210f6f06b9bb5e327d3b3fe8040e353f411b5d9026df50&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russian drone attack forces power cuts in Ukraine's Kryvyi Rih, military says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/russian-drone-attack-forces-power-cuts-ukraines-kryvyi-rih-military-says-2026-01-14/</link><description>Jan 14 (Reuters) - Russian drones struck infrastructure in the central Ukrainian city of Kryvyi Rih on Wednesday, forcing emergency power blackouts for more than 45,000 customers and disrupting heat supplies, military administration head Oleksandr Vilkul said.

"Please fill up on water and charge your devices, if you have the chance. It's going to be difficult," Vilkul said on the Telegram messaging app.

Water utility pumping stations switched to generators and water remained in the system, but there could be pressure problems.

The full scale of the attack was not immediately known. There was no comment from Russia about the strike.

Russia has repeatedly struck Ukraine’s power plants, substations and transmission lines with missiles and drones, seeking to knock out electricity and heating and hinder industry during the nearly four-year war .

Kyiv says the campaign has forced rolling outages and emergency cuts to cities across the country, as repair crews work under fire and Ukraine relies on air defences and electricity imports to stabilise the grid.

Kryvyi Rih, a steel-and-mining hub in the Dnipropetrovsk region and President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s hometown, has been hit repeatedly , with strikes killing civilians and damaging homes and industry.

The city sits close enough to southern front lines to be within strike range, while its factories, logistics links and workforce make it economically important and a key rear-area centre supporting Ukraine’s war effort.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 01:52:16 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russian drone attack forces power cuts in Ukraine's Kryvyi Rih, military says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/russian-drone-attack-forces-power-cuts-ukraines-kryvyi-rih-military-says-2026-01-14/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 01:52:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>US civil rights pioneer Claudette Colvin dies at 86</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260113-claudette-colvin-us-civil-rights-pioneer-dead</link><description>Claudette Colvin, who refused to give up her seat on a segregated bus in Alabama in 1955 and became a US civil rights pioneer, has died aged 86, her foundation said Tuesday.

Colvin, then aged 15, made her protest several months before Rosa Parks' similar act of defiance became a key moment in the birth of the modern civil rights movement in the United States.

Colvin "leaves behind a legacy of courage that helped change the course of American history," her foundation said.

Colvin had been studying Black history in school on March 2, 1955, when she was detained after she refused to give up her seat to a white woman on a bus in Montgomery -- the same southern US city where Parks' protest made headlines.

"I remained seated because the lady could have sat in the seat opposite me," Colvin told reporters in Paris in April 2023.

"She refused because...a white person wasn't supposed to sit close to a negro."

"People ask me why I refused to move, and I say history had me glued to the seat," Colvin said.

Colvin was briefly imprisoned for disturbing public order. The following year, she became one of four Black female plaintiffs who filed a lawsuit challenging segregated bus seating in Montgomery.

The case was successful, impacting public transportation throughout the United States, including trains, airplanes and taxis.

Colvin's role in the US civil rights movement was less celebrated than that of Parks, who was already a key figure in the local chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) at the time of her arrest.

Parks' arrest triggered a year-long bus boycott in Montgomery that thrust civil rights leader Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. to national prominence.

The civil rights movement led to significant advances for Black people in the mid-1960s -- ending legal segregation and securing their voting rights.

Colvin, who was born in Alabama in 1939 as the eldest of eight sisters, would be ostracized from the civil rights movement when she became pregnant out of wedlock.

She spent decades in obscurity, working for 30 years at a Catholic nursing home, caring for elderly patients as a nursing assistant.

But she won recognition later in life.

A 2009 biography by Phillip Hoose, "Claudette Colvin: Twice Toward Justice," won the US National Book Award for young people's literature.

However, it was only in 2021 that the record of her 1955 arrest and adjudication of delinquency was expunged by a US court.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 01:53:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/1bac3fd6-f0d0-11f0-babc-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP21299826050638.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Uganda shuts down internet ahead of election</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/uganda-shuts-down-internet-ahead-of-election</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 01:53:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/763f2636-f0c4-11f0-a569-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/ANGL260113-2141-Live-01.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UK's foreign minister to urge NATO to focus on Arctic in Finland and Norway visit</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uks-foreign-minister-urge-nato-focus-arctic-finland-norway-visit-2026-01-14/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Britain's foreign minister will visit Finland and Norway on Wednesday, where she will call for NATO to step up its work in the Arctic to safeguard regional interests against Russia.

Yvette Cooper's Arctic Circle tour follows renewed threats by U.S. President Donald Trump to take over Greenland, an autonomous territory of the Kingdom of Denmark. The Danish and Greenlandic foreign ministers will meet U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Wednesday.

Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer has said he stands with Denmark in its defence of Greenland.

Cooper's trip will focus on Russia, which the foreign office described in a statement as the "greatest threat" to Arctic security.

In Finland, Cooper will meet border guards defending NATO's eastern flank with Russia, while in Norway she will visit marines taking part in a live training exercise.

The high north, which includes Greenland, is home to key shipping routes and critical infrastructure such as undersea cables, making the region vital to Britain's security, the foreign office said.

"The UK and Norway share a determination to ensure Russia does not succeed in its illegal war of aggression," the foreign office said, adding that Russia posed a threat through its military activity, risks to undersea infrastructure and the use of its "shadow fleet".

Britain last week provided support to the U.S. in its operation to seize a Russian-flagged oil tanker in the North Atlantic.

"Arctic security is critical to protecting Britain and NATO," Cooper said, urging the military alliance to enhance efforts to defend Euro-Atlantic interests against "hostile states who seek to meddle" in the high north.

"Coming together as an alliance allows us to unify and tackle this emerging threat," she added, noting that climate change has opened new shipping routes, exposed valuable resources, and turned the region into a "hotspot" for geopolitical competition.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 03:48:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4ZCR74S76FMHDHVT7Q5RZRWYGQ.jpg?auth=53d75e2b1c894f0a68071b2c0531c282b9176f5d4aa9d7b33cb9fe1c9b5e0aa7&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iraqi officials arrest man wanted by Australian police as 'number one priority'</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/iraqi-officials-arrest-man-wanted-by-australian-police-number-one-priority-2026-01-14/</link><description>SYDNEY, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Iraqi officials have arrested a man wanted by Australian Federal Police as a person of interest in the investigation into a spate of firebombings, including an antisemitic attack on a Melbourne synagogue, police said on Wednesday.

Australian Federal Police Commissioner Krissy Barrett said the arrested man, Kazem Hamad, was a threat to national security and that she had identified him as her "Number One priority".

Iraq's National Center for International Judicial Cooperation said in a statement that Kadhim Malik Hamad Rabah al-Hajami had been arrested as part of a drugs investigation, after a request from Australia.

Barrett said Iraqi officials had made an independent decision to arrest the man in their own criminal investigation, after Australian Federal Police provided information to Iraqi law enforcement late last year.

"This arrest is a significant disruption to an alleged serious criminal and his alleged criminal enterprise in Australia," she said in a statement.

In October, Barrett said that in addition to being a suspect in arson attacks in Australia linked to the tobacco trade, the man was "a person of interest in the investigation into the alleged politically-motivated arson attack on the Adass Israel Synagogue" in Melbourne

Australia expelled Iran's ambassador in August after the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation traced the funding of hooded criminals who allegedly set fire to the Melbourne synagogue in December 2024 to Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.

Hamad, previously convicted in Australia for drug trafficking offences, was deported from Australia to Iraq in 2023.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 03:48:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>2025 was the world's third-warmest year on record, EU scientists say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/cop/2025-was-worlds-third-warmest-year-record-eu-scientists-say-2026-01-14/</link><description>BRUSSELS, Jan 14 (Reuters) - The planet experienced its third-warmest year on record in 2025, and average temperatures have exceeded 1.5 degrees Celsius of global warming over three years, the longest period since records began, EU scientists said on Wednesday.

The data from the European Union's European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) found that the last three years were the planet's three hottest since records began - with 2025 marginally cooler than 2023, by just 0.01 C.

Britain's national weather service, the UK Met Office, confirmed its own data ranked 2025 as the third-warmest in records going back to 1850. The World Meteorological Organization will publish its temperature figures later on Wednesday.

The hottest year on record was 2024.

ECMWF said the planet also just had its first three-year period in which the average global temperature was 1.5 C above the pre-industrial era - the limit beyond which scientists expect global warming will unleash severe impacts, some of them irreversible.

"1.5 C is not a cliff edge. However, we know that every fraction of a degree matters, particularly for worsening extreme weather events," said Samantha Burgess, strategic lead for climate at ECMWF.

Governments pledged under the 2015 Paris Agreement to try to avoid exceeding 1.5 C of global warming, measured as a decades-long average temperature compared with the pre-industrial era.

But their failure to reduce greenhouse gas emissions means that level could now be breached before 2030 - a decade earlier than had been predicted when the Paris accord was signed in 2015, ECMWF said.

"We are bound to pass it," said Carlo Buontempo, director of the EU's Copernicus Climate Change Service. "The choice we now have is how to best manage the inevitable overshoot and its consequences on societies and natural systems."

Currently, the world's long-term warming level is about 1.4 C above the pre-industrial era, ECMWF said. Measured on a short-term basis, the world already breached 1.5 C in 2024.

Exceeding the long-term 1.5 C limit - even if only temporarily - would lead to more extreme and widespread impacts, including hotter and longer heatwaves, and more powerful storms and floods.

In 2025, wildfires in Europe produced the highest total emissions on record, while scientific studies confirmed specific weather events were made worse by climate change - including Hurricane Melissa in the Caribbean and monsoon rains in Pakistan which killed more than 1,000 people in floods.

Despite these worsening impacts, climate science is facing increased political pushback. U.S. President Donald Trump, who has called climate change "the greatest con job ", last week withdrew from dozens of U.N. entities including the scientific Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change .

The long-established consensus among the world's scientists is that climate change is real, mostly caused by humans, and getting worse. Its main cause is greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas, which trap heat in the atmosphere.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 03:48:58 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LY63PDKSE5JXBB7DIZ2HURKFVQ.jpg?auth=5d3efaf92fd189db5b53ff1e165a49665af93a452d6b2a422eebe641dfbee448&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Japan will not comment on BOJ's absence in joint Powell statement</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/japan-will-not-comment-bojs-absence-joint-powell-statement-2026-01-14/</link><description>TOKYO, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Japan declined on Wednesday to comment on the ​Bank of Japan's absence from a statement by ‌other central banks supporting U.S. Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, following the Trump administration's threat of criminal indictment.

The BOJ was ‍not among the major central banks that issued the joint statement backing Powell.

The rare joint statement was signed by the ⁠heads of the European Central Bank, the ‍Bank of England, the Bank of Canada, as well as ‌the ‌central bank chiefs of Sweden, Denmark, Switzerland, Australia, South Korea, Brazil and France.

Asked about the importance of independence of central banks, Kihara said the ⁠government believes that ⁠the ultimate ​responsibility for macroeconomic policy lies with the government.

Although she remained a largely unsung figure in the civil rights movement for decades, Colvin's 1955 act of rebellion inspired Parks and others and helped form the basis for the federal lawsuit that outlawed racial segregation in U.S. public transportation.

Her death, under hospice care in Texas, was confirmed by Ashley Roseboro, a spokesperson for her family and the Claudette Colvin Foundation.

In one of the first publicized acts of civil disobedience against Montgomery's Jim Crow rules governing city bus seating by race, Colvin refused to relinquish her seat for a white woman, as ordered by the driver, and stayed put until she was dragged off the bus by police.

According to accounts of her testimony in court, Colvin recalled she had been studying anti-slavery abolitionist heroes in school, and felt that she had Harriet Tubman on one shoulder, Sojourner Truth on the other, and "history had me glued to the seat."

But Parks, an older seamstress who was secretary of the local NAACP chapter, was seen as a more dignified, sympathetic figure to rally behind as civil rights leaders organized what became the year-long bus boycott that thrust the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. to the national stage.

In the lead-up to the boycott, which started in December 1955, issues of social class and even "colorism" - Colvin came from a poorer background and was lighter skinned than Parks - led civil rights leaders to shy away from the teenager as a standard bearer for the movement, according to Roseboro.

About a year after her arrest, she also became pregnant by a married man from an encounter that she later described as statutory rape.

Nevertheless, Colvin went on to become one of several plaintiffs and a principal witness in the Browder v. Gayle lawsuit challenging the city's Jim Crow bus policies. The case eventually led to the landmark 1956 U.S. Supreme Court decision banning segregation in public transit as unconstitutional.

Colvin lived in obscurity for decades afterward, working as a caregiver and nurse's aide and struggling as a single mother, though historians and others have since brought to light the pivotal role she played in the early civil rights movement.

Fred Gray, the attorney behind Browder v. Gayle, credited Colvin with helping to ignite the battle against segregation in the Deep South.

"I don't mean to take anything away from Mrs. Parks, but Claudette gave all of us the moral courage to do what we did," the Washington Post quoted Gray as saying.

In recent years, Colvin succeeded in having her juvenile arrest record expunged, Roseboro said.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 03:49:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/AJOTTZ37DFJFFEF3Q74KVJDEJA.jpg?auth=fc2aac3ff81f3c174cead7628f12d54054642369c80c52e2be1476f5611b6fe4&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Brunei sultan to undergo knee replacement surgery</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/brunei-sultan-undergo-knee-replacement-surgery-2026-01-14/</link><description>BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Brunei's ruler Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah will undergo knee replacement surgery this weekend, with a recovery period expected to last between two to three months, his office said.

The 79-year-old sultan, one of the world's longest-reigning monarchs, will be limiting his presence at national and official ceremonies during the recovery process for rest and physiotherapy sessions, the office said in a statement on Tuesday.

"However, His Majesty will continue to carry out official duties during the period," it said, adding the surgery would take place in Brunei on Sunday.

The sultan, who ascended the throne in 1967, holds multiple roles in Brunei, serving also as its prime minister, armed forces commander, finance minister, foreign minister and defense minister.

Once the world's wealthiest man, the sultan remains hugely popular in the tiny, oil-rich nation on the island of Borneo, despite holding a firm grip on power in the country of nearly half a million people.

He was briefly hospitalised in Malaysia in May last year due to fatigue during a summit of Southeast Asian leaders in Kuala Lumpur.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 03:49:26 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/3ASB5UZZQJLRVMBQZWSXOF7C7U.jpg?auth=32b738a88b279f7ee26561abf1d36dbaa41f483352517f271de5efd524fa27a3&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Live: Iran says US seeking 'pretext for military intervention'</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260114-live-iran-says-us-seeking-pretext-for-military-intervention</link><description>Iran 's government on Tuesday accused the United States of seeking to manufacture a pretext for military intervention, after US President Donald Trump threatened "strong action" over the deadly crackdown on mass protests.

"US fantasies and policy toward Iran are rooted in regime change, with sanctions, threats, engineered unrest, and chaos serving as the modus operandi to manufacture a pretext for military intervention," Iran 's UN mission posted on X, vowing that Washington's "playbook" would "fail again."

Iranian state media has aired at least 97 confessions from protesters, many expressing remorse for their actions, since the protests began on Dec. 28, according to a rights group that is tracking the videos.

The US.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency says that based on testimony from prior detainees, the confessions often come after psychological or physical torture — and can have serious consequences, including the death penalty.

In a statement published in a state newspaper it called on the International Court of Justice, which began hearings in The Hague on Monday, to "reach its judgement based on fact and settled law strictly within the framework of the Genocide Convention".

ICJ judges are hearing three weeks of testimony as they weigh accusations by The Gambia that Myanmar committed genocide against the Rohingya in a 2017 crackdown.

Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims fled violence by the Myanmar army and Buddhist militias, escaping to neighbouring Bangladesh and bringing harrowing accounts of mass rape, arson and murder.

On the first day of the hearings Gambia's justice minister Dawda Jallow told the court the Rohingya "have been targeted for destruction".

Lawyers for Myanmar will begin their court response on Friday.

The allegations made by The Gambia are flawed and unfounded in fact and law," said the Yangon foreign ministry statement.

"Biased reports, based on unreliable evidence, cannot make up for truth."

The country -- ruled by a military junta since a coup in 2021 -- was co-operating with the ICJ "in good faith" in a sign of its respect for international law, it added.

The statement did not use the word Rohingya, referring instead to "persons from Rakhine state".

Today, 1.17 million Rohingya live crammed into dilapidated camps spread over 8,000 acres in Cox's Bazar in Bangladesh.

Myanmar has always maintained the crackdown by its armed forces was justified to root out Rohingya insurgents after a series of attacks left a dozen security personnel dead.

A final decision could take months or even years, and while the ICJ has no means of enforcing its decisions, a ruling in favour of The Gambia would heap more political pressure on Myanmar.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 03:49:39 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/cd528310-f0eb-11f0-9608-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25295489165312.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukraine drone attack sparks industrial fire in Russia's Rostov-on-Don, officials say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/ukraine-drone-attack-sparks-industrial-fire-russias-rostov-on-don-officials-say-2026-01-14/</link><description>Jan 14 (Reuters) - A Ukrainian drone attack overnight caused two fires at an industrial facility, injured four people and damaged apartment buildings in the southern Russian port of Rostov-on-Don, regional officials said on Wednesday.

Yuri Slyusar, governor of Russia’s Rostov region, said four people, including a four-year-old child, were injured when falling debris from downed drones damaged their apartments. Rostov-on-Don is the Rostov region's administrative centre.

All of the injured people were hospitalised, Slyusar said on the Telegram messaging app.

He would not say what industrial facility was on fire, adding that by early Wednesday morning, one of the fires was extinguished and the other contained.

Aleksandr Skryabin, the mayor of Rostov-on-Don, said temporary accommodation was arranged for the families from the damaged apartments.

The full-scale impact of the attack was not immediately known. There was no comment from Ukraine about the strike.

Ukraine has used drones to strike targets inside Russia, saying such attacks seek to degrade Moscow’s military and energy infrastructure and respond to Russia’s continued strikes on Ukrainian cities during the war that Moscow launched nearly four years ago.

Rostov-on-Don, a major transport and logistics hub near Ukraine, hosts key military headquarters and routes used to supply Russian forces, making it a strategic rear-area centre for Moscow’s operations and a target for drones.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 04:48:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Far-right group targeting pro-Palestinian voices to close New York operation, NY AG says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/far-right-group-targeting-pro-palestinian-voices-close-new-york-operation-ny-ag-2026-01-14/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 13 (Reuters) - New York Attorney General Letitia James' office said on Tuesday it reached a settlement , opens new tab with Betar US that would wind down the far-right Zionist group's New York operations after an investigation found the group intimidated pro-Palestinian activists.

After President Donald Trump took office last year and signed executive orders targeting pro-Palestinian protesters , opens new tab and activists, Betar said it provided names of international students and faculty to the Trump administration for deportation . Trump's deportation attempts have faced legal setbacks.

After investigating Betar, the New York attorney general's office found the group "repeatedly targeted individuals based on religion and national origin," it said in a statement. Betar has been labeled an extremist group by the Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish advocacy organization.

"The settlement requires Betar to immediately cease instigating or encouraging violence against individuals, threatening protesters, and harassing individuals exercising their civil rights, and subjects the organization to a suspended $50,000 penalty that will be enforced if Betar violates the agreement," James' office said.

It added that Betar was seeking to dissolve its not-for-profit corporation and had indicated that it was winding down operations in New York.

In a statement, Betar denied wrongdoing and said it aimed to quash antisemitism. Betar calls itself a part of a militant Zionist group, which was founded a century ago in Europe. Its website says it was "reborn in the summer of 2024" and is headquartered in Israel.

Protests erupted at campuses in the U.S. after Israel began its assault on Gaza following Hamas' October 2023 attack on Israel , a key U.S. ally.

Trump attempted to deport foreign protesters, alleging they were antisemitic and sympathetic to extremism. Rights advocates raised free speech and due process concerns.

Protesters, including some Jewish groups, say their criticism of Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories and support for Palestinian rights should not be equated with antisemitism and support for extremism.

Israel's assault on Gaza since late 2023 has killed tens of thousands, caused a hunger crisis and internally displaced Gaza's entire population. Multiple rights experts , scholars and a U.N. inquiry say it amounts to genocide. Israel has said it took action in self-defense after Hamas-led militants killed 1,200 people and took 250 hostage in their 2023 attack.

Rights advocates note rising antisemitism and Islamophobia since the start of the war in Gaza, where a fragile ceasefire began in October.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 04:48:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ODJPFSJIHNLUJIXM5BFRTZUJF4.jpg?auth=61f38d0ae7b3117de9f252b3ddd6bbf0b916b5486be653706d1ed134d782ae1c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuela frees several Americans from prison, US official says</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260114-venezuela-americans-prison-us</link><description>Venezuela on Tuesday started freeing jailed Americans, said a US official, who hailed the move by the country's interim leadership following Washington's ouster of ex-president Nicolas Maduro.

The official did not immediately provide details on the release of prisoners or say how many were being freed, other than that there was more than one.

"We welcome the release of detained Americans in Venezuela. This is an important step in the right direction by the interim authorities," a State Department official said on condition of anonymity.

Delcy Rodriguez, Maduro's vice president who has become acting president, ordered the release of prisoners in the wake of the US attack.

US President Donald Trump hailed the gesture, saying that his response was to call off a second wave of strikes on Venezuela.

Many were jailed for taking part in protests over 2024 elections, in which Maduro was declared the victor despite widespread allegations of vote-rigging.

Venezuela earlier freed Spanish and Italian citizens from its jails.

The United States has long made freeing its nationals overseas a major priority, and secured freedom for some in a deal with Maduro last year.

Domestically, Venezuelans regained one freedom on Tuesday -- the ability to post on social media platform X.

The social network was once again accessible, more than a year after users were blocked by deposed president Maduro.

Rodriguez updated her profile's bio -- she served as vice president under Maduro -- and wrote: "Let us stay united, moving toward economic stability, social justice, and the welfare state we deserve to aspire to."

Access remained spotty to the social media network owned by billionaire Elon Musk, who engaged in heated online exchanges with the ousted Venezuelan leader, until Maduro lashed out in retaliation for criticism of his contested 2024 election and shut X down.

After the July 2024 election, Maduro was declared the winner amid allegations of fraud and suspended the platform in August.

Prior to that, X had been a prominent social media network for Venezuelans, but the blockade meant ministers, lawmakers and government institutions stopped updating their pages.

Rodriguez assumed power after Maduro was captured by US military forces on January 3 along with his wife, during attacks that left more than 100 dead, according to official figures.

The couple faces US charges of alleged drug trafficking.

Maduro's X account was also updated with a photo of the deposed leader and his wife, Cilia Flores.

The last 11 years have now been the warmest ever recorded, with 2024 topping the podium and 2023 in second place, according to the EU's Copernicus Climate Change Service and Berkeley Earth, a California-based non-profit research organisation.

For the first time, global temperatures exceeded 1.5C relative to pre-industrial times on average over the last three years, Copernicus said in its annual report.

"The warming spike observed from 2023-2025 has been extreme, and suggests an acceleration in the rate of the Earth's warming," Berkeley Earth said in a separate report.

The landmark 2015 Paris Agreemen t commits the world to limiting warming to well below 2C and pursuing efforts to hold it at 1.5C -- a long-term target scientists say would help avoid the worst consequences of climate change.

UN chief Antonio Guterres warned in October that breaching 1.5C was "inevitable" but the world could limit this period of overshoot by cutting greenhouse gas emissions as quickly as possible.

Copernicus said the 1.5C limit "could be reached by the end of this decade -- over a decade earlier than predicted".

But efforts to contain global warming were dealt another setback last week as President Donald Trump said he would pull the United States -- the world's second-biggest polluter after China -- out of the bedrock UN climate treaty.

Temperatures were 1.47C above pre-industrial times in 2025 -- just a fraction cooler than in 2023 -- following 1.6C in 2024, according to the EU climate monitor.

Some 770 million people experienced record-warm annual conditions where they live, while no record-cold annual average was logged anywhere, according to Berkeley Earth.

The Antarctic experienced its warmest year on record while it was the second hottest in the Arctic, Copernicus said.

An AFP analysis of Copernicus data last month found that Central Asia, the Sahel region and northern Europe experienced their hottest year on record in 2025.

Berkeley and Copernicus both warned that 2026 would not break the trend.

If the warming El Nino weather phenomenon appears this year, "this could make 2026 another record-breaking year", Carlo Buontempo, director of the Copernicus Climate Change Service, told AFP.

"Temperatures are going up. So we are bound to see new records. Whether it will be 2026, 2027, 2028 doesn't matter too much. The direction of travel is very, very clear," Buontempo said.

Berkeley Earth said it expected this year to be similar to 2025, "with the most likely outcome being approximately the fourth-warmest year since 1850".

The reports come as efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions -- the main driver of climate change -- are stalling in developed countries.

Emissions rose in the United States last year, snapping a two-year streak of declines, as bitter winters and the AI boom fuelled demand for energy, the Rhodium Group think tank said Tuesday.

The pace of reductions of greenhouse gas emissions slowed in Germany and France.

"While greenhouse gas emissions remain the dominant driver of global warming, the magnitude of this recent spike suggests additional factors have amplified recent warming beyond what we would expect from greenhouse gases and natural variability alone," said Berkeley Earth chief scientist Robert Rohde.

The organisation said international rules cutting sulfur in ship fuel since 2020 may have actually added to warming by reducing sulfur dioxide emissions, which form aerosols that reflect sunlight away from Earth.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 04:50:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/ddd3561a-f0fa-11f0-866e-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/4f842d5a71c78c44ee553b6c15b49cfa1133aed4.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>At least 12 killed after crane falls on train in Thailand's northeast</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/least-five-killed-after-crane-falls-train-thailands-northeast-2026-01-14/</link><description>BANGKOK, Jan 14 (Reuters) - A train traveling from Thailand's capital to the country's northeast was derailed on Wednesday after a construction crane fell on top of one of its carriages, killing at least 12 people and injuring at least 30, police said.

The accident took place on Wednesday morning in the Sikhio district of Nakhon Ratchasima province, 230 km (143 miles) northeast of Bangkok, on a train bound for Ubon Ratchathani province.

Local police told Reuters by phone that a crane working on a high-speed rail project collapsed and hit the passing train, causing it to derail and briefly catch fire.

The Trump administration threatened Powell with a criminal indictment after a probe into the renovation of the Fed's headquarters but Powell called it ​a "pretext" to win ‍presidential influence over interest rates.

Reserve Bank of New Zealand Governor Anna Breman joined top central bankers in Europe, England, Canada and Australia in signing a statement "in full solidarity with the Federal Reserve System and its Chair Jerome H. Powell."

The statement said Powell had acted with integrity and central bank independence was crucial for keeping prices and financial markets stable.

A RBNZ spokesperson said Breman had signed the statement because she believed strongly in the independence of central banks and that her signature indicated the support of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, which is statutorily independent of the New Zealand government.

However, the decision to do so was criticised by Peters, who said in a post on X that "the RBNZ has no role, nor should it involve itself, in U.S. domestic politics. We remind the Governor to stay in her New Zealand lane and stick to domestic monetary policy."

Peters' post said that if advice on signing on to the statement had been sought from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, she would have been told to stick to domestic monetary policy.

An RBNZ spokesperson declined to comment on Peters' post.

Swedish economist Breman started as New Zealand's central bank governor on December 1, 2025, with her appointment following a challenging time for the bank.

Previous RBNZ Governor Adrian Orr suddenly resigned early in 2025 due to disagreements over proposed government cuts to the central bank's budget. This was then followed by the resignation of RBNZ Chair Neil Quigley over his handling of Orr's surprise departure and concerns around transparency.

New Zealand, which is not a formal ally of the U.S. but is a close friend, has managed its relationship with the U.S. carefully in recent years and Peters has spoken about the need to respect the United States.

"Close friends do not need to be, and should not be, confrontational and rude with one another, as New Zealand sometimes was towards the United States in the mid-to-late 1980s. And we should never forget what binds and unites us, bonds stronger and more long-lasting than the controversies and headlines of the moment," Peters said in a speech last April.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 05:27:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ILCW3RKJTBPUXPSW4ZSWVHOZKE.jpg?auth=a3d02212cdf2afb579eb6d4aa3acc5da959066ab76fb0a58abf3ee17808d57d4&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Death toll rises to 19 in Thailand with 80 injured after crane collapses on train, police say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/death-toll-rises-19-thailand-with-80-injured-after-crane-collapses-train-police-2026-01-14/</link><description>BANGKOK, Jan 14 (Reuters) - The death toll from a train derailure following the collapse of a crane in northeastern Thailand rose to 19 on Wednesday, with about 80 people injured, police said.

Up to 4,000 Cambodian families are unable to return to homes along the disputed frontier because of the Thai incursions, Prak Sokhonn told Reuters, despite a December agreement that halted weeks of fierce border clashes.

"The Thai military is still occupying territories well inside Cambodia," he said on Tuesday in a rare interview from Phnom Penh, the capital, listing at least four border locations as incursion sites.

"The situation remains calm, but there are some risks as well. So we hope that Thailand will remain committed to the full implementation of the ceasefire."

In response to questions from Reuters, Thai military and government officials referred to a January 12 statement by Thailand's foreign ministry that dismissed Cambodia's accusations as "baseless".

"The maintenance of current troop positions following the ceasefire constitutes direct compliance with agreed de-escalation measures," the Thai ministry said. "This cannot be misconstrued as territorial occupation."

With fighter jet sorties, exchanges of rocket fire and artillery barrages, the two neighbours battled for 20 days in December, following a July round of clashes that ended after calls by U.S. President Donald Trump .

The December fighting killed 101 people and displaced more than half a million on both sides, in the latest flare-up of a century-old dispute between the countries that has occasionally exploded into conflict.

In recent weeks, Cambodia has asked Thailand for a meeting of the Joint Boundary Commission, a two-way effort to demarcate the border, but Bangkok has not confirmed its participation, according to Prak Sokhonn.

"The occupied village (issue) will be a priority for us because we need to solve those problems in order to allow our people to go back home," he said.

Thailand's foreign ministry said it was finalising internal procedures for the talks, which would happen after a new government takes office following a February 8 election.

"The Thai side reiterates its full commitment to resolving differences through bilateral mechanisms and intends to resume JBC activities at the earliest," it added.

Besides an understanding not to beef up troops on both sides of the border, the December 27 truce also agreed on the return of displaced civilians .

"The two waves of fighting have caused a lot of damage, to both civilian life and infrastructure," Prak Sokhonn added, destroying bridges, schools, pagodas, roads, and buildings.

Although Trump was instrumental in halting the July clashes and then oversaw the signing of a wider ceasefire deal in October, his calls proved unsuccessful in immediately ending the second bout of fighting.

Besides efforts by Trump and Malaysian premier Anwar Ibrahim, Prak Sokhonn also outlined China's involvement in the latest truce, such as key visits by a special envoy to Bangkok and Phnom Penh in late December.

"He met our prime minister, our defence minister, myself," he said, also outlining similar meetings on the Thai side.

"So it was a very, let's say, active contribution from China."

Two days after the latest ceasefire, the top diplomats of China, Thailand and Cambodia met in the southwestern Chinese province of Yunnan, where the combatants agreed to rebuild mutual trust.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 06:36:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ZV3UWIZN7JKY5EAZFDLCLFXQZU.jpg?auth=1153b89ba06fa4c432b65a49332f4020be67b859e2bfdde90207ad198ca75ec2&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Cambodia to keep up crackdown on scam centres after arrest of alleged mastermind</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/cambodia-keep-up-crackdown-scam-centres-after-arrest-alleged-mastermind-2026-01-14/</link><description>Jan 14 (Reuters) - Cambodia's arrest of alleged scam centre kingpin Chen Zhi and his extradition to China was "not the end" of the Southeast Asian nation's battle to stamp out trans-border crimes, its foreign minister said.

Last week's surprise arrest of Chinese-born Chen is a key step in an until now fragmented international campaign targeting sophisticated scam networks in Southeast Asia run by criminal gangs, swindling victims worldwide out of billions of dollars.

The extradition of Chen, sanctioned by several countries and indicted by the United States for wire fraud and money laundering, followed a joint investigation by China and Cambodia, details of which have not been made public.

"It's a continued combat, and we have set measures and steps in order to eradicate this crime," Cambodian Foreign Minister Prak Sokhonn said in a rare interview from Phnom Penh, the capital.

Cambodia has always been determined to crack down on transnational crimes, especially crimes employing new technology, such as online scam organisations, he told Reuters.

"The fact that Chen Xi was arrested and extradited to China is just reflecting this firm commitment of Cambodia to combat the crime. And it's not the end of the combat."

He gave no details of the investigation into Chen but said full cooperation with Beijing had started months ago.

Chen, an enigmatic billionaire in his late 30s, heads the Prince Group conglomerate, based out of Cambodia with scores of ostensibly legitimate businesses worldwide.

But U.S. authorities have said those were fronts for "one of the largest investment fraud operations in history".

Last year, Prince Group rejected as baseless the accusations against Chen.

Hong Kong , Singapore and Taiwan have frozen hundreds of millions of dollars in assets linked to Prince Group, while Britain and South Korea have imposed sanctions.

Last year, U.S. prosecutors seized about $15 billion in bitcoin linked to Chen and Cambodia has liquidated the Prince Bank he founded.

It is not clear what Chen will be charged with in China, which set up a special task force in 2020 to investigate Prince Group, Chinese court documents dating to 2022 showed.

Last week, China's state broadcaster showed video of Chen arriving in Beijing handcuffed and hooded .

It said Chen was wanted for fraud and running illegal casinos and described him as the "leader of a major transnational gambling and fraud crime syndicate".

The scams, operated from vast compounds in countries such as Cambodia, Myanmar and Laos, involve tens of thousands of workers.

Among them are human trafficking victims lured by promises of jobs in industries such as technology and hospitality, forced to cheat strangers online or face brutal punishment.

Cambodia has "very close cooperation" on transnational crime with countries such as the United States, China, South Korea and neighbours Vietnam and Thailand, the Cambodian minister said.

"This is the result of a long investigation," Prak Sokhonn added, referring to the events that led to Chen's extradition.

"Chen Zhi had Cambodian nationality, but when we made those investigations and found that his nationality was not legally obtained and he is also a Chinese national ... we have decided to extradite him to China."</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 06:36:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WP7S4WZLTBO45LDZGQANDVYZMA.jpg?auth=d3e59daef63f0aa2a681156d39ae9498c09ff1af2e7106f0f9e9b11d3f6f5cef&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>At least 2,571 killed in Iran's protests, US-based rights group HRANA says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/least-2571-killed-irans-protests-us-based-rights-group-hrana-says-2026-01-14/</link><description>DUBAI, Jan 14 (Reuters) - The death toll from protests in Iran has reached 2,571 people, the U.S.-based HRANA rights group said on Wednesday, as the Islamic Republic's clerical rulers face the biggest wave of dissent in years.

U.S. President Donald Trump urged Iranians on Tuesday to keep protesting, promising help is on the way. Iranian officials, however, have accused U.S. and Israel of fuelling violence in the country and blamed the deaths on "terrorist operatives" receiving foreign guidance to instigate.

The group said it had so far verified the deaths of 2,403 protesters, 147 government-affiliated individuals, 12 people aged under 18 and nine non-protester civilians.

An Iranian official said on Tuesday about 2,000 people had been killed, the first time authorities have given an overall death toll from more than two weeks of nationwide unrest.

Asked what he meant by "help is on its way", Trump told reporters they would have to figure that out. Trump has said military action is among the options he is weighing to punish Iran over the crackdown.

The unrest, sparked by dire economic conditions, has posed the biggest internal challenge to Iran's rulers for at least three years and has come at a time of intensifying international pressure after Israeli and U.S. strikes last year.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 06:36:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/R4X4WMN3PFNWZJ46HQSQYMWUCU.jpg?auth=613700e4aaef77a4559a23eb8aaa05ad01f407efcb0f2ceaad0fc9e006efeca5&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Actor-director Tim Busfield jailed on child sex abuse charges</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/actor-director-tim-busfield-jailed-child-sex-abuse-charges-2026-01-14/</link><description>Jan 13 (Reuters) - Actor-director Timothy Busfield surrendered to authorities in New Mexico on Tuesday to face child sexual abuse charges, accused of inappropriately touching two young cast members on the set of a television show he was directing and producing.

According to a criminal complaint and arrest warrant affidavit, the case involves 11-year-old twin boys who reported the alleged contact occurred over a two-year period, when they were aged seven and eight, during production of the Fox crime drama "The Cleaning Lady."

Busfield was an executive producer of the show, which was filmed in Albuquerque, New Mexico's largest city, and began directing episodes around the end of the second season, in 2022.

The arrest warrant was issued on Monday. Busfield, 68, turned himself in to the Albuquerque Police Department on Tuesday and was booked into the Bernalillo County jail without bond, said Nancy Laflin, a spokesperson for the district attorney's office.

In a video posted online shortly before his surrender, Busfield professed his innocence, called the allegations against him "lies" and said, "I'm going to be exonerated. I know I am."

"I did not do anything to those little boys," he said during the 45-second clip.

Busfield is best known for his prime-time television roles as a White House reporter on the NBC political drama "The West Wing," which ran on NBC from 1999 to 2006, and as an ad agency executive on the 1980s ABC ensemble series "Thirtysomething."

He is married to actress Melissa Gilbert, a former president of the Screen Actors Guild who gained fame in the 1970s as a child actress on the hit Western family drama "Little House on the Prairie."

Busfield is charged in the complaint with child abuse and two counts of criminal sexual contact of a minor.

According to the affidavit, one of the boys reported multiple instances of Busfield touching his "private areas" over his clothes during pauses in production. His brother also reported being touched by Busfield but was less specific, the affidavit said.

In his own interview for the investigation in November, Busfield acknowledged he probably had physical contact with the boys on occasion, like tickling or picking them up, but in a playful manner with others present, the affidavit said.

Busfield also suggested a possible motive for false allegations against him, according to the affidavit. Citing information he said he gleaned from the show's star, Elodie Yung, Busfield told police that the boys' mother was upset with him to the point of wanting "revenge" after producers decided to replace her sons in the final season of the series.

Yung declined to be interviewed for the police investigation, the affidavit said, but had related a similar account of the mother vowing revenge against Busfield when the actress was questioned by a private investigator for the show's producer, Warner Bros. Television.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 06:37:08 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'Are you dead?'

The app called Sileme in Chinese, which translates to "Are you dead?" in English, is "a lightweight safety tool created for solo dwellers" from students, to solo officer workers or "anyone choosing a solitary lifestyle", says its development team.

The app requires setting up one emergency contact and sends automatic notifications if the user has not checked in via the app for consecutive days.

China may have up to 200 million one-person households, with a solo living rate exceeding 30%, state newspaper the Global Times said.

Sileme said on its official Weibo on Tuesday that the company will launch the global brand name Demumu in its new version to be released soon.

It is already called Demumu on Apple's paid app chart where it is currently sitting at number two, after surging to the top earlier in the week.

"Thanks to all netizens for their enthusiastic support. We were originally just an unknown small team, co-founded and operated independently by three born after 1995," Sileme said.

It said on Sunday that it would launch an eight yuan ($1.15) payment scheme to help cover increasing costs. Demumu on Apple's App store already was charging HK$8 to download the app.

Netizens on social media platforms, including Weibo, called on Sileme not to change its name, while others suggested options like "Are you alive", "Are you online" or "Are you there."

"Maybe some conservative people can't accept it," said one user, but it is helpful for safety purposes. "It will make us unmarried people feel more at ease to spend our lives."

Russia's State Investigative Committee said that the doctors had been detained on suspicion of causing death through negligence. It was not immediately possible to reach the doctors or their lawyers.

"As a result of the suspects' improper performance of their official and professional duties in organising and providing medical care... nine newborns who were born between 1 December 2025 and 12 January 2026 died," the Committee said.

The case, reported by state and independent news outlets, provoked widespread outrage in Russia.

Politicians, commentators and ordinary Russians asked how the country could hope to raise its birth rate - a priority set by President Vladimir Putin - if such tragedies were allowed to happen.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 07:27:07 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/M5FSWQLBUBNX7ANLJKOKKPT77Y.jpg?auth=2e07435e7554777980924e10a38fc8c18a4e1f462b7c1a19440c314671ea01db&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>France to open a consulate in Greenland on February 6</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/france-open-consulate-greenland-february-6-2026-01-14/</link><description>PARIS, Jan 14 (Reuters) - France will open a consulate in Greenland on February 6, a move that had been planned since last year, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said on Wednesday, amid the U.S. President Donald Trump's push to take control of the Arctic territory .

No casualties were immediately reported, as an impasse continues in negotiations between the central government and the SDF over merging its thousands of fighters into the national army.

The Syrian army earlier declared an area east of Aleppo as a “closed military zone". Eastern Aleppo province has been a tense frontline dividing areas under the Syrian government and large swaths of northeastern Syria under the SDF.

In a statement, the SDF said government forces have started shelling Deir Hafer district. The group later said government troops launched exploding drones, artillery and rockets to a village south of Deir Hafer.

Syrian state television later said the SDF targeted the village of Homeima on the other side of the Deir Hafer frontline with exploding drones.

Several days of deadly clashes in Aleppo last week displaced tens of thousands of people. They ended over the weekend with the evacuation of Kurdish fighters from the contested neighbourhood of Sheikh Maqsud. Aleppo Governor Azzam Ghareeb said Damascus now has full control of Sheikh Maqsud and Achrafieh, where clashes took place.

Syrian officials have accused the SDF of building up its forces near the towns of Maskana and Deir Hafer, about 60 kilometers (37 miles) east of Aleppo city. SANA, the state news agency, reported that the army had declared the area a closed military zone because of “continued mobilisation” by the SDF, and accused the group of using the area as a launchpad for drone attacks in Aleppo city.

The army statement said the armed groups should withdraw east of the Euphrates River.

A drone hit the Aleppo governorate building on Saturday shortly after two Cabinet ministers and a local official held a news conference on the developments in the city.

The SDF have denied mobilising in the area or being behind the attack.

The leadership in Damascus, under interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa , signed a deal in March with the SDF, which controls much of the northeast, for it to merge with the Syrian army by the end of 2025. There have been disagreements on how it would happen.

Some of the factions that make up the new Syrian army, which was formed after the fall of former President Bashar Assad in a rebel offensive in December 2024, were previously Turkey-backed insurgent groups that have a long history of clashing with Kurdish forces.

The SDF for years has been the main US partner in Syria in fighting against the Islamic State group, but Turkey considers the SDF a terrorist organisation because of its association with the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK , which has waged a long-running insurgency in Turkey. A peace process is now under way.

Despite the long-running US support for the SDF, the Trump administration has also developed close ties with al-Sharaa’s government and has pushed the Kurds to implement the March deal.

The recent developments have left the SDF and the autonomous administration that runs northeastern Syria frustrated with Washington and accusing Damascus of not implementing its end of the deal.

“The American government needs to clarify its position of the Syrian government which is committing massacres,” the administration's foreign relations official, Elham Ahmad, told journalists Tuesday. She accused government forces of committing “horrific violations” and alleged that forces affiliated with IS and foreign fighters took part in the clashes.

Shams TV, a broadcaster based in Irbil – the seat of northern Iraq’s semi-autonomous Kurdish region – had been set to air an interview with al-Sharaa on Monday but later announced it had been postponed for “technical” reasons, without giving a new date for broadcast.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 07:27:58 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/9ac74310-f0f3-11f0-bfb0-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/bdecc1cf24ae2da14305316c8277f383faa866ee.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Singapore parliament to debate removing Leader of the Opposition after lying conviction</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/singapore-parliament-debate-removing-leader-opposition-after-lying-conviction-2026-01-14/</link><description>SINGAPORE, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Singapore's parliament will debate whether to remove opposition chief Pritam Singh from his post as Leader of the Opposition on Wednesday after he was convicted of lying to parliament.

Leader of the House and ruling People's Action Party MP Indranee Rajah tabled a motion to declare Singh, the leader of the Workers' Party, unsuitable to continue as Leader of the Opposition given his "dishonourable and unbecoming" conduct.

In December, Indranee said that the conduct of Workers' Party chair Sylvia Lim and vice-chair Faisal Manap would also be discussed and that there would be "implications" for them from Singh's case.

Singh, 49, is Singapore's first official Leader of the Opposition since the city state gained independence in 1965. He was appointed after the 2020 general election, when his party gained five seats in parliament, bringing its total to 10.

In 2025, the ruling PAP won its 14th successive election to extend its unbroken six-decade rule, winning 87 of the 97 seats up for grabs. The Workers' Party won the remainder, having contested a total of 26.

A Singapore court found Singh guilty of two counts of lying to parliament in February last year, handing down fines that spared him the loss of his seat and a ban from the 2025 general election.

He was found guilty of giving false testimony to a parliamentary committee in 2021 about a fellow party member, Raeesah Khan, who also admitted lying to parliament.

Singh's appeal failed in December, and Indranee said in a media statement that Parliament must deliberate on an "appropriate response" to Singh's actions and convictions.

"Lying under oath is a serious matter. In some countries, leaders who have lied, cheated or flagrantly broken the law still escape any legal or political consequences. We cannot accept such standards in Singapore," she said.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 07:47:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/66F4CUMYKVK5RNANCIG4RKEIE4.jpg?auth=bdee0435189d78145246ca3b9d5527b631d27890faf343d954885dfb2d55ebea&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>George Vassiliou, 'eternal optimist' president who led Cyprus into the EU, dies at 94</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/george-vassiliou-eternal-optimist-president-who-led-cyprus-into-eu-dies-94-2026-01-14/</link><description>NICOSIA, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Former Cyprus President George Vassiliou, who died on Wednesday aged 94, once risked arrest in Cold War Hungary smuggling a banned political manifesto past the Iron Curtain.

In 1956, as Soviet tanks crushed a popular uprising in Budapest, he agreed to carry to the West the document, one of the anonymous "Hungaricus" pamphlets that gave the outside world its first uncensored accounts of the crackdown.

"I read it, agreed with what was written, and said I would gladly take it," Vassiliou, who was president of Cyprus between 1988 and 1993, later recalled.

"And I was lucky because nobody noticed I took it."

That early act of defiance helped shape the reformer who would later lead Cyprus toward Europe’s political mainstream and out of post-colonial uncertainty, helping to turn the former British island colony into a member of the European Union.

Vassiliou died in hospital aged 94, his wife Androulla said on X on Wednesday, adding, "He passed away peacefully in our arms." The couple had been married for 59 years.

Vassiliou was born in Cyprus in 1931 to parents who were both doctors and die-hard Communists who went wherever their cause would take them.

He initially enrolled in medical school in Geneva, and then Austria. But funds ran out when his father left a lucrative practice in Cyprus to join the communists in the Greek civil war that ran from 1946 to 1949.

Vassiliou moved to Budapest to be closer to his mother and younger sister, who were caught up in the tumult after that war, which stranded tens of thousands of partisans in Eastern Europe, barred from returning to Greece.

His father found himself in Albania, with the route through then-Yugoslavia shut after a fallout between Josip Tito, its prime minister at the time, and Soviet leader Joseph Stalin.

In Hungary, Vassiliou became an interpreter for Greek political refugees, got a part-time job in an aluminium factory and gave up on medicine, to his father's chagrin. He enrolled instead at the capital's Karl Marx University of Economics.

"I was a handsome young man who had lived in the West, a Cypriot (thus a British subject) who spoke French, German, English — an interesting fellow," Vassiliou reminisced to Hungary's Oral History Archive.

"The communists befriended me because I was a Greek refugee; the aristocrats because I was a British subject; the (women) because I was good-looking and well dressed."

Vassiliou chose to study economics because he wanted to "be a planner to design the new world".

He moved among activists disillusioned with Stalinism and attended lectures by philosopher Gyorgy Lukacs, whose reading of Marxism departed from rigid Soviet philosophy.

Vassiliou was present during the 1956 Hungarian uprising, a nationwide revolt against Soviet-backed communist rule sparked by student protests and calls for political reform.

It was crushed within weeks when Soviet tanks entered Budapest, killing hundreds and forcing about 200,000 people to flee the country.

Vassiliou brought the confidential pamphlet to Paris at his friends' request.

The risks were high.

Historians drawing on secret police files, court records and survivor testimony have shown that the underground networks behind such documents were met with harsh reprisals.

Hundreds of people involved in illegal printing and information smuggling were jailed, with many more arrested, interrogated, or subjected to long-term surveillance.

Vassiliou was held for two days when he returned to Hungary in 1959, and not allowed to leave the country for a year.

He later surmised that he escaped jail because he was a foreigner, or because authorities mistook him for the son of a high-ranking party official.

"The crushing of my youthful idealism by the tanks taught me that what was preached, and what was done, diverged," Vassiliou said, reflecting on the events of 1956. "Since then I have never been a member of any party."

A liberal who founded market research firm MEMRB in Cyprus in 1971 and grew it into one of the biggest in the Middle East, Vassiliou was a lone figure when he declared his bid for the presidency of the eastern Mediterranean island in 1987.

A year later, he won unexpected support from Cyprus's influential communist AKEL party.

His credentials, as the son of Communists, helped. Yet it was known that Vassiliou did not subscribe to that ideology.

Two internal reports compiled by AKEL addressed to sister Communist parties in Greece and then-Czechoslovakia labelled him an "anticommunist, anti-Soviet and a revisionist", Cyprus's Alithia newspaper said in 1994, citing a former AKEL official.

In his memoir "Reflections on the Past and Future", Vassiliou wrote that AKEL threw its weight behind him after its leadership found pictures of their preferred candidate wearing the garments of Freemasons.

That dealt a blow to the Communists, who viewed Freemasons as classists.

In the 1988 election, Vassiliou inched to victory over conservative-backed Glafcos Clerides, although the latter would go on to defeat him in an election runoff in 1993.

In later life, Vassiliou would rue his arrogance: "I was sure I would be re-elected ... it turned on me in the end because too much self-confidence isn't always good," he told Greece's Kathimerini newspaper in 2017.

His election to the presidency shook up the stale world of Cypriot politics, ushering in more scrutiny and accountability.

He travelled widely to meet any prominent personality who would hear him out over Cyprus's division between Greek and Turkish Cypriots.

A marketing man through and through, he became known for his brisk, two-handed handshake, which Cypriots nicknamed "kappakoti" ("to cup") in their vernacular.

At home, he cut taxes to stamp out tax evasion and sent in police to demolish illegal shacks along the pristine coastline, along which he later built a palatial mansion, for use as a private residence.

He also clashed with entrenched bias. In his failed bid for re-election in 1993, Vassiliou said he and his wife would be honoured to return to the office. Opponents said it was inappropriate to have mentioned her.

A politician in her own right, his wife Androulla Vassiliou was an EU Commissioner for health, then education and youth from 2008 to 2014. They had three children.

Under his watch, Cyprus was the first non-EU member state to apply and peg its currency, the Cyprus pound, to the precursor of the euro, the European Currency Unit (ECU), in 1992.

It was Vassiliou's administration that applied for Cyprus's membership in the EU in 1990, and he was chief negotiator for joining the bloc between 1998 and 2003. Cyprus eventually entered the EU in 2004, and adopted the euro in 2008.

As president, Vassiliou created the island's first state university. Upon leaving the presidency, he launched the liberal United Democrats party, which fared poorly in elections, however.

Unlike other Greek Cypriot politicians, Vassiliou was steadfast in his support of a United Nations reunification blueprint for Cyprus in 2004. But that plan was rejected by fellow Greek Cypriots in a referendum.

A self-proclaimed "eternal optimist", he died never having fulfilled his ambition of ending the division of Cyprus between its Greek and Turkish Cypriot populations, a simmering conflict that is a permanent drag on ties between NATO partners Greece and Turkey.

"The tragedy of Cyprus is between what is desired and what is possible," he once said.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 07:48:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/AQDIMOX3SBJM7D6BFD4FPWNYFI.jpg?auth=d3ee15be23d5c305e62598f9c25c7b1d68e4abf16a6e897d96989286dc19c2e6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Tunisian journalist Chatha Belhaj Mubarak freed after sentence cut</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/tunisian-journalist-chatha-belhaj-mubarak-freed-after-sentence-cut-2026-01-14/</link><description>TUNIS, Jan 14 (Reuters) - A Tunisian appeal court on Wednesday ordered the release of journalist Chatha Belhaj Mubarak, jailed since 2023 in a conspiracy case, after reducing her prison sentence, her family said.

The court cut her sentence from five years to two, making her eligible for immediate release, her brother told Reuters.

She was convicted in the so-called "Instalingo" case, which involved politicians, media figures and other defendants accused of conspiracy and financial crimes. Belhaj Mubarak denied the charges.

"Chatha is free and leaving prison," her brother, Amen Belhaj Mubarak, said.

He said her health had severely deteriorated during her time in prison. She suffered serious complications, including significant hearing loss, and was diagnosed with cancer in detention, he added.

Tunisian authorities have said the case stems from judicial investigations into alleged financial and security-related offences, and have rejected accusations by opposition groups that the prosecutions were politically motivated.

Tunisian prosecutors are pursuing a number of high-profile conspiracy cases involving politicians, journalists and activists. Several opposition leaders have received lengthy prison terms.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 07:48:42 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuelans regain access to X, a year after Maduro blocked network</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260114-venezuelans-regain-access-to-x-a-year-after-maduro-blocked-network</link><description>The social network X was once again accessible in Venezuela on Tuesday, more than a year after users were blocked by deposed president Nicolas Maduro , who was captured by US forces last week.

Interim president Delcy Rodriguez updated her bio – she served as vice president under Maduro – and wrote: "Let us stay united, moving towards economic stability, social justice, and the welfare state we deserve to aspire to."

Access remained spotty to the social media network owned by billionaire Elon Musk , who engaged in heated online exchanges with the ousted Venezuelan leader, until Maduro lashed out in retaliation for criticism of his contested 2024 election and shut X down.

After the July 2024 election, Maduro was declared the winner amid allegations of fraud and suspended the platform in August.

Prior to that, X had been a prominent social media network for Venezuelans, but the blockade meant ministers, lawmakers and government institutions stopped updating their pages.

Rodriguez assumed power after Maduro was captured by US military forces on January 3 along with his wife, during attacks that left more than 100 dead, according to official figures.

The couple faces US charges of alleged drug trafficking.

Maduro's X account was also updated with a photo of the deposed leader and his wife, Cilia Flores.

According to an Israeli assessment, Trump has decided to intervene but the scope and timing of this action remains unclear, an Israeli official said.

A second Israeli source, a government official, said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's security cabinet was briefed late on Tuesday about the chances of regime collapse and the chances of U.S. intervention in Iran, an arch-foe with which it fought a 12-day war last year.

The protests which began on December 28 in response to soaring inflation have spiralled into one of the biggest challenges to Iran's clerical establishment since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.

In an interview with CBS News on Tuesday, Trump vowed "very strong action" if Iran started hanging protesters, but didn't elaborate. "If they hang them, you're going to see some things," he said. He also urged Iranians on Tuesday to keep protesting and take over institutions, declaring "help is on the way" but without giving details.

Iranian state media reported that the head of Iran's top security body, Ali Larijani, had spoken to the foreign minister of Qatar and that Iran's foreign minister had spoken to his Emirati and Turkish counterparts. The countries are all U.S. allies.

Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi told UAE Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed that "calm has prevailed" and that Iranians were determined to defend their sovereignty and security from any foreign interference, state media reported.

The flow of information from Iran has been hampered by an internet blackout. Holistic Resilience, a U.S. organization that works to expand information access in repressive or closed societies, said on Tuesday that billionaire Elon Musk's Starlink satellite internet service was now available for free in Iran.

U.S.-based HRANA rights group said it had so far verified the deaths of 2,403 protesters and 147 government-affiliated individuals. An Iranian official told Reuters on Tuesday that about 2,000 people had been killed.

Iranian authorities have accused the United States and Israel of fomenting the unrest, blaming violence on people it calls terrorists who have attacked security forces, mosques and public property.

Visiting a Tehran prison where arrested protesters are being held, Iran's chief justice said that speed in judging and penalizing those "who beheaded or burned people" was critical to ensuring such events do not happen again.

HRANA reported 18,137 arrests so far.

State TV said that a funeral procession will take place on Wednesday in Tehran for more than 100 civilians and security personnel killed in the unrest.

Hengaw, an Iranian Kurdish rights group, has reported that a 26-year-old man, Erfan Soltani, arrested in connection with protests in the city of Karaj, was to be executed on Wednesday.

Hengaw told Reuters on Wednesday it had not been able to confirm whether Soltani's sentence had been carried out due to the internet and communications shutdown. Reuters could not independently confirm the report.

Pro-government rallies were held in Iran on Monday, a show of loyalist support for the clerical Iranian establishment. So far, there have been no signs of fracture in the security forces that have quelled other bouts of protest over the years.

While Iranian authorities have weathered previous protests, the latest unrest is taking place with Tehran still recovering from last year's war and with its regional position weakened by blows to allies such as Lebanon's Hezbollah since the October 7, 2023 Hamas-led attacks against Israel.

Asked what he meant by "help is on its way", Trump told reporters on Tuesday they would have to figure that out. Trump has said military action is among the options he is weighing to punish Iran over the crackdown.

"The killing looks like it's significant, but we don't know yet for certain," said Trump upon returning to the Washington area from Detroit, adding he would know more after receiving a report on Tuesday evening.

"We'll act accordingly," he said.

Trump on Monday announced 25% import tariffs on products from any country doing business with Iran - a major oil exporter.

The U.S. State Department on Tuesday urged American citizens to leave Iran now, including by land through Turkey or Armenia.

In response to Trump's social media post that "help is on the way," Iran’s U.N. Ambassador Amir Saeid Iravani said the U.S. president was inciting violence, threatening the country’s sovereignty and security and seeking to destabilize the government.

Russia on Tuesday condemned "subversive external interference" in Iran's internal politics, saying any repeat of last year's U.S. strikes would have "disastrous consequences" for the Middle East and international security.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 09:29:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/EKWD6AHQNVO5BFZ5DXGMCOF54Y.jpg?auth=2df6dd8a9397d7731cbabc20c9bfb2d81a3f2684d1cd7da91f85fc8ea02d935d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Syria asks Lebanon to hand over Assad-era officers after Reuters report</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/syria-asks-lebanon-hand-over-assad-era-officers-after-reuters-report-2026-01-14/</link><description>DUBAI, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Syrian authorities have asked Lebanese security forces to hand over more than 200 senior officers who fled to Lebanon after the fall of Bashar al-Assad, following a Reuters investigation that showed how the neighboring country was a hub for insurgent plotting.

On December 18, a top Syrian security official, Brig. Abdul Rahman al-Dabbagh, met with his Lebanese counterparts in Beirut to discuss the exiled Assad-era officers, according to three senior Syrian sources, two Lebanese security officials, and a diplomat with knowledge of the visit.

The meetings came days after a Reuters investigation detailed rival plots being pursued by Rami Makhlouf, the billionaire cousin of the ousted president, and Maj. Gen. Kamal Hassan, former head of military intelligence, both living in exile in Moscow, to finance potential Alawite militant groups in Lebanon and along the Syrian coast. Syria and Lebanon share a 375-kilometer border.

The two rival camps aim to undermine the new Syrian government under President Ahmed al-Sharaa. Reuters found they are sending money to intermediaries in Lebanon to try and stir uprisings that would divide Syria and allow the plotters to regain control over the coastal areas. The population of those areas is dominated by Alawites, the minority sect associated with the Assad family and the dictatorship’s ruling elite.

Al-Dabbagh, an aide to the head of internal security in Syria’s Latakia province, an Alawite stronghold, met with Lebanese intelligence chief Tony Kahwaji and Major General Hassan Choucair, head of the General Security Directorate, and presented them with the list of senior officers wanted by Syria.

The visit focused on gathering information about the whereabouts and legal status of the officers, as well as trying to find ways to prosecute or extradite them to Syria, according to the Syrian sources. They described it as a direct request from one security agency to another, rather than a demand for extradition.

Three senior Lebanese security officials confirmed the meetings. One of the Lebanese officials denied receiving any demands from the Syrians to hand over the officers. Two others acknowledged receiving a list of names but said none were senior officers.

One of the Lebanese security officials said there is no evidence of any insurgency being planned, despite the threats against Syria’s new government detailed in the Reuters reporting.

All the officials spoke on condition of anonymity to reveal details of a highly sensitive cross-border issue.

Among the names handed over by Syrian officials to Lebanon were several high-ranking figures acting as intermediaries for Makhlouf or Hassan in Lebanon, according to a Syrian source who saw the list.

A Lebanese judicial official said Syria had not made a formal extradition request to Lebanon, typically done through the two countries’ justice and foreign ministries.

Accompanying Dabbagh on his Beirut visit was Khaled al-Ahmad, a former Assad advisor and childhood friend of Sharaa, who is leading the government’s efforts to win over the Alawite community through development projects and aid, according to two witnesses who saw the men together on that mid-December day.

According to the two witnesses, who are both ex-Assad officers, al-Ahmad and Dabbagh went together to Azmi, an upscale Beirut restaurant that is popular among Assad’s men. The two witnesses said they and others interpreted the outing as a warning to those trying to influence Alawites to rise up against Syria’s new leaders that Lebanon is no longer a haven. A manager at Azmi declined to comment on the visit.

In a January 2 post on X, Lebanese Deputy Prime Minister Tarek Mitri called on his government’s security agencies to verify the information circulating in the media and take action against the Lebanon-based agents for Assad’s former insiders, Makhlouf and Hassan.

“It is incumbent upon them, and upon all of us, to avert the dangers of any actions that undermine Syria’s unity or threaten its security and stability, whether in Lebanon or originating from it,” the tweet read.

In response to questions from Reuters, Lebanon’s General Security referred to January 11 remarks by Lebanese President Joseph Aoun, who said Lebanon’s military intelligence and other security agencies had carried out raids in several areas of the country’s north and east. Aoun said the raids did not produce evidence of the presence of officers linked to the Assad dictatorship and said Lebanon was continuing to coordinate with Syria on the issue.

Syrian government officials did not respond to requests for comment.

From January 3 to January 6, Lebanese soldiers raided locations and shelters housing displaced Syrians. The Lebanese Army said 38 Syrians were arrested during the raids on different charges such as possession of drugs or weapons, or entering the country illegally. A senior Lebanese security official told Reuters those raids were linked to the exiles’ plots.

Another senior Lebanese security official emphasized that there was no arrest warrant for the Syrian officers in Lebanon, nor Interpol requests for them.

“We can't do anything against them,” the official added.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 09:30:16 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/QXSUPJQDHBIHDFCNTI5PP3M2ZU.jpg?auth=f6e6fb3d9f7ac9eaaffb35f67309014a6e1efa0fbbba0559e15f9acbe90c5167&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Greek airspace blackout linked to old systems, not cyberattack, report says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/greek-airspace-blackout-linked-old-systems-not-cyberattack-report-says-2026-01-14/</link><description>ATHENS, Jan 14 (Reuters) - An eight-hour radio outage at Greek airports last week that forced authorities to clear the country's airspace and divert dozens of incoming flights was in part due to an outdated communications system, investigators said in a report.

Flights were suspended into and over Greece on January 4 when air traffic controllers lost contact with most planes, including dozens heading for Greek airports, as radio frequencies went down and were replaced by static.

Aviation experts said the incident was unprecedented in the southern European country.

The exact cause of the outage, which occurred when multiple systems fell out of sync, causing a scramble in communications between airport towers and planes, remains unclear, the report from a five-member investigating committee commissioned by the government found.

It ranked the incident as "low risk" regarding flight safety, ruled out a cyberattack and said that pilots and air traffic controllers responded effectively.

However, the Civil Aviation Authority's voice communication system and critical supporting telecommunications infrastructure are based on outdated technology that is no longer supported by manufacturers and lacks operational guarantees, according to the report, which was submitted to Greece's transport ministry and published late on Tuesday.

The report said that Greek telecommunications provider OTE had since 2019 warned the civil aviation authority that its systems needed new circuits. The report called for upgraded transceivers and other changes. It also recommended the creation of a crisis-response mechanism between the civil aviation authority and OTE.

Greece's systems are in line with EU standards, a transport ministry official said in reaction to the report, although the ministry has implemented an upgrade plan expected to be completed in 2028.

But unions, who have been calling for upgrades for years, say the system is dangerous, especially amid a tourism boom with millions of tourists flying to Greece every year. On Wednesday, they said that the report "fully vindicates" their protests.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 09:30:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LCUCKJJUBRP67BXIGFFKWQJO5I.jpg?auth=70579dfdae71a310b9ccfd0089cca5ae2158eabcd8d7fa2182dad852d852442c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Denmark and Greenland to face Vance in high-stakes meeting</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/denmark-greenland-face-vance-high-stakes-meeting-2026-01-14/</link><description>NUUK, Jan 14 (Reuters) - The Danish and Greenlandic foreign ministers will meet with U.S. Vice President JD Vance at the White House on Wednesday following weeks of threats by President Donald Trump to take control of Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark .

Trump has said the strategically located and mineral-rich island is vital to U.S. security and the United States must own it to prevent Russia or China occupying it.

Greenland and Denmark say the island is not for sale, threats of force are reckless and security concerns should be resolved among allies. Prominent EU countries have backed Denmark.

Denmark's Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen and his Greenland counterpart Vivian Motzfeldt were expected to show a united front in the meeting with Vance and other U.S. officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

"We choose the Greenland we know today – as part of the Kingdom of Denmark," Motzfeldt said in a statement released by the Danish ambassador to the U.S. on Tuesday.

Greenland's Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen also reiterated Greenland's commitment to Denmark, calling the situation "a geopolitical crisis" and rejecting the prospect of becoming a U.S. territory.

Trump, when asked by reporters late on Tuesday, dismissed Nielsen's statement that Greenland prefers to remain part of Denmark.

"That's their problem. I disagree with them. I don't know who he is. Don't know anything about him, but that's going to be a big problem for him," Trump said.

White House officials have been discussing various plans to bring Greenland under U.S. control, including potential use of the U.S. military and lump-sum payments to Greenlanders to convince them.

Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has said the hardest part in the dispute over Greenland's future may lie ahead.

Denmark and Greenland had originally sought a meeting with Rubio, hoping to have a discussion among top diplomats on resolving the crisis between the two NATO allies.

But Denmark's Rasmussen said Vance had also wanted to participate and that the vice president would host the meeting himself, at the White House.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 09:30:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/GGYX2XFSBFMQHELP5VMQR6JJJM.jpg?auth=a76d63f834eabba356329e8ae09fed1127e34469b9dff70263ce78a7175ca401&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Hezbollah warns Lebanese state against expanding disarmament push</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/hezbollah-warns-lebanese-state-against-expanding-disarmament-push-2026-01-14/</link><description>BEIRUT, Jan 14 (Reuters) - A senior Hezbollah official has warned Lebanon's government that pressing on with efforts to disarm the group throughout the country would trigger chaos and possibly civil war, according to comments circulated by the armed group on Wednesday.

Lebanon has pledged to bring all arms in the country under state control, in line with a 2024 agreement that ended a devastating war between Hezbollah and Israel.

Hezbollah insists that deal only applies to the southernmost region of Lebanon that borders Israel and has refused to relinquish its arsenal elsewhere.

In an interview with Russian state media outlet RT, senior Hezbollah political official Mahmoud Qmati said pursuing a state monopoly on arms further north would be "the biggest crime committed by the state".

"The path taken by the Lebanese government and state institutions will lead Lebanon to instability, chaos and perhaps even civil war," Qmati said, though he added that Hezbollah would not be dragged into a confrontation with Lebanon's army.

The Lebanese army said last week that it had taken operational control in the area between the Litani River and Israel's border. The Lebanese cabinet has asked the army to brief it in early February on how it would pursue disarmament in other parts of the country.

Hezbollah has said that Israeli troops must withdraw from five hilltop positions they occupy in southern Lebanon, halt near-daily airstrikes on Lebanon and release detained Lebanese before any further disarmament is discussed.

"There will be no talk or dialogue about any situation north of the Litani River before Israel withdraws from all Lebanese territory, liberates the South and the prisoners, and stops its violations against Lebanon," said Qmati.

Israel says that efforts to disarm Hezbollah fighters have been insufficient, raising pressure on Lebanese leaders who fear Israel could escalate strikes.

The war in Gaza that erupted in October 2023 triggered months of cross-border hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah, with near-daily exchanges of fire along the Lebanon-Israel frontier.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 09:30:49 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/PKZ4MFFURZJ4XKYUQN34TLOKSU.jpg?auth=e29c2084f14be440e57728d307f3de995204544135a8857ff01194585f041e1f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump son-in-law Kushner, envoy Witkoff plan to meet Putin in Moscow, Bloomberg reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/trump-son-in-law-kushner-envoy-witkoff-plan-meet-putin-moscow-bloomberg-news-2026-01-14/</link><description>Jan 14 (Reuters) - White House envoy Steve Witkoff and U.S. President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner are seeking to travel to Moscow to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin, Bloomberg News reported on Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter.

The meeting could happen this month, though plans are not final and timing may slip due to unrest in Iran, the report said.

Reuters could not immediately verify the report. The White House did not immediately respond to a Reuters' request for comment.

A White House official told Bloomberg no such meeting was currently scheduled.

The U.S. officials will present the latest draft peace proposals to Putin and his team, the report said, adding that the talks were expected to cover security guarantees from the U.S. and Europe to uphold any agreement, and Ukraine's post-war reconstruction.

This follows Trump's comments earlier this month expressing frustration with Putin over the continued war in Ukraine, repeating that he had initially believed ending the conflict would be easy.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 09:30:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ILM4X7FH2FMETNOGGUYDWVRJFE.jpg?auth=dd4d6582ee98b276cf04f0136b56c84685f3c360a6419a9136bb9c12cf1c9ab0&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Benin offers citizenship to African diaspora, with help from Spike Lee</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/benin-offers-citizenship-african-diaspora-with-help-spike-lee-2026-01-14/</link><description>OUIDAH, Benin, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Isaline Attelly, a native of the Caribbean island of Martinique, had been living in Benin for nearly a year before she learned that her family's connection to the West African country went back much further.

Genealogical records confirmed her great-grandmother on her mother's side was born in what is now Benin and, at the height of transatlantic slavery, was trafficked across the Atlantic Ocean.

The discovery last year prompted Attelly, a 28-year-old content creator, to enrol in a new programme offering Beninese citizenship to people of African descent.

The "My Afro Origins" programme is an important piece of President Patrice Talon's plan to raise his country's profile, including among prospective tourists, by highlighting its prominent role in the transatlantic trafficking of enslaved people.

"For me, it's a source of pride. It feels like my journey has come full circle," Attelly told Reuters after her naturalisation ceremony. "I am proud and very happy to be able to represent my ancestors."

The first naturalisation ceremonies have coincided with the unveiling of projects intended to bring that history to life, including a new "Door of No Return" in Ouidah, a common departure point for transatlantic trafficking, and a replica of an 18th-century ship that transported enslaved people with sculptures inside representing nearly 300 captives. Both are still under construction.

The government also plans to open this year a new International Museum of Memory and Slavery at the former residence of Francisco Felix de Souza, a prominent trafficker of enslaved people in the 18th and 19th centuries.

Talon, who survived a coup attempt last month and is expected to end his 10-year tenure after a presidential election in April, has recruited star power to publicise his vision.
Filmmaker Spike Lee and his wife Tonya Lee Lewis were last year named ambassadors for the programme to the African-American community.

"Our brothers and sisters in Benin are telling us: come home, welcome us home, come back to the motherland. Come back (to) where your roots are," Lee told France 24 last year.

In July 2025 American R&amp;B star Ciara became one of the first beneficiaries of Beninese citizenship. She performed last week at a concert in Ouidah as part of an annual festival devoted to voodoo, playing hits such as "Level Up" during a set that ran until 3 a.m.

Her husband, American football quarterback Russell Wilson, attended and said he was hoping to become a citizen himself "real soon".

Around 50 people have received Beninese citizenship since the "My Afro Origins" programme launched last year, according to the Justice Ministry, which is sorting through thousands of applications and receives about 100 more each day.

To qualify, applicants need to be 18 years old and produce documents or a DNA test proving their ties to the continent, and they cannot be citizens of another African country, Foreign Minister Olushegun Adjadi Bakari told Reuters.

At the naturalisation ceremony on December 27 in Cotonou, Benin's biggest city and economic capital, Attelly and nine others received their citizenship certificates and posed for pictures next to the Beninese flag.

Benin's programme is similar to an initiative in Ghana that, since 2016, has granted citizenship to 684 members of the African diaspora, according to Kofi Okyere Darko, presidential adviser on diaspora affairs.

CARICOM, the regional bloc of the Caribbean, has endorsed a "right of return" for descendants of enslaved people, as part of a reparations plan adopted in 2014.

Resettlement should be funded by "those states that are responsible for the forced movement and enslavement" of millions of people, CARICOM says, meaning European states and governments.

Though no significant progress has been made towards such a comprehensive effort, Benin's government hopes the programme can nevertheless strengthen ties between Africans and the diaspora while showcasing the country's history, said Bakari, the foreign minister.

"We believe that Africa cannot develop without a strong involvement of its diaspora," he said.

"What we are looking for is people who will definitely recognise themselves as African, having the proof that they are part of this continent."</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 09:31:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/S3SOVWFYGRLRJGBNA7RRGWOJ3A.jpg?auth=260d290b4200dba2a86bc111b46c8046353758f65e6bb52ad90e19ec6322aa23&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>France to open consulate in Greenland in a ‘political signal’ amid Trump threats</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260114-france-to-open-consulate-in-greenland-in-a-political-signal-amid-trump-threats</link><description>France will open a consulate in Greenland on February 6, Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot said Wednesday, calling the move a "political signal" over the strategic Danish territory, which US President Donald Trump has vowed to seize.

The comments came as the Danish and ‍Greenlandic foreign ministers are set to ​meet with US Vice President JD Vance at the White House later Wednesday

Since returning to office nearly a year ago, Trump has repeatedly mused about taking over Greenland from longtime ally and European Union member Denmark.

Barrot on Wednesday told French RTL broadcaster that the decision to open the consulate was taken last summer, when President Emmanuel Macron visited Greenland in a show of support.

"For my part, I went there at the end of August to plan the consulate, which will open on February 6," he said.

"It's a political signal that's associated with a desire to be more present in Greenland, including in the scientific field."

"Greenland does not want to be owned, governed ... or integrated into the United States. Greenland has made the choice of Denmark, NATO, (European) Union," he said.

Greenland's leader has said that the island would choose to remain an autonomous territory of Denmark.

Trump has said the United States needs Greenland due to the threat of a takeover by Russia or China.

The two rival powers have both stepped up activity in the Arctic, where ice is melting due to climate change, but neither claims Greenland, where the United States has long had a military base.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 09:32:08 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/2379b5c4-f123-11f0-9145-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26013723586602.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Some personnel were advised to leave U.S. military base in Qatar, diplomats tell Reuters</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/some-personnel-were-advised-leave-us-military-base-qatar-diplomats-tell-reuters-2026-01-14/</link><description>DOHA, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Some personnel were advised to leave the U.S. military's Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar by Wednesday evening, three diplomats told Reuters.

Prime Minister Rosen Zhelyazkov's coalition government, backed by GERB-SDS, resigned last month after weeks of street protests against state corruption and a new budget that would have increased some taxes.

In line with the constitution, Bulgarian President Rumen Radev on Monday had formally asked the conservative GERB-SDS to form the government which they rejected. On Wednesday PP-DB, which seeks closer relations with the European Union, also rejected the mandate, BTA agency reported.

Radev is now expected to offer a chance to govern to another party and then if they refuse he will have to call a snap vote, Bulgaria's eighth in just four years.

Despite such uncertainty, Bulgaria joined the euro zone on January 1 as scheduled. But it needs political stability to speed the uptake of EU funds into its creaking infrastructure, encourage foreign investment and root out endemic state corruption.

The GERB-SDS coalition won the last election in October 2024 but only took power in January 2025 after months of talks and needed the support of other parties in the divided legislature.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 09:55:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BK5VL5TJM5IYDGVGQOIR6LTX3Y.jpg?auth=047ff1a5dd4ffc606693883f8fa3fe9c9d8bbc907debe8d3f8cb8bccbc61d447&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>2025, third hottest year on record</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/2025-third-hottest-year-on-record</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 09:56:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/4fd4b200-f12c-11f0-963f-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260114-102130-102659-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Gaza: Hypothermia kills 5 as blockade hinders aid</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/gaza-hypothermia-kills-5-as-blockade-hinders-aid</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 10:55:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/e31a3d06-f12b-11f0-8cd8-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260114-101642-101818-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Greenland: Meeting set in Washington as Trump mulls taking the island</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/greenland-meeting-set-in-washington-as-trump-mulls-taking-the-island</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 10:55:26 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/61cfa0d8-f12b-11f0-bc9d-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260114-100833-101617-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>JD Vance, Rubio to meet Greenland officials</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/jd-vance-rubio-to-meet-greenland-officials</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 10:55:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/107e2880-f12b-11f0-b65e-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260114-100646-100833-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Donald Trump warns of "very strong action" if Iran hangs protesters</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/donald-trump-warns-of-very-strong-action-if-iran-hangs-protesters</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 10:55:32 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/afc69f90-f12a-11f0-8cc5-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260114-100435-100613-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran: Activists report more than 2,500 dead after brutal crackdown</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/iran-activists-report-more-than-2-500-dead-after-brutal-crackdown</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 10:55:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/82185052-f12a-11f0-86e4-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260114-100154-100415-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Economic confrontation replaces armed conflict as top risk in WEF survey</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/davos/economic-confrontation-replaces-armed-conflict-top-risk-wef-survey-2026-01-14/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Economic confrontation between nations and its consequences topped the World Economic Forum's (WEF) annual risks perception survey released on Wednesday, replacing armed conflict as the number one concern of 1,300-plus experts surveyed worldwide.

The survey also showed perceptions of environmental risk slipping down the rankings while other concerns came to the fore - notably fears over the long-term consequences of weak governance of artificial intelligence.

Saadia Zahidi, managing director of the WEF annual gathering in Davos due to start next week, cited rising tariffs, checks on foreign investment and tighter supply controls on resources like critical minerals as examples of "geoeconomic confrontation", which ranked as the top risk.

"(It is) when economic policy tools become essentially weaponry rather than a basis of cooperation," she told an online press conference.

U.S. President Donald Trump's "America first" policies have led to a sharp rise in U.S. trading tariffs across the world and fed into tensions between the U.S. and China, which is dominant in critical minerals and the world's second largest economy.

Perceived risks around extreme weather over the next two years dropped from 2nd to 4th place and pollution from 6th to 9th. Anxiety over critical change to earth systems and biodiversity loss fell seven and five positions respectively.

However, when asked what their sharpest concerns were over a longer, 10-year period, those same respondents ranked such environmental concerns in the top three spots.

Anxiety about "adverse outcomes of AI technologies" ranked 30th place in the two-year horizon but 5th place in the 10-year horizon.

Zahidi said the survey revealed that most of the concerns focused on how insufficient governance around AI could harm jobs, society and mental health while seeing it increasingly being used as a weapon in warfare.

The WEF said its annual survey draws on responses from "over 1,300 global leaders and experts from academia, business, government, international organizations and civil society".</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 11:23:07 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/TH57VPJPWNNWPAZQY6M2LGDOII.jpg?auth=9bc8d43ff4500d48cd2ee0f942a3411a19b8f44a8789d36953222fc46d0de2dc&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>EU to split Ukraine financial support with 30 bln euros for budget, 60 bln for military</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/eu-split-ukraine-financial-support-with-30-bln-euros-budget-60-bln-military-2026-01-14/</link><description>BRUSSELS, Jan 14 (Reuters) - The European Commission's President Ursula von der Leyen said on Wednesday the EU intends to split the 90 billion euro ($104.89 billion) financial support approved for Ukraine into one third for its general budget and two thirds for military supplies.

"We take really a next step in our support to build a stronger and more stable Ukraine," she said in a news conference in Brussels.

The 60 billion euros to be spent on military gears will be used mainly to buy equipment from the EU and EFTA countries, she said.

Finland and other European Union and NATO members bordering Russia - Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and Poland - decided to leave the Ottawa treaty amid concerns over the military threat posed by Russia.

Russia has used landmines in its invasion of Ukraine, and in July accused Ukraine of doing so too, after Ukraine announced its withdrawal from the Ottawa Convention.

In Finland, talks with the domestic defence industry and anti-personnel landmine training for military personnel will start early this year.

"The goal is to have the first new mines and their exercise equipment available in the course of 2027," the country's Defence Forces said in a statement.

"New anti-personnel mines are intended to be developed in cooperation with the domestic defence industry with a further goal of manufacturing them in Finland."

Finland does not plan to lay anti-personnel mines on the ground in peacetime.

"We will use mines only in emergency conditions," said Colonel Riku Mikkonen, Inspector of Engineers for the Army Command.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 11:24:10 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/P2Y7AJ7HSBPJZJHMY4NO3HBHGA.jpg?auth=f896226513b783b7dd1353f025223136e710d7055935ccf7c366f9d34781e694&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Just one in five Americans support Trump's efforts to acquire Greenland, Reuters/Ipsos poll finds</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/just-one-five-americans-support-trumps-efforts-acquire-greenland-reutersipsos-2026-01-14/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Just 17% of Americans approve of President Donald Trump's efforts to acquire Greenland, and substantial majorities of Democrats and Republicans oppose using military force to annex the island, a Reuters/Ipsos poll found.

The two-day poll, which concluded on Tuesday, showed widespread concerns over Trump's threats to NATO ally Denmark over Greenland, which has been a Danish territory for centuries .

U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio are due to meet the Danish and Greenlandic foreign ministers at the White House on Wednesday, the day after Greenland's prime minister said his nation would prefer to remain part of Denmark .

Trump has said Greenland is vital to U.S. security and that Washington must own it to prevent Russia or China occupying the strategically located territory - which is rich in mineral wealth - in the future.

White House officials have discussed various plans to bring Greenland under U.S. control, including using military force or issuing lump-sum payments to Greenlanders as part of a bid to convince them to secede from Denmark.

Some 47% of respondents to the Reuters/Ipsos poll disapproved of U.S. efforts to acquire Greenland, while 35% said they were unsure.

About one in five respondents in the poll said they had not heard of the plans to acquire Greenland. The effort has come to the fore as Trump has stepped up efforts to dominate affairs in the Western Hemisphere. Earlier this month, he vowed to "run" Venezuela after ordering a military raid that captured the country's president.

Only 4% of Americans - including just one in 10 Republicans and almost no Democrats - said it would be a "good idea" for the U.S. to use military force to take possession of Greenland from Denmark. Some 71% thought it would be a bad idea, including nine in 10 Democrats and six in 10 Republicans. About one in three Republicans said they weren't sure if it was a good or bad idea.

Denmark has warned that using military force would mark the end of NATO, the transatlantic defense treaty that has been a key plank in the world order since 1949.

Some 66% of respondents, including 91% of Democrats and 40% of Republicans, said they were worried U.S. efforts to acquire Greenland will damage the NATO alliance and U.S. relationships with European allies.

Trump campaigned on promises to avoid war, helping shore up support for him among Americans tired of decades of foreign military conflicts such as the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Appetite for foreign conflict, including attempts to expand U.S. territory, has been low throughout Trump's second term.

Some 10% of respondents agreed with a statement that the U.S. "should use military force to obtain new territory, like Greenland and the Panama Canal," largely unchanged from 9% in a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted January 20-21 of last year, shortly after Trump returned to power.

Some Republican lawmakers have also expressed skepticism over Trump's Greenland ambitions, particularly when it comes to threats against Denmark, though others support legislation that would give Trump the power to annex Greenland.

Besides Denmark, Trump has also threatened action against Iran if authorities there mistreat protesters in the country. Trump last year ordered U.S. strikes in support of Israel in its short-lived war against Iran. The latest Reuters/Ipsos poll showed 33% of Americans approve of Trump's handling of Iran, while 43% disapproved.

The new Reuters/Ipsos poll, which was conducted online and nationwide, gathered responses from 1,217 U.S. adults and had a margin of error of 3 percentage points.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 11:24:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7O5AAB6PGJL45KE3WSUNM2X4H4.jpg?auth=3249739d42dda3975a8cd27765727b9da3679073b8e79460da66ebe9dda42d7d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran's Revolutionary Guards point to battle readiness and increased missile stockpiles, state media says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/irans-revolutionary-guards-point-battle-readiness-increased-missile-stockpiles-2026-01-14/</link><description>DUBAI, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Iran's stockpile of missiles has increased since a 12-day war with Israel last year, Revolutionary Guards' Aerospace Commander Majid Mousavi said on Wednesday according to state media, following U.S. President Donald Trump's threats of intervention amid anti-government protests in Iran.

"We are at the peak of our readiness," Mousavi was quoted as saying by state media, adding that wartime damages had been repaired and output in various areas by the guards' aerospace forces was higher than before June 2025.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 11:24:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CGHQRCW7RBNVHAKYA65V5CQOLU.jpg?auth=d291a54a56fdbe68a7620d16c02941aebfe8f00e8b78620b2112d70fc243295e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia says talk of a ceasefire, rather than a full peace deal, in Ukraine is simply not serious</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-says-talk-ceasefire-rather-than-full-peace-deal-ukraine-is-simply-not-2026-01-14/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 11:24:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Finland to acquire anti-personnel landmines and start training staff</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/finland-acquire-anti-personnel-landmines-start-training-staff-2026-01-14/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 11:24:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Iran's Revolutionary Guards point to battle readiness and increased missile stockpiles, state media says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/irans-revolutionary-guards-point-battle-readiness-increased-missile-stockpiles-2026-01-14/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 11:24:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>US expected to unveil post-war Gaza leadership, sources say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-expected-unveil-post-war-gaza-leadership-sources-say-2026-01-14/</link><description>CAIRO, Jan 14 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump is expected on Wednesday to push ahead with his phased plan for Gaza's future by announcing the administration that will run the war-ravaged Palestinian territory, four Palestinian sources said.

Israel and Hamas in October signed off on Trump's 20-point plan which says that a technocratic Palestinian body overseen by an international "Board of Peace" is meant to govern Gaza for a transitional period. It is not to include Hamas representation.

The 14-member Palestinian body will be headed by Ali Shaath, a former deputy minister in the Western-backed Palestinian Authority who had been in charge of developing industrial zones, the Palestinian sources said.

Other members tapped by Nickolay Mladenov, the former U.N. Middle East envoy who is expected to represent the Board of Peace on the ground, include people from the private sector and NGOS, according a list of the names obtained by Reuters.

The first phase of Trump's plan, which included a ceasefire and hostage release deal, has been shaken by issues including Israeli airstrikes in Gaza that have killed hundreds of people, a refusal by Hamas to disarm, the remains of one last Israeli hostage still not having been returned and Israeli delays in reopening Gaza's Rafah border crossing with Egypt.

Although the two sides accuse each other of breaching the deal, Trump says he wants to move on to the second phase, a progression that would entail the establishment of the Board of Peace and a yet-to-be-agreed deployment of peacekeeping forces.

Hamas leaders and other Palestinian factions are in Cairo for talks on the second phase, the group said. Egyptian sources said talks with Hamas would now focus on the group's disarmament.

Hamas has so far not agreed to lay down its weapons, saying it will only give up its weapons once there is a Palestinian state. Further Israeli withdrawals within Gaza are tied to disarmament.

Members of the technocratic Palestinian committee were expected to meet with Mladenov in Cairo on Wednesday. Hamas and its rival Fatah group, led by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, have both endorsed the list of members, Egyptian and Palestinian sources said.

It will also include the head of the Gaza Chamber of Commerce Ayed Abu Ramadan and Omar Shamali, who has worked for the Palestinian Telecommunication Group PALTEL, the Palestinian sources said.

Israeli officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 11:44:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CUFFLM3DEJLDXG6UM7FJUYWWF4.jpg?auth=f4028b3aac023f8114c37733ff42a51e5d2c30d8ed556b7c48a7bc2b4492dc1d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Explainer: Why Japan's Takaichi is gambling on an early election</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/why-japans-takaichi-is-gambling-an-early-election-2026-01-14/</link><description>TOKYO, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi plans to dissolve parliament's lower house next week, triggering a national election to decide all 465 seats in her first major election test since taking office in October .

She will announce details of the election on Monday, ruling Liberal Democratic Party Secretary-General Shunichi Suzuki said.

Japan's first female premier inherited a battered government, with the LDP having lost its majority in both houses of parliament after disgruntled voters punished it over rising prices and a funding scandal.

By calling a snap election now, she hopes to capitalise on a surge in public support for a new leader who has promised to spur economic growth, tackle cost-of-living concerns and tighten immigration rules.

Some media polls have put the LDP's support at more than 60%, giving Takaichi an opportunity to restore its majority in the more powerful lower chamber.

A poll of 1,213 people published by public broadcaster NHK on January 13 showed she had the backing of 62% of voters.

Even if she bags a lower-house majority, however, Takaichi will still have to govern with a minority in the upper house, which she cannot dissolve. Voters elect half of its members every three years and the next election is not due until 2028.

A decisive victory would strengthen her hand within the LDP and reduce her reliance on smaller political parties to pass key legislation.

That, in turn, could allow her to push ahead with plans to boost government spending to revive economic growth and sharply increase defence outlays under a revised national security strategy amid heightened tension with Japan's powerful neighbour China .

The shift could mark a further step from Japan’s post-war pacifist constraints, including a long-standing principle that bars nuclear weapons from the country's territory.

With prices still rising and the yen's value against the U.S. dollar sliding , the cost of living is likely to dominate the election campaign. In the NHK poll 45% of respondents said that was their main concern, followed by diplomacy and national security at 16%.

Her government has proposed record spending of $770 billion for the next fiscal year, a move that has unnerved investors in one of the world's most indebted industrial economies.

All 465 seats in the lower house will be contested, 289 in single-member districts and 176 through proportional representation. A simple majority requires 233 seats.

The LDP currently controls 199 seats in the chamber and governs with the support of its coalition partner the Japan Innovation Party, known as Ishin, which has 34 seats.

The main opposition party, the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan (CDPJ), has 148 seats in the house, followed by the Democratic Party for the People (DPP) with 27. Komeito, which quit its 26-year coalition with the LDP after Takaichi became leader, has 24 seats.

Attention may also focus on how Takaichi fares against the far-right Sanseito Party , whose calls for tighter immigration controls siphoned votes from the LDP in last July's upper house election, where it won 14 seats.

By dissolving the lower house on January 23, Takaichi will trigger an official campaign period of around two weeks before voting day. If the LDP and Ishin secure a majority, she would be confirmed as prime minister in a special parliamentary session.

If not, she may be forced to seek new coalition partners or the support of other smaller parties, a setback that would weaken her authority.

In open , opens new tab letters , opens new tab published on Wednesday, the coalition accused the Elon Musk-owned apps of generating illegal content that violates both companies' terms of service.

The push, whose backers include the feminist group UltraViolet, the National Organization for Women, the liberal group MoveOn, and the parent advocacy group ParentsTogether Action, is aimed at piling pressure on Musk after Grok began generating sexually charged, degrading, or violent images of women and children.

"We are really imploring Apple and Google to take this extremely seriously," Jenna Sherman, UltraViolet's campaign director, told Reuters ahead of the letter's release. "They are enabling a system in which thousands, if not tens of thousands, of people, particularly women and children, are being sexually abused through the help of their own app stores."

X did not return a message seeking comment on the letter. Its parent company, xAI, which powers Grok, responded with the words, "Legacy Media Lies." Google and Apple have not returned repeated messages seeking comment about X and Grok.

Scrutiny continues to build after X was flooded with hyper-realistic images of women and minors in skimpy clothing at the turn of the new year.

Malaysia and Indonesia have already banned Grok over the explicit content, while authorities in Europe and the United Kingdom have announced investigations or demanded answers.

Separately, some organizations and leaders are pulling back from X. On Tuesday, the American Federation of Teachers announced it was quitting the social network over indecent images of children produced by Grok.

While X has adjusted the chatbot's behavior so that images Grok generates or edits are not posted to the public timeline, a Reuters test of Grok on Tuesday showed it was still generating bikini-clad versions of people's photographs on demand.

Sherman said while Apple and Google both claim to take child protection seriously, their treatment of X would reveal "what their values actually are in practice."</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 11:44:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/VU3G4YSWZ5IXNEEIEXVW57Q4PY.jpg?auth=2447f678233cef3c084f4db8550947448bcf93a719c4d2a91806742d3df320ac&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>EU's von der Leyen: Greenlanders can count on us</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/eus-von-der-leyen-greenlanders-can-count-us-2026-01-14/</link><description>BRUSSELS, Jan 14 (Reuters) - The European Commission's President Ursula von der Leyen said on Wednesday there is a strong relationship between the EU and Greenland and that Greenlanders could rely on the EU's support.

Unidentified drones struck at least two oil tankers in the Black Sea on Tuesday, including one chartered by U.S. oil major Chevron (CVX.N) , opens new tab , as they sailed toward a terminal on the Russian coast to load oil from Kazakhstan.

Kazakhstan's foreign ministry said in a statement that three tankers were hit en route to the marine terminal of the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) in the Black Sea.

On November 29, drones also attacked CPC's exporting equipment, resulting in a fall in oil exports via the outlet.

"The increasing frequency of such incidents highlights the growing risks to the functioning of international energy infrastructure," the ministry said in a statement.

"We therefore call upon our partners to engage in close cooperation to develop joint measures aimed at preventing similar incidents in the future," it added.

Russian defence ministry said on Wednesday that the Matilda tanker, sailing under the Maltese flag, came under attack by two Ukrainian strike drones at a distance of about 100 kilometres (62 miles) from the city of Anapa in Russia's Krasnodar region.

Ukraine did not comment on the incident.

Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh, whose stage name is Mo Chara, was accused of having waved the flag of the banned militant group Hezbollah during a November 2024 gig.

The charge was thrown out in September after a court ruled it had originally been brought without the permission of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Attorney General, and also one day outside the six-month statutory limit.

But the Crown Prosecution Service said it would challenge the ruling and its lawyer Paul Jarvis told London's High Court on Wednesday that permission was only required by the time Ó hAnnaidh first appeared in court, meaning the case can proceed.

Kneecap – known for their politically charged lyrics and support for the Palestinian cause – have said the case is an attempt to distract from what they described as British complicity in Israel's genocide in Gaza. Israel strongly denies committing a genocide in the tiny coastal territory.

J.J. Ó Dochartaigh, who goes by DJ Próvaí, was in court but Ó hAnnaidh was not required to attend and was not present.

Ó hAnnaidh was charged in May with displaying the Hezbollah flag in such a way that aroused reasonable suspicion that he supported the banned group, after footage emerged of him holding the flag on stage while saying "Up Hamas, up Hezbollah".

Kneecap have previously said the flag was thrown on stage during their performance and that they "do not, and have never, supported Hamas or Hezbollah".

The group, who rap about Irish identity and support the republican cause of uniting Northern Ireland with the Republic of Ireland, have become increasingly vocal about the war in Gaza, particularly after Ó hAnnaidh was charged in May .

During their performance at June's Glastonbury Festival in England, Ó hAnnaidh accused Israel of committing war crimes, after Kneecap displayed pro-Palestinian messages during their set at the Coachella Festival in California in April.

Kneecap have since been banned from Hungary and Canada , also cancelling a tour of the United States due to a clash with Ó hAnnaidh's court appearances.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 12:47:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BNAVQFT7CBP6TLE2EB4XN7W2YU.jpg?auth=f15023533f57c9ef9ac1488583b99f5e54b01a57d0894789343ec2c4d34238ad&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia says attack on oil tanker near CPC was carried out by Ukrainian drones</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-says-attack-oil-tanker-near-cpc-was-carried-out-by-ukrainian-drones-2026-01-14/</link><description>MOSCOW, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Russia's defence ministry said on Wednesday that an attack on the oil tanker Matilda in the Black Sea on January 13 was carried out by two Ukrainian strike UAVs about 100 km from the city of Anapa in Russia's Krasnodar region.

The no-confidence motions, filed by the far-right National Rally (RN) and hard-left France Unbowed (LFI), aim to protest the European Union's trade agreement with the Mercosur bloc.

Despite French opposition, EU member states last week approved the signing of the long-debated deal with Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. The RN and LFI accuse the government of not doing enough to block it.

“The French executive never really gave itself the means to prevent the adoption of this agreement,” LFI said.

The two motions will be examined by the lower house of parliament in the afternoon.

The Socialist Party has ruled out backing them and the conservative The Republicans said they would not vote to censure the government over Mercosur.

“A motion of censure in France achieves nothing. It’s now in the European Parliament that the battle will take place,” The Republicans leader Bruno Retailleau told Europe 1/CNews.

Government insiders said Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu will let the no-confidence motions run their course before returning to the fraught budget talks.

NEXT ON THE AGENDA: TOUGH BUDGET TALKS

One of several options regarding the country's 2026 budget would be for the prime minister to invoke Article 49.3 of the Constitution to push through the finance bill without a vote, after negotiating a text with all groups except the RN and LFI, one government source said. That would almost certainly lead to more motions of no confidence.

Lawmakers are eager to end weeks of wrangling over the budget, even if it means the country's deficit remains near 5%, sources said.

President Emmanuel Macron, according to his entourage, wants a budget adopted in January and is "neutral" on how to achieve that.

Government spokeswoman Maud Bregeon said on Tuesday that "nothing is excluded" to pass the budget. Lecornu, who last week warned of a possible dissolution of parliament if his government fell, later softened his tone: "I want neither censure nor dissolution. My fight is for stability and against disorder," he told Le Parisien.

France's political situation has been fragile since 2022, when Macron lost his majority in parliament.

His problems worsened when he unexpectedly called early legislative elections in mid-2024, only to deliver a hung parliament split between three distinct ideological blocs: his centre-right alliance, the left, and the far-right RN.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 12:47:49 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CERWTDWCLNNL3OQVVJM6UMMCPA.jpg?auth=737bd1f6e0fa9f30a9f53926e4deefc782efdc4e2b9d62f2c7e9056749c25218&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukraine lawmakers appoints former PM Shmyhal as energy minister</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/ukraine-lawmakers-appoints-former-pm-shmyhal-energy-minister-2026-01-14/</link><description>KYIV, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Ukrainian lawmakers appointed former prime minister Denys Shmyhal as energy minister and first deputy prime minister on Wednesday amid escalating Russian strikes on the power sector.

The activists, identified as members of a group called "Raise the Colours" that was involved in a national flag-raising campaign, seek to find and destroy boats used to carry migrants and spread propaganda on France's northern coast calling on the British public to join the movement to stop migration, according to the French interior ministry.

"Our rule of law is non-negotiable, violent or hate-inciting actions have no place on our territory," French Interior Minister Laurent Nunez wrote on social media platform X on Wednesday.

The ministry said in a statement it had been informed of the group's activities in December last year and that it had referred the matter to the relevant authorities, as the actions were likely to cause "serious disturbances" to public order.

"Raise the Colours" describes itself as a grassroots movement that began in the central English city of Birmingham, when a small group started tying national flags to lampposts in a show of national pride. It says the effort has since spread across the UK.

The widespread display of the red-and-white St George's Cross for England and the Union Jack for Britain has prompted concern among some migrant communities as a reflection of rising anti‑immigration sentiment in the country, coinciding with a wave of protests outside hotels housing asylum seekers last year.

Neither the group nor the British Foreign Office immediately responded to Reuters requests for comment.

Immigration and the crossings of small boats carrying migrants from France have become a focal point for British voters and has helped propel Nigel Farage's right-wing, anti-immigration Reform UK party, into a commanding opinion poll lead.

Farage last year in London met the leader of French far-right National Rally (RN) party, Jordan Bardella, who has accused France of being too soft on immigration.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 12:47:54 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/U5NSDG5SL5KYJMZG33XCGMR2WU.jpg?auth=1cd8d047e96c4fb76c5645f72a2a9b40fb2f914947f5322f2dee0a465d137117&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia's Lavrov says the U.S. is smashing the world around with its raid on Venezuela and threats to Iran</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/russias-lavrov-says-us-is-smashing-world-around-with-its-raid-on-venezuela-2026-01-14/</link><description>MOSCOW, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Wednesday that the United States was fragmenting the very international system which Washington helped to create by undertaking what he said was an illegal operation to topple Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro and by threatening Iran with attack.

"We are talking about a gross violation of international law," Lavrov said of the U.S. operation to capture Maduro. He added that Russia remained committed to its agreements with Venezuela, a Russian ally.

"In general, this and other actions in the international arena indicate the line of our American colleagues to break the entire system that has been created for many years with their participation," he said.

Lavrov, who has served as foreign minister since 2004, said the entire international order - along with globalisation - had been "flushed down the drain" and was now fragmenting.

When asked about U.S. threats against Iran, Lavrov said that Moscow needed to keep working with Tehran to implement their bilateral agreements and that no other country could change the nature of ties between Russia and Iran.

Lavrov suggested that the United States, by abandoning the principles it had promoted for so long, was damaging its own image.

"Our American colleagues look unreliable when they act in this way," Lavrov told a news conference with his Namibian counterpart in Moscow.

Asked about a Bloomberg report that White House envoy Steve Witkoff and U.S. President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner are seeking to travel to Moscow to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin, Lavrov said that Putin had repeatedly said that he is open to serious discussions about peace in Ukraine.

It would, Lavrov said, be helpful if Washington briefed Moscow on the latest peace proposals for Ukraine.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 12:47:56 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/IVRR47ZN3NPO3BEA5ZTID4XXDM.jpg?auth=8348685653ad5e74ab5bcae42f248b247f44cedbc73512d0001bbff7ecca01bd&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Macron on Greenland: If sovereignty of an ally is affected, knock-on effects would be unprecedented</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/macron-greenland-if-sovereignty-an-ally-is-affected-knock-on-effects-would-be-2026-01-14/</link><description>PARIS, Jan 14 (Reuters) - If the sovereignty of a European country and ally was affected, the knock-on effects would be unprecedented, French President Emmanuel Macron said on Wednesday during a cabinet meeting, referring to the U.S. President Donald Trump's push to take control of the Arctic territory .

"We do not underestimate statements on Greenland," Macron said, quoted by French government spokesperson Maud Bregeon.

"If the sovereignty of a European country and ally were to be affected, the knock-on effects would be unprecedented. France is monitoring the situation very closely and will act in full solidarity with Denmark and its sovereignty." he added.

Earlier in the day, the European Commission's President Ursula von der Leyen said there was a strong relationship between the EU and Greenland and that Greenlanders could rely on the EU's support.

The Danish and Greenland foreign ministers will meet with U.S. Vice President JD Vance at the White House later on Wednesday following weeks of threats by President Donald Trump on Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 12:48:02 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/JKLZV6GMGBLIPNR4OE2D6SWM4U.jpg?auth=06ccec5bf9d2474e1cf3e581f2d13b85d395fdc3bfe065516b9a778773945e7d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>France bans 10 British far-right activists for attacking migrant boats</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260114-france-bans-10-uk-far-right-activists-over-anti-migrant-actions</link><description>France has banned 10 British far-right activists for actions in France intended to stop migrants crossing to England on small boats, the interior ministry said Wednesday.

Immigration has become a central political issue in the United Kingdom, as the government seeks to stem a wave of undocumented migrants arriving on English shores after paying smugglers to cross the Channel.

The arrivals have fuelled rising anger on the British far right, and since last year videos have circulated of anti-migrant activists visiting France to take matters into their own hands.

France's interior ministry said it took action following reports that members of the "Raise the Colours" movement had conducted anti-migrant activities in France.

On Tuesday, "territorial bans were issued against 10 British nationals, identified as activists within the movement and having carried out actions on French soil", it said.

It did not immediately name the 10 people, or the exact nature of their actions in France.

But French authorities have opened an investigation over an alleged "aggravated assault" on migrants in September in a coastal area near the northern city of Dunkirk.

Four men carrying British and English flags verbally and physically assaulted a group of migrants in Grand-Fort-Philippe on the night on September 9 to 10, telling them they were not welcome in England, a charity working with migrants told AFP.

"Raise the Colours" denounced the ban as "absolutely disgraceful" in a post to X.

Another of its social media accounts, this one on Instagram, whose profile logo includes the words "Operation France", late last year posted videos of anti-immigration activists on France's northern coastline.

In one video posted in November, a man filmed himself on a French beach, saying he had found a small inflatable boat buried in the sand and had slashed it.

"That is not going to England," said the man, who elsewhere has called himself Ryan Bridge.

In another post published earlier the same month, he waded into the sea shouting at what appeared to be dozens of undocumented migrants boarding an inflatable dinghy on their way to England.

"You're not welcome in our country," he said, calling the passengers "potential rapists, murderers and child abusers".

The debate about immigration in the United Kingdom last year triggered a new trend of flying English and British flags.

Anti-racism campaigners say far-right activists are behind the main organisers, "Raise the Colours".

Migrants have long sought to cross the Channel from France to the United Kingdon dreaming of a better life in Britain.

Last year saw the second highest number of undocumented migrants arrive on British shores since the Channel crossings from France began in 2018.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 12:48:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/28d9389c-f140-11f0-ae70-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/7e4d8e320b80644fea0fd19516d3b6bc5120af47.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Wildfires ravage Argentina’s Patagonia</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/wildfires-ravage-argentina-s-patagonia</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 12:48:16 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/ba976a68-f13d-11f0-8f8d-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260114-121126-121259-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran calls for fast trials of protesters despite Trump’s warning</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/iran-calls-for-fast-trials-of-protesters-despite-trump-s-warning</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 12:48:19 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/9aec4c98-f13c-11f0-b98e-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260114-120247-120756-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Semifinals kicking off on Wednesday: Morocco VS Nigeria</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/semifinals-kicking-off-on-wednesday-morocco-vs-nigeria</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 12:48:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/093fed54-f13c-11f0-bf44-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260114-110813-110934-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>No cows allowed at French agricutural show</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/no-cows-allowed-at-french-agricutural-show</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 12:48:22 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/3682b9be-f13b-11f0-b29d-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260114-104156-104335-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Vance to meet Danish and Greenlandic officials in Washington on Wednesday</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/vance-to-meet-danish-and-greenlandic-officials-in-washington-on-wednesday</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 12:48:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/c1a0c9f6-f13a-11f0-a13d-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260114-103715-103921-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia launches intense missile and drone assault on Ukraine</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/russia-launches-intense-missile-and-drone-assault-on-ukraine</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 12:48:26 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/635eac88-f134-11f0-831b-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260114-101849-102023-CS-01.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Brazil's Lula leads right-wing rivals ahead of 2026 election, poll shows</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/brazils-lula-leads-right-wing-rivals-ahead-2026-election-poll-shows-2026-01-14/</link><description>SAO PAULO, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva is leading Senator Flavio Bolsonaro and Sao Paulo Governor Tarcisio de Freitas in voting intentions for this year's election, a Quaest poll commissioned by brokerage Genial showed on Wednesday.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 13:40:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/OW6MZN7CVVOERFCWYZS36FMEE4.jpg?auth=ff3c1eecc0c3620d64d6432b93b210d78646421980ba6015fd8afa70bfa1ec35&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Captain tried to change course before fatal tanker crash, UK jury told</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/captain-tried-change-course-before-fatal-tanker-crash-uk-jury-told-2026-01-14/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 14 (Reuters) - The captain of a container ship that crashed into a U.S. tanker off Britain's east coast last year tried to change course to avoid the fatal collision, his lawyer told a London court trial over a crew member's death on Wednesday.

Russian national Vladimir Motin, captain of the Solong that hit the anchored Stena Immaculate tanker in March 2025, tried to take his vessel off autopilot shortly before the crash but was unsuccessful, his lawyer said.

Motin, 59, is on trial at the Old Bailey charged with the gross negligence manslaughter of Solong crew member Mark Pernia, 38, whose body has never been found but is presumed dead. Motin has pleaded not guilty.

His lawyer James Leonard said Motin had a duty to avoid the collision and that there was "no doubt that the collision caused the sad death of Mr Pernia".

"On the simple basis of failing to avoid a collision with the Stena Immaculate, there is no doubt that the defendant was at fault," Leonard added.

But he told the jury they would have to consider whether any fault by Motin actually caused the collision and whether it was "grossly negligent as compared with something less than that".

Motin was aware of the Stena Immaculate from the Solong's radar from "at least nine nautical miles (16.7 kilometers) away" while the Solong was controlled by autopilot, Leonard said.

He added that, when the Solong was around one nautical mile away from the Stena Immaculate, Motin tried to take the Solong out of autopilot to manually change course.

"There is no dispute that, had he changed course in the way he intended, there would have been no collision," Leonard said.

He told the jury that they would have to consider why Motin waited until the Solong was one nautical mile away and whether that was reasonable.

Prosecutor Tom Little said on Tuesday that Motin, who has pleaded not guilty to gross negligence manslaughter, did "absolutely nothing" to prevent the collision.

The trial is expected to conclude next month.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 13:40:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ND3S3PQ7RFKBPFGXAHRYVBEPGU.jpg?auth=20f4982773f8d2fef38e28f407c491572753b18a75017a117e1b35577023a982&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>EU assembly weighs freezing US trade deal over Trump's Greenland threats</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/eu-assembly-weighs-freezing-us-trade-deal-over-trumps-greenland-threats-2026-01-14/</link><description>BRUSSELS, Jan 14 (Reuters) - The European Parliament is considering putting on hold the European Union's implementation of the trade deal struck with the United States in protest over threats by U.S. President Donald Trump to seize Greenland .

The European Parliament has been debating legislative proposals to remove many of the EU's import duties on U.S. goods - the bulk of the trade deal with the U.S. - and to continue zero duties for U.S. lobsters , initially agreed with Trump in 2020. It was due to set its position in votes on January 26-27, which the MEPs said should now be postponed.

Leading members of the cross-parliamentary trade committee met to discuss the issue on Wednesday morning and decide whether to postpone the vote. In the end, they took no decision and settled on reconvening next week. A parliamentary source said left-leaning and centrist groups favoured taking action, such as a postponement.

A group of 23 lawmakers also urged the EU assembly's president Roberta Metsola on Wednesday to freeze work on the agreement as long as the U.S. administration continued its threats to take control of Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark .

"If we go through and approve a deal that Trump has seen as a personal victory, while he makes claims for Greenland and refuses to rule out any manner in which to achieve this, it will be easily seen as rewarding him and his actions," the letter drafted by Danish lawmaker Per Clausen said.

Signatories were mainly fellow members of Clausen's Left Group, but also included centre-left Social Democrats and Greens.

Greens lawmaker Anna Cavazzini said the only argument in favour of the deal was to bring stability.

"Trump's actions show again and again that chaos is his only offer," she said.

French lawmaker Valerie Hayer, head of the centrist Renew Europe group, said on Tuesday the EU should consider holding off a vote if Trump's threats continued.

Many lawmakers have complained that the U.S. trade deal is lopsided, with the EU required to cut most import duties while the U.S. sticks to a broad rate of 15%.

However, freezing the deal risks angering Trump, which could lead to higher U.S. tariffs. The Trump administration has also ruled out any concessions, such as cutting tariffs on spirits or steel, until the deal is in place.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 13:42:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/XJZ2JZ66XJOA5I3ZP4X5ARC5DU.jpg?auth=559fd50e1182c4ebe0a32462afa6ce1fce5172470529692b1ee5a59cae5dce2f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Exclusive: US withdrawing troops from key Middle East bases as precaution, US official says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-withdrawing-troops-key-middle-east-bases-precaution-us-official-says-2026-01-14/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 14 (Reuters) - The United States is withdrawing personnel from key bases in the region as a precaution given heightened regional tensions, a U.S. official told Reuters on Wednesday, speaking on condition of anonymity.

"I have been informed this morning that X is acting to ensure full compliance with UK law," Starmer told parliament, adding that the government would take further measures if needed.

Ofcom launched an investigation into the social media platform on Monday over concerns Grok was creating sexually intimate deepfake images in violation of its duty to protect people in the UK from illegal content.

Technology minister Liz Kendall said a new law making it an offence to create sexual deepfakes would come into force this week to tackle the images, which she called "weapons of abuse".

X did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It said earlier in January that it has restricted requests to undress people in images to paying users.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 13:42:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/SDOW7TR7MJKTBLPPD54L5VE5K4.jpg?auth=6d5c604c05b951d67005d290dbec73597e21d7ae1b87f413576fc814ae93b7b2&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iranians arrive in Turkey through border gate as crackdown persists</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iranians-arrive-turkey-through-border-gate-crackdown-persists-2026-01-14/</link><description>KAPIKOY, Turkey, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Dozens of Iranians crossed the border into Turkey on Wednesday, as authorities in Iran crack down on one of the biggest ever waves of protest against the Islamic Republic's clerical rule.

U.S. President Donald Trump urged Iranians on Tuesday to keep protesting, saying help is on the way. A rights group said 2,600 people have been killed in Iran as the clerical rulers try to quash the major wave of dissent.

Iranian families and individuals arrived in Turkey's eastern province of Van through the Kapikoy border gate, pulling luggage and other belongings with them as they made their way through the border gate and got on vehicles heading for nearby towns.

Those asked to speak to media declined to do so, expressing fear of repercussions in Iran when they return.

Two diplomats have told Reuters there has been an increase in the numbers of people crossing from Iran to Turkey after several countries advised their citizens to leave.

However, a Turkish security official at the border said that the situation at the gate was not extraordinary, with no notable increase in the numbers arriving, but that developments there were being closely monitored.

The U.S. has urged its citizens to leave Iran immediately, and advised them to consider departing by land to Turkey or Armenia, according to a notice released on Tuesday by the U.S. virtual embassy in Tehran.

Tehran has warned neighbouring countries hosting U.S. troops that it would retaliate against American bases if Washington carries out threats to intervene in protests in Iran, a senior Iranian official told Reuters on Wednesday.

Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan stressed the need for talks to resolve current regional tensions in a call with his Iranian counterpart, Abbas Araqchi, on Wednesday, a Turkish Foreign Ministry source said.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 13:42:33 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/SDLSGGUSWBLNHI4G2RTY34KMHU.jpg?auth=532908ee98a8b306e1f000efc524dc3dc045c6fb1b626f17174de71c4b2227bd&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Hungary's main opposition widens lead over PM Orban's Fidesz, two surveys show</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/hungarys-main-opposition-widens-lead-over-pm-orbans-fidesz-two-surveys-show-2026-01-14/</link><description>BUDAPEST, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Hungary's main opposition Tisza party has widened its lead over Prime Minister Viktor Orban's Fidesz, two polls showed on Wednesday, ahead of an April election in which the veteran nationalist is seeking to retain his 16-year grip on power.

Orban, in power since 2010, is facing a strong challenger for the first time in the April 12 parliamentary vote , with the outcome having major implications not only for Hungary but for Europe and its far-right political forces.

The polls show Fidesz is still struggling to recoup ground despite numerous voter-pleasing measures after three years of economic stagnation.

Tisza, a centre-right party led by former government insider Peter Magyar, has extended its lead over Fidesz to 12 percentage points, up from a 10-point lead in a November survey, pollster Median said in an article published by news website hvg.hu.

Magyar's party, which was only launched in 2024, had the support of 51% of decided voters, up from 50% in November.

Support for Fidesz dropped to 39% from 40% two months ago, according to the survey conducted between January 7 and 13.

Median researchers said Tisza was mostly luring away voters from other opposition parties, not Fidesz, but the ruling party was failing to lure new voters despite fiscal giveaways and efforts to tap into voter fears about the Ukraine war.

Apart from the two main parties, only the far-right Our Homeland (Mi Hazank) party has a chance to reach the 5% threshold for getting into parliament, the Median survey showed.

A second poll published on Wednesday, conducted by Idea Institute, put support for Tisza at 48% among decided voters, 10 points ahead of Fidesz. That survey was conducted between December 31 and January 6.

U.S. President Donald Trump redesignated Nigeria "a country of particular concern" in November and promised military action if it failed to crack down on the killing of Christians.

The Nigerian government says it is working hard to tackle Islamist and other groups which have attacked both Muslim and Christian civilians and that there is no systematic persecution.

It hired Washington-based consulting firm DCI Group for an initial six months for $4.5 million, with a similar amount due for another six months, a filing with the U.S. Department of Justice dated December 18 and posted on the DOJ website showed.

DCI and the Nigerian presidency did not immediately comment on the filing, which appeared in Nigerian media on Wednesday.

The agreement says DCI would help the Nigerian government "in communicating its actions to protect Nigerian's (sic) Christian communities and maintaining U.S support in countering West African jihadist groups and other destabilizing elements".

Nigeria has faced a long-running Islamist insurgency in the northeast, armed kidnapping gangs in the northwest and clashes between largely Muslim cattle herders and mostly Christian farmers in the middle belt of the country.

The U.S. military carried out an airstrike in northwest Nigeria on Christmas Day, which Trump said had killed multiple Islamic State militants. Trump said in an interview with the New York Times published last week that there could be more strikes if Christians are killed.

On Tuesday, the U.S. military's Africa Command said it had delivered critical military supplies to Nigeria to bolster the West African country's operations, in a sign of increased cooperation between Washington and Abuja.

On its website, DCI says "we are seasoned political operatives, communication strategists" and "experts at re-framing external narratives, and in delivering the right message to the right audience."</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 13:43:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/VNQQIB3TF5IE7GT65BA3PLM55I.jpg?auth=c054701426f305509128eab9230e153023caef0cb25effe670882058ad859e88&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Major construction-linked accidents in Thailand</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/major-construction-linked-accidents-thailand-2026-01-14/</link><description>BANGKOK, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Dozens of people were killed on Wednesday after a crane collapsed onto a moving train in northeastern Thailand, in the latest in a series of construction accidents in recent years.

Here are some other fatal incidents involving construction in Thailand:

March 28, 2025 - A partially built 30-storey tower in the capital Bangkok collapsed during a 7.7 magnitude quake that struck central Myanmar, killing at least 89 people .

The construction was being carried out by a joint venture including Italian Thai Development PCL (ITD.BK) , opens new tab , a major construction company which was also involved in building the rail link in Wednesday's crane accident.

The president of ITD was charged in August along with 21 other suspects for breaching construction regulations and causing death through negligence. The case is still pending and he denied the charges when arrested.

March 15, 2025 - At least five people were killed and 27 injured after an under-construction bridge on the Rama III–Dao Khanong Expressway Project collapsed in Bangkok. The highway project also involved ITD in a joint venture.

Authorities launched an investigation and the contractors promised compensation to the victims. The incident prompted the national government to roll out a "contractor report card" system in August, to boost oversight of companies working on public infrastructure projects.

August 24, 2024 - Three workers, two Chinese nationals and one from Myanmar, were killed when a tunnel collapsed in Nakhon Ratchasima province in northeastern Thailand that is part of the same railway project where Wednesday's incident took place. The collapse occurred during heavy rain in the region.

November 29, 2024 - Four Myanmar and two Thai workers were killed in Samut Sakhon province, south of the capital Bangkok, in an accident at a construction site of an elevated motorway. Six people were also injured in the incident when a concrete segment and crane collapsed during construction of the highway.

March 29, 2024 - Seven people were killed and several injured, including one who lost a limb, after a crane collapsed at a construction site of a Chinese-run steel factory in Rayong province in eastern Thailand.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 13:43:32 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HSMOXBN5CNM2JF7OVH3XTS7ZEM.jpg?auth=e7408cd0dd5cc9d3e37fd53358a7b9a2c171197fb04cdc4a9752af168c584f41&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Germany open to deepening ties with Syrian government, says Berlin</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/germany-open-deepening-ties-with-syrian-government-says-berlin-2026-01-14/</link><description>BERLIN, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Germany is open to deepening relations with the new Syrian government, a German government spokesperson said, adding that Berlin is closely monitoring the situation in the country.

"The German government is, of course, open to deepening relations and a fresh start with the new Syrian government," said the spokesperson at regular government press conference.

The spokesperson added that Berlin is closely monitoring the situation in the Syrian city of Aleppo , where deadly clashes broke out recently, also in close consultation with Damascus.

"The situation in Syria is such that it needs to be reassessed almost daily," the spokesperson said on Wednesday.

"I wouldn't want to give a new assessment of a specific situation at this moment. But I think we will have the opportunity to discuss this in more detail in the coming days."

Germany's Bild newspaper, citing security and government source, reported on Tuesday that Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa is expected to visit Berlin early next week.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 13:43:39 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/RFXNHNONARIGLEWYC53SBQCEII.jpg?auth=b85f526e41a7f3507a0a06d7c6312a1fcca548ba902661b7f6d2f8d3d8e1f5ae&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Major construction-linked accidents in Thailand</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/major-construction-linked-accidents-thailand-2026-01-14/</link><description>BANGKOK, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Dozens of people were killed on Wednesday after a crane collapsed onto a moving train in northeastern Thailand, in the latest in a series of construction accidents in recent years.

"The United States needs Greenland for the purpose of National Security. It is vital for the Golden Dome that we are building," Trump, who has vowed to seize the Arctic island from ally Denmark, wrote on social media.

" NATO becomes far more formidable and effective with Greenland in the hands of the UNITED STATES. Anything less than that is unacceptable."

Trump's post came early on a day when top Danish and Greenlandic diplomats were to visit the White House for talks on Greenland with Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio .

Hours before the meeting was due to start, Danish Defence Minister Troels Lund Poulsen sought to ease US concerns about security in Greenland, telling AFP that Denmark was boosting its military presence there and was in talks with allies on "an increased NATO presence in the Arctic".

Trump for his part said that NATO "should be leading the way" in building the multi-layer missile defence system.

"IF WE DON'T, RUSSIA OR CHINA WILL, AND THAT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN!" Trump wrote.

The US leader has repeatedly threatened to take over the vast, strategic and sparsely populated Arctic island, and he has sounded emboldened since ordering a deadly January 3 attack in Venezuela that removed its president.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 13:47:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/2af79eea-f148-11f0-a393-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25140745248832.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item></channel></rss>
