Asked about the request and Russia's response, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov declined further comment.

Ukraine has said it will reciprocate if Russia forgoes strikes on the country's energy infrastructure amid a period of bitterly cold weather.

The next round of trilateral peace talks between Russia, Ukraine and the United States were set to take place in Abu Dhabi on Sunday, but Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Friday the date or location could change.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 10:37:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ARAE2LIGVBKO7AOC6QUEEMUPEI.jpg?auth=19bebc611f3d8d2e4dc2e5913fb325f9ac55d14b4d3917693dfb2f79c6041219&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US military destroyer docks at Israel's Eilat port, Israeli media reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-military-destroyer-docks-israels-eilat-port-israeli-media-reports-2026-01-30/</link><description>JERUSALEM, Jan 30 (Reuters) - A U.S. Navy destroyer has docked at the Israeli port of Eilat, Israel's Ynet news website reported on Friday, citing the military, as tensions between Washington and Iran escalate.

Ynet said the arrival of the destroyer at the southern port on the Gulf of Aqaba, near Israel's borders with Egypt and Jordan, was pre-planned and part of ongoing cooperation between the U.S. and Israeli militaries.

The U.S. Navy and Israeli military did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

The deployment comes as U.S. President Donald Trump signalled he was open to talks with Iran, even as Washington dispatched additional military assets to the Middle East.

A U.S. defence official told Reuters the military could not discuss operational details for security reasons, adding that the safety of service members was the top priority.

Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth said the U.S. military was prepared to carry out whatever course of action the president decides.

Trump has warned Iran to return to negotiations over its nuclear programme or face far harsher U.S. action, while Tehran has threatened retaliation against the United States, Israel and their allies.

Trump has also said the U.S. has an "armada" heading towards Iran, though he said he hoped it would not be used.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 10:38:56 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US military destroyer docks at Israel's Eilat port, Israeli media reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-military-destroyer-docks-israels-eilat-port-israeli-media-reports-2026-01-30/</link><description>JERUSALEM, Jan 30 (Reuters) - A U.S. Navy destroyer has docked at the Israeli port of Eilat, Israel's Ynet news website reported on Friday, citing the military, as tensions between Washington and Iran escalate.

"Within hours of Russian drones with Starlink connectivity appearing over Ukrainian cities, the Ministry of Defence team promptly contacted SpaceX and proposed ways to resolve the problem," Fedorov said on social media.

"I'm grateful to SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell and personally to Elon Musk for their swift response."

Fedorov and the US-based Institute for the Study of War said earlier this week that the Russian army used Starlink satellites to guide its drone attacks deep into Ukraine.

Russia has been battering the country's energy grid as temperatures tumble below freezing and the invasion's fourth anniversary looms.

The ISW said that "Russian forces are increasingly using Starlink satellite systems to extend the range of BM-35 strike drones to conduct mid-range strikes against the Ukrainian rear".

Starlink is also widely used by the Ukrainian army for communications.

"Elon Musk's decision to urgently activate Starlink and send the first batch of terminals to Ukraine at the start of the full-scale invasion was critically important for our country's resilience," Fedorov said.

"Western technologies must continue to support the democratic world and protect civilians, not be used for terror and the destruction of peaceful cities."</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 10:44:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/76edd494-fdc4-11f0-bda8-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-14T113541Z-1679002033-RC2X0JAZHQ92-RTRMADP-3-UKRAINE-CRISIS-MINISTERS-DEFENCE.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Syria, Kurdish-led SDF reach integration deal after weeks of clashes</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260130-syria-kurdish-led-sdf-reach-integration-deal-after-weeks-of-clashes</link><description>Syria 's government and Kurdish forces reached a comprehensive agreement on Friday that included the gradual integration of the Kurds' forces and administration into the central state, following weeks of clashes between the two sides that led to a ceasefire .

The agreement, shared by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces and Syrian state television, came after the Kurds lost control of swathes of territory to government forces during weeks of fighting.

They now find themselves restricted to Kurdish-majority areas, having once held sway over much of north and northeastern Syria.

The agreement stipulates that government forces will enter the Kurdish-controlled cities of Hasakeh and Qamishli in the northeast, while three Syrian army brigades will be created out of the SDF.

Damascus and the SDF on Sunday extended their ceasefire for 15 days while pursuing talks on integration.

Syria's new Islamist authorities, who took over after the ousting of longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad in December 2024, are seeking to extend state control across Syria.

Syrian security forces will "be deployed in the cities of Hasakeh and Qamishli" in the northeast, currently controlled by Kurdish forces, while a separate brigade will be created for the Kurdish-majority town of Kobane in the north.

The agreement deals a blow to the Kurdish minority's hopes for self-rule, after having established a de facto autonomous administration in areas under their control during Syria's 13-year civil war.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 10:44:49 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/c02ce11c-fdc0-11f0-8134-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/000-93TV363-1.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Viktor Orban’s vampiric presence in Transylvania</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260130-viktor-orban-s-vampiric-presence-in-transylvania-romania-hungary-szekely</link><description>“I refuse to say that I'm from Romania or Hungary , I just will not say that,” states 25-year-old Dalma. “So I always say, ‘I'm from Transylvania, comma, Romania'.”

Dalma is keen to set the record straight: she was born into a Hungarian family in the Szekely Land, a sub-region of Transylvania. She is Romanian by nationality, but she grew up immersed in Hungarian culture and language . She therefore sees herself first and foremost through this identity: Hungarian, from Transylvania, in Romania.

In her home region, Dalma's case is far from isolated: the Szekely Land is home to more Hungarians than Romanians. Some villages are even exclusively Hungarian-speaking, while larger cities are bilingual. In Dalma’s native town of Targu Mures, known in Hungarian as Marosvasarhely, street names, signs and inscriptions at building entrances are all in both languages.

“I feel Romanian, Transylvania is a part of Romania,” says Radu, a 24-year-old medical student who also grew up in Targu Mures, in a Romanian family. He considers himself “100% Romanian” and like many Romanians in the region, he speaks almost no Hungarian, although he does acknowledge that knowing the language would be a significant advantage for practising medicine there.

The presence of a large Hungarian community in Transylvania dates back centuries. And for good reason: until 1920, the region was part of Hungary. At the end of World War I , the Treaty of Trianon was signed in Versailles, marking the dismantling of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Thus the Kingdom of Hungary lost part of its territory, and a large number of its Hungarian-speaking citizens, including those in Transylvania.

Today, the two communities cohabit rather peacefully in Transylvania, but some people still feel strongly about the issue. In 2018, several Hungarian parties in the region presented a plan for territorial and cultural autonomy, based on the model of Catalonia in Spain or South Tyrol in Italy. To date, this initiative has not been successful.

“It's a very taboo subject,” says Radu. “We have to respect our minorities, (...) [but] personally I view Transylvania as a part of Romania. I truly believe that Transylvania belongs to Romania.”

In neighbouring Hungary, the highly conservative Viktor Orban continues to present this chapter in Transylvanian history as a gaping wound for his country. Although in many ways a rhetorical tool, the Hungarian prime minister's attachment to Transylvania is also reflected in very real investments in the region, with Hungary financing schools, nurseries, media outlets, places of worship, stadiums, and more.

In 2011, Orban also decreed that it was no longer necessary to reside on Hungarian territory to obtain Hungarian citizenship. Speaking the language and proving one's Hungarian origins have since then deemed sufficient criteria. Following his decree, over one million Hungarians residing abroad, most of them in Romania, obtained citizenship. And along with it, the right to vote…

Dalma also obtained a Hungarian passport, and she is grateful for it. She now lives and works in the Hungarian capital Budapest. But she also views Orban’s measures with skepticism. “When [being granted citizenship] is tied with the idea that (...) ‘I'm giving you the right to vote,’ I think it transfers a different message,” she says.

Even though the votes of the Hungarian diaspora in Transylvania only account for a very small number of seats in the Hungarian Parliament, Orban may seek to stack the odds in his favour by securing them ahead of the next Hungarian parliamentary elections in April 2026.

Meanwhile, some right-wing Romanian politicians are playing the “Romanian patriotism” card to garner voter support, scapegoating minorities, including the large Hungarian minority, for their own political aims.

Faced with these mounting identity issues, where does the new generation stand? Find out more from Dalma and Radu's full testimonials in this new episode of the ENTR series “Growing up in Europe.”

The top military officer at the Civil-Military Command Center, a three-star lieutenant general, is expected to be replaced by a U.S. commander of a lower rank, while the top civilian has returned to his job as U.S. ambassador to Yemen.

The CMCC was set up in October in the first phase of President Donald Trump's plan to end the Gaza war, and is meant to supervise the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, facilitate the entry of aid and shape Gaza policy.

The overhaul in its leadership comes amid what western officials and diplomats say is growing uncertainty over the body's future role, as Trump pursues the next phase of his plan including by setting up a "Board of Peace" of foreign dignitaries to supervise Gaza policy.

Lieutenant-General Patrick Frank, the top commander of U.S. Army forces in the Middle East, has been leading the CMCC in southern Israel since it was established. The U.S. military announced last month that he was being promoted to deputy head of U.S. Central Command.

Four diplomats told Reuters he is expected to leave as soon as next week. The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The State Department said in a statement that the CMCC's civilian lead, career diplomat Steve Fagin, had returned to his post as U.S. Ambassador to Yemen after holding "the transitional role as civilian lead for CMCC". The department did not say who would replace him. The four diplomats said a replacement for Fagin had not yet been announced.

Diplomats have said the centre has failed to increase aid flows or achieve political change, with some U.S. partners now reconsidering their involvement.

Under the first phase of the ceasefire plan, major fighting has been halted, hostages were released in exchange for prisoners and Israeli forces have withdrawn from nearly half of the Gaza Strip.

But the warring sides accuse each other of violations. More than 400 Palestinians and three Israeli soldiers have been killed. The vast majority of Gaza's more than 2 million people now live in a small strip of land outside an Israeli-occupied zone, mostly in makeshift tents or damaged buildings.

Trump has announced the second phase of his plan this month, under which Israel would withdraw further and Hamas would relinquish day-to-day control to an internationally backed administration.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 11:29:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/6FYCIHXBDVNUTMR5LXGPVYEIUU.jpg?auth=b0fc3d6b0d28740ad82a2b1482dba19b86cd2bd52b9f41f56afb289e6fb52894&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Nationwide protests, walkouts planned over fatal ICE shootings in Minneapolis</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/nationwide-protests-walkouts-planned-over-fatal-ice-shootings-minneapolis-2026-01-30/</link><description>MINNEAPOLIS, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Student organizers have called for walkouts and protests across the United States on Friday to demand that federal immigration agents withdraw from Minnesota, after two fatal shootings of U.S. citizens generated public outrage.

The call for a general strike follows last Friday's protests when thousands marched through Minneapolis in the bitter cold, urging an end to President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown in their city.

Protesters said they want to step up pressure even after Trump said he would "de-escalate a little bit" in Minnesota.

"We want this to be more of a sustained movement, so going forward: more striking, more protesting," Brianna Jackson, part of the Black Student Union at the University of Minnesota, said in a video promoting the strike.

On Thursday, U.S. border czar Tom Homan, newly installed as leader of Trump's immigration enforcement surge in Minneapolis, said federal officers would focus on targeted operations , shifting away from the broad street sweeps.

Newly issued internal guidance from a high-ranking official of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency directs federal officers to refrain from unnecessary communication and engagement with "agitators" to avoid "inflaming the situation."

"No work. No school. No shopping. Stop funding ICE," ran a slogan on the website nationalshutdown.org that listed 250 sites for Friday's protests across 46 states and in major cities such as New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Washington.

Voters ousted the Democrats from the White House and returned Trump to power in 2024 partly out of frustration with a surge in illegal immigration to the United States.

But after weeks of videos showing aggressive tactics by heavily armed and masked officers in Minneapolis, American approval of Trump's immigration policy has fallen to its lowest in his second term, a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll showed.

A majority of respondents said his crackdown had gone too far.

A day after last Friday's protests, immigration officers shot and killed Alex Pretti, 37, an intensive care nurse at a hospital for military veterans.

Many people were already upset at the shooting death of Renee Good, 37, a mother of three, in her car on January 7.

Good and Pretti had been monitoring immigration officers, as part of a movement that enabled witnesses to capture both shootings on cellphone video.

At a memorial at the site where Pretti was killed, a woman laid a bouquet of flowers and quietly wept on Thursday, saying she felt moved to protest in his memory.

"I’m absolutely not spending any money tomorrow," said Stacy, who asked that her last name not be used. "It’s my little way of being a voice for those who don’t have them, like Alex."

In the southern state of Georgia, students at 90 high schools from Atlanta to Savannah plan to walk out of class on Friday.

"We are saying no business as usual while ICE is allowed to terrorize our communities," said Claudia Andrade, an immigrant rights organizer with Atlanta's Party for Socialism and Liberation.

On the eve of the protests, police in Washington, D.C., arrested 54 demonstrators of different religious affiliations who sat on the floor at the Hart Senate Office Building, holding banners that read "Do Justice, Love kindness, Abolish ICE."

They were demanding that the U.S. Senate withhold funding to the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 11:30:21 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CIXUNSPISNLHRBUQ6WEVRKIH64.jpg?auth=3cb69237ca95085993dc78ba657f0f0262406d97b180cec7be3d01a5cb006b8e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Patagonia wildfires stir criticism over Milei austerity cuts</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/patagonia-wildfires-stir-criticism-over-milei-austerity-cuts-2026-01-30/</link><description>BUENOS AIRES, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Patagonia forest fires have destroyed an area more than twice the size of Buenos Aires, stirring criticism over austerity measures under President Javier Milei that have significantly cut aid resources.

On Thursday, the government said it would declare an emergency in the southern provinces of Chubut, Rio Negro, Neuquen and La Pampa to help unlock funds.

Wildfires are common in Patagonia during the summer months, but the current fires have breached Los Alerces National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage site famed for its alerce trees, which can live more than 3,600 years, making them the world's second-longest-living tree species.

The current forest fires are concentrated in the province of Chubut, where firefighters are battling strong winds and high temperatures. The government of Chubut has said that more than 110,000 acres (44,515 hectares) have been destroyed so far. The first forest fires of the season began in December.

Milei’s government has pursued aggressive fiscal tightening dubbed "chainsaw" spending cuts and environmental groups have criticized budget cuts that have significantly reduced funding for wildfire prevention and response.

Argentina's 2026 budget slashed funding for the National Fire Management Service by 71% in real terms compared with the previous year, according to FARN, a local non-profit group.

"These fires are absolutely predictable," said Ariel Slipak, an economist at FARN, adding that Milei's government had prioritized a balanced budget over emergency funds "at all costs."

Argentina's Ministry of Security on Thursday said it would allocate about $69 million to support fire fighting efforts.

Milei has previously referred to climate change as a "socialist lie," drawing criticism from environmental activists.

His government has said it is also considering withdrawing from the Paris Agreement, the world's main climate pact, following the example of U.S. President Donald Trump, a close ally of Milei, who exited the accord this year.

"To continue denying or underestimating the effects of climate change, which science and the ecological movement have long warned about, is a political irresponsibility that will be paid for by forests and homes," Hernan Giardini of Greenpeace in Argentina in a statement.

The burned area has already surpassed the roughly 80,000 acres (32,374 hectares) of Patagonian forest scorched during last summer’s fire season, according to Greenpeace.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 11:30:33 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/JSO6AFSNUVPJVBRVXET3XFVKKY.jpg?auth=bb3d5d274d83dd8556497c2065f8aec6208fc527a9b3436357da0312498ae23c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Sudanese paramilitary force abducting children in Darfur, witnesses say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/sudanese-paramilitary-force-abducting-children-darfur-witnesses-say-2026-01-30/</link><description>Jan 30 (Reuters) - Paramilitary fighters kidnapped children during their takeover of the Sudanese city of al-Fashir in October and in other attacks in the Darfur region over the course of Sudan's civil war, in some cases killing their parents first, witnesses say.

The descriptions, based on Reuters interviews with more than two dozen witnesses, included four accounts of fighters from the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) telling families the children would be used as slaves, to herd animals.

The RSF has been locked in war with Sudan's army since April 2023 over which side will run a country endowed with rich mineral reserves, plentiful arable land and Red Sea ports. While human rights groups have reported alleged war crimes by both sides including the recruitment of child combatants, the abduction and enslavement of children by the RSF and allied militias has not been previously reported by other media.

The 26 witnesses spoke to Reuters in person or by phone after fleeing to the North Darfur town of Tawila or to eastern Chad. They described 23 separate incidents in which at least 56 children aged between two months and 17 years were abducted in attacks dating back to 2023.

Six described their own relatives being taken.

Reuters could not determine how many children in total have been abducted, and could not independently verify the witness accounts or trace what happened to the children after they were taken.

The RSF did not respond to requests for comment about the reported abductions and abuse of minors and killing of their parents. Previously it has denied deliberately targeting civilians and says it has placed fighters suspected of abuses under investigation.

Three legal experts said the abductions may constitute unlawful imprisonment and torture, and amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity.

The accounts gathered by Reuters may also constitute acts of enslavement and slave trading that violate international laws and multiple international treaties, said one of the experts, Patricia Sellers, an international lawyer and former special adviser for slavery crimes at the International Criminal Court.

Sheldon Yett, head of U.N. children's agency UNICEF in Sudan, said he had not received any reports of children being kidnapped specifically to be used as slaves or to tend to livestock, but said the accounts gathered by Reuters "are sadly consistent with the broader pattern of grave violations we continue to see against children". He did not elaborate.

The RSF evolved from the so-called Janjaweed militias that fought alongside government forces under the rule of former Sudanese leader Omar al-Bashir and were accused of genocide in Darfur in the early 2000s. During that conflict, the Janjaweed abducted children and forced them to do domestic work, look after livestock, or work as sex slaves, according to reports at the time by activists and human rights groups.

Asked for comment on the witness accounts of abductions during the current war, the Sudanese army said such acts were "consistent with those of the Janjaweed militia during the previous regime."

Sudan's army-backed government "cannot accept leaving citizens hostage to the militias' violence," it said in a statement to Reuters.

The RSF has previously denied responsibility for atrocities blamed on its fighters in Darfur.

The war has killed tens of thousands of people and led to famine and disease, in what the United Nations has called the world's largest humanitarian crisis. The RSF and its allies have been blamed for mass killings against ethnic non-Arabs.

In late October the RSF consolidated its grip over Darfur when it took al-Fashir, a city that had sheltered many displaced people and which the paramilitary force had attacked and besieged for 18 months. Witnesses accused it of abuses including summary killings .

During a briefing at the U.N. Security Council on January 20, deputy ICC prosecutor Nazhat Shameem Khan said her office was investigating alleged crimes committed by the RSF in al-Fashir, with a particular focus on violence against women, girls, and children.

Khan said that based on the evidence collected so far, her office believes war crimes and crimes against humanity occurred in the city in late October during the culmination of the RSF's siege of al-Fashir.

The RSF did not respond to a request for comment on Khan's assertion.

In most cases, the witnesses described RSF fighters taking children whose parents had recently been killed, at gunpoint or after beating the children.

In some cases, six witnesses said, the children had seen their parents being killed.

Ten witnesses interviewed by Reuters in Chad described RSF fighters abducting children during the takeover of al-Fashir.

Abductions took place in the city and along the road to Tawila, a town about 50 km (31 miles) to the west where the U.N. estimates approximately 665,000 displaced people are sheltering, the witnesses said.

Madina Adam Khamis, 38, said she was held captive at al-Fashir University with other women and children after they tried to flee the city on October 26.

At the university she said she watched an RSF fighter known as Abu Lulu shoot many of the captives, including a woman seven months pregnant, and 10 children.

She said Abu Lulu and his group of fighters took three girls and two boys aged between two and five years old, whose mothers they had killed, and put them in the back of a Toyota Land Cruiser. Another fighter took a 2-month-old baby from the arms of one of the girls and sat in the vehicle with the baby as well, she said. She said the children were from al-Fashir, but did not know their names.

"There was one child who lost her mother, the mother died in front of our eyes, and the child was touching her mother to try to get her to wake up," Khamis said.

Reuters could not independently corroborate Khamis' account.

The RSF told Reuters in December that Abu Lulu was in its custody and it was investigating him and several other RSF soldiers regarding abuses committed in the aftermath of the takeover of al-Fashir.

In the wake of the RSF seizing the city, videos online showing Abu Lulu shooting dead unarmed captives, some of which have been verified by Reuters, gained global attention.

The RSF did not respond to a Reuters request to speak to Abu Lulu.

Mohammed Adam Bashir, 38, said he saw RSF fighters take two boys of around four to five years old and a girl of about three years old, after shooting their mothers dead, as he was fleeing north from al-Fashir to Torro village on October 26. He said the fighters put the children in the back seat of an armoured Land Cruiser.

"They pulled the children away from their two mothers who were dying," he said. "They took them to the car and then they came back to ask us for money."

None of the witnesses interviewed by Reuters saw what happened after children were taken. One, Abdulmajeed Abdulkarim, 28, said he heard children crying for their parents at night while he was being held captive in a bush area close to the village of Garney in the days after al-Fashir fell.

Researchers who have interviewed people displaced by the violence in Darfur collected similar testimonies.

A report last month by Amnesty International documented the account , opens new tab of one child who said he was abducted by RSF fighters in Zamzam displacement camp close to al-Fashir, and forced to work.

He said he was chained at night and forced to herd sheep by day for more than six weeks.

His captor called his relatives to demand a ransom of five million Sudanese pounds ($1,500). After they paid, he was released, Amnesty said.

Reuters, which didn't independently verify Amnesty's findings, has previously reported that the RSF has held large groups of adult survivors from al-Fashir for ransom. An RSF adviser said at the time that rivals disguised in RSF uniforms were responsible for most such cases.

Seven witnesses who spoke to Reuters said fighters referred to the children they took as "falungiat", or children of falungi, a term that roughly translates to house slaves and is used as a derogatory term for allies of the Sudanese army.

The witnesses, who were mainly from the Zaghawa tribe, said fighters from the RSF's Arab-dominated force addressed them with racial slurs. The RSF did not respond to a question about possible racial motivations for the abductions.

Several of the witnesses described the RSF taking children alongside seized livestock. Four said RSF fighters told them the children would be used to look after animals - a role commonly assigned to children in the region.

Sixteen witnesses described abductions that took place before the takeover of al-Fashir.

Imam Ali, 26, said he fled besieged al-Fashir in March 2025 with his family and was attacked southeast of Tawila by RSF fighters who arrived with camels, motorcycles, and a car. The fighters shot two of his brothers and abducted the other two, aged 15 and 13, along with 60 of their sheep, he said. He hasn't heard from the kidnapped brothers since.

Fatima Yahya, 47, said she left Nyala, the capital of South Darfur, in October 2023, and was stopped by a group of RSF fighters in a village called Karamaje, as she fled to al-Fashir with other families.

There the fighters blindfolded two boys and one girl of about nine years old and put the children in the middle seats of three double-cabin Land Cruisers, with two fighters on either side, she said. She said she did not know the children but that they were from Nyala, and two had lost their mothers in bombardments there.

"They told us the kids would look after the animals," Yahya said.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 11:30:44 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/D5MLLLLLCROITKTMZ3DAT4DVBM.jpg?auth=63c41339ecd28b16fdf69f7cbd94a499ff33f71da4263ae3a498aca861d7a426&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US energy assistance for Ukraine stalls as winter bites</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-energy-assistance-ukraine-stalls-winter-bites-2026-01-30/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 30 (Reuters) - U.S. and European officials are growing increasingly worried as hundreds of millions of dollars in U.S. energy assistance promised to Ukraine remain unreleased, even as a bone-cold winter pushes the nation's war‑damaged power grid to the brink, said several sources familiar with the matter.

The funds in question were originally slated to help Ukraine import liquefied natural gas and rebuild energy infrastructure damaged by Russian strikes, said the sources, who include a U.S. official and a Ukrainian official. The U.S. Agency for International Development had notified Congress during former President Joe Biden's administration of its intention to disburse at least some of the funds, said two of the sources, who requested anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.

After USAID was effectively shuttered in the opening weeks of the Trump administration, however, some of the funds fell into what the sources described as bureaucratic limbo.

Some administration officials have argued for the State Department - which oversees what is left of USAID - to disburse the funds, the sources said. Others have instead pushed for a role for the Development Finance Corporation, a previously obscure federal agency expected to play a major role in Ukraine's reconstruction.

The Trump administration has paused or delayed Ukraine aid before. For example, the U.S. has temporarily halted military aid shipments several times, in some cases to force concessions from Ukraine amid ongoing U.S.-led peace negotiations between Moscow and Kyiv.

This time, the delay in energy aid appears to stem from bureaucratic confusion and infighting instead of an attempt to exert leverage over Ukraine, two of the sources said.

Still, the stalled aid - valued at roughly $250 million by two of the sources - has stirred frustration in recent weeks, as Russian attacks on power plants and pipelines have left millions of Ukrainians exposed to brutal winter cold, according to a Ukrainian official, a U.S. official, a European official and two others with knowledge of the matter.

One source said aides on Capitol Hill were aware of the stalled funds and were seeking additional information.

A Ukrainian official said Kyiv was also aware, but fearful that broaching the topic could provoke diplomatic blowback. U.S. President Donald Trump has at times reacted coolly to Ukrainian requests for assistance.

Halyna Yusypiuk, a spokeswoman for the Ukrainian embassy in Washington, said Ukraine and the U.S. were working closely on energy-related matters.

"(The) Ukrainian and American sides are working on a daily basis to strengthen the stability of Ukraine's energy system," she wrote in an e-mail.

A Development Finance Corporation spokesperson said the agency is "working closely with all interagency partners with the goal of supporting Ukraine's reconstruction efforts and advancing shared economic security and prosperity for the United States and Ukraine."

The White House's Office of Management and Budget, in an apparent reference to a critical USAID inspector general report, suggested energy assistance funds for Ukraine had been misused in the past.

"The Biden Admin support to Ukraine's energy sector was a disaster, we have an USAID IG report showcasing how contractors in Ukraine likely lost millions worth of energy products due to no oversight, corruption, theft, etc," a spokesperson wrote in an email.

"President Trump has done more than anyone to bring peace to this brutal war."

The sweeping changes to the federal bureaucracy imposed by the Trump administration have complicated U.S. efforts to distribute aid to its allies.

The de facto elimination of USAID, for instance, has caused confusion about how and when to disburse funds, several sources told Reuters.

Additionally, the National Security Council, which in previous administrations would sort out conflicts between intelligence, national security and diplomatic agencies, has been radically downsized.

Beyond this, energy assistance for Ukraine has long been slow to go out the door amid concerns about widespread corruption in the nation's power sector, said one source.

Residents of Ukraine's major cities, including Kyiv, are currently struggling with power outages that are lasting hours or days, as well as cuts to heating that leave homes as cold as 45 degrees Fahrenheit (7 degrees Celsius). Water supplies have also been disrupted.

The rumble of generators is a near-constant presence on city streets, which are often plunged into widespread darkness in the evenings. Overnight lows in Kyiv are expected to fall to around -12 Fahrenheit next week.

Ukrainian officials told foreign diplomats in Kyiv in recent days that all of the country's major energy plants had been "damaged or ruined," according to a presentation seen by Reuters. The presentation identified roughly 675 million euros ($807 million) in unfunded energy needs.

"They're preparing for the fact that people in the upper (stories) of apartment buildings are going to freeze to death," Mykola Murskyj, the director of advocacy at Razom, a non-profit group supporting Ukraine, said of next week's expected cold snap.

"They're preparing to retrieve the bodies. It's extremely grim."</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 11:31:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/Q2IYZCGQPFL77DGVIAYNZ2MTWY.jpg?auth=1740058c7d54976ebdada0c6cc97c579f8bb785aea1735ae024e5d44d1be0253&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>South Africa declares Israel's chargé d'affaires persona non grata</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/south-africa-declares-israels-charg-daffaires-persona-non-grata-2026-01-30/</link><description>JOHANNESBURG, Jan 30 (Reuters) - South Africa has declared Israel's chargé d'affaires Ariel Seidman persona non grata, its foreign affairs ministry said on Friday.

Seidman is required to depart from the country within 72 hours, the ministry said in a statement on its website.

It accused Seidman of "unacceptable violations of diplomatic norms and practice which pose a direct challenge to South Africa's sovereignty".

"These violations include the repeated use of official Israeli social media platforms to launch insulting attacks against His Excellency President Cyril Ramaphosa, and a deliberate failure to inform DIRCO (South Africa's foreign affairs ministry) of purported visits by senior Israeli officials," the ministry said.

Israel's diplomatic mission in Pretoria did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Diplomatic relations between South Africa and Israel have been strained by South Africa's genocide case over Israel's actions in Gaza at the International Court of Justice.

His declarations and executive orders have led to the dismantling of slavery exhibits, the restoration of Confederate statues and other moves that civil rights advocates say could reverse decades of social progress.

Here are some actions that Trump has taken to reshape American historical sites and cultural bodies since returning to the White House:

Trump signed an executive order just weeks after taking office targeting what he said was the spread of "anti-American ideology" at the Smithsonian Institution and calling for the ideology's removal from the vast museum and research complex, a premier exhibition space for U.S. history and culture.

The order also directed the Interior Department to restore federal parks, monuments and memorials that had been "removed or changed in the last years to perpetuate a false revision of history."

Last August, Trump decried in a social media post what he said was an excessive focus on " how bad slavery was ." This month, in an interview with the New York Times, he said civil rights protections hurt white people, when asked about policies that followed from the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

The NAACP, the largest U.S. civil rights group, said Trump's remarks were laying the groundwork to roll back social progress. Racial justice group Black Lives Matter said , opens new tab Trump's remarks showed he wanted to deny the atrocities of slavery.

Following Trump's March 2025 executive order on anti-American ideology, the U.S. Interior Department said all national parks' interpretive signage - the plaques and panels that explain sites and events - was under review as the Trump administration attempted to reshape public spaces and museums.

U.S. National Park Service staff subsequently removed a slavery exhibit on January 22 from a Philadelphia historic site where George Washington once lived. The exhibit included a reference to Washington's ownership of enslaved people.

The Washington Post reported that U.S. officials have also ordered national parks to remove dozens of signs and displays related to slavery and the mistreatment of Native Americans by settlers.

The National Park Service said last August it would reinstall a statue of Confederate General Albert Pike that had been toppled and vandalized in 2020 during racial justice protests after George Floyd's murder.

Civil rights groups say such moves undermine the acknowledgment of critical phases of American history. "Stripping enslaved people's stories from museum exhibits, monuments, and digital archives is not neutrality - it is erasure," the NAACP said , opens new tab .

Trump harshly criticized the Smithsonian in a social media post last year, saying it would face the same process as colleges and universities whose funding came under threat for policies that displeased the Trump administration.

The 180-year-old Smithsonian, which includes 21 museums and galleries and the National Zoo, receives most of its budget from the U.S. Congress but is independent of the government in decision-making.

The White House launched an internal review of some Smithsonian museums last year, saying it would assess the tone and historical framing of exhibition text, websites, educational materials and digital content. The Smithsonian said it would engage "constructively."

Trump named himself chairman of the Kennedy Center and filled its board with allies last year. In December, the institution's board voted to rename it the Donald J. Trump and the John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts. Trump has previously criticized the institution as too liberal.

Many groups and artists have since withdrawn from the center, citing the Republican leader's takeover. Democrats, noting that the center's name was established by Congress, have said Trump's rebranding has no force of law. John F. Kennedy's family denounced the renaming as undermining the slain president's legacy.

The Trump administration announced last April that the Environmental Protection Agency would close a one-room museum at its headquarters on the agency's history, citing cost cuts.

Last May, Trump attacked historian Kim Sajet , director of the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, calling her partisan. She announced the following month that she would step down. Late last year, the White House fired several members of the National Council on the Humanities.

Internationally, Trump has withdrawn the U.S. from dozens of global and U.N. entities, including cultural and refugee agencies, saying they do not benefit Washington.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 11:32:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/6SGP5FCPTBLJRND45ZNUP5GTQE.jpg?auth=8a43bd06213796f9cd54deb275bf08ef662c8b86230271a2d76c4b0381839e8b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israel military reported to accept death toll of around 70,000 in Gaza</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-military-reported-accept-death-toll-around-70000-gaza-2026-01-30/</link><description>JERUSALEM, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Israel's military has accepted that around 70,000 Palestinians were killed during the war in Gaza, after having earlier cast doubt on death tolls reported by the enclave's health officials, Israeli media reported on Friday citing senior military officials.

The United Nations has long accepted death tolls recorded by health authorities in Gaza as accurate. Israel has cast doubt on the figures, arguing that the health ministry in the enclave was run by Hamas and could not be trusted.

The Gaza health ministry publishes names and ages of those it records as killed. It now says the toll stands at over 71,000, including more than 480 killed in Israeli attacks since the start of a U.S.-brokered ceasefire in October.

It says many thousands more are still buried beneath the rubble of Gaza's destroyed cities. It does not distinguish between civilians and fighters but has identified most of the dead as women or children.

Citing a briefing on Thursday with senior military officials, Israel's Ynet news website and other leading outlets reported that the military had adopted a similar estimate.

"In our estimation, around 70,000 Gazans were killed during the war, not including missing persons," Ynet cited an official as saying.

"We are currently doing the work of distinguishing between terrorists and those who were not involved," the official was quoted as saying.

Asked for comment, Israel's military said that "the details published do not reflect official (Israel Defence Forces) data."

It added: "Any publication or report on this matter will be released through official and orderly channels."

The October 7, 2023, Hamas attack that triggered the war killed around 1,200 people in Israel, most of them civilians, according to Israeli tallies.

"The return of residents from Egypt to the Gaza Strip will be permitted, in coordination with Egypt, for residents who left Gaza during the course of the war only, and only after prior security clearance by Israel," COGAT said.

The Rafah crossing is effectively the sole route in or out of Gaza for nearly all of the more than 2 million people who live there.

Israel seized the border crossing in May 2024, about nine months into the Gaza war . Reopening it was an important requirement under the first phase of U.S. President Donald Trump 's plan to stop fighting between Israel and Hamas militants, which followed a ceasefire agreed in October.

Israel had said it would reopen it only after recovering the body of the last Israeli hostage in Gaza, which took place this week.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 11:55:02 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/T42RYOAPMRJ3FOMZCTD7N45UM4.jpg?auth=70ae5ac53f776c773138d28e5fac34a94da6f34ee11661ff4080c07873271eb8&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Explainer: How does Iran's system of power work?</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/how-does-irans-system-power-work-2026-01-30/</link><description>Jan 30 (Reuters) - The United States is considering new military strikes against the Islamic Republic of Iran over its deadly suppression of protests this month.

The complexities of Iran's ruling system, the ideological nature of its support base, and the power of its Revolutionary Guards make it hard to predict its resilience or vulnerability in the face of external attack, or what might come next.

The following explains how the system operates and who the main figures are in today's Iran:

Iran's political system is based on the theory of vilayat-e faqih ("rule of the jurist"), which holds that until the return of the Shi'ite Muslim 12th Imam, who disappeared in the ninth century, power on earth should be wielded by a supreme cleric.

The first Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, was the charismatic father figure of the 1979 Islamic Revolution who developed the model of a cleric standing above an elected government.

His successor, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , has cemented that role since becoming leader in 1989. This has ensured he retains the ultimate say on all major policy decisions and has built a parallel system of rule, alongside that of the elected government, staffed with loyalists.

Khamenei's sway has often been wielded through the National Security Council headed by longtime adviser Ali Larijani. Other advisers to Khamenei, including former defence minister Ali Shamkhani and former foreign minister Ali Akbar Velayati, have also played prominent roles.

Khamenei, 86, has not named a successor and it's not clear who would replace him if he was killed or ousted.

His son, Mojtaba Khamenei , has at times been seen as a possible candidate. His predecessor's grandson, Hassan Khomeini, has been another, as have some older senior clerics.

Iran's clerical elite control powerful bodies that extend their influence throughout the political system.

The Assembly of Experts, made up of senior ayatollahs elected every eight years, is the body that appoints the supreme leader. The constitution also gives it power to question and even dismiss a leader, but it has never done so.

The Guardian Council - half appointed by the leader and half by the judiciary chief - can veto laws passed by parliament and disqualify election candidates, a mandate that has been used to block potential critics of Khamenei.

Another clerical body, the Expediency Council, appointed by Khamenei, resolves disputes between the elected parliament and the Guardian Council.

Iran follows Shi'ite interpretations of Islamic sharia law and its judges are also clerics under a judiciary chief named by Khamenei. The current head, Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei, was sanctioned by Western countries for a violent crackdown on protesters in 2009 when he was intelligence minister.

Other influential clerics include Expediency Council head and former judiciary chief Sadiq Larijani, the brother of Ali Larijani; Assembly of Experts and Expediency Council member Mohsen Araki; and Tehran Friday prayer leader Ahmad Khatami.

However, not all clerics - even senior ones - are necessarily supporters of Iran's theocratic system or its current rulers. Some have been dissidents, others like former President Mohammed Khatami have unsuccessfully tried to reform and soften the existing system.

Unlike the ordinary military, which comes under the Defence Ministry in the elected government, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps answers directly to the Supreme Leader.

Formed soon after the revolution, the IRGC's role defending the Islamic system greatly expanded during the 1980-88 war with Iraq and it is now the strongest and best-equipped section of Iran's armed forces.

Over the decades, the Guards have extended their influence through the worlds of politics and business, gaining in power at home and abroad.

The Quds Force, an elite Guards unit, has spearheaded Iran's regional strategy of supporting affiliated Shi'ite groups across the Middle East, most notably in Lebanon and Iraq. That strategy was hard-hit by the U.S. assassination of Quds Force commander Qassem Soleimani in a 2020 air strike in Iraq, and by Israel's pummelling of Lebanon's Hezbollah in a 2024 war.

The Basij militia, a part-time paramilitary force under Guards control, is often used to quell protests inside Iran.

Since the early 2000s, the Guards' economic power has grown as its contracting company Khatam al-Anbiya won projects worth billions of dollars in Iran's oil and gas sector.

The targeted nature of Israeli strikes on senior Guards commanders last year and Hezbollah leaders in 2024 has raised questions over possible Western intelligence penetration in the corps' upper echelons.

However, Guards commander Mohammad Pakpour, his deputy Ahmad Vahidi, the IRGC's naval chief Alireza Tangsiri and current Quds Force commander Esmail Ghaani remain powerful figures.

Iranians elect a president and a parliament to four-year terms. The president appoints a government that handles daily policy within parameters permitted by the Supreme Leader.

During the early years of the Islamic Republic the votes drew mass participation. But Guardian Council restrictions on candidates and a much-disputed election outcome in 2009 undermined trust among many voters, while the Supreme Leader's overarching role has reduced the scope for elected bodies.

President Masoud Pezeshkian, seen as a moderate, was elected in 2024 after a first-round vote with around 40% turnout, and a run-off in which about half the electorate took part. He defeated Saeed Jalili, a Khamenei loyalist and anti-Western hardliner who remains influential.

Pierre Gramegna, managing director of the European Stability Mechanism, said the ESM could give credit lines for defence and would not demand stringent economic reform in return, in part to dispel any stigma that might arise from asking the emergency euro zone fund for money.

"In these times of geopolitical turmoil, which have triggered higher expenditure , defence costs for all countries, we must use the full potential of the ESM," said Gramenga.

He pointed to the use of credit lines for defence for countries in good financial health but whose budgets are stretched, in particular smaller euro zone states.

"We have instruments," he said. "It is in the best interests of Europe ... to use the full potential."

"It is obvious that the relationship between Europe and the United States is becoming more and more bumpy."

Any such financial support would be symbolically important, repurposing a fund set up at the height of the euro zone debt crisis to stave off the collapse of national economies, banks and shore up the currency.

U.S. President Donald Trump's open hostility towards Europe is forcing its political leaders to scour for alternative means of defending the region against Russian aggression .

Gramegna's remarks suggest a willingness to use the vast European reserve to reinforce euro zone countries, in particular smaller Baltic nations bordering Russia, although loans first need to be signed off by the 21 euro zone countries backing the ESM.

Only countries in the euro zone could get the loans, excluding those who do not use the currency, such as Poland. The ESM makes no explicit mention of defence in its mission and any such shift would require the blessing of member states, including from militarily neutral countries like Austria, Cyprus, Malta or Ireland.

Europe's attempts to boost its defences, four years after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine , have taken on greater urgency since Trump threatened trade tariffs on countries that rejected his claim on Greenland, a Danish territory.

Gramegna hinted at a potential role for the ESM, which was set up during the debt crisis to lend to countries such as Greece but has since become largely redundant.

"It is one of our instruments," he said, referring to using so-called precautionary credit lines for defence. "It's available. We need to rediscover the potential of that instrument."

"You need to guarantee that this facility ... has to be used for defence expenditure," he said, adding that it would not come with draconian terms. "The whole goal here is to avoid that this type of tool is combined with restructuring of the economy."

His comments breathe fresh life into a "defence support line" earlier suggested by former Italian prime minister Enrico Letta to lend up to 2% of a country's economic output at low interest rates for defence.

Gramegna's proposal mirrors an ESM crisis support scheme worth up to 240 billion euros set up during the COVID pandemic to help countries spend on healthcare. That ultimately remained unused.

The Baltic states of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia could stand to benefit. They have almost quadrupled spending on defence since Russia invaded Ukraine to roughly 5% of their economic output, borrowing heavily to cover the bill.

Those countries, which border Russia and its close ally Belarus, have suffered an increasing number of sabotage attacks that law enforcement agencies blame on Russia.

They borrowed billions of euros from the EU's oversubscribed SAFE loans scheme for defence projects, where the EU jointly borrows money on the market to lend it on at cost to EU governments for defence. ESM support would work similarly.

If set up like the pandemic support, the loans would have considerable weight across the EU. Estonia had a gross domestic product of roughly 40 billion euros in 2024 - 2% of that would be less than 1 billion euros.

Gramegna said countries could make "collective requests", which would avoid any stigma attached to asking for assistance from the ESM. "The impetus has to come from the member countries," he said.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 12:57:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/JXZE2EW2YNPFDPMBNAPWZVORYY.jpg?auth=23527f4d4cbd3a75700fe14100cc37011f38e922dade381ab3362f7f65c8c780&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China to lift restrictions on UK lawmakers, PM Starmer says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/china-lift-restrictions-uk-lawmakers-pm-starmer-says-2026-01-30/</link><description>SHANGHAI, Jan 30 (Reuters) - China is set to lift restrictions which it had imposed on a group of British lawmakers, Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on Friday, meaning that they will now be free to travel to China.

Starmer made the announcement during his four-day visit to China , the first by a UK leader in eight years, aimed at improving relations despite ongoing concerns over espionage, human rights and other issues.

The Prime Minister told the BBC that he raised the issue of sanctioned lawmakers with China's President Xi Jinping, who responded that "restrictions no longer apply".

"President Xi said to me that means all parliamentarians are free to travel to China," Starmer said. "One of the benefits of engaging is to not only seize the opportunities, but to raise those difficult sensitive issues."

In 2021, China imposed sanctions on nine Britons, including Iain Duncan Smith, the former leader of the Conservative Party, accusing them of spreading what it called "lies and disinformation" about alleged human rights abuses in Xinjiang.

Starmer's spokesperson said Britain would not be lifting sanctions on Chinese individuals in return for the lifting of restrictions on the British parliamentarians.

Some of the group of sanctioned British lawmakers said in a statement responding to the possible lifting that they would rather remain under sanction than have their status used as a "bargaining chip" to justify the removal of Chinese officials from Britain's sanctions list.

"We would reject any deal that prioritises our personal convenience over the pursuit of justice for the Uyghur people," the group, which includes former security minister Tom Tugendhat, said in a statement.

China last year lifted sanctions on members of the European Parliament and its human rights subcommittee.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 12:57:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/FLTBWQC2WRL5RJ26UU2FDNHR3A.jpg?auth=f3e6c59ee89154254ea80ce89c86cbbbfa2ab525c24266c9e63431137f4485fd&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran to label EU armed forces as 'terrorists' over Guards blacklist</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-label-eu-armed-forces-terrorists-over-guards-blacklist-2026-01-30/</link><description>Jan 30 (Reuters) - Iran plans to designate the armed forces of European Union countries that have blacklisted the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as "terrorists", according to a post by top Iranian security official Ali Larijani on X.

"I have known Kevin for a long period of time, and have no ‌doubt that he will go down as one of the GREAT Fed Chairmen, maybe the best. On top of everything else, he is 'central casting, and he will never let you down," Trump said in announcing his latest move to put his stamp on a Fed he persistently criticizes for not caving to his demands for deep reductions in borrowing costs.

U.S. stock index futures pared declines after Trump's announced pick of Warsh, who markets perceive as someone who would support lower rates but who would stop well short of the more aggressive easing associated with some of the other potential nominees.

Trump announced the nomination, which requires confirmation by the U.S. Senate, in a post on social media. No public events have been listed on the president's schedule for Friday involving the ‌Fed.

The Fed has long been seen as a stabilizing force in global financial markets due in no small part to its perceived independence from politics.

Trump's escalating efforts to test ​that independence, including his Justice Department's decision earlier this month to open a criminal probe into Powell, have set the stage for a challenging Senate confirmation process for any successor.

Republican U.S. Senator Thom Tillis has said he will not support any of Trump's Fed nominees amid the ongoing probe , while fellow Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski has called for an investigation into the department's actions.

It has also opened the door to the possibility that Powell, who called the criminal probe a pretext to pressure ‍the Fed into setting monetary policy as the president wishes, may opt to stay on at the Fed as a governor even after his term as central bank chief is up in a bid to safeguard it from political capture.

The nomination caps a months-long process that often resembled a public audition as Warsh, White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett and other top contenders - including sitting Fed governor Christopher Waller and Wall Street insider Rick Rieder - appeared regularly on television to tout their credentials and showcase their thoughts about the economy and Fed policy.

Trump in August named ⁠White House economic adviser Stephen Miran to fill a vacant governor's seat on the Fed, where he has become a leading proponent of the aggressive rate cuts that Trump has long sought. Trump has also tried to force out Fed Governor Lisa Cook in ‍a battle now before the Supreme Court that, if successful, would mark the first time a president has ever fired a U.S. central bank policymaker.

While Warsh is no White House insider, he has been a confidant of ‌the president and ‌a guest at the president's Florida estate, and looks poised to push many of Trump's priorities as a "shadow" Fed chief until Powell's tenure in the top job ends in mid-May.

A lawyer and distinguished visiting fellow in economics at Stanford University's Hoover Institution, Warsh has said he believes the president is right to press the central bank for steep rate cuts, and has criticized the Fed for underestimating the inflation-busting potential of productivity growth supercharged by artificial intelligence.

He has also called for a broad overhaul of the central bank that would slim its balance sheet and ease bank regulations.

Warsh, 55, was nearly named to the job in Trump's first term before being passed over for Powell, and since then has kept a steady ⁠public profile through speeches and essays that have taken Powell ⁠and his colleagues to task for their management of ​the Fed's balance sheet, interest rates and other actions.

He now will be responsible for an institution he has said should scale back its footprint in the economy and change the way it manages monetary policy.

It is not clear how the pick may affect the trajectory of rates in the short term. The Fed's three rate cuts in 2025 brought its benchmark interest rate to the 3.50%-3.75% range. Earlier this week, citing stronger growth and a stabilizing labor market, it left rates on hold and signaled a pause ahead; ‍markets for now don't expect another rate cut until the June 16-17 meeting, when Powell's successor is expected to be in place.

With a background on Wall Street, including as a partner in the office managing the wealth of investing giant Stanley Druckenmiller, and family ties to major Trump supporter Ron Lauder, Warsh will be under an intense spotlight to prove his independence from the president.

As a Fed governor from 2006 to 2011, Warsh's familiarity with Wall Street executives and investors made him a chief liaison to the financial community for then-Fed Chair Ben ​Bernanke during the 2007-2009 financial crisis.

Though he did not dissent against the massive bond purchases Bernanke used to nurse the economy out of ‍what proved a long downturn, he was concerned they would stoke inflation and eventually resigned. Warsh's inflation concerns proved misplaced, but the large size of the Fed's balance sheet, and the role it plays in managing interest rates, remain a concern.

He now argues that shrinking the Fed's big balance ​sheet would allow it to "redeploy" excess liquidity in financial markets to the real economy by lowering the central bank's policy rate.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 12:59:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/Y3A3YORDCFOP7PZRREBJNTN5BU.jpg?auth=079d675f57424ad7f2ffa023cc031db796e2cea944619453c790a64954f043dd&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump names former Fed governor ‍Kevin Warsh to replace Powell as US ‌central ‍bank head</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260130-trump-names-former-fed-governor-kevin-warsh-to-replace-powell-as-us-central-bank-head</link><description>President Donald Trump on Friday chose former Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh to head the US central bank when Jerome Powell 's leadership term ends in ⁠May, giving a frequent Fed critic a chance to put his idea of monetary policy "regime change" into practice at a moment when the president has pushed for more control over the central bank.

"We have not been able to determine exactly what happened or who was behind the breach but we do believe that the digital domain still is the main suspect," the permanent secretary of the committee that bestows the award told Reuters on Friday.

Bets on Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado winning the prize spiked on October 10, hours before the name of the 2025 laureate was due to be announced in Oslo.

An initial bet was placed on Machado's name to win the prize, rising quickly to some $2.2 million as others followed, Kristian Berg Harpviken said. Machado's name had not been mentioned ahead of time by any of the experts nor the media.

One of Norway's three intelligence agencies was involved in the ensuing investigation of whether there was an internal leak or whether it was the result of spying, either by a criminal actor or a state entity, but it remains unclear who was behind the leak and how it unfolded, Harpviken said.

And while financial bets were placed, it was not known whether the ultimate purpose was to profit from the incident or to inflict damage to the credibility of the prize, he said, adding that the institute's efforts have now turned to preventing future breaches.

Machado won the award for fighting dictatorship in Venezuela and dedicated the award in part to U.S. President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly insisted he deserved to win himself.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 13:59:02 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/NPO5JJN5KNIBLNGGPTW5NPCQVE.jpg?auth=f5aa6d1ef69105fb9668ae78f5d68ce1a1ed51e1ae7c491ff73ae5cb36f8800b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UN chief Guterres warns of 'imminent financial collapse'</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/un-chief-guterres-warns-imminent-financial-collapse-2026-01-30/</link><description>GENEVA, Jan 30 (Reuters) - The U.N. chief has told states that the organisation is at risk of "imminent financial collapse", citing unpaid fees and a budget rule that forces the global body to return unspent money, according to a letter seen by Reuters on Friday.

"The crisis is deepening, threatening programme delivery and risking financial collapse. And the situation will deteriorate further in the near future," United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres wrote in a letter to ambassadors dated January 28.

The U.N. is facing a cash crisis as the world body's largest contributor - the United States - has slashed voluntary funding to U.N. agencies and refused to make mandatory payments to the U.N.'s regular and peacekeeping budgets.

In the letter, Guterres said "decisions not to honour assessed contributions that finance a significant share of the approved regular budget have now been formally announced."

It was not immediately clear which state or states he was referring to and a U.N. spokesperson was not immediately available for comment.

“Either all Member States honour their obligations to pay in full and on time – or Member States must fundamentally overhaul our financial rules to prevent an imminent financial collapse," he said, warning that cash could run out by July.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 13:59:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CFSJJ7WOTZJ5BB3FKZ3LJ37ZCE.jpg?auth=15c3f4bbf40fc19af023fa47c05c4ff62b6ea43232c17cba788286e04e64dc81&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Sudanese man jailed in UK for murdering asylum hotel worker</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/sudanese-man-jailed-uk-murdering-asylum-hotel-worker-2026-01-30/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 30 (Reuters) - A Sudanese asylum seeker was jailed on Friday for a minimum of 29 years for murdering a woman who worked at the hotel in central England where he and other migrants were being housed.

Anti-immigration activists have seized on other criminal cases involving asylum seekers, predominantly young men, in hotels to argue that they are a danger to nearby communities.

Last summer, a number of protests at asylum hotels across England – sparked by the arrest of an Ethiopian asylum seeker for sexually assaulting a teenage girl and a woman – turned violent.

The Labour government, nervous of the rise of the anti-immigration Reform UK party in opinion polls, has promised to clamp down on illegal immigration and, by 2029, to stop placing asylum seekers in hotels while their cases are processed.

Deng Chol Majek followed Rhiannon Whyte, 27, to a railway station in October 2024 after she finished her shift.

He stabbed her 23 times to the head, chest and arm with a screwdriver. She died in hospital three days later.

Majek was convicted in October and sentenced on Friday to life imprisonment with a minimum of 29 years at Coventry Crown Court, where some anti-immigration protesters gathered outside for the hearing.

Judge Michael Soole said the murder was "particularly vicious" and told Majek there had been a "chilling composure in every aspect of your behaviour".</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 13:59:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Denmark plans tougher deportation laws, challenging European human rights framework</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/denmark-plans-tougher-deportation-laws-challenging-european-human-rights-2026-01-30/</link><description>COPENHAGEN, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Denmark said on Friday it would introduce legislation allowing the expulsion of more foreigners including criminals despite the risk of clashing with Europe's human rights court.

In a global hardening of attitudes on asylum and migration issues, various European governments including Denmark have expressed frustration with how the Strasbourg-based European Court of Human Rights has often blocked deportations.

Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said on Friday her centre-right coalition government would act without waiting for the court to revise its interpretation of the European Convention on Human Rights as relates to immigration.

"Some experts might think that we are breaking the convention with this. We see it the other way around," she said at a press conference.

Frederiksen is under pressure from nationalist and anti-immigration parties who are gaining support ahead of an election due by October 31.

"It is because a majority of the countries behind the (rights) convention share Denmark's desire to change the interpretation that we are now tightening further," the prime minister added, acknowledging that could bring legal challenges.

Denmark has in particular criticized rulings by the European court stopping deportations due to family ties.

The proposed reforms, to take effect from May 1 if approved, would increase requirements to deport foreign nationals sentenced to a year or more for serious crimes.

Other plans include introducing electronic tagging for people without residency permits who breach reporting requirements, reopening Denmark's embassy in Syria - the source of many migrants - and appointing a deportation envoy.

Copenhagen also plans to explore a potential first EU reception centre outside the bloc and intensify reviews to revoke refugee permits.

Frederiksen's government has seen a poll boost for its handling of a standoff over U.S. President Donald Trump ´s demands to acquire Greenland but its ratings remain below those of the 2022 election.

Frederiksen, of the Social Democratic Party, took a tougher stance on immigration when she became prime minister in 2019, with coalition partners Moderates and the Liberal Party following her lead.

With a population of around 6 million, Denmark granted asylum to 839 people in the first 11 months of 2025, on track to approve fewer than 1,000 claims in the year for only the fourth time since 1983. Most asylum applicants in recent years have come from Syria, Afghanistan, Eritrea, and Somalia.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 13:59:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5HUJ3Q4NTFNM5NRL2AHWOQ7UY4.jpg?auth=76924ec55e2aa1e4891fb024dc626fb1d6975e7440fdf32ac6b8c9d8af4e7b25&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Panama ports will operate undisrupted after CK Hutchison ruling, president says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/panama-president-says-ports-will-operate-without-disruption-after-court-ruling-2026-01-30/</link><description>PANAMA CITY, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Panamanian President Jose Raul Mulino said on Friday that ports in the country will operate without disruption, despite a Supreme Court decision to annul key port contracts held by a subsidiary of Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison.

The ruling on Thursday left the future operations of some key ports near the Panama Canal unclear.

Mulino said that APM Terminals Panama, a Maersk (MAERSKb.CO) , opens new tab subsidiary, has shown willingness to temporarily take over the operation of the Balboa and Cristobal terminals, following a transition period during which the current operator will stay on.

He said there have been discussions with several companies.

About the process with CK Hutchison, Mulino said during a press conference that he had instructed the Panama Maritime Authority to meet immediately with the Panama Ports Company to coordinate the next steps.

Mulino said there would not be any layoffs.

The Islamic State affiliate in the region has been linked to high-profile attacks in Niger in recent months, killing over a 120 people in strikes targeting the Tillaberi region in September and abducting an American pilot in Octover.

Niger's government said in a statement that the attackers arrived on motorcycles and security forces quickly repelled their advance. In the fighting that ensued, four soldiers were wounded, it said.

Material losses at the airport included a stash of ammunition that caught fire, the government said, and several civilian airplanes that were damaged.

Islamic State described the assault as a "surprise and coordinated attack" that inflicted "significant damage" without providing further details.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 14:42:52 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/RZL4LEIBP5JKDE2L7HCNRGWMDU.jpg?auth=637892b796f22a1292fc206d96c9e8500a9879c7d76aad4532a5ff759d93816e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>New Dutch government plans 'freedom tax' to fund defence spending</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/new-dutch-government-plans-freedom-tax-fund-defence-spending-2026-01-30/</link><description>AMSTERDAM, Jan 30 (Reuters) - The incoming Dutch government plans to add a surcharge to income and corporate taxes to generate around 5 billion euros ($6 billion) per year for increased defence spending, coalition parties said on Friday.

To meet a target set by NATO countries last year, the government aims to increase defence spending to 2.8% of gross domestic product by 2030 and to 3.5% by 2035, compared with around 2% now.

Ultimately, the increase in defence spending would be around 19 billion euros per year, which would be funded by broad budget cuts, including in healthcare and welfare, as well as the tax increment the government has named a freedom tax.

In its coalition agreement presented on Friday, months after the October election, the new government also said it planned to invest in housing, while limiting the government deficit to around 2% of GDP.

"We are charting a new course for our country, with investments aimed at the long term," leader of the D66 party Rob Jetten said.

Earlier this week , Jetten and other political leaders agreed to form a rare minority government in which the centrist pro-EU D66, will team up with the conservative Christian Democrats and right-wing VVD.

This coalition will only hold 66 of the 150 seats in the lower house of parliament, and will need to find support among opposition parties for its proposals.

The main leftwing opposition party said it would strive for more social and greener policies.

As the leader of the new government, Jetten, aged 38, will become the youngest prime minister in Dutch history.

Other cabinet posts will be filled in the coming weeks, and the government is expected to be officially installed within a month.

MSF, which supports and helps staff hospitals in Gaza, is one of 37 international organisations that Israel ordered this month to stop work in the Palestinian territories unless they meet new rules including providing employee details.

The aid groups say sharing such staff information could pose a safety risk, pointing to the hundreds of aid workers who were killed or injured during the two-year Gaza war.

Israel's diaspora ministry, which manages the registration process, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Israel has previously said the registrations were meant to prevent diversions of aid by Palestinian armed groups. Aid agencies dispute that substantial aid has been diverted.

MSF had said last week it would be prepared to share a partial list of Palestinian and international staff who had agreed to release that information, provided the list be used only for administrative purposes and not put its team at risk. It also said it wanted to retain control over the management of medical humanitarian supplies.

"However, despite repeated efforts, it became evident in recent days that we were unable to build engagement with Israeli authorities on the concrete assurances required," MSF said in a statement.

It said there could be a devastating impact on humanitarian services if it is banned from operating in Gaza and the West Bank, amid the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza.

The Ministry of Health in Gaza said in a statement on Friday that it rejected sharing data of health staff working with partner health institutions, saying it threatened the personal safety of workers.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 14:43:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WKF762VVNJKMBI5WSDN2GCAPII.jpg?auth=7f93edb23922d9bb5a2169c98748b1f4b1049eb5a6e988ed3be79349f3058ecd&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Rohingya survivors expect UN's highest court to find Myanmar committed genocide</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/rohingya-survivors-expect-uns-highest-court-find-myanmar-committed-genocide-2026-01-30/</link><description>THE HAGUE, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Rohingya survivors of the 2017 military crackdown in Myanmar expect the International Court of Justice, the United Nations' highest court, to rule the country committed genocide against them, they said on Friday.

A judgment is expected in three-to-six months' time following three weeks of hearings at the court in the Hague that is also known as the World Court.

The outcome of the case will have repercussions beyond Myanmar, including affecting South Africa’s genocide case at the court against Israel over the war in Gaza.

GAMBIA BROUGHT THE CASE

In their final submissions this week, lawyers for Gambia, a mainly Muslim country that brought the case, told the court that the only reasonable conclusion to be drawn from Myanmar's conduct is that it intended to destroy the Rohingya as a group.

Myanmar has denied accusations of genocide and said the 2017 offensive that forced at least 730,000 Rohingya from their homes and into neighbouring Bangladesh was a legitimate counterterrorist operation.

Speaking on Friday on the sidelines of a meeting of survivors of mass atrocities, Yousuf Ali, a 52-year-old Rohingya refugee who says he was tortured by the Myanmar military, said he believed the court would declare a genocide had been committed.

"The world has witnessed us suffering for so many years (... ) how we were deported, how our homes were destroyed and we were killed," he said.

A U.N. fact-finding mission concluded the offensive had included "genocidal acts" and survivors recounted killings, mass rape and arson.

At the international court, Myanmar's lawyers said the fact-finding mission was biased and that its conclusions did not have the standard of proof needed for a finding of genocide.

Gambia's Justice Minister Dawda Jallow asked the court to reject Myanmar's arguments and said a judgment declaring genocide would help to break Myanmar's "cycle of atrocities and impunities".</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 15:35:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/S2772TPVAVPE3JVKCVIDBHO6DE.jpg?auth=00ec33e0dd203b5467d9d0ee128ab8f2f0eb3f22e0172d4a438be644c06fa885&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UN says Houthi seizure of telecom gear threatens Yemen aid</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/un-says-houthi-seizure-telecom-gear-threatens-yemen-aid-2026-01-30/</link><description>GENEVA, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Yemen's Iran‑aligned Houthi paramilitary has removed critical telecommunications equipment belonging to the U.N., the global body said on Friday, warning that further restrictions on its work would fuel a worsening humanitarian crisis

The Houthis, who control areas in north Yemen, entered at least six unstaffed U.N. offices in the capital Sanaa and took telecommunications equipment and several vehicles to an unknown location, the U.N.'s Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Yemen Julien Harneis said in a statement.

"This equipment is part of the minimum infrastructure needed by the United Nations to be present and to implement programmes," said Harneis.

The U.N. has warned of a worsening humanitarian crisis in Yemen with some 21 million people needing aid.

Yemen has suffered 11 years of conflict between the Houthis, who took over the capital Sanaa in 2014 and the internationally-recognised government in Aden. Some 4.8 ‎million people are internally displaced and nearly half a million children need treatment for severe malnutrition.

The situation has been aggravated by economic collapse, disruption of health and education services, political uncertainty and funding cuts, the U.N. previously said.

The Houthis did not immediately respond to a request for comment. They have previously called the work of some U.N. agencies like the World Food Programme a political, military and intelligence operation aimed at subjugating Yemenis.

The U.N. also raised concern of further constraints on aid, stating that the Houthis have not authorized the U.N. Humanitarian Air Service to fly to Sanaa for more than a month, nor the city of Marib, which is controlled by the internationally-recognised government, for more than four months.

These flights are the only way for NGO workers to enter and exit Houthi-controlled areas, Harneis said.

U.N. operations are limited to government-held areas, with U.N. agencies unable to help in Houthi-held areas accounting for about 70% of humanitarian needs, Harneis said.

Staff security is worsening with 73 U.N. colleagues now detained since 2021.

In September the U.N. said it had relocated the base of its resident coordinator for Yemen to Aden, more than a week after at least 18 U.N. personnel were detained in the capital Sanaa, which is controlled by the Houthis.

Houthi officials have previously accused U.N. staff of espionage.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 15:35:43 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4LIRVS5GVBKVRKPNBYKORZ5PC4.jpg?auth=ce24314394136c62681f241f12917ce655717fc2de1842ed697bb091a70fb4e3&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>25 killed in Nigeria's deadliest reported Islamist attack since US Christmas strikes</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/25-killed-nigerias-deadliest-reported-islamist-attack-since-us-christmas-strikes-2026-01-30/</link><description>MAIDUGURI, Nigeria, Jan 30 (Reuters) - At least 25 people were killed when suspected Boko Haram militants attacked a town in northern Nigeria, relatives of victims said, the deadliest reported Islamist attack since U.S. President Donald Trump ordered air strikes on Christmas Day.

The victims were labourers who had travelled to Sabon Gari town in northeastern Nigeria's Borno State to work at a construction site, when gunmen swept in on Thursday and opened fire, relatives Hassan Usman and Auwal Isa told Reuters.

Aliyu Ndume, a senator who represents the region, said he was "shocked and saddened" by the killing of his constituents.

In a separate militant attack, also on Thursday in Borno, at least nine soldiers and two members of a civilian task force assisting them were killed by fighters who launched a pre-dawn assault on an army base. Sixteen people were wounded.

Borno, where Boko Haram and Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) fighters have intensified attacks on military convoys and civilians, remains the epicentre of the 17-year Islamist insurgency.

Nigeria, plagued by Islamist attacks and mass kidnappings, is under additional pressure to restore security since Trump accused it last year of failing to protect Christians. U.S. forces struck what they described as terrorist targets on December 25. The Nigerian authorities say they are cooperating with Washington to improve security.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 15:35:48 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US issues fresh Iran-related sanctions, Treasury Dept website says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-issues-fresh-iran-related-sanctions-treasury-dept-website-says-2026-01-30/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 30 (Reuters) - The United States on Friday issued fresh Iran and counter terrorism-related sanctions, targeting seven Iranian nationals and at least one entity, according to the U.S. Treasury Department's website.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 15:35:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4TNLFG3EIBLJFN4HB2RXOJ3CWU.jpg?auth=fefc35bde85eb161e55c0ca8cdcbd2580fabc846c93fd3b9646856a09a8aec7d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Judge dismisses murder, weapons charges against alleged UnitedHealth CEO killer Mangione</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/judge-dismisses-murder-weapons-charges-against-alleged-unitedhealth-ceo-killer-2026-01-30/</link><description>NEW YORK, Jan 30 (Reuters) - A New York federal judge on Friday dismissed murder and weapons charges against alleged UnitedHealthcare CEO killer Luigi Mangione , a major blow to prosecutors that means Mangione no longer faces a possible death penalty if convicted.

Mangione, 27, previously pleaded not guilty to murder, weapons and stalking charges for allegedly gunning down the CEO of UnitedHealthcare in Midtown Manhattan in 2024. Public officials condemned the shocking killing, but Mangione became a folk hero of sorts to some Americans who decry steep healthcare costs and insurance practices.

U.S. District Judge Margaret M. Garnett in Manhattan said she dismissed the murder and weapons charges because they were legally incompatible with the two counts of stalking Mangione faces.

Garnett previously scheduled jury selection to begin in the case in September.

Mangione has separately pleaded not guilty to murder, weapons and forgery charges in Manhattan state court.

Investigators traced at least 31 crypto transactions from virtual wallets controlled by the suspect to addresses that are suspected of being linked to an entity used by the Islamist group, whose attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, triggered a two-year war in the Gaza Strip.

Hamas is designated as a terrorist organisation by the 27-member European Union and other Western nations.

Police declined to comment on the suspect's possible motives and on whether he had interacted knowingly with Hamas or was just an intermediary, citing the sensitivity of the investigation.

During searches of the suspect's hair salon and home, officers seized cryptoassets, cash, some 9,000 cigars, jewellery, computers and mobile phones, the police said.

They also froze several bank accounts, with the total value of seized and blocked assets exceeding 370,000 euros.

Their investigation began last June during a separate probe into fraud and money laundering, police said.

Authorities have warned in recent years that militant groups are using cryptocurrencies to move funds across borders, complicating efforts to track and disrupt terrorism financing .

The claim of responsibility was contained in a statement on Amaq News Agency, the group's propaganda wing, that said it was “a surprise and coordinated attack” that inflicted heavy losses.

The IS group's affiliate in the region has been linked to high-profile attacks in Niger in recent months, killing over a 120 people in strikes targeting the Tillaberi region in September and abducting an American pilot in October.

Material losses at the airport included a stash of ammunition that caught fire, the government said, and several civilian airplanes that were damaged.

Niger has struggled to contain deadly jihadist violence that has battered parts of Africa’s Sahel region, where neighbouring Burkina Faso and Mali also are run by military juntas.

In 2025, al Qaeda and IS group-backed militants escalated their campaigns in the Sahel, further threatening the stability of the fragile region and of Niger, which was the key security ally of the West in the region until a 2023 military coup.

Niger state television reported that one of the assailants killed was a French national, as footage showed several bloodied bodies on the ground. It provided no evidence.

Niger’s military leader has accused the presidents of France, Benin and Ivory Coast of supporting the armed group behind the attack.

Since seizing power, Niger’s military rulers – along with those in neighbouring Mali and Burkina Faso – have cut ties with France and other Western powers and turned to Russia for military support to fight insurgencies.

The juntas also regularly accuse the presidents of Benin and Ivory Coast, two West African countries that maintain close relations with France, of acting as proxies for Paris.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 15:36:21 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/159395e4-fde7-11f0-8259-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/000-94JQ3CT.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Exclusive: US slows transfers of Islamic State detainees to Iraq, sources say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-slows-transfers-islamic-state-detainees-iraq-sources-say-2026-01-30/</link><description>BAGHDAD Jan 30 (Reuters) - Transfers of Islamic State detainees from Syria to Iraq by the U.S. military have slowed this week, seven sources familiar with the matter said, following calls by Baghdad for other countries to repatriate thousands of foreign jihadists.

The U.S. military said on January 21 it had started to transfer the detainees. Its announcement followed the rapid collapse of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces in northeast Syria, which caused uncertainty about the security of prisons and detention camps they were guarding.

The United States had expected to transfer up to 7,000 fighters to Iraq within days . But more than a week later, only about 500 have been moved, according to two Iraqi judicial officials, two Iraqi security officials and three diplomats, some from countries whose nationals are among those transferred.

An Iraqi foreign ministry official put the number at under 500 so far.

Baghdad asked the U.S. to slow the influx to make time for negotiations with other countries on repatriating their own nationals among the detainees and to prepare additional facilities to host the fighters, the Iraqi officials and a Western diplomat told Reuters.

Those moved to Iraqi facilities so far include about 130 Iraqis and some 400 foreigners, the Iraqi judicial sources, the Iraqi security officials and a Western diplomat said.

The slowdown, which has not previously been reported, is linked to Western governments' reservations about bringing home their own citizens who joined the Islamic State's brutal self-declared caliphate across swathes of Syria and Iraq from 2014.

Most foreign fighters were subsequently captured in Syria and held in prisons in the northeast for years without trial.

The U.S. State Department and the Pentagon did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment on the transfers.

Iraq agreed to host the detainees being moved by the U.S. military after a brief escape by dozens of fighters from one facility in Syria prompted concerns that more could flee, Iraqi government officials said.

But although it has already tried and sentenced dozens of foreign fighters in recent years, Baghdad balked at the prospect of having the full 7,000 in its custody, the officials said.

The influx could overwhelm Iraq’s courts and prisons, and sentencing detainees to death would prompt criticism from Western countries and rights groups, they said.

"It's a trap," one of the senior Iraqi judicial sources said. "These Western countries object to the death penalty, but refuse to receive their terrorists. Why should we bear the burden of being seen as the butcher?"

Responding to questions from Reuters, Hisham al-Alawi, Undersecretary of Iraq's Foreign Ministry for Political Planning, said fewer than 500 detainees had been transferred to Iraq so far.

"For years, Iraq has been urging foreign states to assume their responsibilities by taking back their citizens and dealing with them in accordance with their own laws. While some countries have taken the initiative, a large number of states have not responded to our requests," Alawi said.

The dilemma of what to do with foreign nationals who joined Islamic State has plagued Western countries for the last decade.

Securing guilty verdicts against such detainees in their home countries could be harder than in Iraq, said four diplomats from countries whose nationals were captured in Syria, citing a greater need to prove direct participation in violent crimes.

Governments in such countries could face a public backlash if Islamic State fighters were repatriated and then freed, the diplomats said.

The return of an Islamic State-linked woman to Norway in 2020 caused a cabinet crisis that ultimately brought down the government.

As a result of Western nations' hesitations, thousands of foreign fighters detained in Syria and Iraq remained there for nearly a decade - even though the U.S., which repatriated and tried its nationals, urged other countries to do the same .

The senior Iraqi judicial source said Baghdad was working with the U.S. State Department on increasing pressure on other countries to begin repatriations.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio said after transfers had begun that foreign Islamic State members would be in Iraq temporarily. "The United States urges countries to take responsibility and repatriate their citizens in these facilities to face justice," he said.

Two diplomats from countries with nationals now in Iraq said their governments faced an uncomfortable choice between repatriation - which would be unpopular domestically - and the possibility that their nationals would face the death penalty if tried in Iraq, an outcome that could outrage voters at home.

One of the diplomats said Baghdad had begun conversations with their country about repatriations but that their government's policy was unchanged.

"It would be difficult for us to accept that they are transferred to Iraq if they are then going to get their head chopped off," the second diplomat said.

Letta Tayler, an associate fellow at the International Centre for Counter-Terrorism, said the mass transfer of detainees to Iraq "has mind-boggling legal implications, none of them positive."

It could prolong their indefinite detention without trial and place detainees at risk of torture and executions based on flawed convictions, Tayler said. The U.S. has raised concerns about unfair trials of Islamic State detainees in Iraq.

"The only viable solution is for countries with fair justice systems to repatriate their nationals," Tayler said.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 17:34:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/Q6FDEGBYQZKFNOWUSKQXIH5VSI.jpg?auth=589f21a90899ad2bb53b8c163035c356e73a817d765c854baaa10c1cbfe8a3f5&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Mexico to seek diplomatic solution after US threatens Cuba oil tariffs</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/mexico-seek-diplomatic-solution-after-us-threatens-cuba-oil-tariffs-2026-01-30/</link><description>MEXICO CITY, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum said on Friday her country would seek diplomatic solutions and alternatives to help Cuba after the United States threatened tariffs on nations that supply the Caribbean nation with oil.

"We need to know the scope because we don't want to put our country at risk in terms of tariffs," Sheinbaum said in a morning press conference, adding that she had instructed her foreign minister to reach out to the U.S. State Department.

Mexico is one of Cuba's only remaining suppliers of oil and its shipments are a lifeline for the island.

Sheinbaum said cutting off oil shipments could cause a serious humanitarian crisis in Cuba, affecting transportation and key infrastructure including hospitals and electricity generation.

"Applying tariffs on countries that supply oil to Cuba could trigger a far-reaching humanitarian crisis, directly affecting hospitals, food and other basic services for the Cuban people, a situation that must be avoided," she said.

U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy in Boston said he would issue an order delaying the February 13 effective date of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's termination of the Temporary Protected Status granted to over 5,000 Ethiopians in order to provide more time for a legal challenge to be heard.

Murphy, who was appointed by Democratic President Joe Biden, during a virtual hearing said an order administratively staying the effective date would allow DHS time to produce records detailing how it made its decision so he can then consider whether to block the agency's action for even longer.

The U.S. Department of Justice had requested more time to respond to the lawsuit filed by immigrant rights advocates before Murphy, after he set the case down for arguments on Tuesday.

At the same time, it opposed even a temporary court-ordered delay in the expiration of the protections the Ethiopians had from deportation. Murphy said he would schedule further arguments after the agency's records are produced, which a government lawyer suggested could be done within weeks.

"I want to do everything I can to keep this case going," Murphy said.

DHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Under federal law, Temporary Protected Status is available to people whose home countries have experienced natural disasters, armed conflicts or other extraordinary events. It provides eligible migrants with work authorization and temporary protection from deportation.

DHS has moved to end the status for about a dozen countries as part of Trump's crackdown on immigration , saying TPS was always meant to be temporary and not a "de facto amnesty program."

The case before Murphy was filed last week by three Ethiopian nationals and the group African Communities Together after DHS said on December 12 it was ending the TPS designation for Ethiopia, citing improved conditions in the African nation.

The lawsuit argues DHS unlawfully terminated the TPS designation first granted to Ethiopia in 2022 by the Biden administration with just 60-days notice, even though armed conflicts there continue.

The plaintiffs say Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem took that action based on an unconstitutional animus against non-white immigrants.

Officials in Argentina were moving to finalize this month the third-country deal with the U.S., the New York Times reported.

Reuters could not independently confirm the report. A U.S. State Department spokesperson declined to comment.

Argentina's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

A third-country deal with Argentina would bolster President Donald Trump's intention to deport millions of immigrants in the U.S. illegally. His administration has aimed to ramp up removals to third countries , including to South Sudan, Eswatini, El Salvador, Costa Rica and Panama.

While Argentina has historically had a relatively open immigration policy, President Javier Milei, a close ally of Trump, has sought to tighten immigration by cracking down on those with criminal records and requiring that travelers are covered by health insurance.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 18:44:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Putin envoy Dmitriev to travel to Miami, meet members of Trump administration, sources say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/putin-envoy-dmitriev-travel-miami-meet-members-trump-administration-sources-say-2026-01-30/</link><description>MOSCOW, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin's special envoy, Kirill Dmitriev, will travel to Miami on Saturday for meetings with members of U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration, two sources with knowledge of the visit told Reuters.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 18:45:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/PHIJGKFNIVPBFLAQKMECGARI6Q.jpg?auth=bf541580f7c05e624b64e6ce8c73b2efced5bbac8908dba3515a75746cf59ba1&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Syria to close camps housing thousands linked to Islamic State</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/syria-close-camps-housing-thousands-linked-islamic-state-2026-01-30/</link><description>Jan 30 (Reuters) - Syria plans to permanently close two displacement camps in the northeast that hold civilians, including foreigners, linked to Islamic State militants , a government official said on Friday.

The al-Hol and Roj camps hold more than 28,000 people, mostly Syrians and Iraqis, according to the U.N. About 6,000 foreigners are housed in al-Hol and a further 2,000 in Roj.

A charity that has worked in both camps, the Swiss-based Global Community Engagement and Resilience Fund, told Reuters it understands Damascus aims to empty and shut the sites within a year.

Syrian forces recently took control of al-Hol after the chaotic withdrawal of Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). The SDF still holds Roj where residents had in recent days reported being confined to their tents as aid groups evacuated due to rising security worries.

More than 50,000 people who fled IS's last strongholds as the group lost territory over the last decade were once held at the two camps. Numbers have fallen due to repatriations, primarily by Iraq.

Among the foreigners held is Shamima Begum , a British-born woman who joined IS.

The civilian displacement camps are for families and others with alleged IS links, distinct from detention facilities that hold suspected fighters.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 18:45:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/C5WAOEMGYRKGFCH3G3VJQ3UPMM.jpg?auth=60c0d07b16bf9e4f1adf1eadee504503e732f8ae8ea3d2f588418b51bd2400aa&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US judge bars prosecutors from seeking death penalty against Luigi Mangione</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260130-us-judge-bars-prosecutors-from-seeking-death-penalty-against-luigi-mangione</link><description>A US judge on Friday barred prosecutors from seeking the death penalty against Luigi Mangione, the man accused of gunning down a health insurance CEO in New York in December 2024.

The judge dismissed two charges against Mangione that could carry the death penalty: murder and using a gun with a silencer. The 27-year-old suspect is still charged with two counts of stalking in his federal case, and faces state-level murder charges.

He has pleaded not guilty to the state and federal charges.

Friday's decision "is solely to foreclose the death penalty as an available punishment to be considered by the jury", Judge Margaret Garnett wrote in a court filing.

Mangione faces life in prison without parole if convicted of the stalking charges. The federal trial is to begin with jury selection on September 8.

The murder of UnitedHealthcare executive Brian Thompson, captured on surveillance video, shocked the United States and exposed public anger with the profit-driven private healthcare system.

Mangione was arrested five days after the killing at a McDonald's restaurant in Altoona, Pennsylvania, some 230 miles (370 kilometres) from the crime scene, following a tip from a staff member.

In another significant ruling Friday, Garnett rejected Mangione's lawyers' efforts to suppress as evidence the police search of a backpack recovered at the time of his arrest.

Inside, officers found a handgun, a silencer, a magazine with bullets wrapped in underwear and a red notebook described as a "manifesto".

The defence argued the search breached legal standards.

Following through on Donald Trump ’s campaign promise to vigorously pursue capital punishment, Attorney General Pam Bondi had ordered Manhattan federal prosecutors last April to seek the death penalty against Mangione.

It was the first time the Justice Department was seeking to bring the death penalty in Trump’s second term.

The contract emerged last week after it was first revealed by independent media outlet l’Observatoire des multinationales. It concerns “skip tracing” services – a form of data-driven locating and tracking of individuals whose whereabouts are unknown – used by ICE to verify home and work addresses and support removal operations. The framework agreement is capped at over $365 million, with nearly $4.8 million already committed.

In practical terms, contractors use government-supplied case data alongside commercial databases, public records, phone and social media information and even physical observation to confirm a person’s location for enforcement purposes.

The solicitation , revealed by US magazine Wired in October, outlines an incentive structure offering monetary bonuses for high performance, with companies assigned thousands of cases at a time. To meet these targets, contractors are expected to carry out “commercial data verification” and, if required, “physical observation services” to verify the address information.

Wired described parts of the initiative as relying on private "bounty hunters" paid to locate and track immigrants. A language echoed by The Intercept , which reported on December 23 that at least 10 companies had already earned more than $1 million and could collectively make well over $1 billion from the programme through 2027. The largest potential single share, the investigative outlet outlined, was expected to go to Capgemini Government Solutions.

Capgemini group CEO Aiman Ezzat said Sunday on LinkedIn that senior management had only recently become aware of the contract “through public sources”, adding that it was “not currently being executed” and was subject to legal challenge. An internal message sent to staff and seen by AFP said the US subsidiary had launched a process to examine the contents of the deal, as scrutiny intensified from unions, politicians and investors.

According to The Washington Post , ICE told prospective contractors in a written Q&amp;A in November that the intelligence they gathered "may lead to raids", and that the government "may send correspondence to the alien or take an enforcement action".

French investigative outlet Les Jours reported on Wednesday that Capgemini Government Solutions’ ties with ICE stretched back nearly two decades. Government spending records from USAspending.gov show that 65% of the contracts awarded to the company by US federal agencies were with ICE . As early as 2007, the contracts already covered operational planning, including modelling the agency’s detention capacity.

“If you fire them, ICE would be paralysed. They’ve become essential to certain parts of the system, it’s very hard to get rid of them,”  a former senior ICE official told Les Jours.

This dependency is reinforced by a "revolving door" process, with many employees moving between ICE and CGS, ensuring continuity and deep institutional knowledge.

The relationship has endured for nearly two decades, as documented by Les Jours, and came under scrutiny in a 2021 audit by the DHS Office of Inspector General , which flagged performance and oversight failures. “Although ICE had controls in place that required the contractor to provide qualified labour, ICE did not properly construct or monitor the contract,” the report said.

It also found that the contractor had failed to specify staffing levels for key labour categories, meaning ICE “cannot ensure it received all services and may have overpaid $769,869 in labour cost”. The watchdog further concluded that ICE did not ensure the contractor – Capgemini Government Solutions – met requirements for staff skills, education and experience, or that all contractor personnel worked at the designated place of performance.

This dependence on Capgemini’s services spans operations ranging from detention capacity management to deportation logistics and individual tracking, underscoring how deeply embedded CGS has become to core ICE functions.

These revelations have triggered mounting pressure on Capgemini from unions, politicians and parts of the French government. French union CFDT strongly condemned the ICE contract and has called for more transparency from management at a time when Capgemini is planning to cut up to 2,400 jobs in France . The more hardline CGT called for the ‘immediate and public cessation of any collaboration with ICE’, arguing that the agreement runs counter to the company’s stated values.

French Finance Minister Roland Lescure on Wednesday urged full transparency, saying Capgemini – which is partly state-owned – must "shed light, in an extremely transparent manner, on its activities" and "question the nature of these activities". Defence Minister Catherine Vautrin has meanwhile called for close ethical scrutiny of such contracts.

Capgemini has scheduled an extraordinary board meeting for this weekend in Paris as scrutiny intensifies, with unions warning that its outcome could set a precedent for how European firms engage with US security agencies.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 18:45:33 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/92ca346a-fe09-11f0-a98a-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/USA-ICE.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US Justice Department releases 3 million pages of new Epstein files</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260130-us-justice-department-releases-3-million-pages-of-new-epstein-files</link><description>The US Justice Department announced Friday it was releasing more than three million pages from the Jeffrey Epstein files along with photos and videos, adding fuel to a political drama putting pressure on President Donald Trump .

Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said all images of women were redacted from the documents being released aside from those of Ghislaine Maxwell , the accomplice of the convicted sex offender.

The latest release is expected to contain previously unseen material from the investigation into Epstein, a wealthy US financier who died in a New York jail in 2019 while awaiting trial for sex trafficking underage girls.

Previous releases have shed light on Epstein's ties to leading business executives, celebrities, academics and politicians, including Trump and former president Bill Clinton .

Perhaps the most significant documents published so far are two FBI emails from July 2019 which mention 10 "co-conspirators" of Epstein.

Only one person – Epstein's former girlfriend Maxwell – has ever been charged in connection with his crimes and the names of the alleged "co-conspirators" are redacted from the emails.

Maxwell is serving a 20-year prison sentence for recruiting underage girls for Epstein, whose death was ruled a suicide.

According to Axios, major documents which have not been released yet include a draft 60-count federal indictment of Epstein that was inexplicably quashed, and an 82-page prosecution memo from 2007.

Trump, a one-time close friend of Epstein, and Clinton both figure prominently in the records published so far but neither has been accused by officials of any wrongdoing.

A Republican-led House panel has voted to launch contempt of Congress proceedings against Bill and Hillary Clinton over their refusal to testify before its probe into Epstein.

Trump, 79, fought for months to prevent release of the vast trove of documents about Epstein.

But a rebellion inside his Republican Party forced him to sign off on a law mandating release of all the documents.

The Epstein Files Transparency Act (EFTA) called for all of the documents held by the Justice Department to be released by December 19.

The department missed that deadline. Blanche has blamed the delay on the need to painstakingly redact the identities of Epstein's more than 1,000 victims from the files.

The sweeping redactions across many of the documents – combined with tight control over the release by the Trump administration – have stoked scepticism that conspiracy theories of a high-level cover-up will be silenced.

As soon as the president's name began surfacing in the released files, the Justice Department issued a statement saying that some documents "contain untrue and sensationalist claims made against President Trump".

But the documents already released confirm that Trump was once close to Epstein.

They moved in the same social circles in New York and Florida and documents confirm that Trump flew multiple times on Epstein's private jet.

A January 2020 note from New York federal prosecutors who were investigating Maxwell had Trump making eight trips on Epstein's plane between 1993 and 1996.

Trump has given varying accounts of why he eventually fell out with Epstein. He has criticised the file dumps, expressing concern that people who "innocently met" Epstein over the years risked having their reputations smeared.

A spokesman for Clinton has urged the Justice Department to release all materials in the files related to the former president, saying he had nothing to hide.

"Someone or something is being protected. We do not know whom, what or why. But we do know this: We need no such protection," Angel Urena said.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 18:45:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/17424ca2-fdf9-11f0-9115-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/c78fb3ddc59591e57e22ce07fc3f18ec063da38f.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump's Justice Department releases massive cache of Jeffrey Epstein files</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trumps-justice-department-releases-new-cache-jeffrey-epstein-files-2026-01-30/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 30 (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department on Friday published a new and final cache of millions of documents related to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, under a law passed in November that required the release of all Epstein-related records.

Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general, said at a press conference that Friday's massive batch of files marked the end of the Trump administration's planned releases under the law. The new cache includes more than three million pages, 2000 videos, and 180,000 images, he said.

The files include "extensive" redactions, he said, given the law's exceptions permitting certain documents to be blacked out, including identifying information of victims or materials related to active investigations. Previous releases have been heavily redacted, drawing criticism from some members of Congress.

Reuters is in the process of reviewing the files.

Trump, who was friends with Epstein in the 1990s and early 2000s before they had a falling out years before Epstein's first conviction, spent months resisting any release until both Democrats and Republicans in Congress forced his hand by advancing the law over his objections.

Trump has not been formally accused of any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein, and he has denied any knowledge of Epstein's crimes. But the scandal has dogged him for months, in part because he promised to release the files during his 2024 presidential campaign.

It was not immediately clear how many of the newly released files included mentions of Trump. The Justice Department's first major release in December contained relatively few references to the president.

In a press release announcing Friday's document production, the Justice Department wrote, "Some of the documents contain untrue and sensationalist claims against President Trump that were submitted to the FBI right before the 2020 election. To be clear, the claims are unfounded and false, and if they have a shred of credibility, they certainly would have been weaponized against President Trump already."

Blanche said the department has also withheld some files based on legal privilege, including work product and attorney-client privilege. Some lawmakers have said those withholdings appear to run counter to the law, which required the department to produce internal communications related to decisions on whether to charge or investigate Epstein or any associates.

The Justice Department will provide Congress a report that includes a summary of all redactions and withheld documents, as required under the law, Blanche said in a letter sent to Congress on Friday.

Asked whether he believed all the files had been released in compliance with the law, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said, "We believe it is not."

Epstein, a New York financier with ties to high-profile political and business figures, was found hanged in his jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. While his death was ruled a suicide, it has engendered years of conspiracy theories, some of which Trump himself boosted to his own supporters during his 2024 presidential campaign.

Blanche expressed frustration with accusations that the Justice Department had declined to pursue associates of Epstein who may have participated in illegal activity.

"There's this built-in assumption that somehow there's this hidden tranche of information of men that we know about, that we're covering up, or that we're not we're choosing not to prosecute. That is not the case," he said.

The Epstein scandal has become a persistent political problem for Trump, who is already facing sagging approval ratings on a range of issues, including his handling of the economy and his immigration crackdown.

Blanche defended the slow pace of releases, saying that the voluminous files required hundreds of attorneys to work day and night for weeks to review and prepare them for public release. The law had set a deadline of December 19, 2025, but officials said they needed more time to review the files.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 19:32:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4ILFJKU4RBI2JEN73NHPR7JWBE.jpg?auth=9870531b243b02eb90743d6cbd5cb89d9c1eb3be566a5196ab8c69edad16adf1&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US Justice Dept opens civil rights probe into Alex Pretti shooting, official says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-justice-dept-opens-civil-rights-probe-into-alex-pretti-shooting-official-says-2026-01-30/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 30 (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department has started a civil rights investigation into the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti by federal immigration officers in Minneapolis, a senior official said on Friday.

The department's investigation could potentially lead to criminal charges against the officers involved, though there is a high legal bar to bring such a case.

Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said the FBI was examining Saturday's shooting with potential assistance from the department's Civil Rights Division, which typically plays a leading role in investigations into use of force by law enforcement. He cautioned the review was preliminary and he downplayed its scope.

"This is what I would describe as a standard investigation by the FBI when there's circumstances like what we saw last Saturday," Blanche said at a news conference.

Pretti's shooting by agents taking part in an immigration crackdown has stirred widespread outrage and prompted the Trump administration to make changes in the operation in Minnesota. Local officials have said the administration cannot be trusted and are pursuing their own investigation.

“The family’s focus is on a fair and impartial investigation that examines the facts around his murder," Steve Schleicher, an attorney representing the Pretti family, told Reuters in a statement.

A preliminary review by U.S. Customs and Border Protection said Pretti, 37, was shot by two federal officers, a Border Patrol agent and a customs officer. Pretti was the second protester to be shot and killed by federal agents in Minneapolis this month.

Video of the encounter verified by Reuters showed Pretti holding a cell phone as he was wrestled to the ground by agents. Video also showed that an officer removed a gun from Pretti’s body shortly before the first shots were fired.

Blanche's statement followed days of uncertainty over the nature of DOJ's involvement in the probe.

A Justice Department official told Reuters earlier this week that a criminal civil rights investigation would only begin if warranted by evidence. A DHS official said in a sworn court statement following the shooting that DHS was the lead investigative entity.

The department has so far not opened a criminal civil rights investigation into the fatal shooting of Renee Good, 37, by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer earlier this month. Blanche previously said there was no basis for a criminal probe.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 19:32:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5ZOKRPOAV5LS3MCTZQHD34V3T4.jpg?auth=33c0f1cf653ef208d025b9efa8196eefd983c5b2e4bcd1f3ad02c7f4f815ad26&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Catherine O'Hara, 'Schitt's Creek' and 'Home Alone' star, dies at 71</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/culture/20260130-catherine-o-hara-schitt-s-creek-and-home-alone-star-dies-at-71</link><description>Catherine O'Hara, the Emmy-winning actor known for comedic roles across the decades – from Kevin's mum in “Home Alone” to the iconic Moira Rose in “Schitt's Creek” – died Friday at 71.

A report , opens new tab by Poland's Computer Emergency Response Team on the incident - which a Polish minister said was the worst of its kind in years - pointed to a team of hackers from Russia's Federal Security Service, known by its Russian acronym FSB.

The hacks were "purely destructive in nature," the report said, comparing them to arson.

"It is worth noting that this period coincided with low temperatures and snowstorms affecting Poland, shortly before New Year’s Eve,” the report said.

The Russian aim was to irreversibly destroy data stored on devices within the combined heat and power plant but security software blocked that portion of the attack, according to the report.

The Russian embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment.

Poland says its critical infrastructure has been subject to a growing number of cyberattacks by Russia since the war in Ukraine began in February 2022. Moscow regularly denies responsibility for malicious cyber activity.

The report tied the incident to an FSB hacking operation tracked under several nicknames, including "Berserk Bear" and “Dragonfly.” An August 20, 2025 report from the FBI linked the groups to the FSB’s specialised unit Center 16.

While the group has historically had “significant interest” in the energy sector and the ability to attack industrial devices, “this is the first publicly described destructive activity attributed to this cluster,” the Polish cyber officials said, referring to the FSB hacking group.

The report’s verdict on the hacks involved partially backs an independent analysis published last week by researchers at the Slovakia-based cybersecurity firm ESET.

ESET said that the malware involved in the Polish attack overlapped with prior destructive cyber operations tied to Russia, but linked it to a Russian military intelligence hacking unit known as Sandworm, not the FSB.

ESET issued a second report , opens new tab Friday expanding on its analysis of the malware which again tied it to Sandworm, although it cautioned that other aspects of the operation might have been carried out by different hacking groups.

John Hultquist, chief analyst at Google Threat Intelligence Group, said Friday that if the attack truly is Berserk Bear, the activity represents an escalation from its penetration of targets for long-term espionage towards damaging action.

"They have the means, the question was always did they have the motivation,” Hultquist said. "Now, potentially based on this attribution, proven to us that they do have the motivation, which puts us in a much more serious situation.”

Hultquist said the situation should raise concerns about the security of the Winter Olympics, set to kick off February 6.

“Russia has previously attempted to knock the opening ceremonies of the Winter Olympics offline, and they were extremely active during the last summer games," Hultquist said. “Disruptive cyberattacks are a very real threat.”</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 20:33:17 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ICRDGL3XGROGZI6WG4YDIW6GEQ.jpg?auth=746b565700b3c9fc21716622fcef6ddde5c97d106b2d356509bee10ca3f87485&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>More than 200 killed in coltan mine collapse in east Congo, official says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/more-than-200-killed-coltan-mine-collapse-east-congo-official-says-2026-01-30/</link><description>Jan 30 (Reuters) - More than 200 people were killed this week in a collapse at the Rubaya coltan mine in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, Lubumba Kambere Muyisa, spokesperson for the rebel-appointed governor of the province where the mine is located, told Reuters on Friday.

Rubaya produces around 15% of the world's coltan, which is processed into tantalum, a heat-resistant metal that is in high demand by makers of mobile phones, computers, aerospace components and gas turbines. The site, where locals dig manually for a few dollars per day, has been under the control of the M23 rebel group since 2024.

The collapse occurred on Wednesday and the precise toll was still unclear as of Friday evening.

"More than 200 people were victims of this landslide, including miners, children and market women. Some people were rescued just in time and have serious injuries," Muyisa said.

An adviser to the governor said the number of confirmed dead was at least 227. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to brief the media.

The United Nations says M23 has plundered Rubaya's riches to help fund its insurgency, backed by the government of neighboring Rwanda, an allegation Kigali denies.

The heavily-armed rebels, whose stated aim is to overthrow the government in Kinshasa and ensure the safety of the Congolese Tutsi minority, captured even more mineral-rich territory in eastern Congo during a lightning advance last year.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 21:29:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Tunisia extends state of emergency by 11 months until Dec 31</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/tunisia-extends-state-emergency-by-11-months-until-dec-31-2026-01-30/</link><description>TUNIS, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Tunisian President Kais Saied has extended a long-running state of emergency by 11 months until December 31, the official gazette showed on Friday.

"Russian production of military goods was supplied last year to more than 30 countries and the amount of foreign exchange earnings exceeded $15 billion," Putin told a meeting on military-technical cooperation in the Kremlin in a pool video.

Putin said the sector was operating in "complicated conditions".

"Pressure from Western countries remained and was even intensified to slow down or block business ties with Russia," he said. "But despite all these attempts, our export contracts were on the whole being honoured consistently."

African countries, he said, were particularly expressing interest in Russian production.

"Despite pressure from the West, African partners are showing readiness to expand their relations with Russia in the military and military-technical fields," he said.

Russia has been cultivating ties with a string of African countries, including in the domain of military cooperation.

The Central African Republic in 2018 brought in Russia's Wagner mercenaries to fend off rebel groups. Its newly reelected president, Faustin-Archange Touadera, invited Putin this month to visit the country.

Russia has also boosted relations with military administrations in Mali and Burkina Faso.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 23:49:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/O7ZEK6CCLRM77MSH7BINQBFFAA.jpg?auth=3e7e002dcd3d922b829cb24dea9306183afb70eb3afa55f83a561165883234f5&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Thousands marched for democracy in Myanmar. Some died in prison.</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/thousands-marched-democracy-myanmar-some-died-prison-2026-01-31/</link><description>Jan 31 (Reuters) - Shwe Theingi was instantly drawn to Wutt Yee Aung when they met at the start of their second year at Myanmar's Dagon University in 2019.

The 19-year-old zoology major stood out with her boyish clothes, short hair and a friendly but outspoken personality, Shwe Theingi said. The two young women, who were active in the student union, quickly became friends.

At about the same time and in the same city, Khant Linn Naing was working at a printing press. He was also pursuing a degree in history at a different university and involved with a student union.

All three students were part of the first generation in decades to come of age in a quasi-democratic Myanmar, enjoying newfound freedoms in the commercial capital of Yangon before the February 1, 2021 military coup .

And all three were caught up in a brutal crackdown against the tens of thousands of young people who took to the streets in support of democracy five years ago.

Many of those protesters took up arms against the junta. Others fled or were detained in prison, where some of them died.

At least 74 political prisoners aged between 18 and 35 have died in detention since the coup, according to previously unreported data from the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, whose information on Myanmar is often cited by United Nations agencies.

The tally was corroborated with the Political Prisoners Network of Myanmar (PPNM), which monitors the country's prison system. A total of 273 people charged with public incitement and insurrection after the coup have died while incarcerated, according to PPNM.

Reuters interviewed three associates and relatives of detained students and the two prison monitor groups, and reviewed letters sent by inmates and correctional authorities. Together, they provide the fullest account to date of the conditions experienced by Wutt Yee Aung and Khant Linn Naing and the circumstances of their deaths.

The news agency could not independently verify all the accounts, but they echo allegations made by U.N. investigators last year of "systematic torture, killing and other serious abuses during interrogations and in detention facilities operated by the security forces of Myanmar."

The junta information ministry did not return multiple requests for comment about the allegations of mistreatment.

The military government's foreign ministry last year denied U.N. reports of torture and abuse, without addressing specifics. "These one-sided and unfounded allegations are persistently advanced based on such unverified data," it said in October.

Arrests, torture and conscription, as well as displacement within and outside Myanmar, "have disproportionately affected the younger generation," the U.N. said in a report last year.

An estimated 300,000 to 500,000 young people have fled the country, which has a population of about 51 million, since the coup, according to the U.N. Development Programme.

When the 2021 crackdown began, Shwe Theingi left Yangon. Wutt Yee Aung remained, participating in the anti-junta resistance until she was arrested in September 2021.

After a junta court convicted her on charges that included insurgency and incitement, she was sentenced to seven years in Yangon's notorious Insein prison.

Through letters and the occasional phone call, she stayed in touch with her family and Shwe Theingi.

"Mother, I hope you are well," Wutt Yee Aung said in a letter from prison in February 2024. "I have run out of snacks and medicine, so please transfer 200,000 kyat."

The hand-written plea for around $100 at official exchange rates also contained a list of medicines, including some for treating nerve damage and asthma.

It was during interrogation in the fortnight after her arrest that Wutt Yee Aung sustained head injuries, according to Shwe Theingi and the Dagon University Students' Union, which also said that she had no health problems prior to her imprisonment.

Her health eventually deteriorated so severely that she was hospitalised inside prison at least once in mid-2025, Shwe Theingi said.

In one undated letter intended for Shwe Theingi, Wutt Yee Aung asked for about $150 for a medical test. "Please don't tell my mother about this," she wrote, "I miss everyone."

Wutt Yee Aung died in prison on July 19, 2025, at age 25. Authorities told her family that the cause of death was a heart condition, Shwe Theingi said.

The student union challenged the junta version of her death in a statement.

"Due to political prisoners not being given adequate medical treatment, the lack of medicine and restrictions on contact with her family, Ma Wutt Yee Aung died in prison at around 9.30 p.m. on July 19, 2025," it said, using an honorific for her name.

Khant Linn Naing's family learnt of his arrest on television news.

The 19-year-old was picked up in December 2021 and accused of inciting people to commit offences against the state and insurrection. He was held at Daik-U prison, some 110 km from Yangon, and sentenced by a junta court to 15 years.

In July 2023, his family was jolted again, this time by a letter from correctional authorities, which said Khant Linn Naing had been shot and killed while trying to escape during a prison transfer.

The contents of the letter were described to Reuters by a family member, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to fear of retaliation.

Reuters also viewed a letter sent in June 2023 by prison authorities to the family of another inmate at Daik-U, which said he was killed after "security personnel fired warning shots" when he attempted to escape during a transfer.

A colonial-era rule book that a lawyer and a prison monitor said is still used by correctional authorities allows officials to use weapons like firearms against inmates who are attempting to escape only when "there are no other means available to prevent the prisoner from escaping," according to a section of the manual reviewed by Reuters.

Neither death notice provided more information about the circumstances of the alleged escape attempts and the junta information ministry did not respond to requests for specific details.

Khant Linn Naing's parents were not given access to his remains and, over two years after receiving the notice, they have not conducted a funeral, the relative said.

"Because that letter was so unclear, we don't believe he is dead," the person said.

PPNM spokesperson Thaik Tun Oo said he found it implausible that Khant Linn Naing had been trying to escape because prisoners are typically restrained and paired with police officials during a transfer.

He added that his organization had been informed by prison sources that Khant Linn Naing had been subject to harsh interrogation shortly before the alleged transfer.

In the years after Wutt Yee Aung and Khant Linn Naing protested the junta, youth uprisings have upended politics and ousted governments elsewhere in Asia, including Bangladesh and Nepal.

Myanmar's generals, however, have endured. While they have lost territory in their borderlands, the junta has fought back by introducing conscription and expanding aerial power. This month, it concluded a three-phase election that will likely see a military-backed party take power.

"I wanted to become a news presenter. Wutt Yee wanted to do more volunteer work," Shwe Theingi said. "Each of us had different dreams."</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 01:59:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/DYS4EFEQGJLH5APUZU3IUG7UJA.jpg?auth=b29e78321511f9c394cac24d0360f9ccd4aeff1210c115842b4525aa3bfc59b3&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Modi ally proposes social media ban for India's teens as global debate grows</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/society-equity/modi-ally-proposes-social-media-ban-indias-teens-global-debate-grows-2026-01-31/</link><description>NEW DELHI, Jan 31 (Reuters) - An ally of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has proposed a bill to ban social media for children, as the world's biggest market for Meta and YouTube joins a global debate on the impact of social media on young people's health and safety.

"Not only are our children becoming addicted to social media, but India is also one of the world's largest producers of data for foreign platforms," lawmaker L.S.K. Devarayalu told Reuters on Friday.

"Based on this data, these companies are creating advanced AI systems, effectively turning Indian users into unpaid data providers, while the strategic and economic benefits are reaped elsewhere," he said.

Australia last month became the first country to ban social media for children under 16, blocking access in a move welcomed by many parents and child advocates but criticised by major technology companies and free-speech advocates. France's National Assembly this week backed legislation to ban children under 15 from social media, while Britain, Denmark and Greece are studying the issue.

Facebook operator Meta (META.O) , opens new tab , YouTube-parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O) , opens new tab and X did not respond on Saturday to emails seeking comment on the Indian legislation. Meta has said it backs laws for parental oversight but that "governments considering bans should be careful not to push teens toward less safe, unregulated sites."

India's IT ministry did not respond to a request for comment.

India, the world's second-biggest smartphone market with 750 million devices and a billion internet users, is a key growth market for social media apps and does not set a minimum age for access.

Devarayalu's 15-page Social Media (Age Restrictions and Online Safety) Bill, which is not public but was seen by Reuters, says no one under 16 "shall be permitted to create, maintain, or hold" a social media account and those found to have one should have them disabled.

"We are asking that the entire onus of ensuring users' age be placed on the social media platforms," Devarayalu said.

The government's chief economic adviser attracted attention on Thursday by saying India should draft policies on age-based access limits to tackle "digital addiction".

Devarayalu's legislation is a private member's bill - not proposed to parliament by a federal minister - but such bills often trigger debates in parliament and influence lawmaking.

Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Europe ‍had ​stirred tensions in the recent protests ‌that gripped ‍the country and "provoked" people.

The United States on Friday approved a sale of $9 billion in Patriot defense missiles for Saudi Arabia, with the deal coming as tensions rise with nearby Iran.

The kingdom, a longtime US partner, plans to buy 730 Patriot missiles from the United States, the State Department said.

The Trump administration has approved a massive new series of arms sales to Israel totaling $6.67 billion, including 30 Apache attack helicopters and related equipment and weapons as well as 3,250 light tactical vehicles.

The State Department announced the package of four separate sales late Friday amid rising tensions in the Middle East over the possibility of US military strikes in Iran.

The Apache helicopters, which will be equipped with rocket launchers and advanced targeting gear, are the biggest part of the total package, coming to $3.8 billion, according to the department.

The next largest portion are the light tactical vehicles, which will be used to move personnel and logistics “to extend lines of communication” for the Israel Defense Forces and will cost $1.98 billion, it said.

Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said the department would be releasing more than 3 million pages of documents along with more than 2,000 videos and 180,000 images.

The files, posted to the department’s website, include some of the several million pages of records that officials said were withheld from an initial release in December.

Included were documents concerning some of Epstein's famous associates, including Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, formerly known as Britain’s Prince Andrew, and email correspondence between Epstein and Elon Musk and other prominent contacts from across the political spectrum.

Friday's disclosure represents the largest document dump to date about a saga the Trump administration has struggled to shake because of the president's previous association with Epstein. Criminal investigations into the financier have long animated online sleuths, conspiracy theorists and others who have suspected government cover-ups and clamored for a full accounting, demands that Blanche acknowledged might not be satisfied by the latest release.

“There’s a hunger, or a thirst, for information that I don’t think will be satisfied by the review of these documents," he said.

The latest batch includes correspondence either with or about some of Epstein's friends.

The records have thousands of references to Trump, including emails in which Epstein and others shared news articles about him, commented on his policies or politics, or gossiped about him and his family.

Also included was a spreadsheet created last August summarizing calls to the FBI’s National Threat Operation Center or to a hotline established by prosecutors from people claiming without corroboration to have some knowledge of wrongdoing by Trump.

Mountbatten-Windsor's name appears at least several hundred times in the documents, sometimes in news clippings, sometimes in Epstein’s private email correspondence and in guest lists for dinners organized by Epstein. Some records document an attempt by prosecutors in New York to get the former prince to agree to be interviewed as part of their Epstein sex trafficking probe.

The records also show Musk, the billionaire Tesla founder, reached out to Epstein on at least two occasions to plan visits to the Caribbean island where many of the allegations of sexual abuse purportedly occurred.

In a 2012 exchange, Epstein asked how many people Musk would like flown by helicopter to the island he owned.

“Probably just Talulah and me,” Musk responded, referencing his then-partner, actress Talulah Riley. “What day/night will be the wildest party on our island?”

It’s not immediately clear if the island visits took place. Musk has said he repeatedly rebuffed Epstein's overtures.

Epstein also appears to have tried to connect New York Giants co-owner Steve Tisch with women, according to emails.

Tisch said in a statement that he had a “brief association” with Epstein where they emailed about adult women and other topics. He said he “never went to his island” and that he “deeply regrets” the association.

The documents show that Steve Bannon , a conservative activist who served as Trump’s White House strategist earlier in the president’s first term, bantered over politics with the financier, discussed get-togethers with him and, on March 29, 2019, asked Epstein if he could supply his plane to pick him up in Rome.

Epstein told him his pilot and crew “are doing their best” to arrange that flight but if Bannon could find a charter flight instead, “I’m happy to pay.” Apparently in France at the time, Epstein sent a text message saying: “My guys can pick you up. Come for dinner.” The exchange did not show how that played out.

In December 2012, Epstein invited Howard Lutnick, now Trump's commerce secretary, to his private island for lunch, the records show. Lutnick’s wife accepted the invitation and said they would arrive on a yacht with their children. On another occasion in 2011, the two men had drinks, according to a schedule shared with Epstein.

Lutnick has said he cut ties with Epstein long ago. A Commerce Department spokesman said Lutnick had “limited interactions with Mr. Epstein in the presence of his wife and has never been accused of wrongdoing.”

Another Epstein contact surfacing in the records is former Obama White House general counsel Kathy Ruemmler. In one of several exchanges, Epstein emailed Ruemmler to advise that Democrats should stop demonizing Trump as a Mafia-type figure even as he derided the president as a “maniac.”

A spokesperson for Goldman Sachs , where Ruemmler is general counsel and chief legal officer, said in a statement that Ruemmler “had a professional association with Jeffrey Epstein when she was a lawyer in private practice” and "regrets ever knowing him.”

The documents were disclosed under the Epstein Files Transparency Act, the law enacted after months of public and political pressure that requires the government to open its files on the late financier and his confidant and onetime girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell .

Lawmakers complained when the Justice Department made only a limited release last month, but officials said more time was needed to review additional documents that were discovered and to ensure no sensitive information about victims was released.

After missing a December 19 deadline set by Congress to release all the files, the Justice Department said it tasked hundreds of lawyers with reviewing the records to determine what needed to be redacted, or blacked out.

It denied any effort to shield Trump, who says he cut ties with Epstein years ago after an earlier friendship, from potential embarrassment.

Epstein killed himself in a New York jail cell in August 2019, a month after being indicted on federal sex trafficking charges.

In 2008 and 2009, Epstein served jail time in Florida after pleading guilty to soliciting prostitution from someone under the age of 18. At the time, investigators had gathered evidence that Epstein had sexually abused underage girls at his Palm Beach home. The U.S. attorney's office agreed not to prosecute him in exchange for his guilty plea to lesser state charges.

A draft indictment from that period released Friday shows prosecutors contemplated federal charges against not just Epstein but three others who were his personal assistants and were suspected of participating in a conspiracy to recruit underage girls to perform lewd acts with Epstein.</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 06:56:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/28718252-fe69-11f0-ae35-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26031020763767.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Are the West's tightening oil sanctions finally taking their toll on Russia’s economy?</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260131-are-the-west-tightening-oil-sanctions-finally-taking-toll-russia-economy</link><description>Across the world's vast oceans, more and more tankers bearing crude oil drawn from the Russian soil have begun to sit idle in the water.

Reuters estimates suggest 19 million barrels of Urals crude loaded before December 15 are still in transit as traders deliberately slow their journeys, struggling to nail down buyers amid declining demand.

And where the oil does flow, it's bringing in less and less in return. Last year, Russia’s revenue from oil and gas sales dropped by about a fifth to their lowest point in five years.

That Russia is getting less and less money from flogging fossil fuels is not in itself surprising – a global glut of crude has pushed oil prices down all over. On top of that, a strong rouble means that Moscow is getting less in its own currency for each dollar it earns from its exports.

But years of Western sanctions , including US President Donald Trump ’s decision in October to target Rosneft and Lukoil – Russia’s two largest oil exporters – also appear to be increasingly eating into Moscow’s much-needed oil rents.

Since the October sanctions, the discount at which Russia is forced to sell its oil to tempt trading partners to risk taking sanctioned crude has doubled. In December, the country’s Urals crude fell below $40 a barrel – its lowest point since global oil prices plummeted in the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Taken with the outgoing Biden administration’s decision in January to impose sanctions on the country’s third- and fourth-largest oil exporters, four-fifths of Russia’s oil production is now under US sanctions .

And unlike earlier sanctions, these latest measures hit not just the named companies themselves, but anyone doing business with them.

Alexander Kolyandr, a financial analyst and a senior scholar at the Center for European Policy Analysis, said that the secondary sanctions imposed by Trump threatened to cut companies receiving Russian oil off from the US-run financial infrastructure that underpins much of the global economy.

“The main feature of the American sanctions is that the United States, unlike Europe, is ready to apply secondary sanctions – in other words, if the United States sanctions you, and I trade with you, the US feels within its rights to fine or sanction me,” he said.

“We saw that, for example, in China, the main buyer of the Russian oil was not the state-owned companies or large companies, but rather, what's called ‘teapot refineries’ – small refineries which get sanctioned oil, refine it and then sell it. They have no exposure to the United States, and they can risk it.”

Targeting Russia’s oil rents has been a core strategy of Western governments’ economic response to the full-scale invasion of Ukraine . In the months that followed the Russian advance, European Union and Group of 7 countries imposed a “price cap” on Russia’s seaborne oil exports.

The cap effectively banned commercial operators based in EU or G7 countries from transporting Russian oil – or providing insurance or other financial services to those who did – unless it was sold for less than a fixed price.

Originally set at $60 a barrel, the price cap will fall to under $44 a barrel as of February 1.

Catherine Wolfram, the William Barton Rogers professor of energy economics at MIT’s Sloan School of Management, said that the price cap had been designed to avoid a sudden spike in oil prices that could have been triggered by keeping Russian oil off the world market altogether. Russia is the world’s third-largest producer of oil.

“The price cap was designed to A, drive a wedge between the global price and what Russia received for its oil, and B, keep oil on the market – especially in 2022 when oil prices were very high and inflation was running rampant,” she said. “It succeeded with B. With A, it drove a bit of a wedge, but the Trump administration’s actions on Rosneft and Lukoil widened that wedge.”

To sell its oil at higher prices, Russia has become increasingly reliant on what some have dubbed a “shadow fleet” of ageing commercial oil tankers of unclear ownership.

Earlier in January, the French navy boarded an oil tanker in the Mediterranean and forced it to dock in Marseille . The captain who, like all members of the crew is an Indian national, has been taken into custody. French President Emmanuel Macron accused the tanker of helping to “finance Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine”. He was released from custody on Monday.

“We see a mounting campaign against Russia’s shadow fleet – it seems that both the Americans and the Europeans are ready to up the ante and start seizing these ships, which increases the cost of transportation,” Kolyandr said. “It all results in the buyer’s attempt to push prices lower. That’s where the discount is coming from.”

Increasingly cut off from Western markets, Moscow initially found willing buyers in India and China , where refiners have jumped at the chance to buy Russian crude at bargain prices.

But Daniel Spiro, an associate professor at the department of economics at Sweden's Uppsala University, said that the latest US sanctions seemed to have spooked even these once-eager buyers.

“For maybe the first time, it seems to have affected India's and China's willingness to buy Russian oil,” he said. “India decreased the volumes and China seems to have demanded a higher discount on the oil it buys. And this hasn't really been the case previously.”

Another casualty of these sanctions has been Lukoil’s extensive overseas assets. Founded in the frantic privatisations that marked the former Soviet Union’s wrenching transition to a market economy, Lukoil is believed to have some $22 billion worth of assets across the world, including in Iraq , Egypt , Nigeria and Mexico .

This week, the company announced that US private equity titan the Carlyle Group had agreed to buy up these assets – except for those in Kazakhstan – for an undisclosed price. The deal would require final approval from the US Treasury.

Spiro said that while the sale would likely eat into Russia’s oil and gas revenue, it would nevertheless boost the country’s critical foreign reserves.

“Presumably they do that at a low price compared to if this would have just been any regular market exchange,” he said. “So it is reducing the profits from oil and gas for Russia, but it is increasing the money they have – because they sold it off.”

He said that it was unclear what impact the sale would have on Russia’s vast oil and gas industry.

“Sanctions are a cat-and-mouse game – somebody imposes sanctions on Russia, and initially, they can be quite painful,” he said. “And Russia, of course, tries to avoid it in some way. For all I know, it could be that when they sell these assets, they use the money to invest in oil and gas production in Russia.”

Wolfram said that the planned sale was partly born from financial necessity.

“This feels like eating your seed corn, but Russia really needs the funds now,” she said.

Russia’s shrinking oil revenues risk eating into the wider state budget.

Oil and gas revenue made up less than 23 percent of the federal budget by the end of 2025 – something not seen for 20 years. With government spending outstripping revenue, last year's budget deficit ended up around 2.6 percent of GDP.

To make up for the shortfall, the Russian government has already begun increasing a range of domestic taxes, including raising VAT to 22 percent – as well as the threshold under which small businesses are exempt from paying it.

Spiro said that declining oil and gas revenues would push the government into making difficult decisions.

“Russia has a few choices. They can raise other taxes – that has a cost, and it's not going to be popular,” he said. “Or they need to increase government take in Russian oil and gas, but it's already quite high – I don't think there's a lot of margin to move on there. Or it has to reduce spending.”

While Russia's war-time economy has driven up wages in some of the country's poorest regions as workers man the production lines of a growing military-industrial complex, the overall economic situation is less rosy.

Economic growth has slowed as the central bank cracks down on inflation with double-digit interest rates, and social spending has already been slashed from 38 percent in 2021 to 25 percent this year.

“There's essentially two ways it can reduce spending – either reduce the war effort or reduce pensions and things like that,” Spiro said. “One of the key questions since the full-scale invasion has been, how far can the Russian government push its economy – or essentially push the costs onto its population.”

Ultimately, though, Kolyandr said it was unlikely the rising cost of Western sanctions would impact Putin’s determination to continue the nearly four-year war in Ukraine.

“Those decisions can only be made by Putin himself if he decides to wind down the war,” he said. “And I think his priorities are pretty clear – that the war and all this geopolitical struggle has priority. That the Russians had a couple of years of pretty good economic growth, and they can suffer a little bit. I don't think that it will derail his ideas.”</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 07:32:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/14fd6f62-fdfe-11f0-aaac-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25316184713361.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuela announces amnesty push targeting mass release of political prisoners</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260131-venezuela-announces-amnesty-push-targeting-mass-release-of-political-prisoners</link><description>Venezuela 's acting president announced on Friday a proposal for mass amnesty in the country, in her latest major reform since the US toppling of Nicolas Maduro just weeks ago.

Delcy Rodriguez , in a speech at the Venezuelan Supreme Court attended by top government officials, said she will propose a "general amnesty law covering the entire period of political violence from 1999 to the present."

Leftist revolutionary Hugo Chavez assumed the presidency in 1999, and was succeeded upon his death in 2013 by Maduro, who oversaw an increasingly authoritarian government and whose two re-elections were widely dismissed as fraudulent.

"This law will serve to heal the wounds left by political confrontation, fueled by violence and extremism. It will allow us to put justice back on track in our country," Rodriguez said, also announcing a "major national consultation for a new judicial system."

She also announced plans to close the notorious El Helicoide prison in Caracas, where rights groups say political prisoners were tortured by Maduro's intelligence services.

The massive facility, originally built as a shopping mall, will be turned into a "sports, cultural and commercial center for police families and neighboring communities," Rodriguez said.

A mother interviewed by AFP near El Helicoide was overjoyed that her son, imprisoned inside, may soon be released under the law.

"It's wonderful! I haven't heard from my son in six months, so, damn it, this is a huge joy, it's an amnesty, my God, it's total liberation," said Betsy Orellana, 63.

Formerly Maduro's vice president, Rodriguez, 56, has quickly moved in less than four weeks in power to overhaul Venezuelan society in ways sought by the United States, earning high praise from US President Donald Trump .

Along with her brother, National Assembly President Jorge Rodriguez, she has passed a new law opening up the country's critical oil sector to private investments – a key demand of Trump.

The move on Thursday was almost immediately followed by a rollback on US sanctions targeting Venezuela's oil industry.

The government also agreed on January 8, five days after Maduro was seized in a deadly US military operation, to free inmates considered political prisoners by rights groups.

Families – many of whom began camping outside the prisons – and rights groups have criticized the slow pace of the releases, with the Foro Penal NGO counting less than 300 in total released since January 8.

Opposition figures in Venezuela have voiced reserved optimism at the changes taking place, wary that Maduro's closest allies still remain in power.

Nobel Peace Prize laureate Maria Corina Machado said Friday that Rodriguez's amnesty proposal came only after she was pushed by Washington.

"This is not a voluntary gesture by the regime, but a response to pressure from the United States government. And I hope that the prisoners will soon be able to be with their families," she posted on social media.

Opposition lawmaker Tomas Guanipa, whose two brothers are imprisoned, said he hope the amnesty would end "an era of repression."

"May this be the beginning of a path that leads us to freedom and democracy, definitively and forever," he told AFP in an interview at his home in Caracas.

US authorities on Friday announced that all Americans known to be held prisoner in Venezuela had been released.

The announcement came hours after the release of Peruvian-American political prisoner Arturo Gallino Rullier, whom the Foro Penal group said was on his way to the United States.

For years, Venezuela has routinely arrested foreigners and domestic opposition actors on a range of charges from spying to plotting attacks – charges critics dismiss as fabricated.

In a sign of Trump's satisfaction with the new Venezuelan authorities, his administration lifted a ban on US flights to the South American country.

And after years of the US embassy being shuttered, Washington is also preparing to re-establish its diplomatic presence in Caracas.

Seasoned diplomat Laura Dogu was recently named US charge d'affaires for Venezuela – the highest level representative below an ambassador.

Dogu is expected to arrive in Caracas on Saturday, diplomatic sources told AFP.</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 07:32:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/5af68142-fe45-11f0-b037-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/17256d9719472ab9bfb1c2fa45b4e6c32ca296a4.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Indonesia landslide death toll rises to 49, agency says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/indonesia-landslide-death-toll-rises-49-agency-says-2026-01-31/</link><description>JAKARTA, Jan 31 (Reuters) - The death toll from a landslide a week ago in Indonesia's West Java province has risen to 49, the country's main rescue agency Basarnas said on Saturday, with 15 still missing.

Twenty-three soldiers were also killed while conducting border patrol training, the navy said on Tuesday.

The January 24 landslide that hit Pasir Langu village in the Bandung Barat was triggered by heavy rains. The landslide followed cyclone-induced floods and landslides on the island of Sumatra late last year that killed 1,200 people and displaced over one million residents.

The rescue agency extended the emergency response period for seven days to February 6.

Basarnas had its funding cut by a parliamentary panel on Wednesday, despite concerns over the number of disasters the agency has to deal with.</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 07:51:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7Z7VQWI3CJK5FEXZ5CBZAFAISU.jpg?auth=5f2d8f0a5d27d8b7212c554f9dbab1ca59b7ddb7bebced65839963706e959741&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran president says Trump, Netanyahu, Europe stirred tensions in protests</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-president-says-trump-netanyahu-europe-stirred-tensions-protests-2026-01-31/</link><description>Jan 31 (Reuters) - Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said on Saturday that U.S., Israeli and European leaders had exploited Iran's economic problems, incited unrest and provided people with the means to "tear the nation apart” in recent protests.

The two-week long nationwide protests, which began in late December over an economic crisis marked by soaring inflation and rising living costs, have abated after a bloody crackdown by the clerical authorities that U.S.-based rights group HRANA says has killed at least 6,563, including 6,170 protesters and 214 security forces.

Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi told CNN Turk that 3,100, including 2,000 security forces, had been killed.

The U.S., Israeli and European leaders tried to "provoke, create division, and supplied resources, drawing some innocent people into this movement," Pezeshkian said in a live state TV broadcast.

U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly voiced support for the demonstrators, saying the U.S. was prepared to take action if Iran continued to kill protesters. U.S. officials said on Friday that Trump was reviewing his options but had not decided whether to strike Iran.

Israel's Ynet news website said on Friday that a U.S. Navy destroyer had docked at the Israeli port of Eilat.

Trump, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Europeans "rode on our problems, provoked, and were seeking — and still seek — to fragment society," said Pezeshkian.

"They brought them into the streets and wanted, as they said, to tear this country apart, to sow conflict and hatred among the people and create division," Pezeshkian said.

"Everyone knows that the issue was not just a social protest," he added.

Regional allies including Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia have been engaging in diplomatic efforts to prevent a military confrontation between Washington and Tehran.

The U.S. is demanding that Iran curb its missile programme if the two nations are to instead resume talks, but Iran has rejected that demand.

Foreign Minister Araqchi said in Turkey on Tuesday that missiles would never be the subject of any negotiations.

In response to U.S. threats of military action, Araqchi said Tehran was ready for either negotiations or warfare, and also ready to engage with regional countries to promote stability and peace.

"Regime change is a complete fantasy. Some have fallen for this illusion," Araqchi told CNN Turk. "Our system is so deeply rooted and so firmly established that the comings and goings of individuals make no difference."</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 09:29:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/R4X4WMN3PFNWZJ46HQSQYMWUCU.jpg?auth=613700e4aaef77a4559a23eb8aaa05ad01f407efcb0f2ceaad0fc9e006efeca5&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>French fishermen repurpose used nets to help Ukraine protect against drone attacks</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260131-french-fishermen-repurpose-used-nets-help-ukraine-protect-drone-attacks</link><description>"These fishing nets were used to catch monkfish, a strong fish that hits the net hard," said Christian Abazou from the Brittany-based NGO Kernic Solidarités.

One airstrike hit an apartment in Gaza City killing three children and two women, according to a family member and the official Palestinian news agency WAFA. Another airstrike hit a tent in Khan Younis, further south, according to WAFA.

The Israeli military said it was looking into the report and did not immediately say whether it had carried out airstrikes in the enclave.

Video showed charred, blackened and destroyed walls at an apartment in a multi-storey building, and debris scattered inside it and outside on the Gaza City street.

"We found my three little nieces in the street, they say ceasefire and all, what did those children do, what did we do?" said Samer al-Atbash, a relative.

Israeli fire has killed more than 500 people, most of them civilians according to Gaza health officials, since a U.S.-brokered truce between Palestinian militant group Hamas and Israel took effect in October after two years of war .

Palestinian militants have killed four Israeli soldiers since the truce, according to Israeli authorities.

On Friday, the Israeli military said that its forces identified eight gunmen emerging from a tunnel in Rafah , in southern Gaza. Three of them were killed and a fourth, whom it described as a key Hamas commander in the area, was arrested.

The two sides have traded blame over truce violations, even as Washington presses them to proceed to the next phases of the ceasefire deal meant to end the war for good.

The next phase of U.S. President Donald Trump's plan includes complex issues such as Hamas disarmament , which the group has long rejected, further Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and the deployment of an international peacekeeping force.

Gaza's main gateway, the Rafah border crossing with Egypt that has been largely shut during the war, is expected to reopen on Sunday .</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 09:52:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/AZHVMLGAQFMQHKDPFHPFWMRPFA.jpg?auth=e7dc01be6fc3da67793e1b8945b5d17ed2fe7e8810599496c6edbdedf59a48b8&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Thousands flee northwest Pakistan after mosques warn of possible military action</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/thousands-flee-northwest-pakistan-after-mosques-warn-possible-military-action-2026-01-31/</link><description>BARA/KARACHI, Pakistan, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of people have fled a remote mountainous region in northwestern Pakistan in recent weeks, residents said, after warnings broadcast from mosques urged families to evacuate ahead of a possible military action against Islamist militants.

Residents of the Tirah Valley, in the Pakistani province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa that borders Afghanistan, said they have moved out of the area into nearby towns despite heavy snowfall and cold winter temperatures because of the announcements to avoid the possible fighting.

"The announcements were made in the mosque that everyone should leave, so everyone was leaving. We left too," said Gul Afridi, a shopkeeper who fled with his family to the town of Bara located 71 km (44 miles) east of the Tirah Valley.

Local officials in the region, who asked to remain unidentified, said thousands of families have fled and are being registered for assistance in nearby towns.

The Tirah Valley has long been a sensitive security zone and a stronghold for Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, an Islamist militant group that has carried out attacks on Pakistani security forces.

The Pakistani government has not announced the evacuation nor any planned military operation.

On Tuesday, Pakistan's Defence Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif denied any operation was planned or underway in Tirah, calling the movement a routine seasonal migration driven by harsh winter conditions.

However, a Pakistani military source with knowledge of the matter said the relocation followed months of consultations involving tribal elders, district officials and security authorities over the presence of militants in Tirah, who they said were operating among civilian populations and pressuring residents.

The source asked to remain unidentified as they are not authorized to speak to the media.

The source said civilians were encouraged to temporarily leave to reduce the risk of harm as "targeted intelligence-based operations" continued, adding there had been no build-up for a large-scale offensive due to the area's mountainous terrain and winter conditions.

Pakistan's military media wing, the Inter-Services Public Relations, the interior ministry, and the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provincial government did not respond to requests for comment made on Friday.

Residents rejected suggestions that winter alone drove the movement.

"No one left because of the cold," said Abdur Rahim, who said he left his village for Bara earlier this month after hearing evacuation announcements. "It has been snowing for years. We have lived there all our lives. People left because of the announcements."

Gul Afridi described a perilous journey through snowbound roads along with food shortages that made the evacuation an ordeal that took his family nearly a week.

"Here I have no home, no support for business. I don't know what is destined for us," he said at a government school in Bara where hundreds of displaced people lined up to register for assistance, complaining of slow processes and uncertainty over how long they would remain displaced.

Abdul Azeem, another displaced resident, said families were stranded for days and that children died along the way. "There were a lot of difficulties. People were stuck because of the snow," he said.

The Tirah Valley drew national attention in September after a deadly explosion at a suspected bomb-making site, with officials and local leaders offering conflicting accounts of whether civilians were among the dead.</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 09:53:03 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4LLIDQPKRNLQHNZUWG6JH2FOSE.jpg?auth=06785e09330ab7bbb70f666e3386bf1105c74522df75a9365f8dd568829a7980&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China's corruption watchdog probing emergency management minister</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-corruption-watchdog-probing-emergency-management-minister-2026-01-31/</link><description>Jan 31 (Reuters) - China's minister of emergency management, Wang Xiangxi, is being investigated for suspected "serious violations of discipline and law," a common euphemism for corruption, the anti-graft watchdog said on Saturday as a purge of senior officials continues.

The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection did not provide details in its statement on Wang, a Communist Party secretary. It is relatively rare for a sitting minister to undergo investigation.

In President Xi Jinping’s years-long corruption purge, the defence ministry announced last week it was investigating the nation's top general, Zhang Youxia, who is second only to Xi in the military leadership.

Xi said this month that anti-corruption is a battle China must not lose, following a record 65 probes into high-ranking officials last year, while scrutiny has expanded to former leaders of universities and state-owned enterprises.

Wang, 63, took office in July 2022, after serving as chairman of state-owned power generator National Energy Investment Corp.

He appeared on Tuesday, speaking at a regular internal meeting where cadres engage in self-criticism, according to an official release from the Ministry of Emergency Management.

The corruption watchdog announced an investigation into Sun Shaocheng, the former Party secretary of the Inner Mongolia autonomous region, according to state-owned media China Daily.</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 09:53:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/PM6P77CI55M57BPQAJUNKW76IE.jpg?auth=1e5266aa2557f732cfabfd7c81db387465d41433bb981c8091653fb151bc6154&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Dozens killed in Baloch separatist attack in southwest Pakistan</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260131-dozens-killed-in-baloch-sepratist-attack-in-southwest-pakistan</link><description>At least 10 security officials and 37 militants were killed as ethnic Baloch separatists launched "coordinated" attacks across Pakistan 's Balochistan province on Saturday, an official said, the latest violence in the insurgency-hit southwest region.

Pakistan has been battling a separatist insurgency in Balochistan for decades, where militants target state forces, foreign nationals and non-locals in the mineral-rich southwestern province bordering Afghanistan and Iran .

"The terrorists ... launched coordinated attacks this morning at more than 12 locations", a senior security official said on condition of anonymity as he was not authorised to speak to the media.

"Thirty-seven terrorists have been eliminated... Ten security personnel were martyred while a few others were injured," the official added.

A senior security official based in the provincial capital of Quetta said at least four policemen were killed in Quetta, although it was not clear whether they were included in the 10 officials killed.

A senior military official based in Islamabad confirmed the attacks, adding they were "coordinated but poorly executed".

The attacks "failed due to poor planning and rapid collapse under effective security response", the official added.

Separatists had also abucted the deputy commissioner of Nushki district, a senior official in Quetta said.

Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif praised the security forces for "foiling coordinated attacks" in 12 locations.

"I, along with the entire nation, am proud of our martyrs," Sharif said in a statement accusing India of backing the separatists.

"We will continue the war against terrorism until its complete eradication from the country," he said.

At least four police officials in as many districts confirmed that the situation was not completely under control yet.

Mobile phone services have been jammed and traffic disrupted in the affected districts, while train services have been suspended across the province.

The Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), the most active militant separatist group in the province, claimed responsibility for the attacks in a statement sent to AFP.

The group claimed to target military installations and police and civil administration officials during gun attacks and suicide bombings, adding that major highways were also blocked to disrupt the military's operation.

In Quetta, an AFP journalist heard several explosions as heavy security was deployed across the city, with major roads deserted and business activity shut down.

"Since morning, there have been explosions one after another," Abdul Wali, a 38-year-old private employee, said as he struggled to find blood for his hospitalised mother.

"The police point guns at us and say go back otherwise they beat us. What should we do?" he added.

Saturday's attacks come a day after the military said it had killed 41 insurgents in two separate operations in the province.

Balochistan is Pakistan's poorest province, despite an abundance of untapped natural resources, and lags behind the rest of the country in education, employment and economic development.

Baloch separatists have intensified attacks on Pakistanis from neighbouring provinces working in the region in recent years, as well as foreign energy firms, which they believe are exploiting the province's riches.

Pakistan routinely accuses neighbouring India and Afghanistan of fomenting militancy.

"Throughout the operation, the terrorists were reportedly in continuous contact with their handlers in Afghanistan," the security official said.

Last year, ethnic Baloch separatists attacked a train with 450 passengers on board, sparking a two-day siege during which dozens of people were killed.</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 10:28:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/4c341cd6-fe87-11f0-a6ca-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/8ad3e8510b89b341c1573ef4570f8860ac833f9f.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Moldova hit by widespread power cuts amid Ukraine grid problems</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/moldova-hit-by-widespread-power-cuts-amid-ukraine-grid-problems-2026-01-31/</link><description>CHISINAU, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Moldova's energy system was hit by an emergency outage on Saturday due to problems in neighbouring Ukraine's grid, officials said, with the capital Chisinau and other parts of the country experiencing power cuts.

According to a Moldovan energy ministry statement on the Telegram app, disruptions in Ukraine's grid led to a voltage drop on one of the power lines into Moldova.

Most districts in Moldova's Chisinau were without electricity supplies, the city mayor Ion Ceban said on Telegram, with officials adding that even traffic lights were not working.

Ukrainian energy officials have yet to comment on the situation. Emergency power cuts have also been introduced in some parts of Ukraine, power company DTEK said, and the metro in Kyiv has stopped operating.

The grid emergency has also led to a temporary halt to Kyiv's water supply, officials said.

Ukraine's power grid has been one of the main targets of months of Russian strikes, and there have been significant restrictions to power supplies for consumers there for weeks.</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 10:52:21 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Cubans under siege as US stranglehold sets in</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/cubans-under-siege-us-stranglehold-sets-2026-01-31/</link><description>HAVANA, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Cubans from all walks of life are hunkering into survival mode, navigating lengthening blackouts and soaring prices for food, fuel and transport as the U.S. threatens a stranglehold on the communist-run nation.

Reuters interviewed over three dozen residents of towns and neighborhoods around the capital Havana – the country's political and economic engine - from street vendors to private sector workers, taxi drivers and state employees.

Together, those discussions paint a picture of a people pushed to the limit as goods and services - particularly those tied to ever more limited fuel supplies - become scarcer and more expensive.

For much of rural Cuba, this is not entirely new. The island's frail and antiquated power generation system has been slowly failing for years and residents have grown accustomed to spending hours at a time without functioning electricity , internet or water pumps.

But the seaside capital, where the streets are lined with 1950s-era cars and colorful if decrepit Spanish colonial architecture, has until recently fared better.

Now crisis looks set to swamp it, too, as fuel shortages take hold, with first Venezuela , then Mexico halting oil shipments to the island.

U.S. President Donald Trump has said tariffs will be imposed on imports from countries that supply Cuba with oil, ratcheting up the pressure on Washington's long-time foe in the wake of the ousting of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, a key Cuban ally, in early January.

In many other countries, the conditions would have sent people out into the streets. So far, in a nation where dissent has long been curbed, there has been little sign of protest. But it is unclear how much more Cubans will be willing to endure.

Cuba's peso has lost more than 10% of its value against the dollar in three weeks, pushing up the price of groceries.

"This has put me in an impossible situation," said Yaite Verdecia, a Havana resident and housewife. "There's no salary that can cope with this."

Trump, when asked about the prospect of a U.S. military intervention in Cuba shortly after the capture of Maduro, said he did not think an attack was necessary because "it looks like it's going down."

On Friday, Cuba's Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez declared an "international emergency" in response to the U.S. tariff warning, which he said constituted "an unusual and extraordinary threat."

But the government has said little about how it will manage the growing threat of humanitarian crisis.

Many of the Cubans Reuters spoke with said daily life - already difficult - had been reduced to basics like assuring food, fuel for cooking, and water, and that it had become noticeably harder in recent days.

Lines for gasoline have grown significantly this week at a handful of service centers in the city still supplied with fuel. And since the U.S. blocked Venezuelan deliveries of oil to Cuba in mid-December, virtually all gas has been sold at a premium, in dollars - a currency to which few Cubans have access.

"It used to be that you could sign up and get fuel once a month (in pesos)," said Havana resident Jesus Sosa, referring to an app that would let residents know when it was their turn to fill up their cars. "Not anymore. Sales in national currency have stopped."

The crunch has hit both public and private transportation, putting some buses and private taxis out of business and forcing others to raise their prices.

Daylan Perez, a 22-year-old who hails private taxis for clients in old Havana, said fewer buses mean people now have no choice but to pay rising fees for private transport.

"You have to pay the price or stay home," he said.

Even transportation by electric vehicle - once thought to be a panacea in a city short of fuel - has been hit by blackouts that now last for eight to 12 hours or more.

Taxi driver Alexander Leyet of Havana swapped to an electric three-wheeled taxi recently, thinking he had outsmarted the pack.

"Now because of the blackouts I can only charge my taxi for four or five hours," he said.

For decades, the government that has its roots in Fidel Castro's 1959 Cuban Revolution has survived despite sometimes brutal economic struggles, upending regular predictions of imminent collapse or an uprising.

It has long alleged a U.S.-led effort to foment revolt, but the most recent widespread protests were in the pandemic year of 2021, despite a 12% contraction of the economy between 2019 and 2024.

Sharp crackdowns on any form of dissent, combined with the emigration of between one and two million people since the pandemic, have all but eliminated organized in-country opposition. The Cubans interviewed by Reuters generally declined to answer questions about the prospect of protests.

But none of those interviewed disputed that change was necessary.

"I'm just praying God finds a way to get us out of this (mess)," said Mirta Trujillo, a 71-year-old street vendor from Guanabacoa who burst into tears as she told Reuters she could no longer afford food. Previously, she had depended on a ration book of basic goods provided by the government, but that was phased out post-pandemic as tourist income and other sources of hard currency dried up.

"I'm not against my country... but I don't want to die of hunger," she said.

On a recent weekday evening, Reuters witnessed an accident at a busy intersection in Havana where the stoplights were not functioning as a result of a power outage.

"Sometimes when the power goes out, accidents happen because the traffic lights don't work," said Raysa Lemu, whose apartment overlooks a boulevard in Marianao, on the outskirts of Havana.

"It used to be they turned off the power two or three times a week, but now it's every day and sometimes it's up to 12 hours."

Julia Anita Cobas, a 69-year-old housekeeper from Guanabacoa, gets up at 4 a.m. each morning for a 10-mile (16-km) commute that now approaches four hours round-trip. With less public transportation available, the journey has become longer and more costly.

"I leave my house before sunrise and I don't know how I'll get back," she said.

But Cobas, who was born just before Castro's revolution, said she had no expectation that Trump would make things any better.

"Since I was born the (United States) has been threatening us, and every day we deal with hardship. But we've survived it all," she said.

Aimee Milanes, a 32-year-old resident of Reparto Electrico, just outside Havana, said neither the Cuban nor the U.S. government offered her much hope.

"We're drowning. But there's nothing we can do," said Milanes. "This is about survival. Nothing else."</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 11:20:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/EU4GIFNX7RL4XOMZLGHJT35TVA.jpg?auth=3e1a72443b77e9d6e1059a5ba667b2a6e895c4f7d1dfd42086c86d6c92804358&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'Technical malfunction' causes mass power outages in Ukraine</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260131-technical-malfunction-causes-mass-power-outages-in-ukraine</link><description>Ukraine 's power grid experienced mass outages on Saturday after a "technical malfunction" caused electrical lines between Moldova , Romania and Ukraine to fail, Ukraine's energy minister said.

The malfunction "caused a simultaneous shutdown of the 400 kilovolt line between the power grids of Romania and Moldova and the 750 kilovolt line between western and central Ukraine", Denys Shmygal said on Telegram.

Problems ​in Ukraine's ⁠power grid also led to the emergency ​shutdown ‍of Moldova's ​energy system on Saturday, Moldova's ​energy ministry said.

The latest outages come amid recent Russian attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure that have caused major disruptions to heat, electricity and water provision as the country faces a particularly harsh winter.

Due to the power shortages on Saturday, Kyiv 's metro system temporarily closed, the operator said.

The Kyiv metro is a vital transport artery for the capital and rarely pauses operations, even during intense Russian bombardment.

Around 800,000 passengers use the system daily, according to data published last year. Many of them rely on it to commute to work.

Residents also use its 52 stations as bomb shelters during Russian attacks.

"Due to a power outage from external power supply centres, train service and escalator operation have been temporarily suspended in the metro," Kyiv Metro said in a post on Facebook.

The system will serve as a shelter until power resumes, Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko said in a post on Telegram.

Russia has hit Ukrainian energy infrastructure throughout its nearly four-year invasion, but Kyiv says this winter has been the toughest yet, as attacks cut power and heating to millions during sub-zero temperatures.

The Kremlin said Friday said that President Vladimir Putin had agreed to stop striking Kyiv for a week until Sunday following a request from US counterpart Donald Trump .</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 11:24:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/f5db951e-fe93-11f0-b136-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-30T174851Z-1518836082-RC2PBJAM6D77-RTRMADP-3-UKRAINE-CRISIS-COLD-KYIV.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Nigeria's Fela Kuti is first African musician honoured with Grammys Lifetime Achievement award</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/culture/20260131-fela-kuti-first-african-honored-grammys-lifetime-achievement-award-afrobeat</link><description>Afrobeat legend Fela Kuti to make history as first African honoured with posthumous Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. After a lifetime of clashes with successive powers in Nigeria , the recognition comes nearly three decades after Fela's death and long after his influence reshaped global music.

He is one of several artists getting the award at a ceremony in Los Angeles on Saturday, the eve of the main Grammys gala.

Others are Cher, Whitney Houston, Carlos Santana, Paul Simon and Chaka Khan.

In the 1970s, Fela the multi-instrumentalist and full-of-life performer invented Afrobeat: a mixture of jazz , funk and African rhythms.

That laid the groundwork for Afrobeats – a later genre that has attracted a global audience by blending traditional African rhythms with contemporary pop sounds, with its roots in Nigeria.

Two years ago the Grammys introduced the category of Best African Performance in 2024 and it has been dominated by Afrobeats artists, especially from Nigeria.

Of the five nominees for the Best African performance this year, three are Nigerian Afrobeats singers, after another Nigerian, Tems, won last year.

"Fela's influence spans generations, inspiring artists such as Beyonce, Paul McCartney and Thom Yorke, and shaping modern Nigerian Afrobeats," said a citation on the Grammys list of this year's honourees.

Known also as the "Black President", the activist and legendary musician, died in 1997 at the age of 58.

His legacy lives on through his sons, Femi Kuti and Seun Kuti, and grandson Made.

"This acknowledgment coming at this time when all three of us are present. It feels wonderful," Grammy-nominated Made Kuti said.

"It feels wonderful that all of us are still practicing Afrobeat, still taking the legacy as far as we can take it."

Yemisi Ransome-Kuti, Fela's first cousin and head of the family, said on Friday the award was "a celebration for the African people and they should take (it).. as their award. Another African is being celebrated."

"But we also want to send a message to those who are giving these acknowledgements, please ...not wait till people are dead," she said.

As to what would have been Fela's reaction, Ransome-Kuti said: "I'm sure he would have said better late than never" although "in his lifetime he was not particularly interested in being recognised in the external world, particularly the western world".

Fela was arrested frequently by military governments during his career, sometimes for political activism and sometimes also on allegations of theft, which he denied.

His first brush with the law dated back to 1974 when he released his famous album "Zombie", generally considered by the military authorities in power as a diatribe levelled at them.

His songs were long, defiant and explicitly anti-governments in power and anti-corruption.

His manager, Rikki Stein, speaking on the phone from Los Angeles where he will join the Kuti family at the ceremony, was confident the award would "significantly uplift Fela's music".

"Fifty albums out there. I'm sure it's going to continue onward and upward."

"An increasing number of people what weren't even born when Fela died are expressing interest in listening to Fela's music and hopefully Fela's message," he said</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 11:44:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/32de12d0-fe98-11f0-9909-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP8609130557-1.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Drone strikes in Ethiopia's Tigray region kill one, injure another</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/drone-strikes-ethiopias-tigray-region-kill-one-injure-another-2026-01-31/</link><description>Jan 31 (Reuters) - One person was killed and another injured in drone strikes in Ethiopia's northern Tigray region on Saturday, a senior Tigrayan official and a humanitarian worker said, in another sign of renewed conflict between regional and national forces.

Ethiopia's national army fought fighters from the Tigray People's Liberation Front for two years until late 2022, in a war researchers say killed hundreds of thousands through direct violence, the collapse of healthcare and famine.

Fighting broke out between regional and national forces in the disputed territory of western Tigray earlier this week, according to diplomatic and government sources .

The senior Tigrayan official said the drone strikes hit two Isuzu trucks near Enticho and Gendebta, two places in Tigray about 20 kilometres apart. A humanitarian worker confirmed the strikes had happened. Both asked not to be named.

The Tigrayan official said the Ethiopian National Defence Force launched the strikes but did not provide evidence.

A spokesperson for the ENDF did not respond to a request for comment.

It was not immediately clear what the trucks were carrying.

TPLF-affiliated news outlet Dimtsi Weyane posted pictures on Facebook which it said showed the trucks damaged in the strikes. It said the trucks were transporting food and cooking items.

Pro-government activists posting on social media said the trucks were carrying weapons.

Earlier this week national carrier Ethiopian Airlines cancelled flights to Tigray, where residents rushed to try to withdraw cash from banks.

The Tigray war ended with a peace pact in November 2022, but disagreements have continued over a range of issues, including contested territories in western Tigray and the delayed disarmament of Tigray forces.</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 12:50:02 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Explosion occurs at Iran's southern port of Bandar Abbas, Iranian media reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/explosion-occurs-irans-southern-port-bandar-abbas-iranian-media-reports-2026-01-31/</link><description>Jan 31 (Reuters) - An explosion occurred at Iran's southern port of Bandar Abbas on Saturday, Iranian media reported, without giving a cause for the blast.

The semi-official Tasnim news agency said that social media reports alleging that a Revolutionary Guard navy commander was targeted in the explosion were "completely false".

Iranian media said the blast was being investigated but gave no further information. Iranian authorities could not immediately be contacted for comment.

The port of Bandar Abbas lies on the Strait of Hormuz, a vital waterway between Iran and Oman which handles about a fifth of the world's seaborne oil.

The reported explosion comes amid heightened tensions between Tehran and Washington after Iranian authorities quelled the biggest protests to convulse the country in three years, and also amid ongoing Western concerns over Iran's nuclear programme.

The nationwide protests erupted in December over economic hardship and posed one of the toughest challenges to the country's clerical rulers.

At least 5,000 people were killed in the protests, including 500 members of the security forces, an Iranian official told Reuters.

U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday an "armada" was heading toward Iran . Multiple sources said on Friday that Trump was weighing options against Iran that include targeted strikes on security forces.

Earlier on Saturday, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian accused U.S., Israeli and European leaders of exploiting Iran's economic problems, inciting unrest and providing people with the means to "tear the nation apart”.</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 12:50:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HBQRDVLZZNOOLEZID2WCMW545E.jpg?auth=0b5d5d815aa14e48446b7c52410d4cfe59a4cc3ff5ce7cb84d5c54e466383810&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Pakistan says 67 militants killed after coordinated attacks in Balochistan</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/pakistan-says-67-militants-killed-after-coordinated-attacks-balochistan-2026-01-31/</link><description>QUETTA, Pakistan, Jan 31 (Reuters) - At least 67 militants were killed on Saturday as they battled Pakistan's security forces in multiple cities across the southwestern province of Balochistan, four security officials told Reuters.

Some 10 police and security personnel and 11 civilians were also killed during the orchestrated militant attacks, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Twenty-four police officers were injured.

The military's media wing did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Pakistan's Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, in a statement, condemned the attacks and praised security forces for repelling them, saying they had killed dozens of militants.

The attacks came a day after Pakistan's military said it killed 41 militants in separate raids in Balochistan, which borders Iran and Afghanistan and has faced a decades-long separatist insurgency.

The banned separatist group Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for Saturday's attacks, saying it had launched them simultaneously across the province. The BLA said it had killed 84 Pakistan security personnel.

Security officials said armed men launched attacks in several urban areas, including the provincial capital Quetta and the port city of Gwadar, prompting operations by the army, police and counterterrorism units.

Hospitals were placed on emergency footing in some districts, officials said.

In Gwadar, militants attacked a camp accommodating migrant workers, killing 11 people, Atta-ur-Rehman, a senior police officer said, revising an earlier death toll of five. Those killed included five men, three women and three children..

Security forces killed six militants in Gwadar after responding to the attack, he said.

Officials said the situation was critical in Noshki, a district of Balochistan, after militants abducted the area's top civil administrator. He said in a social media video that he was in the custody of the militants. Reuters could not independently verify the video.

Armed men briefly blocked roads in parts of Quetta and a blast was heard near a high-security area, authorities said, though they later said the situation had been brought under control.

Security officials said in text messages that forces had responded effectively to the attacks and that clearance operations were still underway.

Balochistan is Pakistan's largest but poorest province and has faced a decades-long insurgency by ethnic Baloch militant groups. Pakistan says the violence is backed by foreign actors, a charge denied by India.</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 13:43:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israeli strikes kill at least 30 across Gaza in one of highest tolls since October ceasefire</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260131-israeli-strikes-kill-30-palestinians-including-children-gaza-ceasefire-inches-forward</link><description>Hospitals in Gaza said Israeli strikes killed at least 30 Palestinians Saturday, one of the highest tolls since the October ceasefire aimed at stopping the fighting.

A day after Israel accused Hamas of new ceasefire violations, strikes hit locations throughout Gaza, including lethal ones on an apartment building in Gaza City and a tent camp in Khan Younis, officials at hospitals that received the bodies said.

The casualties included two women and six children from two different families. An air strike also hit a police station in Gaza City, killing at least 14 and wounding others, Shifa Hospital director Mohamed Abu Selmiya said.

The series of strikes also came a day before the Rafah crossing along the border with Egypt is set to open in Gaza’s southernmost city . All of the territory’s border crossings have been closed throughout almost the entire war. Palestinians see Rafah as a lifeline for the tens of thousands in need of treatment outside the territory, where the majority of medical infrastructure has been destroyed.

The crossing's opening, limited at first, marks the first major step in the second phase of the US-brokered ceasefire. Reopening borders is among the challenging issues on the agenda for the phase now underway, which also include demilitarising the strip after nearly two decades of Hamas rule and installing a new government to oversee reconstruction.

Still, Saturday’s strikes are a reminder that the death toll in Gaza is still rising even as the ceasefire agreement inches forward.

Nasser Hospital said the strike on the tent camp caused a fire to break out, killing seven, including a father, his three children and three grandchildren. Meanwhile, Shifa Hospital said the Gaza City apartment building strike killed three children, their aunt and grandmother on Saturday morning, while the strike on the police station killed at least 14 – officers, including four policewomen, civilians and inmates held at the station. The hospital also said a man was killed in a strike Saturday in the eastern side of Jabaliya refugee camp.

Hamas called Saturday's strikes “a renewed flagrant violation” and urged the United States and other mediating countries to push Israel to stop strikes.

Israel’s military, which has struck targets on both sides of the ceasefire’s dividing line, said its attacks since October have been responses to violations of the agreement. It said in a statement that Saturday’s strikes followed what it described as ceasefire violations a day earlier, when the army killed at least four militants emerging from a tunnel in an Israeli-controlled area of Rafah.

The number reported killed Saturday was several times higher than the daily average since the ceasefire began. As of Friday, Gaza’s Health Ministry had recorded at least 520 Palestinians killed by Israeli fire since the start of the ceasefire on October 10. The ministry, which is part of the Hamas-led government, maintains detailed casualty records that are seen as generally reliable by UN agencies and independent experts.</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 13:46:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/b61a3024-fea3-11f0-9b72-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26031346989500.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Four killed in gas blast in residential building in Iran's Ahvaz, media reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/four-killed-gas-blast-residential-building-irans-ahvaz-media-reports-2026-01-31/</link><description>Jan 31 (Reuters) - Four people were killed after a gas explosion at a residential building in Iran's Ahvaz, the state-run Tehran Times reported citing the head of the city's fire department.</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 14:27:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/J2OT46IMSVO2LHG3HHCW3T5WGM.jpg?auth=1bb42dc711388997fd45b2f1aac58ca16ebd233c55b315fd77faa5f6343d7aff&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Hungary's Orban denies need for spending cuts after April election</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/hungarys-orban-denies-need-spending-cuts-after-april-election-2026-01-31/</link><description>BUDAPEST, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban denied on Saturday that he will have to impose austerity measures to rein in the budget deficit if he wins an election in April, and said his right-wing Fidesz party would keep its flagship spending policies in place.

In power since 2010, the veteran nationalist is lagging a centre-right challenger in most opinion polls and battling the weakest economic stretch of his 16-year rule, with the economy nearly stagnant since Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine caused inflation across central Europe.

Economists say whoever wins the April 12 ballot will have little choice but to tighten purse strings after heavy pre-election spending.

"That's a flat-out lie," Orban told a campaign rally, citing economists' view of Hungary's finances. "The state of the Hungarian economy does not require any kind of austerity."

Late last year, Orban's government raised its budget deficit targets to 5% for 2025 and the 2026 election year to make way for pre-election spending, steps which contributed to Fitch Ratings cutting its outlook on Hungary's debt to negative.

Orban said Hungary's budget deficit, which has exceeded government forecasts in recent years, would have to be lowered "calmly, slowly and gradually" as economic prospects improve.

"We need no austerity and nothing should be taken away from the people", Orban said. He said a 3% subsidised mortgage rate or a plan to exempt mothers of two from income tax by the end of the next government cycle would remain intact if he is elected.

With Fidesz trying to fend off centre-right rival Tisza, Orban's government has launched a 100 billion forint ($310 million) scheme to help the restaurant industry and a 50 billion forint ($160 million) measure to curb household heating bills.

Data released on Friday showed Hungary's economy mired in near-stagnation for a third year, underperforming nearby Poland and the Czech Republic. Some analysts have lowered their 2026 growth outlook after the weak figures.

The party said at a convention in the city of Calgary on Saturday that Poilievre won 87.4% of votes cast in the review mandated after the Liberal Party, led by Prime Minister Mark Carney, defeated the Conservatives in the election last April.

Under Poilievre, the Conservatives had held a more than 20-point lead over the Liberals last January but U.S. President Donald Trump’s repeated threats to make Canada the 51st U.S. state united much of the country behind Carney.

Poilievre lost his own seat in the election but returned to parliament after winning a by-election in August.

Before the leadership review, Ashton Arsenault, a former ministerial staffer under ex-Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper, said Poilievre should aim to win at least 75% of the vote to demonstrate the party’s confidence in his leadership.

"That lets every outside observer and party member know that people are behind (Poilievre) and this is the horse we’re riding with in the next election," Arsenault said.

According to the pollster Angus Reid, Carney’s approval rating among Canadians is now at 60%, his highest such rating since he became the Liberal leader.

Although 80% of Conservative voters support Poilievre, who is 46 and has been party leader since 2022, views of him among the wider public are more negative, with 58% holding an unfavourable view of him.</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 16:30:32 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/MOX3ZNCOWBK77H2ZNI3SFIVZCI.jpg?auth=ca128faa121bd5fa77c19b710557fd86cec0bc4167b480509c6536d66f4c1637&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Italy investigates church painting of angel restored to look like Meloni</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/italy-investigates-church-painting-angel-restored-look-like-meloni-2026-01-31/</link><description>ROME, Jan 31 (Reuters) - An angel in a church in central Rome has been restored to look like Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, a national newspaper reported on Saturday, prompting the culture ministry to investigate and Meloni to laugh off the affair.

In a front-page story, la Repubblica daily was the first to note that one of two angels in a chapel of the Basilica of St Lawrence in Lucina had been altered to resemble the 49-year-old conservative, Italy's first female prime minister.

The article ran with before-and-after pictures of the painting. It said the angel had previously looked like a "generic cherub".

The culture ministry said it had instructed Rome's top art heritage official to carry out a same-day inspection of the restored painting before "deciding what to do next".

The opposition Five Star Movement complained: "We cannot allow art and culture to risk becoming a tool for propaganda or anything else, regardless of whether the face depicted is that of the prime minister."

The parish priest, Daniele Micheletti, told ANSA news agency that the decorations in the chapel had recently been touched up following water damage. The originals dated only to 2000, so were not under any heritage protection.

The restoration was carried out by the same artist who created the original painting, Bruno Valentinetti. He disputed the suggestion he had altered the image, telling reporters: "I restored what was there before... 25 years ago".

As for Meloni, she posted a picture of the disputed painting on Instagram, with the caption "No, I definitely don't look like an angel", with a laughing emoji.</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 16:57:03 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/VGXAFFMD6JMFFET44ILLWCFC3A.jpg?auth=f78e4aadee9bfe7117dfb828ab67040b5cfab7042264795f75ce3e3863868eab&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'Creeping fascism': Milan protesters slam ICE deployment at Winter Olympics</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260131-creeping-fascism-milan-protesters-slam-ice-deployment-at-winter-olympics</link><description>Hundreds of demonstrators gathered Saturday in Milan to protest the deployment of ICE agents during the upcoming Winter Olympics , despite the fact that agents would be stationed in a control room and not operating on the streets .

The protest in Piazza XXV Aprile, a square named for the date of Italy’s liberation from Nazi fascism in 1945, drew people from the left-leaning Democratic Party, the CGIL trade union confederation and the ANPI organisations that protect the memory of Italy’s partisan resistance during World War II , along with many other people.

Organisers handed out plastic whistles, which participants blew as music blared from a van. The protest was as much against the news that agents from a division of ICE would participate in security for the US delegation as against what many saw as creeping fascism in the United States.

“No thank you, from Minnesota to the world, at the side of anyone who fights for human rights ,’’ read one banner. “Never again means never again for anyone,’’ read another, and “Ice only in Spritz’,’ a reference to a popular aperitif, read yet another.

News of the deployment of ICE agents has provoked a backlash in Italy. Milan Mayor Giuseppe Sala has said they were not welcome. Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi has been called to Parliament to testify about the deployment this week.

Protester Silvana Grassi held a sign that read “Ice = Gestapo.” She said the scenes of ICE agents in Minneapolis shooting and killing protesters and detaining children were deeply upsetting.

“It makes me want to cry to think of it,’’ Grassi said. “It’s too terrible. How did they elect such a terrible, evil man?’’

The ICE agents to be deployed to Milan are not from the same unit as the immigration agents cracking down in Minnesota and other US cities.

Homeland Security Investigations, a ICE unit that focuses on cross-border crimes, frequently sends its officers to overseas events like the Olympics to assist with security. The ICE arm at the forefront of the immigration crackdown in the US is known as Enforcement and Removal Operations, and there is no indication its officers are being sent to Italy.

“Even if it’s not the same ones, we don’t want them here,’’ Grassi said.

Paolo Bortoletto, also holding a banner, was aware that the officers would have an investigative and not a street role.

Still, he said, “We don’t want them in our country. We are a peaceful country. We don’t want fascists. It’s their ideas that bother us."

The Olympics begin February 6 with an opening ceremony that will be attended by US Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio .</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 16:58:02 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/fd87ebcc-febc-11f0-ab2d-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26031540142092.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Morocco deploys army to help evacuate thousands after floods</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/morocco-deploys-army-help-evacuate-thousands-after-floods-2026-01-31/</link><description>RABAT, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Morocco has deployed army rescue units to help with the evacuation of thousands of people after floods triggered by torrential rains and rising river levels hit parts of the country's northwest, state TV reported on Saturday.

Weeks of heavy rainfall, combined with water releases from a nearly full dam nearby, increased water levels in the Loukous River and flooded several neighbourhoods in the city of Ksar Kbir, about 190 km (118 miles) north of the capital Rabat, a national flood follow-up committee said.

More than 20,000 people had been moved to shelter and camps by Saturday, official media reported.

Authorities set up sandbags and temporary barriers in flood-prone districts as waters began to recede.

Schools in Ksar Kbir have been ordered to remain closed until February 7 as a precaution.

In the nearby province of Sidi Kacem, the Sebou River's rising levels prompted evacuations from several villages as authorities raised vigilance levels.

The abundant rainfall ended a seven-year drought that drove the country to invest heavily in desalination plants.

The average dam-filling rate has risen to 60%, with several major reservoirs reaching full capacity, according to official data.

Last month, 37 people were killed in flash floods in the Atlantic coastal city of Safi , south of Rabat.</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 17:49:22 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Protesters in Copenhagen rally for Danish veterans after Trump remarks</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/protesters-copenhagen-rally-danish-veterans-after-trump-remarks-2026-01-31/</link><description>COPENHAGEN, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Hundreds of Danes gathered outside the U.S. Embassy in Copenhagen on Saturday in support of veterans who said they had been insulted by President Donald Trump's comment that European allies had kept "off the front lines" in the Afghanistan war.

Denmark, with a population less than 2% the size of the United States, was one of the major combat allies in the U.S.-led war in Afghanistan, losing 44 service members killed, a per capita death toll on par with that of the Americans themselves.

Trump had already antagonised Danes by demanding the annexation of Greenland, a semi-autonomous territory of the Danish kingdom, when he made the remarks last week questioning the role of NATO allies during the conflict.

The remarks sparked widespread backlash from Europeans, with Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer calling them "insulting and frankly appalling". Trump subsequently singled out British troops for praise, but stopped short of apologising or addressing the role of European troops more broadly.

"Behind all these flags, there's a guy, there's a soldier, there's a young man," said retired Danish Lieutenant-Colonel Niels Christian Koefoed, who served in Afghanistan, as demonstrators planted Danish flags embroidered with the names of the deceased outside the U.S. Embassy.

The protesters, many wearing medals received for their NATO service, marched to the embassy, where the names of Danish soldiers killed in Afghanistan and Iraq were read aloud. The event concluded with a moment of silence.

"I lost a very close friend and colleague of mine," said Afghanistan veteran Jesper Larsen. "So I was hurt by what Mr Trump said, and I think he owes all my combat friends an apology."</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 18:33:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/IA5FQDOKLRL2JO7XPLNQWLWRPI.jpg?auth=5d8b2e9563c438bbfa81f8da27d07beb9dfe72d99c5221556f9787618c4fd2a9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump’s policies ‘erodes the fabric of global cooperation’, ex-Swedish PM Bildt says</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260131-trump-s-policies-erodes-the-fabric-of-global-cooperation-ex-swedish-pm-bildt-says</link><description>&gt;&gt; Click on video player above to watch the full interview</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 18:36:44 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/80b6733c-fecd-11f0-a1c9-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260131-180206-182104-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Zelenskiy says Ukraine is getting ready for new peace talks next week</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/zelenskiy-says-ukraine-is-getting-ready-new-peace-talks-next-week-2026-01-31/</link><description>Jan 31 (Reuters) - President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Saturday that Ukraine was waiting for more information from the United States about further peace talks and expected new meetings to take place next week.

Zelenskiy's statement during his nightly video address appeared to suggest that a meeting scheduled for Sunday in the United Arab Emirates between representatives of Ukraine, Russia and the United States would not take place. The three sides held a round of talks a week ago.

"We are in constant communication with the American side and are expecting specific details from them regarding further meetings," Zelenskiy said.

"Ukraine is ready to work in all working formats. It is important that there be results and that the meetings take place. We are counting on meetings next week and are preparing for them."

U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff led a team of representatives in talks in Florida on Saturday with Kremlin envoy Kirill Dmitriev and described the discussions as "productive and constructive."

The U.S. has been spearheading diplomatic efforts to end the war, launched nearly four years ago by the Kremlin's invasion of its smaller neighbour.

Witkoff has singled out the question of territory as the key to making progress in the negotiations, with Kyiv rejecting Moscow's demand that it cede all of the Donbas region, including areas its army has not captured.

Kremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov said this week that land was not the sole key issue under discussion but did not identify other unresolved issues.</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 19:22:33 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/PVACHLFTVVKTTDJFYODHGSNMTM.jpg?auth=05d8f6b11473924cfe5a5fa20a13ca6d06182a4b8fa6c2a5abb6b761f932c1bb&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UK’s Starmer says ex-Prince Andrew should testify before Congress over Epstein ties</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uks-starmer-says-ex-prince-andrew-should-testify-before-congress-over-epstein-2026-01-31/</link><description>TOKYO, Jan 31 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on Saturday that the former Prince Andrew should testify before a U.S. congressional committee, following new revelations about Andrew's links to the late financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

New files related to Epstein published by the U.S. justice department on Friday included emails that showed King Charles's brother maintaining regular contact with Epstein for more than two years after he was found guilty of child sex crimes.

The files also include pictures appearing to show Andrew crouching over and touching the waist of an unidentified woman lying on the floor. Her face was blacked out in the redacted images.

The king stripped his brother of his title of prince and evicted him from his mansion in the grounds of Windsor Castle in November, in the wake of previous revelations about his links with Epstein.

The former prince, 65, now uses the family name Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor. He has denied wrongdoing in connection with Epstein and had previously denied maintaining ties with the financier after Epstein's 2008 conviction, apart from a 2010 visit to New York to end their relationship.

He did not reply to a Reuters request for comment on the latest revelations. Buckingham Palace declined to comment.

Starmer, speaking to reporters on the plane to Japan after a four-day visit to China , said the former prince should appear before U.S. lawmakers to explain everything he knows about Epstein to help his victims.

"Anybody who has got information should be prepared to share that information in whatever form they are asked to do that,” Starmer said. "You can’t be victim centred if you’re not prepared to do that."

In November, members of a U.S. congressional committee investigating the Epstein case intensified their calls for Andrew to answer questions.

Epstein died by suicide in 2019 in a Manhattan jail while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. He was jailed in 2008 for soliciting paid sex from a minor.

The files show Andrew maintained regular contact with Epstein after his conviction, including discussing potential business deals and social meetings.

In several emails, Epstein and Andrew discuss women that the financier proposes to put in touch with the prince. In one email, Epstein offered to bring three women to Buckingham Palace.</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 20:26:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/SCDTIH2QXJMRVPXFLDXS264SEY.jpg?auth=115658303f8031c035fe22e14f40f629a349883f3998eab7e2a72c35620fcf92&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iraq's Shi'ite bloc reaffirms backing for Maliki despite Trump's warnings</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iraqs-shiite-bloc-reaffirms-backing-maliki-despite-trumps-warnings-2026-01-31/</link><description>Jan 31 (Reuters) - Iraq's alliance of Shi'ite political blocs, the Coordination Framework, reaffirmed on Saturday its support for former premier Nouri al-Maliki to lead the next government, despite a warning from U.S. President Donald Trump that Washington would no longer help Iraq if Maliki returned to power.

The bloc, which holds a majority in parliament, picked Maliki , Iraq's first elected prime minister after a U.S.-led invasion toppled Saddam Hussein in 2003, as its nominee for the post following an election .

"The choice of the prime minister is a purely Iraqi constitutional matter and should proceed without foreign interference," the Coordination Framework said in a statement, adding that it seeks balanced relations with international partners based on mutual respect.

Trump's threats are the starkest example yet of the Republican president's campaign to curb Iran-linked groups' influence in Iraq, which has long walked a tightrope between its two closest allies, Washington and Tehran.</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 20:27:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7GKVTFRZ5BI5PEV7EIR63MT2SY.jpg?auth=33dff3ba3956c8a3ff45d136784295d3cae412fb8ca881cc05abc5a8236dd9dc&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US envoy Witkoff holds ‘constructive’ Ukraine talks with Russia</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260131-us-envoy-witkoff-holds-constructive-ukraine-talks-with-russia</link><description>US envoy Steve Witkoff said Saturday he had held constructive talks with a Russian envoy in Florida as part of Washington's drive to end the war in Ukraine .

The meeting came just a day before Ukrainian and Russian negotiators were scheduled to meet in Abu Dhabi to discuss a US-backed plan to halt the nearly four-year conflict that began with Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

"Today in Florida, the Russian Special Envoy Kirill Dmitriev held productive and constructive meetings as part of the U.S. mediation effort toward advancing a peaceful resolution of the Ukrainian conflict," Witkoff posted on X.

"We are encouraged by this meeting that Russia is working toward securing peace in Ukraine," he added.

US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, President Donald Trump 's son-in-law Jared Kushner and White House Senior Advisor Josh Gruenbaum also attended the talks, he said.

Earlier Saturday, a source close to the talks had told AFP that they had started at 8:00 am (1300 GMT) and that Dmitriev had arrived in Miami.

Neither side released details of what was discussed.

Dmitriev, Russian President Vladimir Putin 's top economic envoy, met Witkoff and Kushner earlier in January on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.

He also held talks with US negotiators on Ukraine in a visit to Miami in December.

The second round of talks in Abu Dhabi are set to start on Sunday, even if Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky suggested earlier this week that it might be postponed because of the US-Iran crisis.

Zelensky said in his evening address Saturday his negotiators were also waiting to hear from the United States on further meetings.

"Ukraine is ready to work in all working formats," said Zelensky. "It is important that there are results and that the meetings take place. We are counting on meetings next week and are preparing for them."

Teams from Ukraine and Russia met Friday and Saturday last week in Abu Dhabi in their first in-person negotiations on a plan being pushed by Trump.

The United States says both sides are close to a deal, but they have so far been unable to find a compromise on the key issue of territory in a post-war settlement, according to Kyiv.

The Kremlin on Friday said Putin had agreed to a pause on striking Kyiv -- ending Sunday -- following a request by Trump.</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 20:52:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/a59538c6-fee3-11f0-b2a1-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26029832554221.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Deadly blast rips Iranian port city as Tehran plans naval drills in Strait of Hormuz</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260131-deadly-blast-rips-iranian-port-city-as-tehran-plans-naval-drills-in-strait-of-hormuz</link><description>An explosion tore through an apartment building Saturday in Iran 's port city of Bandar Abbas, killing a 4-year-old girl as local media footage purportedly showed a security force member being carried out by rescuers.

The blast happened a day before a planned naval drill by Iran in the Strait of Hormuz , the narrow mouth of the Persian Gulf through which a fifth of all oil traded passes. Already, the US military had warned Iran not to threaten its warships or commercial traffic in the strait, on which Bandar Abbas sits.

State television quoted a local fire official as blaming the blast on a gas leak. Media reported at least 14 others suffered injuries in the explosion at the eight-story building, which blew out windows and covered the street below in debris.

A local newspaper, Sobh-e Sahel, aired footage of one of its correspondents speaking in front of the building. The footage included a sequence that showed a man in black boots and a green security force uniform being carried out on a stretcher. He wore a neck brace and appeared to be in pain, his left hand covering the branch insignia on his uniform.

The local newspaper did not acknowledge the security force member being carried out elsewhere in its reporting. Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard itself did not discuss the blast, other than to deny that a Guard navy commander had been hurt in the explosion.

Another explosion blamed on a gas explosion Saturday in the southwestern city of Ahvaz killed five people, state media reported.

It comes as Iran remains tense over a threat by US President Donald Trump to potentially launch a military strike on the country over the killing of peaceful protesters or the possible mass execution of those detained in a major crackdown over the demonstrations.

Ali Larijani, a top security official in Iran, wrote on X late Saturday that “structural arrangements for negotiations are progressing.” However, there is no public sign of any talks with the United States, which Iran's 86-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has repeatedly ruled out.</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 20:52:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/3bed7d40-fecd-11f0-b8ac-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-31T135958Z-507358427-RC2ACJAE8D5D-RTRMADP-3-IRAN-CRISIS-USA.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Qatari PM meets Iran's Larijani in Tehran, discusses easing regional tensions</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/qatari-pm-meets-irans-larijani-tehran-discusses-easing-regional-tensions-2026-01-31/</link><description>Jan 31 (Reuters) - Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani met with top Iranian security official Ali Larijani in Tehran and reviewed efforts to de-escalate tensions in the region, Qatar's foreign ministry said on Saturday in a statement.</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 21:22:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HC4U4YBF6BNLHCMGR4TJIOWWAQ.jpg?auth=210b258168ff277f19ad0a440e8a02c1c661421190c856e9d039e26361b3acba&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Judge orders release of 5-year-old, father detained in Minnesota ICE raid</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/judge-orders-release-5-year-old-father-detained-minnesota-ice-raid-2026-01-31/</link><description>DETROIT, Jan 31 (Reuters) - A federal judge has ordered the release of Adrian Conejo Arias and his five-year-old son, Liam Conejo Ramos, whom immigration officers detained during a Minnesota raid.

The boy — seen in a now viral photo that showed him wearing a blue bunny hat outside his house as federal agents stood nearby — was one of four students detained by immigration officials earlier this month in a Minneapolis suburb, according to the Columbia Heights Public School District.

"The case has its genesis in the ill-conceived and incompetently-implemented government pursuit of daily deportation quotas, apparently even if it requires traumatizing children," U.S. District Judge Fred Biery wrote in a ruling published on Saturday.

"Ultimately, Petitioners may, because of the arcane United States immigration system, return to their home country, involuntarily or by self-deportation. But that result should occur through a more orderly and humane policy than currently in place."

The Ecuadorean boy and his father, who entered the United States legally as asylum applicants, were sent to a family detention facility in Dilley, Texas, their attorney Marc Prokosch previously told Reuters .

Prokosch and the Department of Homeland Security did not immediately return requests for comment.

Armed and masked officers detained two 17-year-olds and a 10-year-old in addition to Liam, school district Superintendent Zena Stenvik said last week.</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 21:45:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/TBIWWWBB6NJCDAUTZZGTNGJ7BQ.jpg?auth=ccefa05895a64c413db7db0a924836dcb1439a2a0175802c9fb8f4a801e3a819&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Top US envoy for Venezuela arrives in Caracas</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/top-us-envoy-venezuela-arrives-caracas-2026-01-31/</link><description>BUENOS AIRES, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Laura Dogu, the top U.S. envoy for Venezuela, arrived on Saturday in Caracas as the two countries gradually resume bilateral relations, broken in 2019 by Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.

In a post on Telegram, Venezuelan foreign affairs minister Yván Gil said that her visit is meant to "establish a roadmap on matters of bilateral interest" and "resolve existing differences through diplomatic dialogue and through a base of mutual understanding and international law."

Dogu, who previously served as ambassador to Honduras and Nicaragua, wrote on X that she had arrived in Venezuela and that "my team and I are ready to work."

The U.S. captured Maduro on January 3 and brought him to New York for arraignment in court on narcoterrorism charges. Delcy Rodriguez, Venezuela's interim president, has since said she seeks to move towards "balanced and respectful international relations" with the United States.

The two countries have reached a deal to export up to $2 billion worth of Venezuelan crude to the United States, and on Friday Rodriguez announced a proposed "amnesty law" for hundreds of prisoners in the country and said the Helicoide detention center in Caracas would be turned into a center for sports and social services.</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 22:23:49 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Australian boy killed by shark in Sydney Harbour honoured at Bondi Beach</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/australian-boy-killed-by-shark-sydney-harbour-honoured-bondi-beach-2026-01-31/</link><description>Feb 1 (Reuters) - An Australian boy who died after being bitten by a shark in Sydney Harbour was honoured in a surfing ceremony at Bondi Beach on Sunday, following a series of shark attacks along the country's east coast.

Nico Antic, 12, died in hospital on January 24, six days after being attacked when he and his friends jumped off rocks in Vaucluse, around 9 km (5.5 miles) from Sydney's central business district. Friends pulled him from the water with severe injuries to both legs.

On Sunday, a community "paddle-out" at Bondi Beach honoured Nico, with aerial Australian Broadcasting Corp. footage showing paddle boarders and surfers forming a large circle in the ocean.

Local surf lifesavers, as well as school friends and relatives, took part, local media reported.

Dozens of beaches, including in Sydney, were closed in January after four shark attacks in two days, as heavy rains left water murky and more likely to attract sharks.

In September, a surfer was killed by a large shark at Sydney's Long Reef Beach.

Australia averages 20 shark attacks a year, fewer than three of them fatal, according to data from conservation groups. Those numbers are dwarfed by drownings on the country's beaches.</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 23:46:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/VYTMER6LEVMX5FOZ25MJY5K2PA.jpg?auth=036776e7143189f5aa6d6a06aaa0861a558cd44b8b8f7f0b55f7f4e869a3d85f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Exclusive: US special envoy for Iraq Mark Savaya no longer in the post, sources say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/us-special-envoy-iraq-mark-savaya-no-longer-post-sources-say-2026-02-01/</link><description>WASHINGTON/RIYADH, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Mark Savaya, named by U.S. President Donald Trump as special envoy for Iraq in October, is no longer in that role, sources familiar with the move said.

The move comes amid growing tensions between Washington and Baghdad over Washington's push to curb Iranian influence in Iraqi politics.

Savaya, a Christian Iraqi-American entrepreneur, was among a handful of Arab Americans named to senior posts by Trump, who campaigned heavily during the 2024 presidential election to win the Arab and Muslim vote in Detroit and around the country.

It was not immediately clear what prompted Savaya's departure or whether a replacement would be appointed.

One of the sources pointed to Savaya's "mishandling" of key situations, including his failure to prevent the nomination of former Iraqi prime minister Nouri al-Maliki to be the country's next premier, a move Trump openly warned Baghdad against.

U.S. ambassador to Turkey and special envoy to Syria Tom Barrack, who traveled to Erbil earlier this week to meet with Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, is believed to be taking over the State Department's Iraq portfolio, according to the source and a senior Iraqi official.

A spokesperson for Barrack declined to comment.

The State Department referred queries to the White House, which declined to comment on Savaya's status or any replacement.

Reached by Reuters on Thursday, Savaya denied any change in his role, saying that he was still working on administrative procedures required for him to officially assume the role, but a source familiar with the matter said Savaya never became an employee of the State Department.

Savaya's X account, which was active until recently, has not been available since Thursday.

He did not respond to follow-up messages on Friday and Saturday asking him to clarify whether he was still in his appointed role and explain why his X account was taken down.

Savaya, who ran a cannabis business in Detroit and has close ties to Trump, was a surprising choice for envoy because he has no diplomatic experience. He has not traveled to Iraq officially since being named to the role, two of the sources said.

He was set to visit Iraq and hold meetings with senior officials last Friday, but abruptly canceled them, two Iraqi officials said.

The personnel move comes days after Trump warned Iraq that if it again chose Maliki as its prime minister, Washington would no longer help the major oil producer and close U.S. ally. Maliki, accused by the U.S. of stoking sectarian strife and allowing the rise of the Islamic State during his time in office, had been tapped for the role by Iraq's largest parliamentary bloc days earlier.

Trump's comments were the starkest example yet of his campaign to curb the influence of Iran-linked groups in Iraq, which has long walked a tightrope between its two closest allies, Washington and Tehran.</description><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2026 04:41:33 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US may make a deal on Cuba, Trump says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/us-may-make-deal-cuba-trump-says-2026-02-01/</link><description>ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE, Jan 31 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Saturday that he believed the United States would "work a deal" on Cuba.

His comments came days after threatening tariffs on any country supplying Cuba with oil.

Trump reiterated his call for Cuba to negotiate with the United States.

"It doesn't have to be a humanitarian crisis," Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One en route to Florida.

"I think they probably would come to us and want to make a deal ... They have a situation that's very bad for Cuba. They have no money. They have no oil. They lived off Venezuelan money and oil, and none of that's coming now."

In 2025, Venezuela was Cuba's largest oil supplier , meeting roughly one-third of the island's daily needs. Supply from Venezuela dropped following the U.S. blockade on shipments from there, even before the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.

Reuters exclusively reported in January that Mexico, Cuba's top supplier after Venezuela cut off shipments in December, was reviewing whether to continue sending oil amid fears it could face retaliation from Washington.</description><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2026 04:41:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4EPB4EACRFMXZONLMSDLPASLKU.jpg?auth=08295237c0a5f5e872af66223a62676da674522e681f1006abf0ee1dc1c8914a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Malaysia seizes $129.9 million in crude oil from tankers suspected of illegally transferring oil</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/malaysia-seizes-1299-million-crude-oil-tankers-suspected-illegally-transferring-2026-02-01/</link><description>SINGAPORE, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Two tankers suspected of illegal ship-to-ship oil transfers were detained and more than 512 million ringgit ($129.9 million) worth of crude oil seized 24 nautical miles west of Muka Head, Penang last week, the Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency said on Saturday.

The agency did not specify the origin of the oil being transferred.

The waters off Malaysia are known as a regular site for illegal ship-to-ship transfers, where oil is shifted between tankers at sea to obscure its origin. Malaysian authorities said in July last year they would more tightly enforce rules around the practice.

The seized tankers, worth 718 million ringgit, were carrying 53 Chinese, Burmese, Iranian, Pakistani and Indian crew members. The two captains of the ships were arrested and handed over to Penang state maritime investigation officials, the agency said.

Maritime Captain Muhammad Suffi Mohd Ramli said the tankers at anchor were inspected after a patrol boat received a complaint at about 1 a.m. local time on Thursday. The ships were found in a coupled position and suspected of carrying out transfer activities.

The captain added that the tankers are being investigated for anchoring without permission, which carries a penalty of 100,000 ringgit, and carrying out illegal ship-to-ship transfer activities, which carries a penalty of 200,000 ringgit per vessel.

The EU marked a symbolic shift in its approach to Iran's leadership on Thursday by designating the Revolutionary Guards as a terrorist organisation , following what turned out to be the Islamic Republic's bloodiest crackdown of protests since its establishment in 1979.

"By trying to hit the Revolutionary Guards ... the Europeans actually shot themselves in the foot and once again made a decision against the interests of their people by blindly obeying the Americans," Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf told his fellow MPs, all wearing Revolutionary Guards uniforms in support to the elite force.

"According to Article 7 of the law on countermeasures against the designation of the Revolutionary Guards as a terrorist organisation, the armies of European countries are considered terrorist groups."

Qalibaf added that the national security parliamentary commission would deliberate on the expulsion of EU countries' military attaches and follow up on the issue with the foreign ministry.

Set up after Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution to protect the Shi'ite clerical ruling system, the Revolutionary Guards have great sway in the country, controlling swathes of the economy and armed forces.</description><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2026 07:02:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/26FDYIHLPJNZPDCN4JRYAPOUAE.jpg?auth=c111821270964e70a321b8b7ff186e0cd14b6a446f64bfe876745bc6b5937939&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran says it now considers all EU armies to be 'terrorist groups'</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260201-live-qatar-s-top-diplomat-holds-talks-in-iran-aiming-to-reduce-tensions</link><description>Iran speaker of parliament has said that the Islamic Republic now considers all European Union militaries to be terrorist groups.

The reopening comes amid ongoing violence in the Palestinian territory , with Gaza's civil defence agency reporting dozens killed in Israeli attacks on Saturday, while the Israeli military said it was retaliating against ceasefire violations.

The Rafah crossing is a vital gateway for both civilians and aid, but has remained closed since Israeli forces seized control of it in May 2024 during the war with Hamas , aside from a brief and limited reopening in early 2025.

Israel had previously said it would not reopen the crossing until the remains of Ran Gvili – the last Israeli hostage held in Gaza – were returned.

His remains were recovered days ago and he was laid to rest in Israel on Wednesday.

"The Rafah Crossing will open this coming Sunday (February 1st) in both directions, for limited movement of people only," COGAT, an Israeli defence ministry body overseeing civil affairs in the occupied Palestinian territories, said on Friday.

Entry and exit "will be permitted in coordination with Egypt, following prior security clearance of individuals by Israel, and under the supervision of the European Union mission", it added.

However, key details remain unclear, including how many people will be allowed to cross and whether those seeking to return to Gaza will be permitted entry.

A source at the border told AFP that Sunday would be largely devoted to preparations and logistical arrangements.

The crossing is set to open on Sunday on a trial basis to allow the passage of wounded individuals, ahead of a regular reopening scheduled for Monday, three sources at the crossing said.

However, no agreement has yet been reached on the number of Palestinians permitted to enter or exit, the sources added, noting that Egypt plans to admit "all Palestinians whom Israel authorises to leave" the territory.

"Every day that passes drains my life and worsens my condition," said Mohammed Shamiya, 33, who suffers from kidney disease and requires dialysis treatment abroad.

"I'm waiting every moment for the opening of the Rafah land crossing."

Safa al-Hawajri, who has received a scholarship to study overseas, is also eagerly awaiting the reopening on Sunday.

"I'm waiting in the hope of fulfilling my ambition, which is tied to the reopening of the crossing," said Hawajri, 18.

"I hope to be able to travel as soon as it opens."

Located on Gaza's southern border with Egypt, Rafah is the only crossing into and out of the territory that does not pass through Israel.

The crossing lies in an area held by Israeli forces following their withdrawal behind the so-called "Yellow Line" under the terms of a US-brokered ceasefire that came into effect on October 10.

Israeli troops still control more than half of Gaza, while the rest remains under Hamas authority.

The ceasefire has now entered its second phase and calls for reopening the crossing following the release or return of all Israeli hostages held by Palestinian militants.

Hamas had called for its full reopening in both directions after the remains of Gvili were brought back to Israel.

The reopening is expected to facilitate the entry of a 15-member Palestinian technocratic body, the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG), established to oversee the day-to-day governance of the territory's 2.2 million residents.

The committee is to operate under the supervision of the so-called " Board of Peace " chaired by US President Donald Trump .

The NCAG, headed by former Palestinian Authority deputy minister Ali Shaath, is expected to enter the Gaza Strip once the Rafah crossing reopens.

Violence continued ahead of the crossing's reopening.

At least 32 people, including children, were killed on Saturday in Israeli air strikes in Gaza, reported the civil defence agency, which operates as a rescue force under the Hamas authority.

Israel's military said the strikes were retaliation for an incident on Friday in which eight Palestinian fighters exited a tunnel in the city of Rafah, which it said violated the ceasefire.</description><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2026 07:04:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/8a26da18-ff1a-11f0-91e2-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/245d1587ec05ed1f7d71455eead73bf6c20cc6c2.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia's Shoigu, China's Wang Yi to discuss security issues</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/russias-shoigu-chinas-wang-yi-discuss-security-issues-2026-02-01/</link><description>MOSCOW, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Russian Security Council Secretary Sergei Shoigu arrived in China on Sunday where he will meet Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi to discuss security issues, Russian media outlets reported on Sunday citing the Russian Security Council.

All three are angling to add to their trophy cabinets by taking home the gala's most coveted award, Album of the Year, for the first time.

Lamar, the Pulitzer Prize-winning rapper, has nine nominations this time around for his album "GNX" – the most of any artist.

The 38-year-old California native, who won five gramophones last year thanks to his smash diss track "Not Like Us," is also up for Record and Song of the Year for "Luther" featuring R&amp;B artist SZA.

Pop chameleon Lady Gaga and Puerto Rico 's Bad Bunny also are competing in all three top categories.

Also nominated for Album of the Year are: pop princess Sabrina Carpenter; R&amp;B singer-songwriter Leon Thomas; Tyler, the Creator; hip-hop duo Clipse (Pusha T and Malice); and pop superstar Justin Bieber – with his first studio effort in four years.

Lady Gaga, Bieber, Carpenter and Bruno Mars are set to lead a starry list of performers that also includes Lauryn Hill and a tribute to late rocker Ozzy Osbourne featuring Post Malone.

Standing in Lamar's way for Album of the Year is Bad Bunny, who is on a world tour in support of his album "Debi Tirar Mas Fotos" (I Should Have Taken More Photos) after a hugely successful residency in San Juan.

"It was a very exciting album," musicologist Lauron Kehrer told AFP.

"It touched on so much in terms of thematic material and musical material," Kehrer said, pointing to the allusions to decolonization and use of traditional Puerto Rican rhythms.

The 31-year-old Latin megastar, born Benito Antonio Martinez Ocasio, will headline the Super Bowl halftime show a week after the Grammys, where he is up for six awards .

His "Un verano sin ti" (2022) was the first Spanish-language album nominated for Album of the Year honors. A win on Sunday would give Bad Bunny another mention in the history books.

Lady Gaga, 39, made a splashy comeback to touring with "Mayhem," her collection of pop bangers with a dark edge that embraces her dramatic side. She has seven nominations.

A win for Album of the Year would complete her hat trick of top awards.

She took Record and Song of the Year honors seven years ago for the soundtrack hit "Shallow," from "A Star is Born" – which also earned her an Oscar.

This time around, Song of the Year – which honors songwriting – is a crowded category that includes Carpenter's "Manchild" and "Golden" from the Netflix animated smash hit "KPop Demon Hunters."

Many pundits believe the energetic K-pop hit will triumph.

Up for best new artist are Alex Warren, girl group Katseye, Britain's Olivia Dean, TikTok dancer-turned-singer Addison Rae, The Marias, sombr, Lola Young and Thomas.

For musicologist Kehrer, the infusion of rap, reggaeton and K-pop in the top Grammy categories reflects changes in the composition of the Recording Academy's voting group.

More than 3,800 new members have been admitted. Half of those new members are age 39 or younger, and 58 percent of them are people of color, the academy says.

Invitations were also offered to all members of the Latin Recording Academy.

"The Grammys are more reactionary than anything else," said Kehrer.

"These artists winning those major awards is more of an indication of climate, rather than trying to move or change the climate."

The Grammy Awards will once again be hosted by comedian Trevor Noah.

The main broadcast begins at 5:00 pm (0100 GMT Monday), but many of the 95 awards will be handed out at a pre-gala event.</description><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2026 07:56:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/e797a73a-ff11-11f0-aaa7-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/b606b7c8ad88d2c6d0828c04d0984f3cf08f8a1a.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Musk says steps to stop Russia from using Starlink have worked</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/sustainable-finance-reporting/musk-says-steps-stop-russia-using-starlink-have-worked-2026-02-01/</link><description>Feb 1 (Reuters) - Elon Musk said on Sunday that steps SpaceX had taken to stop the 'unauthorized' use of Starlink by Russia seemed to have worked.

"Capgemini considered ‍that the usual legal constraints imposed in ​the United States on contracting with federal entities conducting classified ‌activities did not allow the Group to exercise ‍appropriate control over certain aspects of this subsidiary's operations in order to ensure alignment with the Group's objectives," it said ‍in a statement.

It said the divestment process "will be initiated immediately".

The group's contract with ICE was first revealed by independent media outlet l’Observatoire des multinationales.

It found Capgemini sold “skip tracing” services – a form of data-driven locating and tracking of individuals whose whereabouts are unknown – used by ICE to verify home and work addresses and support removal operations as part of a large-scale anti-immigration crackdown .

The framework agreement is capped at over $365 million, with nearly $4.8 million already committed.

Capgemini, which operates in around 50 countries, convened an emergency board meeting this weekend. In an internal message sent to employees, the group specified that the disputed contract, awarded in December, "was the subject of an appeal."

According to the group Capgemini Government Solutions represents 0.4% of the group's estimated revenue in 2025 and less than 2% of its revenue in the United States.</description><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2026 09:34:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/09bba20c-f301-11f0-8378-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26016127809169.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Tehran warns of regional conflict if US attacks Iran</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/tehran-warns-regional-conflict-if-us-attacks-iran-2026-02-01/</link><description>DUBAI, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said that if the U.S. attacked Iran it would become a regional conflict, state media reported on Sunday, amid heightened tensions between Washington and Tehran.

The U.S. has built up its naval presence in the Middle East after President Donald Trump repeatedly threatened Iran with intervention if it did not agree to a nuclear deal or failed to stop killing protesters.

"(Trump) regularly says that he brought ships (...) The Iranian nation shall not be scared by these things, the Iranian people will not be stirred by these threats," Khamenei said.

"We are not the initiators and do not want to attack any country, but the Iranian nation will strike a strong blow against anyone who attacks and harasses them."

A diplomatic solution remains on the cards, with Tehran saying it is ready for "fair" negotiations that do not seek to curtail its defensive capabilities.

The U.S. Navy currently has six destroyers, one aircraft carrier, and three littoral combat ships in the region.

The protests, which started in late December over economic hardships but morphed into the most acute political challenge to the Islamic Republic since its establishment in 1979, have now abated after repression.

Before the war, the Rafah border crossing with Egypt was the only direct exit point for most Palestinians in Gaza to reach the outside world as well as a key entry point for aid into the territory. It has been largely shut since May 2024.

COGAT, the Israeli military unit that oversees humanitarian coordination, said the crossing will reopen in both directions for Gaza residents on foot only and its operation will be coordinated with Egypt and the European Union.

"As part of the pilot for the initial operation of the crossing, all involved parties are carrying out a series of preliminary preparations aimed at increasing readiness for full operation of the crossing," COGAT said on Sunday.

"The actual passage of residents in both directions will begin upon completion of these preparations," it added.

A European source close to the EU mission confirmed the details and a Palestinian official said the crossing was expected to open for passengers on Monday. The Egyptian foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Israel has said the crossing would open under stringent security checks only for Palestinians who wish to leave the war-ravaged enclave and for those who fled the fighting in the first months of the war to return.

Many of those expected to leave are sick and wounded Gazans in need of medical care abroad. The Palestinian health ministry has said that there are 20,000 patients waiting to leave Gaza.

An Israeli defence official said that the crossing can hold between 150-200 people altogether in both directions. There will be more people leaving than returning because patients leave together with escorts, the official added.

Lists of Gazans set to pass through the crossing have been submitted by Egypt and approved by Israel, the official said.

Reopening the border crossing was a key requirement of the first phase of U.S. President Donald Trump's plan to end the Israel-Hamas war .

But the ceasefire, which came into effect in October after two years of fighting, has been repeatedly shaken by rounds of violence.

Israeli attacks in Gaza have killed more than 500 Palestinians since the ceasefire, local health officials say, and Palestinian militants have killed four Israeli troops, according to Israeli authorities.

On Saturday, Israel launched some of its most intense airstrikes since the ceasefire, killing at least 30 people, in what it said was a response to a Hamas violation of the truce on Friday when militants emerged from a tunnel in Rafah.

The next phases of Trump's plan for Gaza foresee governance being handed to Palestinian technocrats, Hamas laying down its weapons and Israeli troops withdrawing from the territory while an international force keeps the peace and Gaza is rebuilt.

Hamas has so far rejected disarmament and Israel has repeatedly indicated that if the Islamist militant group is not disarmed peacefully, it will use force to make it do so.</description><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2026 10:27:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/SRKGJJPFPFOD3GCZKDUMP2U5PM.jpg?auth=e0e3c7ec0ffb2daf45adb4a79a5bbd391b3b4442af1304469eb09dcd37867f00&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Icy weather spreads across southern US, disrupting travel</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260131-icy-weather-spreads-disrupting-travel-across-southern-us-states</link><description>The latest bout of extreme weather came about a week after a monster storm pummeled a wide swath of the United States , killing more than 100 people and leaving many communities struggling to dig out from snow and ice.

Heavy snow fell in North Carolina and neighbouring states Saturday, as authorities urged residents to stay off the roads and warned oceanfront structures were threatened by the storm.

All of North and South Carolina, and portions of Georgia, eastern Tennessee and Kentucky, as well as southern Virginia were under a winter storm warning.

North Carolina saw 750 car crashes on Saturday, the highway patrol said.

Faust, North Carolina recorded 14.5 inches (37cm) of snow , while West Critz, Virginia got 12.5 inches. Harrisburg, Tennessee received more than nine inches of accumulation.

In the North Carolina town of Cape Carteret, high winds sent thick snow blowing sideways, prompting the National Weather Service to warn that travel was "Treacherous and Potentially Life-Threatening especially if you become stranded".

In dramatic footage released by police in Gastonia, North Carolina, a train plowed at high speed into a semi-truck that had gotten stuck on the tracks, crushing the vehicle. No one was hurt.

The weekend storm forced more than 1,800 flight cancellations Saturday and Sunday at Charlotte Douglas International Airport in North Carolina, a major hub for American Airlines, data from the tracker FlightAware showed.

A 300-strong "snow team" was working to clear runways, taxiways, roads and sidewalks, the airport said Saturday.

More than 600 flights were cancelled Saturday at Atlanta's international airport, the world's busiest. About 50 flights in and out of Atlanta were cancelled in the early hours of Sunday.

"An explosively deepening coastal cyclone will continue to bring moderate to heavy snow, high winds, and possibly blizzard conditions for the Carolinas," the National Weather Service said Saturday.

"An intense surge of arctic air behind the coastal storm will send below freezing temperatures down toward South Florida by Sunday morning."

Davis, West Virginia recorded the lowest temperature in the lower 48 states on Saturday – a frigid minus 28F (minus 33C).

About 156,000 customers remained without power early Sunday, mostly in the south, according to poweroutage.us, with Mississippi, Tennessee and Louisiana hardest hit.

In North Carolina, the National Park Service announced the closure of campgrounds and some beaches at the Outer Banks, a series of barrier islands off the coast of the southern state that are vulnerable to storms.

It said oceanfront structures were threatened, and a section of highway that threads through its dunes was closed.

In Mississippi, Governor Tate Reeves said the US Army Corps of Engineers helped to install generators at critical sites, and authorities were opening 79 shelters and warming centers across the state.

The freezing weather forced NASA to postpone a key fuelling test over the weekend of the 322-foot (98-metre) rocket that is on the Cape Canaveral launch pad in Florida.

That in turn is likely to push back by at least a couple of days a planned manned Moon fly-by slated for this month.

"Looks like the ​steps we took to stop the ‍unauthorised use of Starlink by Russia have worked. Let us ​know if more needs to be done," ​SpaceX CEO Musk said on X.

Ukrainian defence minister Mykhailo Fedorov said on Thursday that Ukraine is working with SpaceX to stop Russia from guiding drones using Starlink's internet system, after Kyiv said it had found ‍it on long-range drones used in Russian attacks .

"Western technology ​must continue to help the democratic world and protect civilians, rather than being used for terrorism and ‌destroying peaceful cities," Fedorov said on X.

Despite Musk's differences with Ukrainian ‍officials over his views on the war with Russia, Ukraine's military still relies on tens of thousands of Starlinks for battlefield communication and for piloting some drone missions.

Starlink has expanded Musk's geopolitical sway. ‍In 2022 he asserted control over how and where Starlink ‌was being ​used by Ukrainian troops fighting Russian forces.</description><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2026 10:54:48 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/ea9694b2-f0a4-11f0-99d9-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-09T133744Z-1743415173-RC2TZHABHXXX-RTRMADP-3-XAI-GROK-GERMANY.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Zelenskiy says new trilateral talks set for Feb 4-5 in Abu Dhabi</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/zelenskiy-says-new-trilateral-talks-set-feb-4-5-abu-dhabi-2026-02-01/</link><description>KYIV, Feb 1 (Reuters) - A new round of U.S.-brokered trilateral talks between Ukraine and Russia will take place in Abu Dhabi on Feb. 4 and 5, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Sunday, adding that Kyiv was ready for a "substantive discussion".

Kyiv is under U.S. pressure to secure peace in the nearly four-year war while grappling with a Russian campaign of air strikes that has ravaged its energy system during one of the coldest winters in years.

The first round of negotiations took place in late January, but led to no new movement on the vital question of territory, with Moscow still demanding Kyiv cede more land in its war-torn east, which it refuses to do.

Zelenskiy said the new talks would take place on February 4 and 5, and that Ukraine - struggling to stop grinding Russian advances on the battlefield - was ready for a "substantive discussion".

"Ukraine is ready for a substantive discussion, and we are interested in ensuring that the outcome brings us closer to a real and dignified end to the war," Zelenskiy wrote on X.

In the capital Kyiv, 1,000 apartment buildings remained without heating on Sunday, said Mayor Vitali Klitschko, as a new wave of bitter cold swept across much of the country.

Temperatures in the city on Sunday hovered around -15 degrees Celsius, as workers raced to restore heating to hundreds out of the nearly 3,500 high-rises affected by a widespread grid malfunction on Saturday.

Officials did not directly link it to war damage, but the resulting blackouts - which spread to neighbouring Moldova - underlined the vulnerability of Ukraine's energy system after months of Russian attacks.

The Kremlin said two days ago it had agreed to halt strikes on energy infrastructure until Sunday at the request of U.S. President Donald Trump, and Kyiv said it would reciprocate.

Ukraine said the suspension was supposed to last until the following Friday.

The countries have not reported major strikes on their energy systems in recent days, though Zelenskiy said on Sunday that Russia was attempting "to destroy logistics and connectivity between cities and communities" through ongoing air attacks.

In southeastern Ukraine, two people were killed overnight in a drone strike on a residential building in the city of Dnipro, and six people were wounded in an attack on a maternity hospital in Zaporizhzhia, regional officials said.

Temperatures are expected to drop even further on Monday to well below minus 20 degrees Celsius in Kyiv.

Ukrainian private energy firm DTEK said on Sunday it had restored power to 300,000 households in the southern coastal region of Odesa, which had been hit hard by the malfunction.

Grid operator Ukrenergo said late on Saturday that planned outages would be in force throughout the entire country.

Anatoliy Veresenko, a 65-year-old veteran who was out for a run at a Kyiv park, said he was warily anticipating new attacks and did not place much hope in the peace process.

"Talks are talks.

National security adviser Miroslav Lajcak issued a statement denying any wrongdoing and condemning Epstein's crimes. He described the exchange as informal and light-hearted and without any real substance, but said he would offer his resignation so the situation would not be used to attack the prime minister.

"Not because of having done anything criminal or unethical in my actions, but I don't want him (Fico) to bear the political costs for something that's unrelated to his decisions," he said.

Fico announced in a video message on Facebook on Saturday he had accepted Lajcak's resignation, calling the adviser an incredible source of experience in diplomacy and foreign policy.

The U.S. Justice Department on Friday published millions of new files related to Epstein, including a text exchange from October 2018, when Lajcak was Slovakia's foreign minister.</description><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2026 12:52:54 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/FUWJBEZZMNNUTHEBI4LWL3FEHU.jpg?auth=80f3996976df515a8a2101241473880c3db57bd909e4a918275a55296804dd96&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Pope Leo urges US and Cuba to engage in sincere dialogue</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/pope-leo-urges-us-cuba-engage-sincere-dialogue-2026-02-01/</link><description>VATICAN CITY, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Pope Leo said on Sunday he was deeply concerned about rising tensions between the United States and Cuba, and he called for "sincere and effective dialogue" to prevent violence and further suffering for the Cuban people.

U.S. President Donald Trump said last week tariffs would be imposed on imports from countries that supply Cuba with oil, ratcheting up the pressure on Washington's long-time foe after ousting Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, a key Cuban ally, in early January.

Trump said the tariff threat was necessary to protect "U.S. national security and foreign policy from the Cuban regime's malign actions and policies."

Pope Leo said he had received reports "with great concern" of rising tensions between Cuba and the United States. He joined Cuban bishops in "urging those responsible to promote sincere and effective dialogue to avoid violence and further suffering for the Cuban people," in comments after his weekly Angelus prayer.

Last week Trump predicted that "Cuba will be failing pretty soon," adding that Venezuela, once the island's top oil supplier, had not recently sent oil or money to Cuba.

Cuba's Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez declared an "international emergency" in response to the U.S. tariff warning, which he said constituted "an unusual and extraordinary threat."

On Saturday, Trump reiterated his call for Cuba to negotiate with the United States. "It doesn't have to be a humanitarian crisis," he told reporters aboard Air Force One en route to Florida.</description><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2026 12:53:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/NGQYXXDEIVIKNJFUJZXHO4A2HI.jpg?auth=35576ca35e64f758190d8cfc3001674c01e336766eca1f0d56c72732228f329e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Costa Ricans vote as right-wing populists aim to  extend mandate</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/costa-ricans-vote-right-wing-populists-aim-extend-mandate-2026-02-01/</link><description>SAN JOSE, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Costa Ricans will vote in a general election on Sunday as the right-wing populist government seeks to extend its mandate and secure control of Congress at a time when drug-fueled violence has gripped the country.

Laura Fernandez, President Rodrigo Chaves' protege and former chief of staff, is leading in the polls with just over 40%, enough to win outright and avoid an April 5 runoff. She has pledged to continue Chaves’ tough security policies and anti‑establishment message.

Her closest rivals in the 20-person field are Alvaro Ramos, a centrist economist representing Costa Rica's oldest political party, and Claudia Dobles, an architect representing a progressive coalition and a former first lady whose husband, Carlos Alvarado, served as president from 2018 to 2022. Both are polling in the single digits but are seen as the two most likely to compete in a possible runoff if Fernandez falls short of 40%.

Fernandez also has asked voters to hand her 40 seats in the country's 57-seat legislative assembly, a supermajority that would allow her to pursue constitutional reforms.

The current government holds just eight seats and has blamed congressional gridlock for blocking its agenda.

Polls show about a quarter of the 3.7 million voters remain undecided, with the largest group being between the ages of 18-34 and from the coastal provinces of Guanacaste, Puntarenas and Limon.

"People are tired of promises from all the governments, including this one even though the government has said things that are true like needing stronger laws to restore order," said Yheison Ugarte, a 26-year-old deliveryman from downtown Limon, a Caribbean port city that's been the hardest hit by drug violence.

Despite homicides surging to an all-time high during his term and multiple corruption investigations, Chaves remains deeply popular, with a 58% approval rating according to University of Costa Rica's CIEP polling.

While consecutive reelection is not allowed in Costa Rica, Fernandez has vowed to include Chaves in her government and positioned herself as the continuity of his mandate.

Polls opened at 6 a.m. local time (1200 GMT) and will remain open until 6 p.m. with early results expected to come in at 8:45 p.m.</description><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2026 12:53:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4RFETWP3R5MFBBJTHFUAADSMXY.jpg?auth=a4f77f45dc7fcbd6014adc06aa60704ceb323ecbc2921e56ceb2438a69bbd1ee&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Nigerian army says it killed a Boko Haram commander and 10 fighters</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/nigerian-army-says-it-killed-boko-haram-commander-10-fighters-2026-02-01/</link><description>ABUJA, Feb 1 (Reuters) - The Nigerian army said on Sunday it had killed a top Boko Haram commander and 10 other militants during a night operation in northeastern Borno state.

The army identified the leader killed as Abu Khalid and said he was second-in-command of Boko Haram in the Sambisa Forest.

"Abu Khalid was a key figure within the terrorist hierarchy, coordinating operations and logistics in the Sambisa axis," said the army statement.

It said no casualties were recorded among its own troops, and that they continued to conduct clearance operations across the Sambisa Forest, Mandara Mountains, Timbuktu Triangle and other known hideouts of Boko Haram and Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) in the North East region.

Nigeria has been battling Boko Haram and its splinter group ISWAP for over a decade in a conflict that has killed tens of thousands and displaced millions across the Lake Chad region.</description><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2026 12:54:12 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iranian official says Revolutionary Guards have no plan to hold military exercises in the Gulf</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iranian-official-says-revolutionary-guards-have-no-plan-hold-military-exercises-2026-02-01/</link><description>DUBAI, Feb 1 (Reuters) - The naval forces of Iran's Revolutionary Guards have no plan to carry out live-fire exercises in the Strait of Hormuz as reported by some media outlets earlier this week, an Iranian official told Reuters on Sunday.

The blast happened a day before a planned naval drill by Iran in the Strait of Hormuz , the narrow mouth of the Persian Gulf through which a fifth of all oil trade passes. Already, the US military had warned Iran not to threaten its warships or commercial traffic in the strait on which Bandar Abbas sits.

State television quoted a local fire official as blaming the blast on a gas leak. Media reported at least 14 others suffered injuries in the explosion at the eight-story building, which blew out windows and covered the street below in debris.

A local newspaper, Sobh-e Sahel, aired footage of one of its correspondents speaking in front of the building. The footage included a sequence that showed a man in black boots and a green security force uniform being carried out on a stretcher. He wore a neck brace and appeared to be in pain, his left hand covering the branch insignia on his uniform.

The local newspaper did not acknowledge the security force member being carried out elsewhere in its reporting. Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard itself did not discuss the blast, other than to deny that a Guard navy commander had been hurt in the explosion.

Another explosion blamed on a gas explosion Saturday in the southwestern city of Ahvaz killed five people, state media reported.

It came as Iran remains tense over a threat by US President Donald Trump to potentially launch a military strike on the country over the killing of peaceful protesters or the possible mass execution of those detained in a major crackdown over the demonstrations.

Trump on Saturday said Iran was negotiating with the US, even as the Islamic republic's army chief warned Washington against launching military strikes.

"(Iran is) talking to us, and we'll see if we can do something, otherwise we'll see what happens...We have a big fleet heading out there," he told Fox News.

"They are negotiating," Trump said.

Trump added that US allies in region were not being told of plans for possible strikes due to security reasons.

"Well, we can't tell them the plan. If I told them the plan, it would be almost as bad as telling you the plan -- it could be worse, actually," he said.

Qatar's premier Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani, who also serves as the kingdom's foreign minister, held talks with Iran's top security official Ali Larijani in Tehran on Saturday to try to "de-escalate tensions in the region" said the kingdom's foreign ministry.

Washington has deployed a naval strike group led by the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier off Iran's shores.</description><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2026 13:44:56 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/3bed7d40-fecd-11f0-b8ac-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-31T135958Z-507358427-RC2ACJAE8D5D-RTRMADP-3-IRAN-CRISIS-USA.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuela rights activist freed from notorious jail amid prisoner release</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/venezuela-rights-activist-tarazona-freed-prisoner-release-2026-02-01/</link><description>Feb 1 (Reuters) - Venezuelan rights activist Javier Tarazona has been freed in a prisoner release, legal rights group Foro Penal said on Sunday, the latest high profile liberation in a weeks-long process that families of the detained say has moved too slowly.

Venezuela's interim president Delcy Rodriguez on Friday announced a proposed "amnesty law" for hundreds of prisoners in the country, and said the infamous Helicoide detention center in the capital Caracas, which rights groups have long denounced as the site of prisoner abuse, will be converted into a center for sport and social services.

Foro Penal says it has verified more than 300 liberations of political prisoners since the government announced the new series of releases on January 8. It added on X on Sunday that several others had been released alongside Tarazona from the Helicoide.

Tarazona is the director of FundaRedes, which tracks alleged abuses by Colombian armed groups and the Venezuelan military along the countries' border. He was arrested in July 2021, accused of terrorism and conspiracy.

"After 1,675 days, four years and seven months, the day we've so wished for has arrived, my brother Javier Tarazona is free," Tarazona's brother Jose Rafael Tarazona said on X. "The freedom of one is hope for all."

Government officials - who deny holding political prisoners and say those jailed have committed crimes - have given a much higher figure of releases, of more than 600, but have not been clear about the timeline and appear to be including releases from previous years. The government has never provided an official list of how many prisoners will be released nor who they are.

Families of prisoners say the releases have progressed too slowly, and Foro Penal says more than 700 political prisoners remain jailed, an updated count including prisoners whose fearful families had not previously reported their detentions.

Families and rights advocates have long demanded that charges and convictions against detainees who are considered political prisoners be wiped. Opposition politicians, dissident members of the security services, journalists and rights activists have long been subject to charges like terrorism and treason, which their families say are unjust and arbitrary.

The proposed amnesty law could affect hundreds of detainees who remain behind bars in the South American country, as well as former prisoners who have already been conditionally released.

Among the long-time advocates of releases and amnesty is Nobel Peace Prize winner and opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, who has several close allies imprisoned.

Many relatives of detainees - both well-known and lesser-known - have gathered outside prisons, even sleeping there, or have visited multiple detention centers in an effort to find out where their loved ones are being detained.

The recent releases were announced after the U.S. capture of President Nicolas Maduro and his arraignment in a New York court on narcoterrorism charges, which he denies.

Among prominent still-detained figures are opposition politician Juan Pablo Guanipa and lawyer Perkins Rocha, both close allies of Machado, and opposition Voluntad Popular party leader Freddy Superlano.

Those released so far include Rafael Tudares , the son-in-law of former opposition presidential candidate Edmundo Gonzalez, who was jailed for over a year, during which he was sentenced to 30 years on terrorism charges which his family has roundly denied.

A 2022 United Nations report claimed state security agencies subjected detainees at the Helicoide, originally designed as a mall, to torture. The government rejected the U.N.'s findings.

The Venezuelan communications ministry, which handles all press queries for the government, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</description><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2026 14:55:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/UPM7HIHJ45INVCHECEPOUSLDPY.jpg?auth=abe91df68748de293416329c374099fbb380758f3957963c3f318ee0c070374e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Death toll of Swiss New Year bar blaze rises to 41</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/death-toll-swiss-new-year-bar-blaze-rises-41-2026-02-01/</link><description>ZURICH, Feb 1 (Reuters) - An 18-year-old injured in the New Year bar fire in the Alpine resort of Crans-Montana has died, Swiss authorities said on Sunday, taking the death toll of one of the worst disasters in modern Swiss history to 41.

The Swiss national was in hospital in Zurich and died on Saturday, the statement by the Public Prosecutor's Office of the Canton of Valais added, without providing any further information.

Most of those killed in the blaze at "Le Constellation" bar were teenagers and some of the 116 people who were injured are still in hospital with severe burns.

The additional victim was a young man living near the western city of Lausanne, two sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.

On Saturday, hundreds of people marched alongside bereaved parents through the lakeside town of Lutry near Lausanne, carrying a large banner demanding "truth and justice".

"Today, we are just asking for justice and truth and afterwards we will mourn," Laetitia Brodard-Sitre, who lost her 17-year-old son Arthur in the fire, told a crowd of people carrying white roses.

The fire has tested relations with neighbouring Italy, which lost nationals in the blaze and has protested the release on bail of the bar's owner.

Swiss authorities earlier this week said they would grant the Rome Public Prosecutor's Office access to evidence gathered.</description><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2026 14:55:47 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/3UEZTKJQFRKFTCMGH2HAVUKMFU.jpg?auth=26e1eab90f3609636a44076bb528f9ea1b1e889c6bce1e34c0bfeb1d574fc337&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuelan human rights activist Javier Tarazona freed in prisoner release</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260201-venezuelan-human-rights-activist-javier-tarazona-freed-prisoner-release</link><description>Venezuelan ‍rights activist ​Javier Tarazona has been freed ⁠in a prisoner release, legal rights group Foro Penal said on ​Sunday, the latest ‍high profile liberation in a process ​families of the detained say ​has moved too slowly.

Since its resurgence in 2021, the M23 armed group has seized vast tracts of the DRC's resource-rich east, capturing the Rubaya mine in North Kivu province in April 2024 with Rwanda 's help.

Scavengers said part of a hillside in the mining zone collapsed on Wednesday afternoon. A second landslide struck on Thursday morning.

The M23-appointed governor, Eraston Bahati Musanga, told AFP there were "at least 200 deaths".

AFP was unable to independently verify a toll.

The phone network has been down for several days there, and Congolese authorities and civil society groups fled the area when the M23 arrived.

Information is arriving "in dribs and drabs from motorbike couriers circulating the region", making it difficult to establish an accurate toll, a humanitarian source said.

The Rubaya mine produces 15 to 30 percent of the world's supply of coltan, a key component in the production of electronics such as laptops and mobile phones.

Experts estimate that the M23 makes around $800,000 a month from the mine thanks to a seven-dollars-a-kilo tax on the production and sale of coltan.

UN experts also accuse Rwanda – which denies providing the M23 with military support – of using the militia to syphon off the DRC's mineral riches.

Kinshasa on Sunday urged "the international community to fully grasp the scale of this tragedy" which is blamed on "armed occupation and an organised system of looting" by the Rwanda-backed militia.

Besides containing at least 60 percent of the world's coltan, the wider eastern DRC is also home to vast reserves of gold and tin.</description><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2026 15:52:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/d1d747f8-ff79-11f0-b1ca-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-30T213800Z-120793558-RC2PJDAOVU5I-RTRMADP-3-CONGO-MINING-COLLAPSE.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russian drone strike kills 15 miners in Ukraine's Dnipropetrovsk, officials say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-drone-strike-kills-12-wounds-7-ukraines-dnipropetrovsk-governor-says-2026-02-01/</link><description>KYIV, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Fifteen people were killed and seven wounded after a Russian drone struck a bus carrying miners in Ukraine's southeastern Dnipropetrovsk region, energy firm DTEK and government officials said on Sunday.

The attack came hours after President Volodymyr Zelenskiy announced that a second round of U.S.-brokered trilateral talks between Ukraine and Russia would take place next week.

DTEK said in a statement that Russian forces had carried out a "massive terrorist attack" on a company mine in the region, and that all the dead and wounded were its employees returning from a shift.

"Today, the enemy carried out a cynical and targeted attack on energy sector workers in the Dnipropetrovsk region," energy minister Denys Shmyhal wrote on the Telegram app.

Police said the attack took place in the city of Terenivka. Footage posted by the State Emergencies Service showed a charred bus with shattered windows that had veered off the road.

Earlier on Sunday, regional officials said at least nine had been wounded in Russian strikes on a maternity hospital and a residential building in the southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia.

Sunday's strikes also follow remarks by Zelenskiy earlier in the day that Russia - which said it had agreed to stop attacking Ukrainian energy infrastructure until February 1 - was still targeting logistics in Ukraine.</description><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2026 16:30:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Portugal launches $3 billion package to help rebuild after storm Kristin</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/portugal-launches-3-billion-package-help-rebuild-after-storm-kristin-2026-02-01/</link><description>LISBON, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Portugal's government approved a 2.5 billion euro ($3.0 billion) package of loans and incentives on Sunday to help people and businesses rebuild after the devastation caused by Storm Kristin, Prime Minister Luis Montenegro said.

Storm Kristin swept across central mainland Portugal early on Wednesday, with wind gusts topping 200 km/h (124 mph) and heavy rain that killed at least six people, damaged homes, factories and infrastructure, and cut power to hundreds of thousands, authorities said.

Montenegro said the public bank Banco de Fomento will launch a 1  billion euro loan programme to rebuild uninsured storm-damaged factories and a 500  million euro financing scheme to help them with their immediate cash-flow needs.

The remaining 1 billion euros in aid includes a financing line to help people rebuild uninsured primary homes, covering up to 10,000 euros per house, as well as social security subsidies for individuals facing hardship or income loss, worth up to 537 euros monthly per person or 1,075 euros per family.

He said that, given the "current exceptional circumstances", all reconstruction work will be exempt from licensing and prior urban planning, environmental and administrative approvals.

"We are mobilising all our resources to manage the emergency responsibly, but also with hope...once again, we will rebuild Portugal," he said at a press conference.

Montenegro said the government also extended the "state of calamity" declared in about 60 hard-hit municipalities until February 8, amid forecasts of more heavy rain and flooding, even though winds are expected to ease compared with last week.

A state of calamity - Portugal's highest civil protection alert used for major disasters - allows authorities to mobilise emergency and armed forces, fast-track procurement and limit access to affected areas without curbing constitutional rights.

Nearly 180,000 households were still without electricity on Sunday, as grid operator REN and distributor E-Redes scrambled to restore power, the companies said.

In December, Israel announced it would prevent 37 aid organisations, including MSF, from working in Gaza from March 1 for failing to submit detailed information about their Palestinian employees, drawing widespread condemnation from NGOs and the United Nations.

"The Ministry of Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism is moving to terminate the activities of Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) in the Gaza Strip ," the ministry said on Sunday.

The decision follows "MSF's failure to submit lists of local employees, a requirement applicable to all humanitarian organisations operating in the region", it added.

The ministry had earlier alleged that two MSF employees had links with Palestinian militant groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad , which the charity has vehemently denied.

On Sunday, the ministry said MSF had committed in early January to sharing the staff list, but ultimately refrained.

"Subsequently, MSF announced it does not intend to proceed with the registration process at all, contradicting its previous statements and the binding protocol," the ministry added, saying "MSF will cease its operations and depart the Gaza Strip by February 28".

MSF said it had tried for months to engage with Israeli authorities over the issue, but its attempts were unsuccessful.

MSF charged that the ministry's move was a "pretext to obstruct humanitarian assistance" to Gaza.

"Israeli authorities are forcing humanitarian organisations into an impossible choice between exposing staff to risk or interrupting critical medical care for people in desperate need," it said in a statement issued on Sunday.

"MSF did not hand over staff names because Israeli authorities failed to provide the concrete assurances required to guarantee our staff's safety, protect their personal data, and uphold the independence of our medical operation," it said.

Such demands by Israel will force aid organisations to pull out when "needs are overwhelming and health services are collapsing" in Gaza, it said.

"At a moment when more humanitarian assistance is urgently needed, it is being restricted rather than facilitated," the charity said, adding that it remained open for dialogue with Israeli authorities to maintain its services in Gaza and the occupied West Bank .

MSF says 15 of its employees have been killed over the course of the Gaza war.

Minister of Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism Amichai Chikli said the organisation had "abruptly changed" its position.

"It appears the organisation's employees do not meet the established criteria," Chikli said.

MSF has long been a key provider of medical and humanitarian aid in Gaza, particularly since the war broke out in October 2023 after Hamas's attack on Israel.

The charity says it currently provides at least 20 percent of hospital beds in the territory and operates around 20 health centres.

In 2025 alone, it carried out more than 800,000 medical consultations and more than 10,000 infant deliveries, and it also provides drinking water.

Aid groups warn that without international support provided by organisations such as MSF, critical services such as emergency care, maternal health and paediatric treatment could collapse entirely in Gaza, leaving hundreds of thousands of residents without basic medical care.

As they did with MSF, the Israeli authorities have repeatedly accused the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA , of providing cover for Hamas militants, claiming that some of its employees even took part in the October 7, 2023 attack.

A series of investigations, including one led by France's former foreign minister Catherine Colonna, found some "neutrality-related issues" at UNRWA but stressed Israel had not provided conclusive evidence for its headline allegation.

Last month, Israeli authorities began demolishing buildings at UNRWA's headquarters in east Jerusalem, which the organisation described as an "unprecedented attack".

UNRWA has now been banned from operating in east Jerusalem, but it continues to operate in Gaza and the Israeli-occupied West Bank.</description><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2026 17:34:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/9e685032-ff8e-11f0-892f-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/000-92C28KB.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russian drone strike on bus transporting Ukrainian energy sector workers kills 15</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260201-russian-drone-strike-bus-transporting-ukrainian-energy-sector-workers-kills-15</link><description>Fifteen people were killed ​and seven wounded after a Russian drone struck a ‍bus carrying miners in Ukraine 's southeastern Dnipropetrovsk region, energy firm DTEK and government officials said ​on Sunday.

Earlier on Sunday, regional officials said at least nine had been wounded in Russian strikes on a maternity hospital and a residential building in the southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia.

In a Telegram post, Ukraine's emergency service said the strike wounded three women in the hospital in Zaporizhzhia, and also sparked a fire in the gynecology reception area that was later extinguished. Regional administration head Ivan Fedorov later said the number of injured had risen to six.

Sunday's strikes also follow remarks by ‍Zelensky earlier in the day that Russia – which said it had agreed to ‌ stop attacking Ukrainian ​energy infrastructure until February 1 – was still targeting logistics in Ukraine.

In the past week, Russia has struck energy assets in the southern Ukrainian city of Odesa and in Kharkiv in the northeast. It also hit the Kyiv region on Wednesday, killing two people and injuring four.

Overnight into Sunday, Russia launched 90 attack drones , with 14 striking nine locations, Ukraine’s air force said in a Telegram post. A woman and a man were killed in an overnight drone strike in Dnipro, according to local administration head Oleksandr Hanzha.

Russian shelling also hit central Kherson, a city in southern Ukraine, soon after 7am, seriously wounding a 59-year-old woman, according to a Facebook post by the municipal military administration.

Russia's defence ministry on Sunday morning said its forces had used operational-tactical aviation, attack drones, missile forces and artillery to strike transport infrastructure used by Ukrainian forces.

In a separate post Sunday, it said that Russian air defences shot down 21 Ukrainian drones flying over southwestern and western Russia. It did not mention any casualties or damage.</description><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2026 17:34:17 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/980587ba-ff88-11f0-82c2-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/000-437N49E.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Czechs rally to support president in his growing rift with government</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/czechs-rally-support-president-his-growing-rift-with-government-2026-02-01/</link><description>PRAGUE, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of Czechs rallied on Sunday in support of President Peter Pavel after he refused to approve the nomination of a minister to the new eurosceptic coalition government who performed a Nazi salute and posted Nazi memorabilia.

In an escalating rift with the government, the pro-EU and pro-Ukraine Pavel last week accused Foreign Minister Petr Macinka of sending text messages via his adviser that threatened the president with "consequences" if he continued to oppose Filip Turek's nomination as Czech environment minister.

Turek, a member of Macinka's right-wing Motorists party, has faced criticism for making a Nazi salute and posting Nazi memorabilia. Turek has put his behaviour down to bad taste rather than any affinity for Nazism or racism.

Supporters of the president filled Prague's Old Town Square and nearby Wenceslas Square, while police closed off a number of streets in the area.

Many protesters waved EU and Czech flags and carried signs saying "We stand with the president". Some voiced support for Ukraine and opposition to Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis' coalition government.

Police gave no official estimate of the size of the protest but organizers put the number at 80,000 to 90,000 people, and said they planned to hold further demonstrations in other towns across the Czech Republic on February 15.

After winning an October election, Babis' populist ANO party cobbled together a coalition with the Motorists and the far-right, pro-Russian SPD.

Pavel appointed Babis in December but objected to Turek's inclusion in the list of cabinet nominees and then made public the messages Macinka sent last week, describing them as blackmail. He has referred the messages for review by the National Organized Crime Agency.

Macinka has rejected the president's accusation of blackmail over the text messages, saying they were all part of a typical political negotiation.

Commenting on the matter on Czech television on Sunday, Macinka said: "Politics is not a discipline for princesses... it is a very demanding discipline. Everyone who is in top politics should show greater resilience."</description><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2026 17:54:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/C4GHLDOYDZLVHD3YLYVR4WYPLE.jpg?auth=56913fbf0c744b5b79ef7a71229b452ecdc20344fa337dfa763881ac5028ba57&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Top US, Israeli generals meet at Pentagon amid soaring Iran tensions</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/top-us-israeli-generals-meet-pentagon-amid-soaring-iran-tensions-2026-02-01/</link><description>Feb 1 (Reuters) - The top U.S. and Israeli generals held talks at the Pentagon on Friday amid soaring tensions with Iran, two U.S. officials told Reuters on Sunday, speaking on condition of anonymity.

The interior ministry said security units arrested all members of the group, which it said had carried out several strikes on the airport in recent months, after surveillance of suspected launch sites in several areas of the capital.

The weapons used in the attacks originated from Lebanon’s Hezbollah, an ally of former President Bashar al-Assad that once had a large military presence across Syria supporting Assad’s army, the ministry said.

Hezbollah denied the allegations and said it had no activity or ties with any group inside Syria.

Authorities said they also seized a number of drones the group was preparing to use in further operations.

The ministry said only that the detainees had links to unidentified "foreign entities," without mentioning Hezbollah or Iran.

Reuters reported in November that Washington was planning to establish a military presence at an airbase in Damascus to help enable a security pact that Washington is brokering between Syria and Israel. The government denied the report.

Security sources say Hezbollah left behind weapons stockpiles, including drones, in parts of Syria after withdrawing its forces following the collapse of Assad’s rule.</description><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2026 19:28:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Texas Democrat's win a 'wake-up call' for Republicans ahead of 2026 elections</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/texas-democrats-win-wake-up-call-republicans-ahead-2026-elections-2026-02-01/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Feb 1 (Reuters) - A Democratic candidate won a special election for the Texas state senate by a double-digit margin, taking control from Republicans for the first time in decades in a result the losing candidate on Sunday called "a wake-up call" for the midterm elections.

The victory for a seat vacated by a four-term Republican followed a string of wins in recent months for the Democratic Party in local and state elections across the country, offering hope for national Democrats looking to claw back power in midterm elections later this year.

Taylor Rehmet, a union machinist and U.S. Air Force veteran, won on Saturday in the conservative area near Dallas by more than 14 percentage points over Republican activist Leigh Wambsganss, whom President Donald Trump had urged voters to rally behind.

In a Sunday statement, Wambsganss said she congratulated Rehmet on his victory and called the Democratic win a "wake-up call" for local and national Republicans.

"The Democrats were energized," Wambsganss said. "Too many Republicans stayed home."

Trump on Saturday touted Wambsganss as a "true MAGA Warrior" and tried to rally voters to the polls on her behalf.

But on Sunday he distanced himself from the loss, saying he was not involved as it was a “local Texas race.”

“I’m not on the ballot, so you don’t know whether or not it’s transferable,” Trump said.

The district is more Republican than overall Tarrant County, which Trump won by 5 percentage points in the 2024 presidential election but Joe Biden won in 2020 by fewer than 2,000 votes.

Wambsganss said she expects to defeat Rehmet when they face off again in the November election for the seat's full four-year term.

But Democrats cited rising momentum heading into the midterm elections in November, when control of Congress is at stake. "Democrats are building on our historic overperformance, and we’re not slowing down," Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin wrote in a social media post.

Saturday's outcome wasn't entirely unexpected. In the November election that led to the runoff, Rehmet had the top result with 48%, while Wambsganss and John Huffman split the Republican vote.

Rehmet's election follows a series of victories for the party nationwide since Trump started his second term last year.

In November, Democrats won governors' races in Democratic-friendly New Jersey and flipped back the gubernatorial control in Virginia.

In December, Democrats won special elections in more conservative Kentucky and Iowa, but Republicans held off a Democratic upset in a special election victory for a Tennessee congressional seat after U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, concerned about his slim Republican majority, rallied national Republicans.

The November 2026 midterm election includes races for Congress and is often seen as a referendum on the White House, as well as some gubernatorial elections across the country.

Democrats, currently the minority party in both chambers of Congress, hope to flip Republicans' majorities.

With a handful of open seats, Republicans currently hold a slim 218-213 edge in the U.S. House, but that will narrow further after the swearing-in of Representative-elect Christian Menefee , a Texas Democrat who also won on Saturday to fill a vacancy in a longtime Democratic district whose previous representative died in March.

The 53-47 Republican-controlled U.S. Senate will pose a bigger challenge for Democrats, but party leaders are encouraged by their candidates who have won before in competitive states like North Carolina, Maine, Ohio and even Alaska.

Trump has encouraged primary challengers to some incumbent Republican senators, such as Louisiana’s Bill Cassidy , and suggested on Sunday he will make an endorsement in the three-way Republican contest in Texas that includes another incumbent, Senator John Cornyn, state Attorney General Ken Paxton and Representative Wesley Hunt.

“I like all of them,” Trump said.

Democratic strategists urged their party to continue emphasizing affordability and pocketbook issues.

"This win is another rejection of the chaos that Trump is creating, and people don't want chaos in their communities," Meghan Hays, a former Biden campaign and White House official, said in a Sunday interview with Reuters.

"Ahead of November, Democrats need to focus on kitchen-table issues and they need to have real solutions. That's what you're seeing in these local races."</description><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2026 19:45:39 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/XG4HHS7IYROX3PPHSGPA4JDIBU.jpg?auth=ffd74632b7b4f80dd999716fb0d97862b41ec0f4ced1b432ef1a860fc086788a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran declares European armies 'terrorist groups' in retaliation for IRGC designation</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260201-iran-declares-european-armies-terrorist-groups-in-retaliation-for-irgc-designation</link><description>Iran has declared European countries' armies "terrorist groups", its parliament speaker said Sunday, following the EU's decision to apply the same designation to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.

Lawmakers wore the green uniform of the Guards in a display of solidarity at the legislative session, where they chanted "Death to America", "Death to Israel" and "Shame on you, Europe", state television footage showed.

Slamming the bloc's "irresponsible action", speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf said that under "Article 7 of the Law on Countermeasures Against the Declaration of the IRGC as a Terrorist Organisation, the armies of European countries are considered terrorist groups".

It remained unclear what immediate impact the decision would have.

The law was first passed in 2019, when the United States classified the Guards as a terrorist organisation.

Sunday's session was held on the 47th anniversary of the return from exile of the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who founded the Islamic republic in 1979.

The Guards are the ideological arm of Iran's military, tasked with safeguarding the Islamic revolution from external and internal threats.

They have been accused by Western governments of orchestrating a crackdown on a recent protest movement that left thousands dead.

Tehran has attributed the violence to "terrorist acts" fomented by the United States and Israel.

The European Union agreed on Thursday to list the body as a "terrorist organisation" over the response to the protests.

The step matched similar classifications enacted by the United States, Canada and Australia.

Ghalibaf said the decision, "which was carried out in compliance with the orders of the American president and the leaders of the Zionist regime, accelerated Europe's path to becoming irrelevant in the future world order".

The move, he added, had only increased domestic support for the Guards.

The legislative session came as Iran and the United States have traded warnings and threats of potential military action.

Tehran's response to the protests prompted US President Donald Trump to threaten to intervene, dispatching an aircraft carrier group to the region.

In recent days, however, both sides have insisted they remain willing to talk.

"Contrary to the hype of the contrived media war, structural arrangements for negotiations are progressing," Ali Larijani, head of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, said on Saturday.

Trump later confirmed that dialogue was taking place, but without withdrawing his earlier threats. He told Fox News that Iran was "talking to us, and we'll see if we can do something, otherwise we'll see what happens... we have a big fleet heading out there".

Trump has previously said he believes Iran will make a deal over its nuclear and missile programmes rather than face US military action.

Tehran, meanwhile, has said it is ready for nuclear talks if its missile and defence capabilities are not on the agenda.

Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said Saturday that "a war would be in the interest of neither Iran, nor the United States, nor the region", during a call with his Egyptian counterpart Abdel Fattah al-Sisi , according to Pezeshkian's office.

Qatari premier Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al, who also serves as foreign minister, held talks in Iran Saturday to try to "de-escalate tensions", the kingdom's foreign ministry said.

Firouzeh, a 43-year-old homemaker who declined to give her full name, said the recent tensions have left her "very worried and scared".

They have returned to Minnesota, according to Texas Rep. Joaquin Castro.

The boy and his dad, Adrian Conejo Arias, who is originally from Ecuador, were detained in a Minneapolis suburb on January 20. They were taken to a detention facility in Dilley, Texas.

Katherine Schneider, a spokesperson for the Democratic congressman, confirmed the two had arrived home. She said Castro picked them up from Dilley on Saturday night and escorted them home on Sunday to Minnesota.

In a statement, US Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said Immigration and Customs Enforcement did not target or arrest Liam Conejo Ramos, and that his mother refused to take him after his father’s apprehension. His father told officers he wanted Liam to be with him, she said.

“The Trump administration is committed to restoring the rule of law and common sense to our immigration system, and will continue to fight for the arrest, detention, and removal of aliens who have no right to be in this country,” McLaughlin said.

The government said the boy's father entered the U.S. illegally from Ecuador in December 2024. The family’s lawyer said he has an asylum claim pending that allows him to stay in the U.S.

Images of the young boy wearing a blue bunny hat and Spider-Man backpack and surrounded by immigration officers drew outrage about the Trump administration's crackdown in Minneapolis.

In his order granting the release, US District Judge Fred Biery blasted the administration, writing, “The case has its genesis in the ill-conceived and incompetently-implemented government pursuit of daily deportation quotas, apparently even if it requires traumatizing children.”

Neighbors and school officials say that federal immigration officers used the preschooler as “bait” by telling him to knock on the door to his house so that his mother would answer. The Department of Homeland Security has called that description of events an “abject lie.” It said the father fled on foot and left the boy in a running vehicle in their driveway.

Castro wrote a letter to Liam while they were on the plane to Minnesota, in which he told the young boy he has “moved the world.”

“Your family, school and many strangers said prayers for you and offered whatever they could do to see you back home,” Castro wrote. A photo of the letter was posted on social media. “Don’t let anyone tell you this isn’t your home. America became the most powerful, prosperous nation on earth because of immigrants not in spite of them.”

Photos on Castro’s social media showed Liam wearing his blue bunny hat and with a Pikachu backpack.

US Sen. Amy Klobuchar , a Democrat from Minnesota, welcomed the boy back to Minnesota, saying in a social media post that he “should be in school and with family — not in detention.” The senator added: “Now ICE needs to leave.”

US Rep. Ilhan Omar, also a Democrat from Minnesota, posted a photo to social media of her with Liam, his father and Castro in which she is holding Liam’s Spider-Man backpack. “Welcome home Liam,” she posted with two hearts.</description><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2026 21:47:21 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/3cee23ce-ffb4-11f0-aee6-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26032616849393.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Washington scolds Cuba after crowds heckle US diplomat</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/washington-scolds-cuba-after-crowds-heckle-us-diplomat-2026-02-01/</link><description>HAVANA, Feb 1 (Reuters) - The United States on Sunday accused Cuba of interfering with the work of its top diplomat in Havana after small groups of Cubans jeered at him during meetings with residents and church representatives outside the capital.

Amid rising tensions between the two countries, the State Department on social media accused the Cuban government of "failed intimidation tactics," and it demanded that Havana stop "sending individuals to interfere with the diplomatic work" of U.S. Charge d'Affaires Mike Hammer.

Friction has increased between the long-time foes after U.S. President Donald Trump last week declared Cuba "an unusual and extraordinary threat" to U.S. national security and said he would slap tariffs on any country that delivered oil to the communist-run Caribbean island.

Trump on Sunday said Cuba was "a failing nation" but added: "I think we're going to make a deal with Cuba."

Hammer, a career diplomat who arrived in Cuba in late 2024, has traveled the island widely to meet with political dissidents, Catholic Church representatives and others. The Cuban government accuses him of seeking to foment unrest.

On Saturday, he posted a video describing alleged harassment following a meeting with local church leaders.

"When I left the parish, a few communists, surely frustrated by how bad the revolution is going, shouted obscenities at me," Hammer said in the video on social media.

Subsequently, several more videos surfaced showing small groups of people in two locations during nighttime blackouts, taunting Hammer with cries of "Assassin!" and "Imperialist!"

Reuters could not identify the individuals in the videos, and Cuba's government has not commented on them.

Cuba's foreign ministry last year complained to Hammer about behavior it said was "interventionist" and alleged he incited Cubans to commit crimes and attack the state.

The U.S. Embassy, which produces the videos, has denied those charges and says Hammer is simply doing his job.

The two neighboring countries have been at odds since Fidel Castro's 1959 revolution, but a crippling economic crisis on the island and stepped up pressure from the Trump administration have recently brought the conflict to a head.</description><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2026 22:51:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7TJIOFZRDFJGRJIBSHZQ4WMSRE.jpg?auth=214eb15d155fd0cbc8af578ebd253268ab5ebf03eb45e6870462cf54ca9d572f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Syrian Kurdish forces announce curfew in northeast cities ahead of deal with Damascus</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260201-syrian-kurdish-forces-announce-curfew-northeast-cities-deal-damascus</link><description>Syrian Kurdish security forces on Sunday announced a curfew early next week in two cities in the country's northeast, ahead of the implementation of a recent deal struck with the Islamist-led government in Damascus.

Damascus and Kurdish forces reached a comprehensive agreement on Friday to gradually integrate the Kurds' military and civilian institutions into the state, after the Kurds ceded territory to advancing government forces in recent weeks.

Mazloum Abdi, head of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, has said the deal would be implemented on the ground from Monday, with both sides to pull forces back from frontline positions in parts of the northeast, and from the town of Kobane in the north.

He said a "limited internal security force" would enter parts of Hasakeh and Qamishli but that "no military forces will enter any Kurdish city or town".

Kurdish security forces announced a curfew in the northeastern city of Hasakeh from 6:00 am (0300 GMT) to 6:00 pm on Monday, and in the northeast's main Kurdish city of Qamishli on Tuesday, during the same hours.

It said the move was "to maintain security, stability and the safety of residents".

A source from the Kurds' security forces said a government security delegation visited its headquarters in Qamishli on Sunday.

The text of Friday's deal maintains an ongoing ceasefire and introduces a "gradual integration" of the Kurdish forces and administrative institutions.

It appeared to include some of the Kurds' demands, such as establishing brigades of fighters from the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in Kurdish-majority areas.

The government's push to extend its authority across the country was a blow to the Kurds.

They had sought to preserve the de facto autonomy they exercised after seizing swathes of north and northeast Syria in battles against the Islamic State (IS) jihadist group during Syria's civil war, backed by a US-led coalition.

In Qamishli on Sunday, thousands of Kurdish men, women and children filled the streets in a show of solidarity, waving Kurdish flags and holding up pictures of fighters who were killed, an AFP correspondent said.

Student Barine Hamza, 18, said "we have come out for Kurdish unity".

"We are afraid of being betrayed because we do not trust this government," she said.

Housewife Nourshana Mohammed, 40, said that "the presence of the SDF is important for us. It protects us Kurds and saved us" from IS.

Information Minister Hamza Mustafa told state media on Friday that the agreement included the handover of some oil fields, the Qamishli airport and border crossings to the government within 10 days.

He said SDF fighters would be integrated on an individual basis into several brigades being formed under the army's command.

The United States, which has drawn close to Syria's new Islamist authorities, recently said the purpose of its alliance with the Kurdish forces was largely over.

Also on Sunday, the head of internal security in Aleppo province, Mohammed Abdul Ghani, told reporters he met with Kurdish forces in Kobane to discuss security matters there "and begin the deployment of interior ministry forces", without announcing a timeframe.

He said technical details still needed to be settled, but that the response from the Kurdish side was "positive".

Located in Aleppo province more than 200 kilometres (125 miles) from other Kurdish-held areas in Syria's northeast, Kobane is hemmed in by the Turkish border to the north and Syrian government forces on other sides.

Kurdish forces liberated Kobane from a lengthy siege by IS in 2015 and it took on symbolic value as their first major victory against the jihadists.

On Saturday, NGOs and a Turkish MP said Turkish authorities had blocked a convoy carrying aid to Kobane from across the border.</description><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2026 22:52:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/c02ce11c-fdc0-11f0-8134-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/000-93TV363-1.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Japan PM Takaichi's party poised for landslide victory, Asahi poll shows</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/japan-pm-takaichis-party-poised-landslide-victory-asahi-poll-shows-2026-02-01/</link><description>TOKYO, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's party is likely to score a landslide victory in next week's lower house election, a survey by the Asahi newspaper showed.

A strong showing in Sunday's election would solidify Takaichi's grip on her party and give her a mandate for her expansionary fiscal policy, which could heighten concerns about Japan's finances and push bond yields higher.

Takaichi's Liberal Democratic Party is likely to well exceed a majority of 233 seats out of 465 seats up for grabs in the lower house, according to Asahi's poll released on Sunday. That would be an increase from 198 seats now.

Together with LDP's coalition partner, the Japan Innovation Party or Ishin, the ruling alliance will likely reach 300 seats, the poll showed.

The largest opposition party, the Centrist Reform Alliance, is struggling and could lose half its 167 seats, the Asahi said.

Takaichi's ruling coalition currently holds a slim majority in the powerful lower house but has a minority in the upper house.</description><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2026 23:27:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7H74KVJ4JNI7XHU252PTZSQ4CU.jpg?auth=4059b8db913208206302d8a1203a3c2a0ce45d416e46c1094dc8bb9d3ec73fb9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Former UK minister Mandelson quits Labour after new Epstein revelations, media say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/former-uk-minister-mandelson-quits-labour-after-new-epstein-revelations-media-2026-02-01/</link><description>LONDON, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Former British government minister Peter Mandelson has resigned as a member of Prime Minister Keir Starmer's Labour Party after new reports of his ties with disgraced U.S. financier Jeffrey Epstein, media reported on Sunday.

Mandelson, who was fired by Starmer as Britain's ambassador to the United States last year after previous revelations about his connections to Epstein, said he did not wish to cause "further embarrassment" to Labour, the reports said.

"I have been further linked this weekend to the understandable furore surrounding Jeffrey Epstein and I feel regretful and sorry about this," Mandelson said in a letter to the Labour Party reported by the BBC and other news organisations, which Reuters was not immediately able to obtain.

Mandelson said he believed allegations about financial payments to him by Epstein, which appeared in British media based on files released by the U.S. Justice Department, were false and he would investigate them.

"While doing this I do not wish to cause further embarrassment to the Labour Party and I am therefore stepping down from membership of the party," the letter said.

Mandelson was key to the Labour Party's electoral success when Tony Blair was prime minister starting in the 1990s.

He came under scrutiny last year after U.S. lawmakers released documents including a letter in which he called Epstein "my best pal", leading to his dismissal as Britain's envoy in Washington.

Mandelson also had a turbulent earlier career in domestic politics. In 1998, he quit as trade minister over a loan he received from a fellow minister to buy a house amid questions over conflict of interest.

A second stint in the cabinet also ended in a resignation in 2001 when he was forced out over his alleged involvement in a passport scandal involving an Indian billionaire. He was later cleared of acting improperly.

Mandelson, a former European Union trade commissioner, is on leave of absence as a member of the upper house of Britain's national parliament.

Separately, Starmer said on Saturday that Britain's former Prince Andrew should testify before a U.S. congressional committee, following new revelations about his links to Epstein.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 02:11:07 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WBBVOO4X2FLZ5HJCJCUVWMYMEI.jpg?auth=87a7e656f51a5e3e794fe8ba5e8cbc71a65ca6d7fd35f7ceecba9880432bcdcd&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UK foreign minister says Ethiopia visit to focus on migration</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-foreign-minister-says-ethiopia-visit-focus-migration-2026-02-02/</link><description>LONDON, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Britain's foreign minister said she would use a visit to Ethiopia on Monday to focus on measures to try to stem rising numbers of migrants from the Horn of Africa seeking to reach the United Kingdom.

Yvette Cooper said job creation partnerships would dissuade people from leaving Ethiopia while stronger law enforcement cooperation was essential to counter smuggler gangs and speed up returns of migrants with no right to stay in Britain.

"We are working together to tackle the economic drivers of illegal migration and the criminal gangs who operate globally, profiting from trading in people," Cooper said in a statement.

"That includes new partnerships to improve trade and create thousands of good jobs in Ethiopia so people can find a better life back home instead of making perilous journeys."

Successive British governments have tried to tackle illegal immigration, an issue which has helped to propel populist campaigner Nigel Farage's Reform UK party into a commanding opinion poll lead.

Around 30% of people crossing the English Channel on small boat over the past two years were nationals from Ethiopia, Eritrea, Somalia and Sudan, the British foreign ministry said.

To help boost job creation in Ethiopia, Cooper is due to sign an agreement with the country to take forward two energy-transmission projects led by Gridworks, a UK investment organisation.

She was also due to announce 17 million pounds worth of funding for tackling violence against women and girls, assistance for 68,000 children suffering malnutrition, and for projects working with displaced people.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 02:11:22 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ICH6HKJEOZPG3FJ7SFVIBAAZPQ.jpg?auth=1bd71781fe746fcd646c6ecea92fda31e1cd44384d76c40190a0821dd4c1cee5&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UK’s Peter Mandelson resigns from Labour party after Epstein ties resurface</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260202-uk-ex-ambassador-quits-labour-epstein-links</link><description>Former British ambassador to Washington Peter Mandelson quit the Labour Party Sunday, seeking to avoid causing it "further embarrassment" after newly released US documents revived scrutiny of his connection to late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

Mandelson, 72, who was sacked as Britain's ambassador to the United States last year over his ties to Epstein, allegedly received several payments from Epstein in the early 2000s, according to documents released on Friday by the US Department of Justice and reported in British media Sunday.

"Allegations which I believe to be false that he made financial payments to me 20 years ago, and of which I have no record or recollection, need investigating by me," Mandelson wrote in a letter to Labour general secretary Hollie Ridley.

"While doing this I do not wish to cause further embarrassment to the Labour Party and I am therefore stepping down from membership of the party," he added, saying he felt "regretful and sorry about this".

Bank records released by the US Justice Department suggest Epstein transferred a total of $75,000 (55,000 pounds) in three payments to bank accounts linked to Mandelson between 2003 and 2004.

Speaking earlier Sunday on the BBC, Mandelson said he had no memory of the transfers and did not know whether the documents were authentic.

Mandelson also appears in newly released, undated photographs, wearing a T?shirt and underwear beside a woman whose face has been redacted by US authorities.

He told the BBC he "cannot place the location or the woman and I cannot think what the circumstances were".

Other documents suggest Epstein sent 10,000 pounds in 2009 to Reinaldo Avila da Silva, Mandelson's partner, at a time when Mandelson was serving as a government minister.

The former ambassador was removed from his post in September after being appointed by Prime Minister Keir Starmer in late 2024.

Mandelson apologised in January for maintaining his friendship with Epstein, having initially refused to do so on the grounds that he was not complicit.

Former prince Andrew, stripped of his royal titles last year over his ties to Epstein, was also named in the files released on Friday.

A second woman alleged Sunday that Epstein sent her to Britain in 2010 for a sexual encounter with Andrew, her lawyer told the BBC.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 02:11:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/f44f5260-ffcb-11f0-be4c-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/1a137762bb4f48f5d63f4cf2319cc6c22a897434.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Olivia Dean named best new artist</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/grammys-poised-rewrite-musics-record-books-2026-02-01/</link><description>LOS ANGELES, Feb 1 (Reuters) - - British soul-pop singer Olivia Dean was named best new artist, and hip-hop megastar Kendrick Lamar claimed the prize for best rap album with "GNX," his chart-topping sixth studio set, as the 68th Grammy Awards got under way on Sunday.

The London-born Dean, 26, edged out fellow newcomers Leon Thomas, KATSEYE, The Marias, Addison Rae, sombr, Alex Warren and Lola Young in the Grammy race to crown the greatest performer among a field of rising new talents.

Accepting her award from the stage of the Crypto.com Arena in downtown Los Angeles, Dean paid tribute to her grandmother, who immigrated to Britain from Guyana as a teenager seeking a new life.

"I must say I'm up here as a granddaughter of an immigrant," she said, evoking cheers from the star-studded audience. "I am a product of bravery and I think those people deserve to be celebrated. We're nothing without each other."

Lamar, 38, the West Coast hip-hop sensation regarded as one of the greatest rap artists of all time, entered Sunday's Grammy Awards with nominations in nine categories and immediately clinched the award for best rap album with "GNX."

Lamar's "GNX" was also vying for the top award of the night, album of the year, facing stiff competition from Puerto Rican rapper Bad Bunny and pop chameleon Lady Gaga.

Bad Bunny was competing for best album with "Debí Tirar Más Fotos," which could make history as the first Spanish‑language winner in that category. The award went last year to Beyoncé’s "Cowboy Carter."

If Lamar wins for "GNX," he would be the first solo male rapper to win the top award. Only two hip-hop musicians have been honored in the category - female artist Lauryn Hill and the duo Outkast.

For Gaga, the best album prize would be the first of her celebrated career. She has never won any of the top four Grammy trophies despite more than two decades in the music business. This year, she is competing with the album "Mayhem," described by critics as a return to her dark dance-pop roots.

Trevor Noah returned to host the festivities for a sixth time, which he has said would be his last Grammys gig. The show aired live on the CBS network from the Crypto.com Arena in downtown Los Angeles.

Bad Bunny's Grammy night recognition carried strong political overtones.

The singer-producer skipped the continental United States on his recent concert tour, saying he feared federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents carrying out U.S. President Donald Trump's deportation drive would show up to arrest his fans.

"ICE out," he said from the stage, accepting the award for best album of Latin urban music for "Debí Tirar Más Fotos."

His selection to perform at the coming Super Bowl halftime show next Sunday drew objections from Trump and other critics who argued the National Football League championship game's entertainment should be performed in English.

The world of KPop also earned a Grammy for the first time.

"Golden," the smash hit from the Netflix (NFLX.O) , opens new tab animated movie "KPop Demon Hunters," won an early award for best song written for visual media. It also was competing for two of the top awards of the night - best record and best song. The song is performed by a fictional band named HUNTR/X. Its real-life members are EJAE, Audrey Nun and Rein Ami.

The best record and best song contests also include "APT.," a duet between Bruno Mars and KPop singer Rosé.

Legendary filmmaker Steven Spielberg, 79, achieved EGOT status — one of the rarest honors in the entertainment industry — after winning his first Grammy award for best music film for "Music by John Williams," which he produced. EGOT stands for Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony.

Grammy winners are chosen by the roughly 15,000 voting members of the Recording Academy — industry peers including artists, songwriters, producers and engineers — whose ranks have been revamped over the past seven years to increase diversity. About 1,000 Latin Grammys voters became eligible to vote this year, and 73% of members have joined since 2019.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 04:36:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/QOF57H2D3JMR5HJNAMQEOXAGZY.jpg?auth=dcfab9a922431256d56254903cdcf9c52a5e90ca1c3f4941e18fa23a1cd8a9e6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Bad Bunny, Billie Eilish call out ICE at the 2026 Grammy Awards</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/culture/20260202-bad-bunny-billie-eilish-call-out-ice-at-the-2026-grammy-awards</link><description>Rapper Kendrick Lamar on Sunday won four Grammys while Bad Bunny and Lady Gaga won two each -- but all three still were in the hunt for history on music's biggest night.

Bad Bunny meanwhile earned cheers as he delivered a powerful political message, ripping the nationwide immigration raids that have polarised America,  a pointed theme at the 68th annual Grammy Awards.

"Before I say thanks to God, I'm gonna say 'ICE out'," Bad Bunny said as he accepted the award for best musica urbana album for his "Debi Tirar Mas Fotos" ("I Should Have Taken More Photos").

"We're not savages, we're not animals, we're not aliens; we are humans and we are Americans," the 31-year-old Puerto Rican singer said, one week before he takes one of the world's biggest stages, headlining the Super Bowl halftime show.

Billie Eilish won song of the year for “Wildflower” at the 2026 Grammy Awards and used the moment to add her voice to the chorus of musicians criticising immigration authorities Sunday.

“No one is illegal on stolen land,” she said while accepting the award for the song from her 2024 album “Hit Me Hard and Soft.” "(Expletive) ICE is all I want to say.”

It was a big moment on a night of hard-hitting performances, poignant speeches and one-liners from six-time host Trevor Noah.

Lamar scooped up four awards in the rap categories including best rap album for "GNX," while Gaga won for best pop vocal album and best dance pop recording.

"I just want to say for women in music that I know sometimes when you're in the studio with a bunch of guys, it can be hard. So I urge you to always listen to yourself and always fight for your ideas," Lady Gaga said.

Britain's Olivia Dean was crowned Best New Artist.

"I'm not good at talking about myself, but I express it through the music. It's an honor to be here," said Lamar, a Pulitzer Prize winner.

The 38-year-old California native, who won five Grammys last year thanks to his smash diss track "Not Like Us," is also up for Record of the Year for "Luther" featuring R&amp;B artist SZA.

Standing in Lamar's way for Album of the Year is Bad Bunny, who is in the middle of a world tour, just months after a hugely successful residency in San Juan.

His "Un verano sin ti" (2022) was the first Spanish-language album nominated for Album of the Year honors. A win on Sunday would give Bad Bunny another mention in the history books.

Lady Gaga, 39, made a splashy comeback to touring with "Mayhem," her collection of pop bangers with a dark edge that embraces her dramatic side. She has seven nominations.

A win for Album of the Year would complete her hat trick of top awards.

She took Record and Song of the Year honors seven years ago for the soundtrack hit "Shallow," from "A Star is Born" -- which also earned her an Oscar.

Also nominated for Album of the Year are: pop princess Sabrina Carpenter; R&amp;B singer-songwriter Leon Thomas; Tyler, the Creator; hip-hop duo Clipse (Pusha T and Malice); and Bieber -- with his first studio effort in four years.

Noah repeatedly joked with the 31-year-old Latin megastar, born Benito Antonio Martinez Ocasio, about not performing due to Super Bowl contractual restrictions -- and even sang a few bars in Spanish himself before Bad Bunny indulged with a short verse.

K-pop singer Rose and Bruno Mars kicked off the proceedings with a high-octane performance of "APT.," before Noah took to the stage.

Lady Gaga offered an energetic version of "Abracadabra" and Justin Bieber stripped to his boxers for his turn on stage.

Reba McEntire and Lauryn Hill sang in honor of those who died over the last year in the world of music. Late rocker Ozzy Osbourne's wife Sharon and children Kelly and Jack looked on as Post Malone paid tribute.

"Golden," from the Netflix animated smash hit "KPop Demon Hunters," won the prize for best song written for visual media, and top Oscar nominee "Sinners" won two soundtrack awards.

The majority of the 95 awards were handed out at a pre-gala ceremony before the televised broadcast.

Joni Mitchell -- one of several attendees wearing an "ICE OUT" pin in protest of US President Donald Trump's sweeping immigration crackdown -- took a prize for best historical album.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 04:38:32 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/cd818b9e-ffe9-11f0-9e7e-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-02-02T022238Z-509359046-HP1EM2206LOKP-RTRMADP-3-AWARDS-GRAMMYS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Live: Trump hopes to reach a deal with Iran, keeps military option on table</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260202-live-trump-hopes-to-reach-a-deal-with-iran-keeps-military-option-on-table</link><description>Oil prices plunged Monday after Donald Trump said he was hopeful of reaching a deal with Iran , easing concerns about a conflict between the two in the crude-rich region.

The daughter of former President Rodrigo Duterte is widely seen as a frontrunner for the 2028 presidential election and prevailed after a similar impeachment bid last year, which the Supreme Court struck down for violating constitutional safeguards.

A lawyer for Duterte said the fresh challenge "comes as no surprise".

"We are prepared to confront these allegations squarely through the proper constitutional processes," her lawyer Michael Poa said in a statement.

The complaints are the latest twist in the Philippines' tumultuous politics, with the vice president still locked in a bitter battle , opens new tab with former ally President Ferdinand Marcos Jr ahead of the next election. Marcos cannot run again due to a single-term limit but is expected to back a successor to try to keep Duterte from power.

Civil society and leftist groups filed two separate complaints against Duterte on Monday based on similar grounds to those lodged last year.

Those included her alleged misuse of public funds, bribery for government contracts and threatening to kill Marcos, the first lady, and the former House speaker who is also the president's cousin. The complainants also accused Duterte of ignoring congressional inquiries.

"The constitution does not permit such cynical disregard for public trust. It does not allow the Vice President to treat public funds as a personal war chest while stonewalling all attempts at oversight," one of the complaints said.

Duterte has previously rejected the allegations.

Marcos too is facing a separate impeachment complaint at the House of Representatives. Asked for comment on the new complaints against Duterte, the president's communications office said it was a matter for Congress to decide.

"We respect the rule of law and we respect due process. The president wants to fight corruption as much as he can, and people deserve to know the truth," it said.

Unlike last year's complaints, the impeachment effort against Duterte will need to hurdle additional procedures imposed by the Supreme Court last year.

A midterm election last year also saw more Duterte allies join the Senate, members of which serve as jurors in impeachment cases.

"It's even more challenging now, I would say, given this Supreme Court final ruling," Senator Risa Hontiveros told foreign correspondents at a forum on Monday.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 06:03:43 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ZUUYJDMECZOGVNUATIMNMTLF3A.jpg?auth=1c0413ca5dc619676b87fd8f183c58b42a50a45bec20f802156096750e02836b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Medvedev says Western claims of a Russian or Chinese threat to Greenland are false 'horror stories'</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/medvedev-says-western-claims-russian-or-chinese-threat-greenland-are-false-2026-02-02/</link><description>MOSCOW, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of Russia's Security Council, said that Western claims of a Russian or Chinese threat to Greenland were false "horror stories" made up by Western leaders to justify their own behaviour.

"This so called threat from Russia and the People's Republic of China is simply a horror story," Medvedev told Reuters, TASS and the WarGonzo Russian war blogger in an interview at his residence outside Moscow.

"This is indeed a serious challenge for Atlantic unity," Medvedev said.

Japan's election this coming weekend is among the most unpredictable in years , while polls across Latin America will ​test the region's rightward shift.

Here are some of the year's most significant elections for markets:

Japan's snap election on February 8 could loosen fiscal purse-strings in the developed world's most indebted ‌nation, on a debt-to-GDP basis. Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi wants to convert personal popularity into support for her expansionary fiscal policies and bolster her coalition government's position in parliament. Latest polls show her approval rating has slipped a touch.

Investors expect pressure on Japanese bonds to continue, and some analysts reckon 10-year yields will hit 3% this year, from just over 2% now.

Colombians will vote as many as three times, starting in March, to choose new legislators and a new president to replace Gustavo Petro , a leftist who has clashed with U.S. President Donald Trump .

Colombian stocks outperformed regional peers last year, but bond investors hope Latam's rightward shift will sweep up Colombia, too, restoring orthodox economic policies.

"If there is a change ‌to the right...there's potential for some fiscal adjustment," said Ninety One portfolio manager Nicolas Jaquier.

Jaquier said a victory for Ivan Cepeda of Petro's coalition could allow him ​to make structural changes at the central bank and supreme court - removing roadblocks that slowed some of Petro's policies.

Hungary's April vote is the opposition's best chance in years to end Prime Minister Viktor Orban's 16-year-long run.

Centre-right party Tisza has a polling lead over Orban's right-wing Fidesz, but the outcome remains uncertain.

Cost of living concerns are high, and Orban has used fiscal giveaways to assuage voter worries.

Fitch Ratings cut Hungary's credit rating outlook to ‍negative last year, citing "significantly worsened" public finance projections that reflected new measures in advance of the election.

Tisza has pledged to repair ties with the European Union and unblock funding. Citi's Luis E. Costa estimates that could mobilise 10 billion euros ($11.9 billion), which alongside other reforms could "enable higher investment spending, accompanied by a lower fiscal deficit and reduced risk premia".

Local elections usually don't attract the attention of foreign investors, but May's ballot might. Keir Starmer's ruling Labour Party is trailing in opinion polls ⁠to the populist Reform UK and has struggled to deliver on promises to strengthen the economy.

Markets are sensitive to signs that the fiscally restrained Starmer might be replaced, as seen by a recent bond selloff.

Societe Generale's UK ‍economist Sam Cartwright says a new British leader would not have scope to significantly lift government borrowing if Starmer is replaced, his base-case scenario. Britain's next parliamentary election must be held by August 2029.

Ethiopia and Zambia, both battling back ‌from debt ‌default, hold summer elections.

Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed 's Prosperity Party will almost certainly win a June vote, as key opposition groups plan a boycott.

In Zambia, President Hakainde Hichilema is currently expected to win in August, though Chatham House experts warn that citizens’ lives have yet to improve despite progress on debt restructuring and economic reform.

Investors are closely watching both countries as they seek opportunities in frontier markets . Zambia's economy has proved more resilient than expected, and Ethiopia's defaulted bond is trading above par despite the ongoing default .

Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva is leading polls for the October election against Flavio Bolsonaro - a right-wing senator and the son of previous President Jair Bolsonaro.

Leftist ⁠Lula, 80, managed a truce with U.S. President Donald Trump ⁠despite clashing over tariffs, Venezuela and the elder ​Bolsonaro's conviction for plotting a coup.

"A Lula victory...could be quite negative for prices," Tellimer's Geronimo Mansutti wrote, citing concerns of "four more years of wide deficits and a higher debt path".

A fourth term could also leave Lula - a progressive champion - facing more clashes with Trump.

But Ninety One's Jaquier pointed to Lula's value as a "known quantity", adding that he is pragmatic and likely to appoint a credible team to make fiscal adjustments.

The U.S. November mid-term elections will determine who controls ‍Congress and are an important test for Trump.

Affordability is a hot-button issue and the White ‍House has scrambled to offer proposals to ease cost-of-living concerns, including capping credit card interest rates .

Polls show that Americans ​are broadly unhappy with Trump's handling of the economy. The incumbent's party historically suffers during mid-terms and the president recently conceded that his Republican Party could struggle to retain its tenuous grip on Congress.

"Clearly the president would like to see economic growth booming and financial markets rallying, and this will play a big part in ​his narrative and policies in the coming months," said Zurich Insurance chief markets strategist Guy Miller. "The policies in to that election ‍will impact all of us."

Japan says the mission was the world's first bid to tap deep sea rare earths at such a depth.

"Details will be analysed, including exactly how much rare earth is contained" in the sample, government spokesman Kei Sato said, calling it "a meaningful achievement both in terms of economic security and comprehensive maritime development".

The sample was collected by a deep-sea scientific drilling boat called the Chikyu that set sail last month for the remote island of Minami Torishima in the Pacific, where surrounding waters are believed to contain a rich trove of valuable minerals.

It comes as China -- by far the world's biggest supplier of rare earths -- ramps up pressure on its neighbour after Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi suggested in November that Tokyo may react militarily to an attack on Taiwan, which Beijing has vowed to seize control of by force if necessary.

Beijing has blocked exports to Japan of "dual-use" items with potential military uses, fuelling worries in Japan that Beijing could choke supplies of rare earths, some of which are included in China's list of dual-use goods.

Rare earths -- 17 metals difficult to extract from the Earth's crust -- are used in everything from electric vehicles to hard drives, wind turbines and missiles.

The area around Minami Torishima, which is in Japan's economic waters, is estimated to contain more than 16 million tons of rare earths, which the Nikkei business daily says is the third-largest reserve globally.

These rich deposits contain an estimated 730 years' worth of dysprosium, used in high-strength magnets in phones and electric cars, and 780 years' worth of yttrium, used in lasers, the Nikkei said.

"If Japan could successfully extract rare earths around Minami Torishima constantly, it will secure domestic supply chain for key industries," Takahiro Kamisuna, research associate at The International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), told AFP.

"Likewise, it will be a key strategic asset for Takaichi's government to significantly reduce the supply chain dependence on China."

Beijing has long used its dominance in rare earths for geopolitical leverage, including in its trade war with US President Donald Trump's administration.

China accounts for almost two-thirds of rare earth mining production and 92 percent of global refined output, according to the International Energy Agency.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 06:04:31 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/281794c2-ffef-11f0-8007-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-12T022016Z-1129875432-RC2CZIAUB2FX-RTRMADP-3-JAPAN-RAREEARTHS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Germany closer to US than China despite recent tensions, foreign minister says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/germany-closer-us-than-china-despite-recent-tensions-foreign-minister-says-2026-02-02/</link><description>SINGAPORE, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Germany is "not in equidistance" from the United States and China, and will always be closer to Washington despite recent tensions, German foreign minister Johann Wadephul said in Singapore on Monday.

At a lecture hosted by the International Institute for Strategic Studies, Wadephul said the United States remains the most important partner for Europe and Germany and that Europe remains dependent on it for its security, despite issues that are currently "alienating" Washington from the region.

Trump administration officials have been critical of European countries for failing to meet NATO spending targets and for being too dependent on the United States for their own defence.

"Running with open arms to President Xi and saying all our problems vanished in this very moment and we are only heading to become your big partner, this would be the wrong answer," he said, referring to Chinese President Xi Jinping.

Western nations, such as Canada and the United Kingdom have been striking trade deals with China, defying U.S. criticism .

Trump's insistence that Washington should take control over Greenland has shaken transatlantic relations and accelerated European efforts to reduce its dependence on the United States, even as Trump last week withdrew his threat to impose additional tariffs and ruled out taking Greenland by force.

But Wadephul said Europe's united response to U.S. claims on Greenland shows that it can be successful at defending its interests as long as it defines its red lines clearly.

Wadephul also said that the European Union's network of free trade agreements is an "important building block for rules-based free trade in times of increased protectionism and fragmentation".

The European Union is working to "swiftly conclude" more free trade agreements in the Asia-Pacific region, including with Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines and Australia, he said.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 07:34:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/FOYPPONQ2FKSXPBY72AWJP2GNI.jpg?auth=5fa1cda9890a08ff6e6b71fcbf23e216df3a295f2eec5eee7314927a5e99206f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Rural Thai voters shift old loyalties, testing Pheu Thai's populist machine</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/rural-thai-voters-shift-old-loyalties-testing-pheu-thais-populist-machine-2026-02-02/</link><description>UBON RATCHATHANI, Thailand, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Rubber farmer Pinittaya Boonlieng sat with friends in a key political battleground in Thailand to discuss how to vote in the February 8 general election - a choice that once would have been simple in a region long loyal to former premier Thaksin Shinawatra.

Thaksin's populist Pheu Thai party has dominated agrarian Ubon Ratchathani and neighbouring provinces in northeastern Thailand for decades, but that grip is weakening and voters are switching allegiance to powerful individual candidates.

In this region, Pheu Thai is polling at 30.1%, slightly behind the national frontrunner, the reformist People's Party, according to a survey conducted by the University of Khon Kaen in January. The conservative Bhumjaithai Party of Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul is third at 27.2%.

In the last election in 2023, Pheu Thai won 73 of 133 direct constituency seats available across 20 provinces in Thailand's northeast, which houses 4 million of the country's 8.56 million registered farmers.

Many of its candidates from the 2023 election remain popular, reflecting the patronage politics they have followed, although some have switched parties , particularly after the removal of Thaksin's daughter - Paetongtarn Shinawatra - as premier last year for her botched handling of border tensions with Cambodia.

The row exploded into the worst fighting between the neighbours in decades, killing at least 149 people, and stoking public anger in Thailand over Thaksin's once-close ties with former Cambodian leader Hun Sen.

Thaksin is currently in prison because of an unrelated case, and a wave of nationalism washing over Thai politics has weakened Pheu Thai, which is also drawing flak for its inability to deliver on handouts promised when taking office in 2023.

Pinittaya, the rubber farmer, said she is considering backing the ruling Bhumjaithai Party, not because of its ideology or policies, but because she likes her local candidate, a former Pheu Thai lawmaker who defected.

"I am choosing the candidate," Pinittaya, 48, said. "The party is less important."

Six other farmers interviewed by Reuters in Ubon Ratchathani and a neighbouring province shared the same sentiment, showing how farm communities battered by falling crop prices, rising costs and mounting debt are shifting from party-based loyalty to backing candidates they believe can help them.

Manee Ruamtham, 62, a rice farmer in Sisaket province, said she was once a Pheu Thai voter but walked away from the party when it failed to deliver on its promise of a 10,000 baht ($317) cash handout after it took power following the 2023 polls.

"I was like their number one supporter but what they did isn't right," she said. "People lost faith in the party."

Paetongtarn blamed steep tariffs proposed by the United States for stalling her government's flagship handout programme, and her administration was eventually ousted due to the Cambodia crisis, leaving the handouts unfinished.

The local candidate Manee said she will vote for is Nuchanat Jaruwongsethian, a former Pheu Thai lawmaker who defected to the smaller Kla Tham party, an ally of the ruling Bhumjaithai.

"People voted for me to fight for farmers, to fight for decent wages," said Nuchanat, a former long-time Pheu Thai supporter. "But one day it wasn't about this anymore, so how can I answer the people?"

But not all rural voters are abandoning Pheu Thai. In Ubon Ratchathani, 53-year-old tapioca farmer Ubon Thanomsup said she may still back the party she has supported for many years - largely because of the local candidate.

"The candidate lives in our area, so he is nearer to help," she said.

Cherdsak Phokkunlanon, a Pheu Thai candidate in the province, said that his party could retain, and even expand, its rural support base with the help of populist policies, a playbook that Pheu Thai has successfully deployed before.

"Pheu Thai policy will guarantee the price of agricultural goods, so that people will gain 30% profit when they sell their products," Cherdsak said.

Political parties are responding to the swing in sentiment by aggressively recruiting well-known local figures, including defectors from rival camps, in a strategy aimed at capturing personal loyalty networks, rather than relying solely on national campaigns.

Among those is Sudarat Pitakpornpunlop, a former Pheu Thai lawmaker now running for Bhumjaithai in Ubon Ratchathani's District 7.

"Even if I change to another four or five parties, I will be the same old person who worked for all of you like before," she told voters at a rally last month.

Nationwide, at least 91 lawmakers elected in 2023 have changed their political affiliation ahead of February polls, according to multiple local media.

Of these, Bhumjaithai attracted 64 defectors, while Kla Tham took second place with 21 lawmakers joining its ranks. Only one has switched to Pheu Thai.

The trend reflects the enduring power of patronage politics in the Thai hinterland, rooted in gaps in state welfare schemes and public service delivery, said Titipol Phakdeewanich, a political scientist at Ubon Ratchathani University.

"When people help you, you feel you owe them something. These networks are long-term investments, and they can still help politicians win elections," he said.

Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine triggered the biggest confrontation between the West and Moscow since the depths of the Cold War, though U.S. President Donald Trump's envoys are trying to negotiate an end to the war with Russia and Ukraine.

Medvedev, who serves as deputy chairman of Russia's Security Council, a kind of modern-day politburo of Russia's most powerful officials, praised Trump and said it was encouraging that contacts had resumed with Washington.

But Medvedev, who has repeatedly hurled invective at Kyiv and Western powers while warning of the risks of an escalation of the war towards a nuclear "apocalypse", said the West had repeatedly ignored Russian interests.

"The situation is very dangerous," Medvedev told Reuters, TASS and the WarGonzo Russian war blogger in an interview at his residence outside Moscow.

"The pain threshold seems to be decreasing."

"We are not interested in a global conflict. We're not crazy," said Medvedev, who served as Russian president from 2008 to 2012. "A global conflict cannot be ruled out."

President Vladimir Putin remains the final voice on Russian policy, though Medvedev, now an arch-hawk, gives a sense of hardliners' thinking within the Russian elite, according to foreign diplomats.

A cartoon hanging in the room where the interview took place showed Medvedev, a former lawyer who hails from Putin's hometown of St Petersburg, pointing a submachine gun at European leaders.

Putin and Trump have both mentioned the risks of escalation over Ukraine, though European diplomats say that Moscow has skillfully played the escalation card to scare Ukraine's allies from getting too heavily involved in the war.

"They say 'No way - these Russians are making it all up - they are sowing horror stories and they will never do anything," Medvedev said, adding that what the Kremlin calls the "Special Military Operation" in Ukraine showed Russia would stand up for its interests.

Ukraine and its European allies cast the war, the deadliest in Europe since World War Two, as an imperial-style land grab, and say that if Russia wins in Ukraine then it will one day attack NATO. Russia dismisses such claims as nonsense.

Conflict first erupted in eastern Ukraine in 2014 after a pro-Russian president was toppled in Ukraine's Maidan Revolution. Russia annexed Crimea and Moscow-backed separatists battled Kyiv's armed forces in eastern Ukraine.

When asked about the flurry of global events of January in Venezuela, over Greenland and elsewhere, Medvedev said that it had all been simply "too much".

On Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, a Russian ally, Medvedev said that if Trump had been "stolen" by a foreign power, then the United States would have clearly seen it as an act of war.

He also said Western claims of a Russian or Chinese threat to Greenland were false "horror stories" made up by Western leaders to justify their own behaviour.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 07:35:42 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/FOLUZGS3Y5N7TBBDYRKOZVMAL4.jpg?auth=5480d241a308f666b63fcb01cd481da441f2ad164df69d8f63a5bd4f32b128a9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia's Medvedev says expiry of New START should alarm the world</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/russias-medvedev-says-expiry-new-start-should-alarm-world-2026-02-02/</link><description>MOSCOW, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of Russia's Security Council, said that if the New START treaty expired with no replacement then the world should be alarmed that the biggest nuclear powers had no limits for probably the first time since the early 1970s.

"I don't want to say that this immediately means a catastrophe and a nuclear war will begin, but it should still alarm everyone," Medvedev told Reuters, TASS and the WarGonzo Russian war blogger in an interview at his residence outside Moscow.

Arms control treaties, Medvedev said, played a crucial role not just in limiting the number of warheads but also as a way to verify intentions and to ensure some element of trust between major nuclear powers.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 07:35:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7MOCWNBHYRNFLIXZPZQQY3YSJY.jpg?auth=78b17eaaf6c889c0916d68f3da7c58119c8a1709bb000d2752ccf3e364d73e6a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israel reopens Gaza's Rafah border crossing to Egypt, with limits</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-expected-reopen-gazas-rafah-border-crossing-egypt-with-limits-2026-02-02/</link><description>GAZA, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Israel reopened the border between Gaza and Egypt on Monday for people on foot, a move that would allow Palestinians to leave the enclave and let back in those who want to return after fleeing Israel's war in the enclave.

The reopening of the Rafah border crossing will be limited, with Israel demanding security checks for Palestinians entering and exiting. Israel and Egypt were expected to impose caps on the number of travellers.

Israel seized the border crossing in May 2024, about nine months into the Gaza war that was brought to a tenuous halt by an October ceasefire brokered by U.S. President Donald Trump . Rafah's reopening was an important requirement under the first phase of Trump's broader plan to stop fighting between Israel and Hamas militants.

An Israeli security official said that European monitoring teams had arrived at the crossing, which "has now opened to the movement of residents, for both entry and exit."

In the first nine months of Israel's assault in Gaza, launched after the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack on southern Israel, Palestinians were generally able to flee to Egypt through the Rafah crossing.

Palestinian officials say about 100,000 Palestinians have fled Gaza since the war began, most of them during the first nine months. Some were sponsored by aid groups. Others paid bribes to parties in Egypt to secure permission to leave.

Israel closed the Rafah crossing after its forces swept into the area and has also closed the Philadelphi corridor that runs the length of Gaza's border with Egypt.

The closure cut off an important route for wounded and sick Palestinians to seek medical care outside Gaza. A few thousand have been allowed out to seek medical treatment in third countries via Israel over the past year, though thousands more are in need of care abroad, according to the United Nations.

Despite the reopening of Rafah, Israel is still refusing to allow the entry of foreign journalists, who have been banned from Gaza since the start of the war, which has caused widespread destruction and laid waste to swathes of territory.

Gaza's about 2 million Palestinians mostly live in makeshift tents and damaged homes, surrounded by the ruins of their destroyed cities.

Israel's Supreme Court is considering a petition by the Foreign Press Association that demands foreign journalists be allowed to enter Gaza from Israel. Government lawyers have said that letting journalists into Gaza could pose risks to Israeli soldiers, while also highlighting potential risks to reporters.

The FPA rejects this, saying the public is being deprived of a vital source of independent information. It also points to the fact that many aid and United Nations workers have been allowed to enter the enclave since the war started.

Trump's plan for Gaza, now in its second phase, foresees governance being handed to Palestinian technocrats, Hamas laying down its weapons and Israeli troops withdrawing from the territory while it is rebuilt.

Israel has cast doubt on the prospect of Hamas laying down its arms and some officials say the military is preparing for a return to war. Since the October deal was struck, Israeli attacks in Gaza have killed more than 500 Palestinians, health officials say, while militants have killed four Israeli troops.

On Saturday, Israel launched some of its most intense airstrikes since the ceasefire, killing at least 30 people, in what it said was a response to a Hamas violation of the truce on Friday.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 08:43:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/RBBPTNMFQNJ43B5ORNILZS2YJU.jpg?auth=e48441b3ef36878bfcb855a96b53b3611a7f240009d1cade5fe8bf23677606b4&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran examines diplomacy with US, hopes for results in coming days, official says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-examines-diplomacy-with-us-hopes-results-coming-days-official-says-2026-02-02/</link><description>DUBAI, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Details of various diplomatic processes to manage tensions with the U.S. are being examined by Iran, Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei said on Monday, adding that Tehran hoped for results in the coming days.

Verdi, which represents nearly 100,000 transport workers, called the strike after talks with municipal and state employers over working conditions stalled last week.

The union is demanding shorter shifts, longer rest breaks and higher pay for night and weekend work even as cities grapple with budget constraints.

The walkout affects about 150 municipal transport companies in all but one of Germany's 16 federal states, including Berlin, Hamburg and Bremen.

One of the largest coordinated actions in local transport sector in years, the strike began as planned, Serat Canyurt, the leading negotiator for Verdi, told rbb radio on Monday, adding that public transport operators were now expected to return to the negotiating table.

In Stuttgart, Karlsruhe and Freiburg, services will grind to a halt for the entire day, union officials said.

Temperatures fell below zero in much of the country, worsening the situation for commuters forced to seek alternative transportation.

Still, Deutsche Bahn said Friday its urban railway S-Bahn trains in cities including Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Stuttgart, along with long-distance services, would run as normal on Monday as staff were not represented by Verdi.

Talks between Verdi and employer associations have been tense, with union leaders accusing municipalities of seeking to cut benefits and lengthen shifts.

In Berlin, Verdi negotiators said operators wanted workers to fund improvements themselves by giving up sick pay and flexible hours.

The next round of negotiations is scheduled for February 9.

Union leaders warned that further industrial action could follow if employers do not offer significant concessions.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 08:44:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/QF2HG53KVJOFNJYKPJASOWWI4M.jpg?auth=04b8d8a0cb99e107f62d7d9c3b77805def9f31118e74a43214334c9c3bfd3346&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Gaza border reopening long awaited by stranded Palestinians</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/gaza-border-reopening-long-awaited-by-stranded-palestinians-2026-02-02/</link><description>CAIRO/GAZA, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Cut off from family or urgently requiring hospital care, Palestinians stranded on each side of Gaza's Rafah crossing waited with growing desperation for Monday's reopening of the border as a delayed part of October's ceasefire deal.

How fully crossings to and from Egypt will resume, and under what conditions, remains unclear with Israel retaining complete control of Gaza's frontier, but for those waiting to travel even a partial reopening feels long overdue.

While Rafah was partially open early in the Gaza war between Israel and Palestinian Hamas militants, it has been shut entirely since summer 2024 and only very small numbers have been able to travel to or from Gaza via Israel since then.

The people hoping to return to Gaza know it lies in ruins, their homes and neighbourhoods destroyed in Israel's two-year military campaign sparked by the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack. Those seeking to leave know that new restrictions could maroon them abroad.

Yet, a mother cut off from family and grieving the death of her newborn son, a trader yearning to reunite with his fiancee for a long-delayed wedding, and two people needing medical treatment abroad were all hopeful for the reopening.

Faten Hamed Abu Watfa, 43, has not seen her three children since she left Gaza nearly 10 months ago. Sitting in Egypt, she scrolls through photographs on her mobile phone, pictures of her two sons, aged 21 and 18, and her 15‑year‑old daughter, trying to bridge the distance that has kept her separated from them.

Abu Watfa left Gaza City’s al‑Karama neighbourhood on April 5, 2024, hoping to stay away for no more than six to eight weeks while her mother‑in‑law received medical treatment. Instead, she became stranded in Egypt after the Rafah crossing closed.

"It's an indescribable feeling, that one will go back to be reunited with his children and family, to the country, to the place where he lived and grew up."

Her return, however, will not be to the home she left behind. Abu Watfa said her house was torched by Israeli forces, leaving only the concrete pillars standing.

“When it rains, they put something like tar on the roof to keep the water from dripping on them, because the situation would be really difficult," she said.

"I am ready to enter Gaza, be searched and get tired, not for a day, but for a whole week... to be dragged around during the journey back, until I reach Gaza and see my children and my father safe and sound."

Many families who arrived in Cairo early in the war never expected to remain for so long. Some depleted their savings, while others found themselves divided, with relatives trapped on opposite sides of the Rafah border.

“I love Gaza, and I don’t see any other place that feels like home,” said Mohammad Talal al‑Burai, 28, a currency trader whose house in Jabalia in north Gaza was destroyed.

Despite fears of a relapse into fighting and concerns that poor internet and communications could disrupt his work, Burai registered with the Palestinian embassy in Cairo as soon as the Rafah crossing reopened.

“Going back to live in a tent? I don’t care,” he said. “I can’t wait to take my father into my arms and place a kiss on his forehead,” Burai told Reuters.

Burai postponed his wedding after the war erupted in October 2023. His mother remains in the United Arab Emirates, receiving medical treatment.

“I will go ahead with my marriage, but I may not hold a party since my mother might not be able to join us,” he said.

For others, the chance to cross is a matter of life and death.

Tamer Al-Burai, 50, who is a cousin of Mohammad Al-Burai's father, suffers from obstructive sleep apnea and relies on Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) machine, to help him breathe normally during sleep by keeping the airway open.

“My health has become much worse because there is no power and no fuel,” he said. His family left for Egypt two years ago, but he was unable to follow because the crossing remained shut.

“I have appealed to humanitarian groups, to the WHO, to the Palestinian Authority - to anyone - so that I can leave, save my life, and reunite with my family,” Al-Burai said.

Thousands of Gaza Palestinians have registered with the World Health Organization to travel for treatment. Gaza’s health ministry said at least 20,000 patients, including children and cancer patients, are awaiting evacuation.

Among them is Noor Daher, 31, a graphic designer from Gaza City with a chronic heart defect. “My heart beats even harder now,” he said. “I am hopeful my problem will finally end.”

For many, the reopening came too late.

Dalia Abu Kashef, 28, died last week while waiting for her name to appear on the Rafah crossing list for a liver transplant.

"We found a volunteer - her brother - who was ready to donate part of his liver," said her husband Muatasem El-Rass.

"We were waiting for the crossing to open so we could travel and do the surgery, hoping for a happy ending. But she deteriorated badly and died."</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 08:44:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4GFHYRCDVVOQVFT3IKZPGWHX4M.jpg?auth=3721508a09102e9df71955e55e4bc984b71b53bec4f7540decc530211c3485c6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>What's next for Trump's Gaza plan after Rafah reopening?</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/whats-next-trumps-gaza-plan-after-rafah-reopening-2026-02-02/</link><description>Feb 2 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's plan to end the Gaza war was given a boost on Monday with the reopening of the enclave's Rafah crossing with Egypt. But difficult questions remain unaddressed, including whether Hamas will disarm.

Trump's plan, now in its second phase, has been shaken by repeated Israeli attacks that have killed hundreds in Gaza, as well as resistance by Hamas militants to lay down their weapons. Israeli officials say they are preparing for a return to war if Hamas refuses to disarm.

Below is background on Trump's plan as well as key issues left to be resolved.

In September, Trump outlined a 20-point plan for an initial truce, followed by steps towards a broader resolution.

It ultimately calls for Hamas to disarm and have no governing role in Gaza, for Israel to pull out its forces, and for broad reconstruction of the territory under international supervision.

The plan was widely endorsed internationally, although the sides have not yet fully agreed to everything in it.On October 9, Israel and Hamas signed a ceasefire deal covering the first phase of the plan. That included a halt to fighting, the release of all remaining hostages held in Gaza in exchange for thousands of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, a partial Israeli withdrawal, a surge in aid and the reopening of the Rafah crossing.

The Trump plan was also endorsed by a United Nations Security Council resolution that authorised a transitional governing body and international stabilisation force in Gaza.

WHAT IS THE SITUATION NOW?The ceasefire came into effect on October 10 and ended large-scale combat, though fighting did not completely stop.Gaza health authorities say at least 488 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire since October 10, and Israel's military says four soldiers have been killed by militants in that time.

Israeli forces pulled back and suspended ground assaults, but still control over 53% of Gaza, including ruined cities along the Israeli and Egyptian borders where they have demolished remaining buildings and ordered residents out.

That means nearly all of Gaza's more than 2 million people are now confined to a sliver of territory on the coast, where Hamas has reasserted control. Most residents live in damaged buildings or makeshift tents.

Palestinian groups and aid agencies say Israel is still not allowing supplies into Gaza at the rate agreed under the first phase of the deal. Israel says it is meeting those commitments.

Armed anti-Hamas Palestinian groups have set up bases in Israeli-held parts of Gaza; Hamas dismisses them as collaborators with no popular support.

Both sides have shown little sign of narrowing their disputes over steps to be taken in the next phase, which foresees the disarmament of Hamas, further withdrawal of Israeli forces and deployment of peacekeepers.

WHAT'S EXPECTED IN THE SECOND PHASE?Despite wide gaps between Israel and Hamas, Washington launched the plan's second phase after the New Year, announcing the establishment of a committee of Palestinian technocrats to run Gaza.

They will be overseen by a "Board of Peace" of foreign dignitaries led by Trump, which he initially proposed to address the Gaza war and has since said will also tackle other conflicts.

The plan's second phase also includes Hamas giving up its weapons and Gaza being demilitarised, in exchange for Israel fully withdrawing its troops.

The militant group is still believed to possess rockets, which several diplomats estimated to number in the hundreds. It is also estimated to possess thousands of light weapons, including rifles.

Hamas recently agreed to discuss disarmament with other Palestinian factions and with mediators, sources said. However, two Hamas officials told Reuters that neither Washington nor the mediators had presented the group with any detailed or concrete disarmament proposal.

Two senior Israeli officials told Reuters that the military was preparing to return to war if Hamas does not give up its weapons and that it did not expect the militants to disarm without the use of force.

Hamas is also seeking to incorporate its 10,000 police officers into the new technocrat-led government in Gaza, sources said, a demand opposed by Israel.

An international stabilisation force is intended to ensure security and peace inside Gaza. But its composition, role and mandate are all up in the air.

The Palestinian Authority, which is internationally recognised and exercises limited self-rule in parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, is supposed to carry out unspecified reforms before ultimately taking a role in Gaza. But details have not been outlined.

Plans have yet to be hammered out to fund and oversee Gaza's reconstruction. Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, laid out plans this month for a "New Gaza" to be rebuilt from scratch, with computer-generated photos of gleaming residential towers, data centres and industrial zones.

The plan did not address property rights or compensation for Palestinians who lost their homes, businesses and livelihoods during the war, nor did it spell out where displaced Palestinians might live during the rebuilding.

Many Israelis and Palestinians suspect the Trump plan will never be fully realised and a frozen conflict will continue indefinitely.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 08:45:56 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/TI4AQSRZ6ZMDPIMZVRFZGH55L4.jpg?auth=0b2955e38416e03764b6a784d8a7a67a4082432fc3e5e15e554ef5837d198446&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Gaza's Rafah crossing with Egypt reopens for limited number of Palestinians</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260202-gaza-s-rafah-crossing-with-egypt-reopens-for-limited-number-of-palestinians</link><description>Israel reopened the border between Gaza and Egypt on Monday for people on foot, a move that would allow a limited number of Palestinians to leave the enclave and let back in those who want to return after fleeing Israel's war in the enclave.

An Egyptian official said 50 Palestinians would cross in each direction in the first day of the crossing’s operation. The official, involved in talks related the implementation of ceasefire deal, spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss the issue.

About 20,000 Palestinian children and adults needing medical care hope to leave devastated Gaza via the crossing, according to Gaza health officials. Thousands of other Palestinians outside the territory hope to enter and return home.

Asked if Russia was discussing with Iran and the United States the possibility of taking Iranian enriched uranium, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: "This topic has been on the agenda for a long time."

"Russia has been offering its services for quite a long time as a possible option that would lead to the removal of certain irritants for a number of countries," Peskov said.

"Right now, Russia is continuing its efforts, continuing its contacts with all interested parties, and maintains its readiness to de-escalate tensions around Iran to the best of its ability," he said.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 10:44:39 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/THCR5P4KO5KKLMJ7XLCLQRNERI.jpg?auth=e4975d22e751d0af0eed4c168e917433032f68432c8a123c72af5f35eea43cf8&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Pakistani security forces hunt militants behind weekend attacks</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/pakistani-security-forces-hunt-militants-behind-weekend-attacks-2026-02-02/</link><description>QUETTA, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Pakistani soldiers were hunting down separatist militants on Monday who stormed schools, banks, and security installations, killing nearly 50 people, in a series of coordinated attacks across southwestern Balochistan province, the military said.

The attacks at the weekend brought Pakistan's largest province to a near standstill as the separatist Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) struck nearly a dozen targets in one of their largest ever operations, killing 17 security officials and 31 civilians.

Pakistan's military has killed 177 BLA fighters in three days of fighting, the interior ministry said on Monday.

Pakistan's government and military have said the group has received support from India, threatening to escalate hostilities between the nuclear-powered neighbours who engaged in their worst armed conflict in decades in May.

Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said 22 more militants had been killed overnight in different areas of Balochistan, taking the total to 177.

"Security forces, police and intelligence agencies thwarted the nefarious intentions of terrorists by taking timely and effective action," Naqvi said in a statement.

"The Indian agents and their facilitators will be completely eliminated."

India's foreign office had rejected the allegations on Sunday, saying Islamabad should instead address the "long-standing demands of its people in the region".

Balochistan, Pakistan's largest and poorest province, has faced a decades-long insurgency led by ethnic Baloch separatists seeking greater autonomy and a larger share of its natural resources.

The group claimed it had killed 84 members of Pakistan's security forces and captured 18 others. Reuters could not independently verify the claim. The military did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Attackers dressed as ordinary civilians entered hospitals, schools, banks and markets on Saturday before opening fire, Pakistan's junior interior minister Talal Chaudhry said.

"In each case, the attackers came in dressed as civilians and indiscriminately targeted ordinary people working in shops," he said, adding militants had used civilians as human shields.

The banned BLA said the attacks were part of a coordinated operation dubbed Herof, or "black storm", targeting security forces across the province.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 10:45:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Hungary's Tisza party maintains lead over Orban's ruling Fidesz, poll shows</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/hungarys-tisza-party-maintains-lead-over-orbans-ruling-fidesz-poll-shows-2026-02-02/</link><description>BUDAPEST, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Hungary's centre-right opposition Tisza party kept an eight-point lead over Prime Minister Viktor Orban's governing nationalist Fidesz party in January, a poll showed on Monday, ahead of a parliamentary election set for April 12.

Orban is facing the biggest challenge to his grip on power since Fidesz swept to victory in 2010, although the outcome remains highly uncertain.

Tisza is led by former government insider Peter Magyar who has said his party will tackle corruption, unlock billions of euros in frozen European Union funds to boost the economy, and firmly anchor Hungary in the EU.

The April vote will have major implications for Europe and its far-right political forces.

Orban, an ally of U.S. President Donald Trump, has often clashed with the EU on a range of issues while maintaining cordial ties with Russia and criticising Ukraine. The EU accuses Orban of eroding democratic values in Hungary, which he denies.

The latest poll, conducted between January 21-24 by Publicus Institute and published by daily newspaper Nepszava, showed that 48% of decided voters supported Tisza while 40% backed Fidesz, unchanged from December.

Besides the two major parties, only the far-right Our Homeland (Mi Hazank) would surpass the 5% threshold required for entry into parliament, the survey found.

The poll also found that 63% of voters thought Hungary was on the wrong track. That figure rose to 71% among pensioners, a key demographic, which Orban has targeted with a pension top-up.

Most polls have shown Fidesz trailing Tisza despite voter-pleasing measures after three years of economic stagnation in Hungary, which has also endured the EU's worst inflationary surge following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

However, pro-government pollsters show a Fidesz lead.

A second survey published on Monday by the pro-government Nezopont Institute showed Orban had a 46% approval rating compared with 35% for Magyar.

Nezopont, which did not survey party preferences in the poll conducted between January 26-27, said support for Orban was especially high among elderly and rural voters.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 10:45:32 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/M6V7ORONRFPWNNOUUBVFOZHFO4.jpg?auth=c94e48fa00b3b8324da16042ac474a19a551fe34addb55150f73df46af5ddf08&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iraq starts investigations into IS group detainees moved from Syrian camps</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260202-iraq-starts-investigations-into-is-group-detainees-moved-from-syrian-camps</link><description>Iraq 's judiciary announced on Monday it has begun its investigations into more than 1,300 Islamic State (IS) group detainees who were transferred from Syria as part of a US operation .

"Investigation proceedings have started with 1,387 members of the Daesh terrorist organisation who were recently transferred from the Syrian territory," the judiciary's media office said in a statement, using the Arabic acronym for the IS group.

"Under the supervision of the head of Iraq's Supreme Judicial Council, several judges specialising in counter-terrorism started the investigation."

Those detainees are among 7,000 IS group suspects, previously held by Syrian Kurdish fighters, whom the US military said it would transfer to Iraq after Syrian government forces seized Kurdish-held territory .

They include Syrians, Iraqis and Europeans, among other nationalities, according to several Iraqi security sources.

In 2014, the IS group swept across Syria and Iraq, committing massacres and forcing women and girls into sexual slavery.

Backed by US-led forces, Iraq proclaimed the defeat of the IS group in the country in 2017, and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) ultimately beat the group back in Syria two years later.

The SDF went on to jail thousands of suspected jihadists and detain tens of thousands of their relatives in camps.

The al-Hol and ​al-Roj camps hold more than 28,000 people, mostly ‍Syrians and Iraqis, according to the UN. About 6,000 foreigners are housed ​in al-Hol and a further 2,000 in al-Roj.

Last month, the United States said the purpose of its alliance with Kurdish forces in Syria had largely expired, as Damascus pressed an offensive to take back territory long held by the SDF.

In Iraq, where many prisons are packed with IS group suspects, courts have handed down hundreds of death sentences and life terms to people convicted of terrorism offences, including many foreign fighters.

Iraq's judiciary said its investigation procedures "will comply with national laws and international standards".</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 10:47:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/effbe85a-001a-11f1-96ce-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26029591423496.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Drone incidents at UK military bases doubled last year</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/drone-incidents-uk-military-bases-doubled-last-year-2026-02-02/</link><description>LONDON, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Britain's military bases experienced a doubling of drone incidents last year, highlighting the changing nature of warfare and prompting the government to hand more powers to its forces to protect sites from aerial threats.

In 2025, there were 266 reported uncrewed aerial vehicle incidents near defence sites in Britain, up from 126 reported in 2024, part of a wider trend of European airspace being targeted by drones.

"The doubling of rogue drones near military sites in the UK in the last year underlines the increasing and changing nature of the threats we face," Defence minister John Healey said in a statement on Monday.

Drone incursions forced airports in Belgium and Denmark to close for hours at a time in the last few months of 2025, with experts saying the incidents had the hallmarks of Russian interference, a charge denied by Moscow.

In order to counter the threat from drones to British bases, Healey said military officers would be given new powers to destroy drones operating near them, an action that previously required the involvement of the police.

The new powers will also mean the military can destroy land drones and unmanned vehicles operating under water.

Healey said security at military sites had been stepped up. Last June, pro-Palestinian activists broke into a Royal Air Force base, damaging and spraying red paint over two planes used for refuelling and transport.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 11:36:27 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/NYKV7PMLCVMADPU2A5BWP6S7WU.jpg?auth=4a826946e1d5c91454d63f95c278e4d240eba6067d8394cfae046024f770f2a0&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>British serial killer 'Suffolk Strangler' pleads guilty to 1999 murder</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/british-serial-killer-suffolk-strangler-pleads-guilty-1999-murder-2026-02-02/</link><description>LONDON, Feb 2 (Reuters) - A British serial killer dubbed the "Suffolk Strangler" by the media after he killed five young women two decades ago pleaded guilty on Monday to another murder from 27 years ago.

Steve Wright, who is already serving a life sentence with no prospect of parole for killing the women in 2006, appeared at London's Old Bailey court and admitted kidnapping and murdering 17-year-old Victoria Hall in 1999.

Wright, 67, also pleaded guilty to the attempted kidnap of a 22-year-old woman the day before Hall's murder. He will be sentenced on Friday.

"Justice has finally been achieved for Victoria Hall after 26 years," Samantha Woolley from the Crown Prosecution Service said in a statement.

Wright was convicted in 2008 of the murder of five women who worked as prostitutes in the town of Ipswich, northeast of London in Suffolk. Wright left two of the bodies in a crucifix position with arms outstretched.

He was give a whole-life order, meaning he could never be released from prison, for what the sentencing judge described as "a targeted campaign of murder".

Wright had consistently denied the allegations even though his DNA was found on three of the victims and bloodstains from two of them were found on his jacket at his home. His victims' bodies were found in the space of just 10 days around Ipswich.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 11:36:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/OU2UWHZXQJP3HGNO6SDCN7K2OQ.jpg?auth=9b0e43f1fb7c2f8506c360b2d0d4af7d5a4a3bccaa21a295c989115ee24c72b5&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Snapchat blocks 415,000 underage accounts in Australia under social media ban</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260202-snapchat-blocks-415-000-underage-accounts-in-australia-under-social-media-ban</link><description>Snapchat has blocked 415,000 accounts under Australia 's social media ban for under-16s , the company said Monday, but warned some youngsters may be bypassing age verification technology.

The platform urged the Australian authorities to oblige app stores to check users' ages as an "additional safeguard" for the world-first crackdown.

Platforms including Snapchat, Meta , TikTok and YouTube must stop underage users from holding accounts under the legislation, which came into effect on December 10.

Companies face fines of Aus$49.5 million (US$34 million) if they fail to take "reasonable steps" to comply.

Australia's eSafety online regulator reported last month that tech giants had already blocked 4.7 million accounts, delivering "significant outcomes".

As of the end of January, Snapchat said it had blocked or disabled 415,000 Snapchat accounts in Australia belonging to under-16s.

"We continue to lock more accounts daily," it said in an online statement.

But the law leaves "significant gaps", Snapchat said, arguing that age estimation technology was only accurate to within two to three years.

"In practice, this means some young people under 16 may be able to bypass protections, potentially leaving them with reduced safeguards, while others over 16 may incorrectly lose access."

Snapchat joined billionaire Mark Zuckerberg 's Meta in calling on Australia to require app stores to check users' ages before allowing downloads.

"Creating a centralised verification system at the app-store level would allow for more consistent protection and higher barriers to circumventing the law," Snapchat said.

The platform said it did not believe an outright ban was the right approach.

Snapchat said it understood Australia's objectives and wanted to protect people online, but did not agree its platform should be covered by the social media ban.

"In the case of Snapchat – which is primarily a messaging app used by young people to stay connected with close friends and family – we do not believe that cutting teens off from these relationships makes them safer, happier, or otherwise better off," it said.

Australia's world-first ban is being closely watched by ⁠other countries considering similar age-based measures, with Britain and France being the latest to signal such plans.

France's National Assembly on January 26 approved legislation to ban children under 15 from social media amid growing concerns about online bullying and mental health risks. The bill still needs to pass through the Senate before a final vote in the lower house.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 11:37:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/2649eca4-fffd-11f0-84b0-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/536b17d7a21bf1d09abe16827de3c3f7e0437990.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Syrian state forces deploy into Kurdish-run city under ceasefire deal</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/syrian-government-forces-deploy-towards-kurdish-run-city-after-ceasefire-deal-2026-02-02/</link><description>HASAKAH, Syria, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Syrian government security forces deployed into a Kurdish-controlled city in the northeast on Monday under a U.S.-backed ceasefire deal that foresees the Kurdish-run regions being merged with Damascus.

The deal, declared on Friday, has staved off further conflict between President Ahmed al-Sharaa's government and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, which lost swathes of eastern and northern Syria to government troops in January.

Reuters journalists saw a convoy of more than 30 interior ministry vehicles begin moving towards the city of Hasakah from a position outside the city in the early afternoon. Two local sources in the city said they entered shortly afterwards.

The government forces are expected to be stationed in Syrian state buildings in Hasakah's so-called "security zone", a Syrian official and a Kurdish security source told Reuters ahead of the deployment.

The accord declared on Friday foresees a phased integration of Kurdish fighters with government forces. The United States has hailed the agreement as a historic milestone towards unity and reconciliation in Syria after 14 years of civil war.

The SDF was once Washington's main Syrian ally, playing a vital part in the fight against Islamic State militants. But its status weakened as President Donald Trump built close ties with Sharaa, a former al Qaeda commander who has now brought almost all of Syria back under the authority of Damascus.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 14:12:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/XU2OL3P45VLKTPSPBHC7WSND6E.jpg?auth=6070df570816fcae4fdd18e4335a9d48662d9dbba6ba0adb2dd86cf13d5982db&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>No new targeted Russian strikes on Ukrainian energy infrastructure, Zelenskiy says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/no-new-targeted-russian-strikes-ukrainian-energy-infrastructure-zelenskiy-says-2026-02-02/</link><description>KYIV, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Russia has not carried out any targeted missile or drone strikes on Ukrainian energy infrastructure in the last 24 hours although energy facilities in frontline areas have come under fire, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Monday.

Zelenskiy's statement highlighted the limitations of a short-term energy truce that Russia agreed to last week at the request of U.S. President Donald Trump.

Zelenskiy said energy repair crews had managed to restore energy facilities damaged when high-voltage power lines malfunctioned over the weekend, on top of the damage caused by frequent Russian attacks.

"The (energy) system is operating stably. However, given the extremely cold weather and the impact of Russian strikes, all challenges remain serious," Zelenskiy said on the Telegram app.

Zelenskiy said Russian forces were focused on attacking transport logistics, especially railway infrastructure.

Russia and Ukraine said last week they halted strikes on each other's energy infrastructure, but disagreed on the timeframe for the truce.

The Kremlin said Trump had made a personal request to Russian President Vladimir Putin to refrain from striking Kyiv until February 1. Zelenskiy said the truce was supposed to last for a week, starting January 30.

A Russian drone strike on Sunday killed 12 miners at a coal mine in the Ukrainian Dnipropetrovsk region, officials said. DTEK said on Monday one of its coal mining enterprises in the Dnipropetrovsk region had been attacked for the second time in 24 hours.

Regional officials said that a Russian strike had killed a father and a son, and wounded two children and their mother in the frontline Donetsk region.

Kyiv and Moscow are preparing for talks in Abu Dhabi this week on how to end the war. The talks are expected to be on Wednesday and Thursday.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 14:12:42 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/JVCO6ZGT55OBZGUT5AQQZXLOVQ.jpg?auth=86a54ad5204733386094d81cfebafad47adcb0b8ca890fee56b65c3290ecbf57&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump still aims for Greenland control, its Prime Minister Nielsen warns</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-still-aims-greenland-control-its-prime-minister-warns-2026-02-02/</link><description>COPENHAGEN, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Greenland's Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen warned on Monday that while U.S. President Donald Trump has ruled out military force, Washington still fundamentally seeks to control the Arctic island.

The president intensified calls for U.S. control over Greenland at the beginning of the year, citing national security concerns related to Russia and China, which threatened to fracture the NATO alliance.

Trump has since backed away from threats of force and said he secured total U.S. access to Greenland in a NATO deal, though details remain unclear.

"The view upon Greenland and the population has not changed: Greenland is to be tied to the U.S. and governed from there," Nielsen said in a speech to parliament, speaking via a translator.

Kyriakos Mitsotakis' centre-right government remains ahead in opinion polls but it has been shaken by a corruption scandal in which some farmers, aided by state employees, faked land ownership to get subsidies. The affair was revealed by EU prosecutors in 2025 and parliament is looking into the case.

Greeks were also angered by the government's handling of a 2023 train crash which killed 57 people, the country's worst on record. It triggered the biggest mass protests in Greece since a debilitating decade-long debt crisis. A trial opens next month, with protesters demanding full political accountability.

In Greece, only parliament can investigate ministers or lift lawmakers' immunity, according to the four-times-revised 1975 constitution.

"The world of 2026 is different and poses new challenges," Mitsotakis said in a letter to his 156 deputies in the 300-seat parliament and in a televised address. "The time is ripe for a brave constitutional revision towards a functional democracy."

To make public administration more efficient, Mitsotakis suggested that the lifelong job security enjoyed by state employees for more than a century should be reviewed, too, to address underperformance.

The constitution also needs to address modern challenges including artificial intelligence, affordable housing, the climate crisis, fiscal stability and a slow judicial system, he said, without proposing any specific measures.

Mitsotakis and his party took power in 2019 and were re-elected in 2023 for another four-year term.

For the proposed changes to come into effect, two successive parliaments need to approve them and an enhanced majority of 180 deputies is required in at least one of the two votes.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 14:13:07 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7SMD7NHITNI3XJMRQUK3OFDMIM.jpg?auth=89421ec3b3389411277f5c443c0ffe8d1f95fc812e8b1255b842628b7ac6b6fc&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Former Peru foreign minister dies in prison hospital in Brazil</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/former-peru-foreign-minister-dies-prison-hospital-brazil-2026-02-02/</link><description>RIO DE JANEIRO, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Former Peruvian Foreign Minister Augusto Blacker Miller, who was arrested in Brazil in December, died in a prison hospital in Rio de Janeiro late last month, the state penitentiary authority said on Monday.

Russia's accusations were "baseless" and the expulsion was "unprovoked and unjustified", a spokesperson for Britain's Foreign Office (FCDO) said in a statement on Monday.

"Summoning the Russian Ambassador, a senior FCDO official made it clear that the UK will not stand for intimidation of British Embassy staff and so we are taking reciprocal action today, revoking the accreditation of a Russian diplomat," the spokesperson said.

Amid the war in Ukraine, Russia and the West have repeatedly accused each other of unfurling espionage campaigns of an intensity not seen since the depths of the Cold War, while western diplomats in Moscow say they are subject to intrusive surveillance and harassment.

Britain warned Russia against pursuing this course against its diplomats.

"Any further action taken by Russia will be considered an escalation and responded to accordingly," the spokesperson added.

The Russian embassy in London did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 14:13:48 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>EU: rejects Iran's categorisation of EU armies as 'terrorist groups'</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/eu-rejects-irans-categorisation-eu-armies-terrorist-groups-2026-02-02/</link><description>PARIS, Feb 2 (Reuters) - The European Union said it rejected Iran's decision to consider as " terrorist groups " the armies of EU countries after the EU listed the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps on the bloc's list of terrorist organisations.

Iran's move came after the EU last Thursday marked a symbolic shift in its approach to Iran's leadership by designating the Revolutionary Guards as a terrorist organisation, following what turned out to be the Islamic Republic's bloodiest crackdown of protests since its establishment in 1979.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 14:13:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/UC65AIAF4FOLVAVL3LUCNF37TU.jpg?auth=0a1fb4c7650a18535408ba0807049fa7702874c98466c916a60ba7258cad947c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>France set to pass delayed 2026 budget, ending months-long saga</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/france-set-pass-delayed-2026-budget-ending-months-long-saga-2026-02-02/</link><description>PARIS, Feb 2 (Reuters) - France should finally get a 2026 budget on Monday, when the expected failure of two no-confidence motions will allow the legislation to pass, heralding a period of relative stability for Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu's weak minority government.

Budget negotiations have consumed the French political class for nearly two years, after President Emmanuel Macron's 2024 snap election delivered a hung parliament just as a massive hole in public finances made belt-tightening more urgent.

The budget talks have cost two prime ministers their jobs, unsettled debt markets and alarmed France's European partners.

However, Lecornu - whose chaotic two-stage nomination in October drew derision around the world - managed to secure the support of Socialist lawmakers through costly but targeted concessions, boosting his stature in the process.

"It's a political success and an economic failure," said veteran political commentator Alain Duhamel on RTL radio.

Despite the still-elevated budget deficit of 5% of GDP seen by Lecornu, investors have taken heart in the new stability. The French government debt premium over the German benchmark has returned to levels last seen in June 2024, before Macron's snap-election announcement.

The Socialists have said they won't back the no-confidence motions, which means the 2026 budget - already more than a month overdue - will be adopted once the two votes are cleared.

The Socialists' main scalp was the suspension of an unpopular pension reform , delaying the planned increase in the retirement age to 64 until after next year's presidential election.

With just over a year to go before the next presidential election in the spring of 2027, the respite on the budget front is giving Macron some breathing space, as he nears the end of his second term with historically low approval ratings.

Having lost control of the domestic agenda, his push for supply-side economic reforms has largely stalled . Meaningful spending cuts are unlikely before he leaves office, with lawmakers showing little appetite for unpopular measures as election campaigning intensifies.

Macron's supporters say Lecornu, by showing flexibility and an ability to compromise, has prevented the return of wealth taxes and preserved Macron's legacy of making France more attractive to foreign investors.

The president is now focusing almost entirely on foreign policy, pushing Europe to be less dependent on foreign powers, and advocating a harder line in confronting U.S. President Donald Trump over tariffs or the Greenland crisis.

At home, however, he leaves his centrist bloc without a clear successor and significantly weakened against a resurgent far right.

Two of Macron's former prime ministers are gearing up for the presidential race, Edouard Philippe and Gabriel Attal, while Lecornu has also gained popularity over the past few months.

But should the centre remain fragmented, and with no primary planned, it remains uncertain whether a mainstream candidate will reach the election's second round to face the far right, whether led by Jordan Bardella or Marine Le Pen.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 14:14:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7UI7QENH5VKYLHR63VYSJYJ2VA.jpg?auth=05651e037eb03b06aa0f9d8bf55621860088e73aa1fd6f559dbb8e75144cd9f6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Nigeria charges nine with 2025 massacre that killed 150</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/nigeria-charges-nine-with-2025-massacre-that-killed-150-2026-02-02/</link><description>ABUJA, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Nigerian prosecutors filed 57 terrorism-related charges on Monday against nine men accused of carrying out a deadly attack on Yelwata community in Nigeria's central Benue state in June 2025 that killed about 150 people.

Benue sits in Nigeria's volatile Middle Belt, the fault line between the Muslim north and Christian south. Years of violence over land, religion, and ethnicity have proved hard for the authorities to rein in.

The charges, filed at the Federal High Court in Abuja, say the defendants held planning meetings, raised funds, procured weapons, and mobilised fighters across several states ahead of the June 13 attack, one of the deadliest rural assaults in years.

The filing says ringleader Ardo Lawal Mohammed Dono and others met in neighbouring Nasarawa state to raise cash, issue orders and recruit fighters. Several defendants are accused of supplying AK-47s, aiding the gunmen or providing safe sites for planning.

Prosecutors say the raid torched homes and caused heavy casualties in Yelwata in Benue's Guma district.

Plagued by Islamist attacks and mass kidnappings, Nigeria is under pressure to restore security since U.S. President Donald Trump accused it last year of failing to protect Christians. U.S. forces struck what they described as terrorist targets on December 25. The Nigerian authorities say they are cooperating with Washington to improve security.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 14:14:48 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/3KVSSAP6DFMCFMYBSGWAWKK6QA.jpg?auth=64b4633eae7cb47ddc6589cb7467c86ff2c06ed07dcea96acd6d857a1a6d3cd0&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Poland and Germany pledge to take lead on Europe's economic revival</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/poland-germany-must-take-responsibility-europes-economic-revival-finance-2026-02-02/</link><description>WARSAW, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Germany and Poland must take joint responsibility for an economic revival in Europe, the finance ministers of both countries said in Warsaw on Monday, as the continent's growth remains sluggish compared to rivals such as the U.S. and China.

A relatively weak economy has compounded Europe's challenges on multiple other fronts, with perceived security threats from Russia, trade and geopolitical disputes with the Trump administration and uncertainty over relations with Beijing.

"We need to make Europe more competitive," Polish Finance Minister Andrzej Domanski said during a joint press conference with German Vice Chancellor and Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil.

"Both Poland and Germany are ready to create this impetus and to develop economic policies that will return Europe to an economic, rather than regulatory, power," he said.

Klingbeil spoke about the transatlantic relationship and the marked changes it is undergoing.

"And we agree: precisely in this phase we must strengthen Europe and move Europe forward," he said, in his first visit to Poland since he took office.

Klingbeil said the EU must become "faster, smarter, and more capable of dealing with complexity."

Ministers from six leading European economies including Germany and Poland vowed on Wednesday to be the drivers of European progress, as they tackled how to advance projects stalled by the EU's complex decision-making process.

"We have set ourselves the goal of deepening European cooperation, picking up speed, and also demanding this from the Commission," Klingbeil said about last week's video conference.

He said this was a first meeting and another will follow soon in Brussels.

"It's less about adopting decisions now in a new format; it's about finding common positions so that we can then push our decisions forward in the Eurogroup," Klingbeil said, referring to the forum of euro zone finance ministers.

The idea of forging ad hoc coalitions allowing some EU countries to pursue projects without the need for agreement from all 27 member states has long tempted some and has already been applied to key projects including the euro currency.

"We must unwind the regulatory corset, simplify the law, reform our markets, and fully harness the power of the common European market and its nearly 500 million consumers," said Domanski.

The Polish minister said Europe is in a race.

"A race for competitiveness, for building true economic strength, and to achieve this, we need to accelerate," Domanski said.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 14:15:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ZPRJQZBQQVKDNGJCDKMMOH6MQM.jpg?auth=a287c7999193d44e9d4006da4d2e12a077d1b16bdc2bd807ad02d4fcc0b5ba53&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia stepping up strikes on Ukraine's railways, Zelensky says</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260202-russian-stepping-up-strikes-on-ukraine-s-railways-zelensky-says</link><description>President Volodymyr Zelensky said Monday he had ordered Ukrainian military leaders to respond to a growing spate of Russian attacks targeting the country's logistics routes, specifically railway infrastructure.

His comments come after Russian forces stepped up their attacks on train facilities, including one last week that left five people dead in a railway car in the eastern Kharkiv region.

Ukraine has managed to keep its nationwide rail network running despite almost four years of war. Russian forces have prioritised the capture of train hubs such as Kupiansk and Pokrovsk in eastern Ukraine.

"The Russian army remains focused on terror against our logistics – primarily railway infrastructure," Zelensky said in a post on social media.

"In particular, there were strikes in the Dnipro region and in Zaporizhzhia, specifically targeting railway facilities," he added.

State railway operator Ukrzaliznytsia warned earlier on Monday that several of its routes in eastern Ukraine were becoming increasingly "high risk," urging passengers to instead use buses.

In the eastern Sumy region, Ukrzaliznytsia said some of its services would monitor for drone threats and stop near bomb shelters if they emerge.

Zelensky said that while Russia has not carried out any targeted missile or drone ⁠strikes on Ukrainian energy infrastructure in the last 24 hours, energy facilities in frontline areas have come under fire.

The Ukrainian president's statement highlighted the limitations of a short-term energy truce ‍that Russia agreed to last week at the request of US President Donald Trump .

Zelensky said energy ​repair crews had managed to restore energy facilities damaged when high-voltage ​power lines malfunctioned over the weekend, on top of the damage caused by frequent Russian attacks.

"The (energy) system is operating stably. However, given the extremely cold weather and the impact of Russian strikes, all challenges remain serious," Zelensky said on the Telegram app.

Russia fired fewer drones and missiles at Ukraine last month, AFP analysis of data from Kyiv's air force published Monday showed, but still crippled Ukraine's energy infrastructure and pushed the country towards a humanitarian crisis.

The most serious electricity, heating and water outages of the nearly four-year war came in January as the Kremlin battered Ukraine with 4,452 long-range drones – a 13 percent decrease from December – and 135 missiles, a 23 percent decrease on the previous month.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 14:15:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/40bb45e2-0034-11f1-b4e3-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/000-72P24ZQ.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>As Sicily's Niscemi crumbles, families race to save what the Earth hasn’t taken</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/sicilys-niscemi-crumbles-families-race-save-what-earth-hasnt-taken-2026-02-02/</link><description>NISCEMI, Sicily, Feb 2 (Reuters) - After losing their home in the Sicilian town of Niscemi in a massive landslide last week, Benedetta Ragusa and Toni Rinnone raced to salvage their pizzeria, retrieving appliances and kitchenware from the site as the ground shifted beneath them.

Firefighters stood by, assessing cracks in the walls and monitoring earth movements before offering a helping hand, pushing a refrigerator up the street and to safety.

"Unfortunately our house was first to collapse in Niscemi, so we didn't even have the chance to recover our mementos from inside that little home," said Rinnone.

"We still had faith in the shop, in the premises we had, so we wouldn't completely fall apart. Instead, it seems that that, too, is collapsing, bit by bit. It's a bit tough to deal with," he said.

With a population of around 25,000, Niscemi sits on clay and sandstone cliffs, dominating a plain in southern Sicily that leads to the Mediterranean sea some 30 km (20 miles) away. It has experienced landslides since the 1790s, with the last major rupture recorded in 1997.

Despite warnings of instability, nothing was done to shore up the town's fragile foundations, and on January 25, following a ferocious storm that drenched the land, a four-kilometre-long (2.5-mile) stretch of hillside collapsed.

Buildings slipped into the void, others were lacerated by cracks spreading across their walls. Authorities hastily created a "red zone" down the eastern edge of the town, 150 metres (490 ft) deep, and ordered the evacuation of some 1,500 people.

Those who want to retrieve anything from inside the cordoned-off area have to be accompanied by emergency crews and must move quickly. No time for reminiscing.

"It feels like we're at war," said Ragusa as she rushed to gather glasses, plates and pans, piling them into a van.

Ariel views show a dramatic beige scar down one side of Niscemi, with mounds of earth lying on the plain below, the surrounding greenfields crisscrossed with cracks and crevices suggesting the whole landscape was being torn apart.

Buildings and severed roads hang over the edge of the land that remains intact. Below it, the broken stubs of drains and water pipes poke out from newly exposed earth.

"Unfortunately, the situation is truly critical. We have a city, its historic centre, seriously at risk," said Gianfranco Di Pietro, a geospatial data engineer.

"It is still too early to know what our future will look like. But we hope to secure this historic part of the city as soon as possible, to rebuild, to provide housing again to those who have lost it, and to stabilize the entire slope."

Locals could be forgiven for being sceptical.

After the 1997 landslide, experts said parts of the town had been built on unstable ground and urgent work was needed, including installing proper drainage to stop the ground from saturating during storms.

But plans for such work stalled amid a mix of legal disputes and local bureaucracy that regularly throttle public works projects across Italy.

Niscemi Mayor Massimiliano Conti told reporters his town had only in December received funding needed to pay for safety work tied to the 1997 disaster. But that plan had been washed away, like the cliffs it was meant to safeguard.

The public prosecutor's office in nearby Gela has opened an investigation into negligent disaster.

"It is right that those responsible for this should pay," Conti said.

With much of her pizzeria equipment secured, Benedetta Ragusa said she now faced a period of grief over her lost home and the dreams destroyed along with it.

Looking at drone footage, she can only make out her old bathroom wall with a mirror still attached. She was relieved she hadn't got back earlier and tried to save her belongings.

"Losing everything is terrible, losing your first home is terrible, but we were saved, because honestly I don't know what would have happened if we had been inside," she said.

Astonishingly, lives were not lost in the disaster.

While Sicilians have a reputation in Italy for riding roughshod over regulations, locals rejected accusations on social media last week that they had ignored building rules while developing Niscemi.

"We risk losing everything, and people still find the time to talk badly about us, and that's not right," said French teacher Daniela Ferraro, whose home lay within the red zone.

Recent renovation work was carried out with the required permits and the property had been earthquake-proofed, she said, refusing to face the prospect of moving away from Niscemi.

"We will go to work like every day, we will keep rolling up our sleeves because we don't give up. Our land must be saved."</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 15:09:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7I7NEY2ARNJXTNQF56TDVPE6QQ.jpg?auth=21dbbe2e97e811af60500393c2dc41833f7aa231f5ec7846d328b5fef6c1b808&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russian captain guilty over crew member's death in U.S. tanker crash</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/russian-captain-guilty-over-crew-members-death-us-tanker-crash-2026-02-02/</link><description>LONDON, Feb 2 (Reuters) - The captain of a container ship that crashed into a U.S. tanker off Britain's east coast last year was found guilty on Monday of causing the death of a crew member through gross negligence.

Russian national Vladimir Motin, 59, was captain of the Solong when it hit the Stena Immaculate tanker, which was anchored and carrying just over 220,000 barrels of high-grade aviation fuel, on March 10, 2025.

The collision started a blaze on both vessels and caused the death of Filipino national and Solong crew member Mark Pernia, 38, whose body has never been found and is presumed dead.

Prosecutor Tom Little told jurors at the start of Motin's trial last month that Motin did "absolutely nothing" to prevent the collision, having been on course to hit the Stena Immaculate for more than 30 minutes before the fatal crash.

Motin's lawyer James Leonard said Motin unsuccessfully tried to take the Solong off autopilot and change course, arguing that while Motin was at fault he was not grossly negligent.

After a trial at London's Old Bailey court, Motin – who had pleaded not guilty – was convicted of the gross negligence manslaughter of Pernia. He will be sentenced on Thursday.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 15:09:16 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/NDZ4K3APCBIABN23SSQTREKUGY.jpg?auth=0085a0033f177e5e90f49a779886760e5967fe24b00ff8f8b3f08a0c9ab54ac7&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Pakistan's India boycott splits fans as politics overshadows cricket</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sports/cricket/pakistans-india-boycott-splits-fans-politics-overshadows-cricket-2026-02-02/</link><description>KARACHI, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Pakistan's decision to boycott its Twenty20 World Cup match against India has drawn widespread support from fans and administrators who hailed the move as a long-overdue stand in a rivalry in which sport and geopolitics have collided.

The government on Sunday cleared Pakistan to take part in the tournament beginning February 7 but barred the team from playing India in a February 15 group match in Colombo, a decision the International Cricket Council (ICC) said was not in the interests of the global game.

The boycott deepened a long freeze in bilateral cricket between the nuclear-armed neighbours — who have not played a full series since 2012–13 and now meet largely at neutral venues — and dealt a blow to the ICC's marquee event, with India-Pakistan matches the biggest drivers of global viewership and revenue.

For many in Pakistan, however, the boycott was less about cricketing issues, with Pakistan forfeiting two points by skipping the match, and more about symbolism.

"Enough is enough," former Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Najam Sethi told Reuters, accusing India's board of politicising the ICC. "It's time to challenge this duplicitous approach by exercising PCB's options in alliance with Bangladesh."

The Indian government, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and the International Cricket Council did not respond to requests for comment.

The ICC said it was still awaiting an official communication from the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) conveying their "position of selective participation".

"While the ICC respects the roles of governments in matters of national policy, this decision is not in the interest of the global game or the welfare of fans worldwide, including millions in Pakistan," the Dubai-based body said in a statement on Sunday.

The government has not publicly detailed its reasoning, but Mosharraf Zaidi, a spokesperson for Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, linked the move to security tensions with India.

"Nothing is more important than the memory of Pakistani citizens and troops murdered by Indian proxy terrorists over the weekend," Zaidi said. "With funerals taking place today, this was the least that could be done."

The remarks followed coordinated attacks by Baloch separatist militants across Pakistan's southwestern Balochistan province over the weekend that killed nearly 50 people.

India's foreign ministry rejected Pakistan's accusations, calling them "baseless" and accusing Islamabad of deflecting attention from its own internal issues.

Pakistan's World Cup jersey has been branded the "Markhor Edition," after the national animal, a symbol of resilience also used in military iconography, Geo TV reported.

On the streets of Pakistan's major cities, many cricket fans backed the boycott as a response to what they see as India's growing influence over global cricket governance.

"This arrogance of India should be broken a little," said Mohammad Asghar, a fan in Karachi. "They should realise someone has come forward to challenge them."

Others drew parallels with Bangladesh's earlier withdrawal from the tournament over safety concerns, a move that led to Scotland replacing them, and questioned why Pakistan should be held to a different standard.

"If Bangladesh can boycott for one player's safety, why can't Pakistan take a stand?" said Ayaz Ahmed.

The decision also sparked heated debate on social media, with users divided between calls for "self-respect" and warnings that skipping the match could further isolate Pakistan in global cricket.

Former Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi agreed.

"Cricket can open doors when politics closes them," he wrote on X. "It's regrettable that Pakistan won't play India, but this is the moment for the ICC to prove it is impartial."</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 15:09:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/AE4ZRG36LZJ4NPXU2SIT4KWWUY.jpg?auth=b58c697d3561b8e6e2607524e6046b3106ba25bb7fc30fb2fa73544512d66bfe&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Norway police detain son of crown princess on fresh allegations ahead of trial</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/norway-police-detain-son-crown-princess-fresh-allegations-ahead-trial-2026-02-02/</link><description>OSLO, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Norwegian police said on Monday they have detained the eldest son of Norway's crown princess over fresh criminal allegations against him ahead of a separate trial this week in which he faces multiple charges of rape and other crimes.

Police in a statement said Marius Borg Hoiby, 29, son of Crown Princess Mette-Marit and stepson to Crown Prince Haakon, was apprehended on Sunday on suspicion of causing bodily harm, wielding a knife and violating a restraining order.

Following the latest accusations, police said they would seek permission from a judge to keep Hoiby in their custody for the next four weeks.

He has so far been at large awaiting the trial, which begins on Tuesday, on four counts of rape as well as domestic violence, assault and drug possession, among other crimes, one of several cases that have shaken the Norwegian monarchy .

He could face new charges from the latest allegations on top of the 38 counts he currently faces. His lawyer declined to comment on the new accusations presented on Monday.

Hoiby does not admit criminal guilt for the charges of rape and domestic violence, but has admitted to some lesser crimes and plans to give a detailed explanation of this in court, his lawyer has previously said. His trial is due to last until March 19.

The case against Hoiby began in 2024 when police named him as a suspect of physical assault against a woman with whom he had been in a relationship.

Hoiby, in a statement to the media at the time, admitted to causing bodily harm to the woman while he was under the influence of cocaine and alcohol and to damaging her apartment. Hoiby said he regretted his acts.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 15:09:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/QU2V3X2ZIJIGHCFSYQSALNJEJE.jpg?auth=6e4e7aeae997775979638bb8de1ee0e6b11fa9f6dc676759ca0ef7744c88e7e6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Colombia's Clan del Golfo commander dies in river accident</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/colombias-clan-del-golfo-commander-dies-river-accident-2026-02-02/</link><description>BOGOTA, Feb 2 (Reuters) - The second-in-command of Colombia's Clan del Golfo crime gang - the country's largest illegal armed group - Jose Gonzalo Sanchez died when the boat he was traveling in to promote the gang's peace process with the government capsized in a river in the northwest of the country, according to reports from the illegal armed group and the government.

The boat carrying Sanchez, more commonly known as 'Gonzalito' capsized on Friday on the Esmeralda River, in the department of Cordoba, the illegal armed group said in a statement on Sunday.

The Office of the High Commissioner for Peace said it hopes that Sanchez's death would not delay the government's peace process with the illegal armed group. The Clan del Golfo crime gang was designated a terrorist organization by the United States in December.

Talks between the group and the government of leftist President Gustavo Petro are part of the administration's embattled plan to bring peace to the country after six decades of armed conflict.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 15:09:47 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Rome introduces Trevi Fountain access fee to curb coin-tossing crowds</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/rome-introduces-trevi-fountain-access-fee-curb-coin-tossing-crowds-2026-02-02/</link><description>ROME, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Tourists keen to follow tradition by tossing a coin into Rome's Trevi Fountain will need to dig a little deeper from Monday, as the city introduces a new 2-euro ($2.40) visitor fee.

The charge, aimed at easing overtourism and helping fund upkeep of the monument, applies only to visitors who walk down the stone steps to get close to the fountain's basin.

The surrounding square, which offers views of the landmark, will remain freely accessible.

The fee will be levied from 11:30 a.m. to 10 p.m. on weekdays and from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. at weekends. Under rules first announced in December, Rome residents are exempt, along with people with disabilities and their companions, and children under 6.

"I didn't know that we had to pay, but I have no problem with that," said Argentine tourist Valentina De Vicentis, one of those affected by the new fee. She said she expected it to ease overcrowding.

"There are less people in here, so I think that's good, because if not, there are a lot of people and you can't take pictures and you can't stay (for a long) time and enjoy."

The Trevi Fountain, where tradition dictates that visitors toss a coin into the water to guarantee their return to Rome, has long been one of the city's most popular attractions, even for visiting world leaders .

It is remembered for the famous film scene in Federico Fellini's "La Dolce Vita", in which Anita Ekberg wades into the fountain and beckons her co-star Marcello Mastroianni to join her: "Marcello! Come here!"

Authorities say more than 10 million people visited the fountain in the December 2024-December 2025 period, which largely coincided with a Catholic Holy Year, or Jubilee, which drew about 33.5 million pilgrims to Rome.

Fed by an ancient Roman aqueduct and completed in 1762, the monument is a late Baroque masterpiece depicting Oceanus, the god of all water, symbolising the varying moods of the world's seas and rivers.

With tourism booming in Rome and across Italy, visitor fees have been introduced at a growing number of cultural landmarks.

They include Rome's ancient Pantheon , the entire city of Venice during the peak travel season, and, on a temporary basis, the courtyard in Verona with the balcony associated with Shakespeare's "Romeo and Juliet".

Michelangelo's "Last Judgment", a Renaissance masterwork in the Vatican's Sistine Chapel that depicts the Second Coming of Jesus, is undergoing its first restoration in 30 years.

Experts will work over three months to remove decades of built-up particles that have obscured the colours of the artwork, the Vatican said in a press release.

"The new intervention... will allow the removal of these deposits and the consequent recovery of the chromatic and luministic quality desired by Michelangelo," it said.

The Sistine Chapel, famous as the site of the secret conclave where the world's Catholic cardinals vote to select new popes , sees millions of visitors each year as part of the Vatican Museums.

The chapel will remain open during the restoration. But the fresco itself, showing Jesus delivering his final judgment of humanity, will be covered by scaffolding.

Visitors will instead be able to see a high-definition reproduction of the artwork, the Vatican said.

The chapel is also home to many other frescoes, including Michelangelo's "The Creation of Adam" on its ceiling. Those will still be on display.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 16:01:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/X6F4SMTDPNOABOCNUYDXFVNLJE.jpg?auth=3dd80a56484bdb3802d69a59f5cb41732452141be642b11d213e6908ea7f4e3d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>U.S. hospitality space changes name from 'Ice House' to 'Winter House' following protests</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us-hospitality-space-changes-name-ice-house-winter-house-following-protests-2026-02-02/</link><description>MILAN, Feb 2 (Reuters) - U.S. Olympic officials have changed the name of an athlete hospitality space at the Milano Cortina Games from "Ice House" to "Winter House," a move that comes following protests in Minneapolis over the fatal shootings of two U.S. citizens by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers.

The venue has been billed by the United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC) as an "athlete-first space" where U.S. figure skaters, hockey players, speedskaters and their families can gather in what is normally a boutique-style hotel in the heart of Milan.

"Our hospitality concept was designed to be a private space free of distractions where athletes, their families, and friends can come together to celebrate the unique experience of the Winter Games," U.S. Figure Skating, USA Hockey and US Speedskating said in a joint statement.

"This name captures that vision and connects to the season and the event."

Winter House will host a variety of activities, including meet-and-greets with Olympic champions and legends, medal celebrations, watch parties and sponsored events, according to the USOPC. While not open to the public, NBC will showcase the venue during its coverage.

Thousands of protesters have taken to the streets in Minneapolis and students across the U.S. staged walkouts on Friday to demand the withdrawal of federal immigration agents from Minnesota following the shootings.

Under a national immigration crackdown, President Donald Trump has sent 3,000 federal officers to the Minneapolis area who are patrolling the streets in tactical gear, a force five times the size of the Minneapolis Police Department.

"I think it's wise," U.S. figure skater Amber Glenn told reporters after practice on Monday in Milan.

"It's unfortunate that the term ICE isn't something we can embrace because of what's happening and the implications of what some individuals are doing.

"Unfortunately, in my own country, it is very upsetting and very distressing to see. And I can't imagine how people who have been impacted by that directly feel. So I think it's wise that we change something as minute as a name if it is able to make anyone feel more comfortable."</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 16:01:43 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Truck traffic at Cargill facility in northern Brazil blocked by protesters</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/truck-traffic-cargill-facility-northern-brazil-blocked-by-protesters-2026-02-02/</link><description>SAO PAULO, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Protesters have been blocking truck traffic at Cargill's Santarem grain terminal in northern Brazil, according to a company statement in response to Reuters questions on Monday.

Cargill denied any occupation of its facilities by protesters, whom local media identified as Indigenous groups.

Cargill's Santarem terminal handles soybeans and corn. According to the company's website, most of the grain arrives there by barge before being hauled onto ships for export.

A smaller portion of the grain that passes through the terminal arrives by trucks, either directly from the state of Mato Grosso via the BR-163 highway or from local farms.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 16:01:56 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/SKFCNH6DENL5XINDEIL5PDLKSM.jpg?auth=d8cefc04a768e0e3fea3070b090dab2ee44171e29652bd2c2420904b3aabbf6a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Gun-wielding IS militants roamed freely on airport tarmac during Niger attack, footage shows</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/gun-wielding-is-militants-roamed-freely-airport-tarmac-during-niger-attack-2026-02-02/</link><description>DAKAR, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Islamic State militants set off explosions and roamed freely among passenger planes during an attack at Niger's main international airport, according to footage distributed by SITE Intelligence Group, which tracks jihadist activity worldwide.

The attack last week has renewed international concern about the security situation in Niger, with Washington ordering non-emergency government employees and their family members to leave the West African country because of safety risks.

It could also further strain regional ties after Niger's military leader Abdourahamane Tiani accused the presidents of Benin and Ivory Coast - as well as France - of sponsoring the attack, without offering evidence.

A Benin government spokesperson denied the allegation, while Ivory Coast summoned the Nigerien ambassador to condemn Tiani's comments.

During the attack at the capital Niamey's airport, claimed by Islamic State's West Africa affiliate on Friday , gunfire and loud explosions echoed around the airport beginning late Wednesday before calm returned on Thursday morning.

In the footage distributed by SITE on Sunday, militants on foot and motorbike fire weapons into the air near parked passenger planes and aircraft hangars, where they set off an explosion near an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and a helicopter that were later shown engulfed in flames.

The video "shows IS militants speaking Kanuri, a language more commonly used in the Lake Chad basin," said Ladd Serwat, senior analyst for Africa at U.S. crisis-monitoring group ACLED.

"While ISSP militants come from diverse areas, this may indicate that more experienced drone operators from Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) supported the attack."

Pan-African carrier ASKY Airlines said two of its aircraft sustained minor damage during the incident while parked on the tarmac. Ivory Coast's national airline Air Cote d'Ivoire said an Airbus A319 was hit, with damage to its fuselage and right wing.

Both companies said no passengers or crew were injured as the incident occurred outside operational hours.

Niger said it killed 20 attackers, including a French national, and injured 11. Islamic State has given no figures.

Niger, like its Sahel neighbours Mali and Burkina Faso, has struggled to contain attacks from jihadist groups linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State that have killed thousands and displaced millions in the three countries.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 16:02:39 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/IPUE5PAB4FM33CEPA4PDLZNANA.jpg?auth=f5dcc8e89d0afdfd2492dcd0c06a15a8c36a478eb0f34587a2fe58ee9ffc6538&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Spain performs pioneering face transplant from donor who requested assisted dying</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/spain-performs-pioneering-face-transplant-donor-who-requested-assisted-dying-2026-02-02/</link><description>MADRID, Feb 2 (Reuters) - A hospital in Barcelona said on Monday it had performed a pioneering facial transplant in which the donor, in a world first, had offered her face for donation before undergoing an assisted dying procedure.

The complex surgery involved transplanting composite tissue from the central part of the face and required the participation of around 100 professionals, including psychiatrists and immunologists, the prestigious Vall d'Hebron hospital said in a statement.

The hospital's transplant coordinator, Elisabeth Navas, said the donor had showed "a level of maturity that leaves one speechless".

"Someone who has decided to end their life dedicates one of their last wishes to a stranger and gives them a second chance of this magnitude," Navas said.

The recipient - identified only by her first name Carme - had suffered facial tissue necrosis from a bacterial infection caused by an insect bite, affecting her ability to speak, eat and see.

"When I'm looking in the mirror at home, I'm thinking that I'm starting to look more like myself," Carme told a press conference on Monday, adding her recovery was going very well.

For such cases requiring facial transplants, donor and recipient must share the same sex, blood group and have a similar head size.

With a population of 49.4 million, Spain has been a global leader in organ transplants for more than three decades. In 2021, it became the fourth European Union country to legalise euthanasia.

Half of the six facial transplants ever done in Spain have been performed by Vall d'Hebron staff. The Catalan hospital also carried out the world's first full face transplant back in 2010.

A spokesperson for the hospital declined to say the exact date of the procedure for privacy reasons, but told Reuters it took place during the autumn of 2025.

Some 6,300 organ transplants were performed last year in Spain, according to Health Ministry data, with kidney transplants being the most common.

In 2024, 426 people received assistance in dying, government data shows.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 16:55:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Explainer: Can transgender athletes compete at the Milano Cortina Winter Games?</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sports/soccer/can-transgender-athletes-compete-milano-cortina-winter-games-2026-02-02/</link><description>MILAN, Feb 2 (Reuters) - The 2026 Milano Cortina Olympics opens on Friday, bringing the world's top athletes together in the biggest winter sports show on earth. The Games will be the last one to be held with the existing and fragmented regulations regarding the eligibility of transgender athletes in women's categories.

The International Olympic Committee is expected to shortly issue new and universal guidelines, which it says are designed to protect women's sport.

The issue of transgender athletes at the Olympics and other top sports events has become a controversial issue in recent years due to the lack of clear and universal rules governing sport.

Sporting bodies have had to balance the twin aims of protecting the women's category but also allowing the free participation for all in sports without any discrimination.

Transgender advocacy groups say excluding trans athletes amounts to discrimination.

Critics of transgender inclusion in women's sport say that the process of going through male puberty imbues athletes with a huge musculo-skeletal advantage that transition does not mitigate.

U.S. President Donald Trump last year banned transgender athletes in the country from competing in college and pro events in the female category.

Yes, under existing rules transgender athletes can participate in the summer and winter Olympics once they have been cleared to do so by their respective sports federations. Currently it is up to each sports federation to draw up participation rules for transgender athletes. There is no universal rule governing their participation or eligibility in pro sports.

ARE THERE TRANSGENDER ATHLETES SET TO COMPETE AT THE MILANO-CORTINA 2026 WINTER OLYMPICS.

Yes, transgender athletes are set to compete in Italy's Games, including Elis Lundholm, a Swedish mogul skier. Lundholm was born a female and identifies as a man. The 23-year-old will be competing in the women's category.

Lundholm would still be eligible to compete in the future no matter the restrictions for transgender athletes, as according to the IOC, the Swede's participation is "in accordance with (international skiing federation) FIS eligibility criteria."

"Elis Lundholm competes in the female category, which is aligned with the sex of this athlete," the IOC told Reuters.

No, there is currently no universal rule regarding the participation of transgender athletes in professional or elite sports. The International Olympic Committee long refused to apply any universal rule on transgender participation for the Games.

It instructed international federations in 2021 to come up with their own guidelines.

The IOC's 2021 guidelines on Fairness, Inclusion and Non-Discrimination suggested that federations prioritised the inclusion of gender non-conforming athletes in the category of their choice, while making no presumptions of unfair advantage.

Under new IOC president Kirsty Coventry, however, the Olympic body did a u-turn in 2025 and decided to take the lead in setting eligibility criteria with fairness of competition the foremost consideration.

The IOC has said it will issue its new rules on participation of transgender athletes in the first quarter of 2026. Under rules still in force, transgender athletes are eligible to take part in the Olympics.

Yes, there are several major sports federations that have restricted the participation of transgender athletes in women's competitions.

World Rugby banned transgender athletes from competing at elite level, while World Athletics does not allow transgender athletes who have undergone male puberty to compete.

World Aquatics allows transgender athletes who have transitioned before the age of 12 to compete, but not those who have done so after that age.

The situation remains somewhat murky in soccer, the world's most popular sport, with FIFA yet to announce a long-promised policy update.

Some individual associations, including the English FA, have unilaterally banned transgender players from competing in women's competitions.

In 2025, boxing and athletics introduced mandatory tests for athletes in the female category to detect the SRY gene, which is on the Y chromosome and triggers the development of male characteristics in mammals.

U.S. President Trump has banned transgender athletes from competing in women's sports in schools in the United States.

Trump, who signed the "Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports" order in February 2025, has said he would not allow transgender athletes to compete at the 2028 Los Angeles Summer Olympics.

Following Trump's decision, the United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee also changed its rules accordingly, banning transgender athletes from taking part in women's sports.

Yes, a small number of openly transgender athletes have taken part in past editions of the Olympic Games. New Zealand's Laurel Hubbard became the first openly transgender athlete to compete in a different gender category to that assigned at birth when the weightlifter took part in the women's weightlifting competition at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 16:56:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ZCUU26Z77RJPBKPZMNC7IWIYW4.jpg?auth=b0ce07719dce3ccdd85b54e43fa2030e44f370d971adc216f707cf083061a307&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Fire breaks out in Karachi building near site of recent blaze, provincial spokesperson says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/fire-breaks-out-karachi-building-near-site-recent-blaze-provincial-spokesperson-2026-02-02/</link><description>KARACHI, Feb 2 (Reuters) - A fire broke out in a commercial building in Pakistan's Karachi on Monday, close to the site where a deadly fire killed dozens of people last month, a provincial government spokesman said.

The claim by the group Boervolk of the Orange Free State to land in KwaZulu-Natal province near the border with Lesotho was published in the government gazette last week, invoking a U.N. resolution granting independence to colonial states.

The group said it was taking its cue from Trump questioning whether Denmark's colonisation of Greenland gives it the right to own the Arctic island.

A spokesperson for the group did not respond to several emailed requests for comment. A spokesperson for South Africa's land reform department did not respond to a request for comment.

The government has let one white separatist group, Orania , set up a small community on the Orange River, but it would be unlikely to accept the Boervolk of the Orange Free State's claim.

Boervolk of the Orange Free State is one of several small separatist groups representing Afrikaners - descendents of mostly Dutch settlers who arrived at the Cape of Good Hope in the 17th century and spread inland.

The land it claims was acquired by Afrikaners from the Zulu king they backed in an 1840 succession war against his brother, but Britain took it by force in the second Anglo-Boer war at the turn of the 20th century and incorporated it into South Africa.

Much of the land settled by Afrikaners was seized from Black Africans in skirmishes, and as a result Afrikaners still own most of South Africa's privately owned land. Very few Afrikaners and other white nationalists have sought to break away.

Boervolk of the Orange Free State said ownership of the land in Kwazulu-Natal came from "willing buyer and seller agreements" with Zulu kings Dingaan and Mpande.

"Britain never owned (the land) ... and couldn't legally give it to the Union of South Africa in 1910," it said.

Therefore, it said, the land did not legally belong to South Africa's Black majority government, which took power after ending Afrikaner nationalist apartheid in 1994.

Zulu king Dingaan granted land to Afrikaners in 1837, but historians say the Zulus did not have the same Western concept of land ownership.

Dingaan killed some Afrikaners during a feast the following year and the settlers responded by backing his brother Mpande's revolt, declaring Mpande king when the war ended.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 16:57:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukraine's Zelenskiy says dignified, lasting peace realistic, ahead of talks</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraines-zelenskiy-says-dignified-lasting-peace-realistic-ahead-talks-2026-02-02/</link><description>KYIV, Feb 2 (Reuters) - President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Monday that it was realistic to achieve a dignified and lasting peace, ahead of the next round of peace talks with Russian and U.S. officials due this week in Abu Dhabi.

Trump intensified calls for ‍US control over Greenland at the start of the year, citing national security concerns related to Russia and China . Some European ​NATO allies have defended Denmark’s sovereignty over Greenland and said Trump’s pressure threatened to ​fracture the NATO alliance.

The US president has since backed away from threats of force and said he had secured total US access to Greenland in a NATO deal, though details remain unclear.

“The view upon Greenland and the population has not changed: Greenland is to be tied to the US and governed from there,” Nielsen said in a speech to the island’s parliament in ‍Nuuk, speaking via a translator.

Nielsen said the US continues seeking “paths to ownership and control over Greenland”.

The island’s government said last week ​it had launched a survey of the population’s mental health situation at a time of extraordinary pressure.

“Some of our compatriots have severe sleep problems, children feel the worry and anxiety ‌of adults, and we all live with constant uncertainty about what may happen tomorrow,” Nielsen said. “We want to say it very clearly: This is completely unacceptable”.

Diplomatic talks between the US, Denmark and Greenland began last week with senior officials meeting to “discuss how we can address American concerns about security in the Arctic while respecting the Kingdom’s red lines”, Denmark’s foreign ministry said.

Nielsen also praised Denmark as a close partner throughout the crisis.

He has previously stated that if Greenlanders were forced to choose between the US and Denmark, they would choose Denmark. The ‍speech made no mention of independence for Greenland.

For Greenland’s Inuit native population, the debate over ownership clashes with cultural values. Under ‌Greenlandic law, people ​can own houses but not the land beneath them, reflecting the Inuit concept of collective land stewardship.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 16:58:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/2a638d52-f7ad-11f0-8a14-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26020618890978.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Norway’s royal crisis: Crown princess faces Epstein scrutiny ahead of son’s rape trail</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260202-norway-royal-crisis-crown-princess-faces-epstein-scrutiny-ahead-of-son-rape-trail</link><description>The scandals involving Norway’s royal household just keep on piling up.

On Sunday, Marius Borg Hoiby, the eldest son of Crown Princess Mette-Marit , was arrested, accused of assault, threats with a knife and violation of a restraining order, police said in a statement. Police requested four weeks’ detention on grounds of risk of reoffending. His lawyers could not immediately be reached for comment.

On Tuesday, Hoiby is due to go on trial at the Oslo district court. The indictment includes 38 counts, including rape, abuse in a close relationship against one former partner, acts of violence against another and transporting 3.5 kilograms of marijuana. Other charges include making death threats and traffic violations.

Hoiby has been under scrutiny since he was repeatedly arrested in 2024 on various allegations of wrongdoing. He was indicted in August, but had been free pending trial until Sunday.

Hoiby is the son of Crown Princess Mette-Marit from a previous relationship and stepson of the heir to the throne, Crown Prince Haakon . He has no royal title or official duties.

The indictment centres on four alleged rapes between 2018 and November 2024; alleged violence and threats against a former partner between the summer of 2022 and the fall of 2023; and two alleged acts of violence against a subsequent partner, along with violations of a restraining order.

Hoiby’s defence team has said that he “denies all charges of sexual abuse, as well as the majority of the charges regarding violence”.

Haakon said last week that he and Mette-Marit do not plan to attend court and that the royal house doesn’t intend to comment during the proceedings.

He emphasised that Hoiby is not part of the royal house and that, as a citizen of Norway, he has the same responsibilities and rights as all others. He said that he is confident that all concerned will make the trial as orderly, proper and fair as possible.

While the royals are generally popular in Norway, the Hoiby case has cast a shadow on their image. And the trial is opening just as his mother faces renewed scrutiny over her contacts with Jeffrey Epstein .

Friday’s release of the latest batch of documents from the Epstein files shone an unflattering spotlight on Mette-Marit. They contained several hundred mentions of the crown princess, who already said in 2019 that she regretted having had contact with Epstein, Norwegian media reported.

The newly released documents, which include email exchanges with Epstein, showed that Mette-Marit borrowed a property of Epstein’s in Palm Beach, Florida, for several days in early 2013, and the royal house confirmed that she did so through a mutual friend, broadcaster NRK reported.

In a statement emailed by the royal house, Mette-Marit said that she “must take responsibility for not having investigated Epstein’s background more thoroughly, and for not realising sooner what kind of person he was”.

“I deeply regret this, and it is a responsibility I must bear. I showed poor judgment and regret having had any contact with Epstein at all,” she said. “It is simply embarrassing.”

She expressed her “deep sympathy and solidarity” with the victims of Epstein’s abuse.

Over the weekend, Kjetil B Alstadheim, a political reporter for one of Norway’s biggest newspapers Aftenposten , described the scandal as “a direct threat against the [royal] institution itself”.

Depending on how she and the royal household handle the matter “could prove decisive for whether Mette-Marit ever becomes queen”, he wrote.

Mette-Marit’s contacts with Epstein and the Hoiby trial are not the only source of negative publicity for Norway’s royals. The business ventures of Haakon’s sister, Princess Martha Louise, have drawn repeated criticism. In 2024, around the same time Hoiby’s case was making news, she married an American self-professed shaman, Durek Verrett.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 16:58:26 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/d1333426-004e-11f1-98ab-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26033497287150.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Exclusive: Iran fears US strike may reignite protests, imperil rule, sources say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-fears-us-strike-may-reignite-protests-imperil-rule-sources-say-2026-02-02/</link><description>DUBAI, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Iran’s leadership is increasingly worried a U.S. strike could break its grip on power by driving an already enraged public back onto the streets, following a bloody crackdown on anti-government protests, according to six current and former officials.

In high-level meetings, officials told Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei that public anger over last month's crackdown -- the bloodiest since the 1979 Islamic Revolution-- has reached a point where fear is no longer a deterrent , four current officials briefed on the discussions said.

The officials said Khamenei was told that many Iranians were prepared to confront security forces again and that external pressure such as a limited U.S. strike could embolden them and inflict irreparable damage to the political establishment.

One of the officials told Reuters that Iran's enemies were seeking more protests so as to bring the Islamic Republic to an end, and "unfortunately" there would be more violence if an uprising took place.

"An attack combined with demonstrations by angry people could lead to a collapse (of the ruling system). That is the main concern among the top officials and that is what our enemies want," said the official, who like the other officials contacted for this story declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter.

The reported remarks are significant because they suggest private misgivings inside the leadership at odds with Tehran’s defiant public stance towards the protesters and the U.S.

The sources declined to say how Khamenei responded. Iran's Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on this account of the meetings.

Multiple sources told Reuters last week that U.S. President Donald Trump is weighing options against Iran that include targeted strikes on security forces and leaders to inspire protesters, even as Israeli and Arab officials said air power alone would not topple the clerical rulers.

Any such uprising in the wake of a U.S. strike would stand in contrast to Iranians' response to Israeli and U.S. bombing attacks on Iran's nuclear program back in June, which was not followed by anti-government demonstrations.

But a former senior moderate official said the situation had changed since the crackdown in early January.

"People are extremely angry," he said, adding a U.S. attack could lead Iranians to rise up again. "The wall of fear has collapsed. There is no fear left."

Tensions between Tehran and Washington are running high. The arrival of a U.S. aircraft carrier and supporting warships in the Middle East has expanded Trump's ability to take military action if he so wishes, after repeatedly threatening intervention over Iran's bloody crackdown.

Several opposition figures, who were part of the establishment before falling out with it, have warned the leadership that "boiling public anger" could result in a collapse of the Islamic system.

"The river of warm blood that was spilled on the cold month of January will not stop boiling until it changes the course of history," former prime minister Mirhossein Mousavi, who has been under house arrest without trial since 2011, said in a statement published by the pro-reform Kalameh website.

"In what language should people say they do not want this system and do not believe your lies? Enough is enough. The game is over'," Mousavi added in the statement.

During the early January protests, witnesses and rights groups said, security forces crushed demonstrations with lethal force, leaving thousands killed and many wounded. Tehran blamed the violence on "armed terrorists" linked to Israel and the U.S.

Trump stopped short of carrying out threats to intervene but he has since demanded Iran make nuclear concessions. Both Tehran and Washington have signalled readiness to revive diplomacy over a long-running nuclear dispute.

Analysts and insiders say that while the streets are quiet for now, deep-seated grievances have not gone away.

Public frustration has been simmering over economic decline, political repression, a widening gulf between rich and poor, and entrenched corruption that leaves many Iranians feeling trapped in a system offering neither relief nor a path forward.

"This may not be the end, but it is no longer just the beginning," said Hossein Rassam, a London-based analyst.

If protests resume during mounting foreign pressure and security forces respond with force, the six current and former officials said they fear demonstrators would be bolder than in previous unrest, emboldened by experience and driven by a sense that they have little left to lose.

One of the officials told Reuters that while people were angrier than before, the establishment would use harsher methods against protesters if it was under U.S. attack. He said the result would be a bloodbath.

Ordinary Iranians contacted by Reuters said they expected Iran's rulers to crack down hard on any further protests.

A Tehran resident whose 15-year-old son was killed in the protests on January 9 said the demonstrators had merely sought a normal life, and had been answered "with bullets.”

"If America attacks, I will go back to the streets to take revenge for my son and the children this regime killed.”</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 17:39:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/6TV3JFRN7VMPXKTFZPA2GBC5AQ.jpg?auth=ffd7fa1817e2aaefbef53210f3f379cac1c890045b369c14966d76a12cde7eb4&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Cambodian scam compound yields trove of fraud evidence, Thai military says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/cambodian-scam-compound-yields-trove-fraud-evidence-thai-military-says-2026-02-02/</link><description>CHONG CHOM, Thailand/ODDAR MEANCHEY, Cambodia, Feb 2 (Reuters) - The Thai military said on Monday it had recovered a trove of evidence of transnational fraud from a Cambodian scam compound seized during clashes last year between the two countries along their disputed border .

Briefing reporters and foreign delegates in Surin province, senior Thai military officials said the O’Smach complex had housed thousands of people, many of them victims of human trafficking who were forced to scam strangers or face punishment.

Soldiers later showed reporters around one of several buildings in the complex that were bombed and occupied by the Thai military late last year. The six‑storey building was strewn with documents, including long lists of what appeared to be potential targets and their contact details, as well as scripts for scam dialogues.

O'Smach has previously been named as a base for scam operations including by the United States, which cited trafficking and forced criminality.

“The reason we are showing this place today is that we want the world to see how it’s being used as a criminal base against humanity,” Lieutenant General Teeranan Nandhakwang, director‑general of the Royal Thai Army’s Directorate of Intelligence, told reporters.

Touch Sokhak, a spokesperson for Cambodia’s interior ministry, told Reuters Thailand had used scam centres as a pretext for military attacks. He said Cambodia was carrying out a crackdown on scams and had pledged to eradicate the illicit industry before April.

Thailand and Cambodia ended weeks of fierce border clashes in late December with a ceasefire — the second in recent months — that halted the worst fighting in years between the Southeast Asian neighbours.

During the clashes the Thai military struck several casino complexes it alleged were scam compounds, saying they were also used to store weapons and launch attacks.

Parts of Southeast Asia, including border areas between Thailand, Myanmar and Cambodia, have become hubs for online fraud in recent years, generating billions of dollars annually.

Among the items seized at O’Smach were 871 SIM cards enabling anonymous international communication, dozens of smartphones, counterfeit police insignia and police uniforms, the Thai military said.

Reporters visiting the complex also saw several rooms set up to resemble police offices from different countries, including Brazil, China and Australia.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 17:40:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/W6YXLYNGPZONRIUUIUOXGLPBZI.jpg?auth=666680b612d48c04e865b7aa116e49d7ceed20ae7b12f76d90b1a9a376cfe7d3&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Portugal counts multi‑billion‑euro damage after Storm Kristin tears off roofs</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/portugal-counts-multibillioneuro-damage-after-storm-kristin-tears-off-roofs-2026-02-02/</link><description>LISBON/LEIRIA, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Last week's Storm Kristin left hundreds of homes in central Portugal without roofs, tens of thousands without power and residents lining up for emergency building materials, as authorities warned damage could run into billions of euros.

The storm swept across the region early on Wednesday, with wind gusts topping 200 kph (124 mph) and heavy rain uprooting trees and ripping off roofs. It killed at least six people and cut power to hundreds of thousands of households.

"The roof blew off, all the windowpanes are broken, everything is chaos and misery," said Paula Franco as she queued in Leiria for donated tiles to repair her home.

Portugal's government on Sunday approved a 2.5 billion-euro ($2.95 billion) package of loans and incentives to help people and businesses rebuild after the storm.

The government could apply for grants from the European Solidarity Fund and unused EU recovery funds to finance reconstruction, Environment and Energy Minister Maria da Graca Carvalho said on Monday at a joint news conference with EU Energy Commissioner Dan Jorgensen.

Leiria, one of Portugal’s main industrial hubs known for its plastics and metalworking industries, was among the hardest-hit areas.

Hundreds of houses, several roads, schools, factories and railway lines have been affected. At the Monte Real air base near Leiria, the storm damaged several aircraft, including F16 fighter jets.

Nearly 170,000 households were still without electricity on Monday, Graca Carvalho said.

Damage in the region could total between 1.5 billion euros and 2 billion euros, Henrique Carvalho, president of the Leiria Business Association, told broadcaster NOW.

The government on Sunday extended a state of calamity in 69 municipalities until February 8, with more heavy rain and flooding expected.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 17:40:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/T62WBCAY4RLFLHA4YBIHL3NU74.jpg?auth=c20df4070a44739379df25ec77a532c590d8574522441d87d81e01c5f3fb30ad&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Nigeria police says 80 abducted congregants return home, Christian group disputes claim</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/nigeria-police-says-80-abducted-congregants-return-home-christian-group-disputes-2026-02-02/</link><description>MAIDUGURI, Nigeria, Feb 2 (Reuters) - At least 80 congregants earlier believed to have been abducted by gunmen from three churches in northern Nigeria last month have returned home, police said on Monday, a claim immediately disputed by the Christian Association of Nigeria.

Gunmen stormed the churches in Kaduna state on January 18 and seized 177 worshippers, disappearing with them into nearby forests, according to CAN. Eleven people later escaped, leaving 166 missing, the group said.

Kaduna police spokesperson Mansur Hassan said fresh inquiries showed 80 of those reported missing had fled to nearby villages during the attack and only returned to their homes in Kurmin Wali over the weekend when they felt safe.

“Currently, we have invited all of these individuals to the Kaduna State Police Headquarters for verification of their identities, screening and health assessments,” Hassan told Reuters by phone.

Police initially denied the kidnapping before acknowledging the incident and saying security forces were searching for the missing.

However, CAN’s Kaduna state chairman, Reverend Caleb Maaji, said he had no information about any returnees.

“Based on the information available to me, the number of those kidnapped remains 177, except for the 11 who escaped and are receiving care in the hospital,” he said.

The police and CAN often offer different figures and accounts on church kidnappings.

Kidnapping for ransom is widespread in northern Nigeria, where armed gangs frequently attack villages, schools and motorists.

The assault on the Kaduna churches is among the latest in a string of mass abductions that has intensified pressure on the Nigerian government. Nigeria has also faced scrutiny from U.S. President Donald Trump, who has accused the country of persecuting Christians — allegations the Nigerian government denies.

Authorities say they are working to curb Islamist insurgents and other armed groups who have targeted both Christian and Muslim civilians, often for ransom.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 17:40:39 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/MQLWRRXWVBLORAKUJMNK5EFSOA.jpg?auth=33bed03bd47566d40475d50ceb3a6656dd654fc1e23b06739dc89f5037747ed8&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Morocco evacuates 50,000 as flooding threatens city after weeks of heavy rain</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/morocco-evacuates-50000-flooding-threatens-city-after-weeks-heavy-rain-2026-02-02/</link><description>RABAT, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Morocco has evacuated more than 50,000 people, nearly half the population of the northwestern city of Ksar el-Kebir, as flooding driven by weeks of heavy rain threatened to inundate the city, state media said on Monday.

"The city has become a ghost town," local resident Hicham Ajttou told Reuters by phone. "All markets and shops are closed and most residents have either left voluntarily or been evacuated."

Authorities set up shelters and temporary camps and barred entry into Ksar el-Kebir as rising water levels in the Loukkos River spread across several neighbourhoods. Only departures from the city were permitted, while electricity was cut in parts of it and schools were ordered to remain closed until Saturday.

Officials said the floods were partly triggered by water released from the nearby Oued Makhazine dam, which had reached full capacity. Ksar el-Kebir lies about 190 km (120 miles) north of Rabat.

Ajttou said he moved his family to Tangier last week and returned to Ksar el-Kebir to volunteer in relief efforts.

"The question that worries us is what comes next. The dam is full and we don't know how long this situation will last," he said.

The army has deployed rescue units, trucks, equipment and medics to support evacuation and rescue operations and buses evacuated people from the city.

State TV Al Oula showed a helicopter rescuing four people trapped by rising waters in Oued Ouargha in the nearby province of Ouezzane.

Further south, rising levels of the Sebou River prompted authorities to evacuate several villagers in Sidi Kacem and reinforce riverbanks with sandbags and barriers.

The heavy rainfall has brought an end to a seven‑year drought that pushed Morocco to invest heavily in desalination plants. The national dam-filling rate is now close to 62%, with several major reservoirs reaching full capacity, according to official data.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 17:40:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Digital sovereignty (1/3): Have Trump’s threats spurred a European awakening?</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/technology/20260202-digital-sovereignty-have-trump-threats-spurred-european-awakening</link><description>Out go Teams, Zoom and Google Meet. In comes Visio.

The French administration is preparing to ditch popular US videoconferencing tools in favour of a homegrown equivalent starting in 2027, a move it says will ensure critical data and infrastructure remains in French hands .

The aim, says David Amiel, the junior minister for the civil service and state reform, is to “end the use of non-European solutions and guarantee the security and confidentiality of electronic communications by relying on a powerful and sovereign tool”.

Visio is part of a batch of French tech alternatives, called LaSuite, specifically developed for French officials and millions of public-sector workers.

News of its impending launch comes at a time of increasingly urgent debate about the continent’s reliance on US Big Tech , which dominated discussions at the European Digital Sovereignty Summit in Berlin last November.

The sudden sense of urgency is a direct consequence of US President Donald Trump’s aggressive rhetoric towards European allies and his open threats to seize the Danish territory of Greenland .

While talk of technological ‘decoupling’ from the US is hardly new , the prospect of Washington slapping sanctions on Europe or cutting access to key technologies has dramatically altered the equation, says Francesca Musiani, head of the Internet and Society Centre at France’s National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS).

“The urgency stems from the fact that geopolitical tensions, for instance over Greenland, can rapidly escalate and push the US to take advantage of Europe’s technological reliance, which has been built up over decades,” Musiani explains.

“US threats may have sounded like banter in the past, but Europeans have now realised, particularly with what happened in Venezuela, that Trump is entirely serious when he issues such warnings,” adds Christophe Grosbost, chief strategy officer at the Innovation Makers Alliance.

Should Trump follow through on his threats and ask the likes of Meta , Google and Amazon to “completely cut off European access to their services, our societies and economies would be completely disrupted,” Grosbost warns. “It would be disastrous.”

Such a step would be especially damaging to governments in Europe.

“Technological reliance is most critical for public institutions because they handle sensitive data, perform sovereign functions and have an obligation to maintain continuity of service,” says Musiani, whose research has focused on matters of digital sovereignty.

Given that most administrations process documents using Microsoft software and then store the data on servers hosted by US-based tech giants, any shift to homegrown systems must be undertaken with caution – barring which ordinary citizens will be the first affected.

In Germany’s Schleswig-Holstein, “the local government recently decided to switch from Microsoft to open software (to signal their distrust of the US) – and clearly it was a bloody mess”, notes Jochim Selzer, a “digital self-defence" spokesperson for the Chaos Computer Club, Europe's oldest and largest “hacktivist” group.

A month after severing all ties with the US behemoth, the authorities in the northern German state are still busy fixing the remaining bugs.

Such difficulties largely explain the prevailing “administrative and political inertia” when it comes to ditching American tech, says Frans Imbert-Vier, CEO of Swiss-based technology consulting firm UBCOM and an advocate of technological independence.

This inertia can have knock-on effects. “The problem with state institutions is that their reliance affects the entire ecosystem. Once the administration uses a tool, it indirectly imposes it on its partners, service providers and citizens,” says Musiani.

European governments thus play into the hands of American Big Tech companies, allowing them to cement their hold on the digital daily lives of all public and private actors. This in turn lends more credibility to Trump’s threats to pull the plug on Europe, adds Musiani, for whom “the example must come from above”.

But is banning Teams or Slack from French government agencies enough?

Musiani describes the move as “symbolic” but a “big step” nonetheless, noting that “the discourse on digital sovereignty has struggled to materialise until now”. She adds: “At the very least, it signals a desire to reduce exposure to the American ecosystem as soon as a European alternative, however imperfect, becomes available.”

Whether the shift to Visio reflects a long-term commitment to greater autonomy, or merely an opportunistic PR move, remains to be seen.

A key obstacle is “the enduring attachment to Atlanticist policies, both in France and at the European level”, says Imbert-Vier, who is sceptical of any long-term European desire to tackle the continent’s cushy digital reliance on US systems.

While the Trump administration once championed “alternative facts”, America's Big Tech firms are no fans of alternatives to their tools and platforms. Competitors are required to fend off accusations of monopoly, but they remain largely invisible, crushed by “the massive marketing budgets that tech giants have been showering on the public for decades”, says Martin Hullin, head of the European Network for Technological Resilience and Sovereignty at the Bertelsmann Foundation, a German think tank.

Yet there is a world beyond Gmail, Word, X, Chrome and Apple. Europe, in particular, is home to “many small companies with very interesting ideas and products that are sometimes of better quality than their American equivalents”, argues Frans Imbert-Vier, CEO of technology consulting firm UBCOM and a key advocate of European technological independence.

The hard part is often finding them. Who, for example, has ever heard of Olvid, a French alternative to WhatsApp and text messaging?

France’s Emmanuel Macron has sought to set an example with his “start-up nation” slogan. His government has developed a whole batch of homegrown digital tools to escape American control, aiming to replace Teams with “Visio”, Google Drive with “Files”, and WeTransfer with “FranceTransfer”.

With strained EU-US relations leading to renewed interest in technological sovereignty, some experts in the field have posted catalogues of alternative solutions online.

For each American software programme, Austrian IT developer Constantin Graf has compiled an almost exhaustive list of European alternatives. The ambitious German project Digital Independence Day is less exhaustive but more educational. Its website offers step-by-step instructions on how to switch, for instance, from PayPal to Wero, a European mobile payment system.

Ultimately, “it’s the money that speaks”, adds Martin Hullin, head of the European Network for Resilience and Technological Sovereignty at the Bertelsmann Foundation, highlighting the crucial role of public procurement in providing the basis for digital sovereignty.

“It’s public contracts that make the difference,” he explains. “Nobody ever got fired for procuring Microsoft solutions (...). But if we say this is about safeguarding European democracies, perhaps we’ll be willing to bear the short-term consequences (of shifting to homegrown solutions).”

Grasping the stakes is especially important for digital infrastructure and cloud services, which “needs to be considered a critical asset of society that must continue to function in a state of crisis, like roads, railways and energy grids”, says Johan Linaker, an expert on digital sovereignty at the Research Institutes of Sweden (RISE).

As Europe gradually awakes to the challenge, Big Tech firms across the Atlantic have sensed the tide turning – and started to offer so-called ‘sovereign’ solutions. Earlier this month, Amazon launched its European Sovereign Cloud, which it claims is “entirely located within the EU”.

Critics, however, have been quick to warn against a “Euro-washing” of American cloud services. As Hullin notes, the data would still belong to a US company, which is liable to comply with US government orders.

The FBI raided the facility outside Atlanta, pursuing Trump's false claims that his 2020 election defeat was the result of widespread voting fraud. Claims of voting fraud in the 2020 presidential election have been rejected by courts, state governments and members of Trump's own former administration.

Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard met some of the FBI agents of the bureau's field office in Atlanta a day after the search. During the meeting, she used her cellphone to call Trump, the newspaper reported.

Trump addressed the agents on speakerphone, asked them questions, and praised and thanked them for their work on the inquiry, it added.

Critics have denounced the Georgia investigation as politically motivated. They say the Justice Department requires an unusual amount of independence because it is responsible for administering justice in a non-partisan fashion.

The raid was the latest in a string of actions by Trump's administration to use the Justice Department against his perceived enemies or to intervene in cases where he believes he was treated unfairly.

"DNI Gabbard and FBI Director (Kash) Patel are working together to implement the president's election integrity priorities, and their work continues to serve him and the entire country well," White House spokesman Davis Ingle said in a statement.

The FBI declined to comment. The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 18:44:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ZHX5EFJMFZNKRAXP2GJPM5QDUM.jpg?auth=0ff84168b5b43f0dc4b8fc6449708abc058624086d26ca085a86e77dce9aa757&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Chile’s president officially backs predecessor Bachelet in race to become UN’s first female chief</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260202-chile-s-president-officially-backs-predecessor-bachelet-in-race-to-become-un-s-first-female-boss</link><description>Chile has officially backed the candidacy of its former president Michelle Bachelet to become the UN 's first female secretary-general, with backing from Mexico and Brazil.

Outgoing President Gabriel Boric made the announcement Monday following concerns that Bachelet's bid could be blocked by right-winger Jose Antonio Kast, due to take over the Chilean presidency next month.

Bachelet, 74, has been a trailblazer for Latin America : the first woman to serve as defense minister and the first female elected as the Chilean president, serving two terms from 2006 to 2010 and 2014-18.

She has also served as the UN high commissioner for Human Rights and the first head of the then-newly created UN Women agency.

Last year, she was nominated for the UN's top job by Boric, and later met Kast to seek his backing.

After that meeting, in December, Bachelet told AFP "the world is ready" for a woman to take over and make "a different contribution through a different kind of leadership".

The UN, which turns 81 years old this year, has never had a woman at the helm and only one Latin American – Peruvian diplomat Javier Perez de Cuellar who served as secretary-general from 1982 to 1991.

The post traditionally rotates between world regions, with Latin America next in line as Portuguese Antonio Guterres 's term comes to an end.

"President Bachelet's candidacy, which has already been registered with the United Nations, will be presented jointly with our sister countries Brazil and Mexico," Boric told reporters on Monday.

Three other women from Latin America and the Caribbean are in the running for the UN top job: Costa Rican Rebeca Grynspan, secretary-general of the UN Conference on Trade and Development; Mexican Environment Minister Alicia Barcena; and Barbados Prime Minister Mia Mottley.

The other candidate is International Atomic Energy Agency chief Rafael Grossi from Argentina.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 18:45:27 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/87146f3a-004a-11f1-83fc-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/6889262bb19d7904db5d8d7789e7167e9dc7a02c.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US to cut tariffs on India to 18%, India agrees to end Russian oil purchases</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/india/trump-says-agreed-trade-deal-with-india-2026-02-02/</link><description>WASHINGTON/NEW DELHI, Feb 2 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday announced a trade deal with India that slashes U.S. tariffs on Indian goods to 18% from 50% in exchange for India halting Russian oil purchases and lowering trade barriers.

Trump announced the deal on social media following a call with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, noting that India would now buy oil from the U.S. and potentially Venezuela.

A White House official told Reuters that the U.S. was rescinding a punitive 25% duty on all imports from India over its purchases of Russian oil that had stacked on top of a 25% "reciprocal" tariff rate.

U.S.-listed shares of major Indian companies rallied on the news. IT consulting firm Infosys closed 4.3% higher, consultancy Wipro rose 6.8%, HDFC Bank gained 4.4% and the iShares MSCI India exchange-traded fund rallied 3%.

Trump's announcement added to positive sentiment over semiconductor makers and artificial intelligence, lifting major indexes into positive territory on the day.

Modi also committed India to "BUY AMERICAN at a much higher level," in addition to buying more than $500 billion worth of U.S. energy, including coal, along with technology, agricultural and other products, Trump added.

"They will likewise move forward to reduce their Tariffs and Non Tariff Barriers against the United States, to ZERO," Trump said of India.

Until Trump returned to office and raised U.S. tariff rates to double-digit levels last year, India had some of the world's highest tariffs, with a simple applied rate of 15.6% and an effective applied tariff of 8.2%, according to World Trade Organization data.

Trump's Truth Social message provided few details, including on the start date for the lower tariff rates, the deadline for India to end Russian oil purchases, trade barrier reductions and which U.S. products India had committed to purchasing.

As of late Monday afternoon, the White House had not issued a presidential proclamation nor a Federal Register notice required to make the changes official.

A White House spokesperson offered no further details, while India's commerce and foreign ministries did not immediately respond to requests sent after working hours. Russia's embassy in Washington also did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Previous trade deals with other major Asian trading partners including Japan and South Korea have included commitments to invest hundreds of billions of dollars into U.S. industries, but the India announcement did not mention any specific investments.

The deal brings India "broadly in line with its Asian peers on tariff rates" of 15% to 19%, said Madhavi Arora, economist at Emkay Global, adding that it would eliminate a disproportionate drag on India's exports and its rupee currency.

Indian markets had been battered since the tariffs were levied by Washington, making it the worst-performing market among emerging nations in 2025, with record outflows of foreign investors.

U.S. business groups reacted with caution and criticism. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which has long advocated a market-opening trade deal with India, called Trump's announcement progress towards that goal.

"We are optimistic that this is the first step toward a comprehensive trade agreement that will unlock even more private sector collaboration, and we look forward to reviewing the details of the deal," Chamber CEO Suzanne Clark said in a statement.

A coalition of more than 800 small businesses called "We Pay the Tariffs" urged Americans not to celebrate the deal, which it called a "600% tax increase on American businesses compared to 2024." The group noted that U.S. tariffs on Indian imports were about 2% to 3% at that time but would now be 18% and could go higher if India does not fully wean itself off Russian oil.

"Wonderful to speak with my dear friend President Trump today. Delighted that Made in India products will now have a reduced tariff of 18%," Modi said in a social media post on X. "Big thanks to President Trump on behalf of the 1.4 billion people of India for this wonderful announcement."

India's Trade Minister Piyush Goyal said the deal would draw the U.S. and Indian economies closer together.

"This agreement unlocks unprecedented opportunities for farmers, MSMEs, entrepreneurs, and skilled workers to Make in India for the world, Design in India for the world, and Innovate in India for the world. It will help India get technology from the U.S.," Goyal said in a post on X.

The deal comes less than a week after India signed a long-awaited trade deal with the European Union that is expected to eliminate or reduce tariffs on 96.6% of traded goods by value. That deal excludes EU soybeans, beef, sugar, rice and dairy from tariff reductions.

The Trump administration has been racing to complete framework trade deals with major trading partners before the U.S. Supreme Court rules on whether to strike down Trump's "reciprocal" tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.

Trump administration officials reached a deal with Taiwan last month and say such agreements are expected to continue no matter what the court rules, as they will reimpose tariffs under other authorities.

On Saturday, Trump teased a potential deal for India to buy Venezuelan oil after the U.S. seized Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro in a military raid in early January.

The deal followed months of tense trade negotiations between the world's two largest democracies.

Last August, Trump doubled duties on imports from India to 50% to pressure New Delhi to stop buying Russian oil, and earlier this month said the rate could rise again if it did not curb its purchases.

Purchases of Venezuelan oil would help replace some of the Russian oil bought by India, the world's third-biggest oil importer.

India relies heavily on oil imports, covering around 90% of its needs, and importing cheaper Russian oil has helped lower its import costs since Moscow invaded Ukraine in 2022 and Western nations enacted sanctions on its energy exports.

Recently India has begun to slow its purchases from Russia. In January, they were around 1.2 million barrels per day, and are projected to decline to about 1 million bpd in February and 800,000 bpd in March, according to a Reuters report.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 23:05:12 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/XIVNT4NKZNJLRN7C7VY36JGZHA.jpg?auth=158928fdd06703dc1deeb106d1ab8673a04d9fe7af310f5b32b57f4e3cde7286&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Cuba in communication with US, Cuban diplomat says, as Trump tightens screws</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/cuba-communication-with-us-cuban-diplomat-says-trump-tightens-screws-2026-02-02/</link><description>HAVANA, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Cuba and the United States are in communication, a Cuban diplomat told Reuters on Monday, although he said the exchanges have not yet evolved into a formal "dialogue."

Carlos Fernandez de Cossio, Cuba's deputy foreign minister, told Reuters the U.S. government was aware that Cuba was "ready to have a serious, meaningful and responsible dialogue."

"We have had exchange of messages, we have embassies, we have had communications, but we can not say we have had a table of dialogue," de Cossio told Reuters in an interview at the Foreign Ministry building in Havana.

De Cossio's statements on Monday represent the first hint from Cuba that the two sides are in conversation, even if in a limited fashion, after tensions flared earlier this month between the two countries following the U.S. capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro, long a close ally of Cuba.

U.S. President Donald Trump on Sunday said the United States had begun talks with "the highest people in Cuba," days after declaring Cuba "an unusual and extraordinary threat" to U.S. national security and threatening tariffs on any nation that sends oil to the communist-run island.

"I think we're going to make a deal with Cuba," Trump told reporters at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida on Sunday.

Cuba had previously denied any talks with the United States.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 23:05:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/GNFEZOLAANOKZJ3RXWCXUOKHZQ.jpg?auth=4704c84a3386dd1207af0112c6f4f74eb86d8a8943e096189535ef0023e22eff&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuela says interim president met with U.S. envoy</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/venezuela-says-interim-president-met-with-us-envoy-2026-02-02/</link><description>Feb 2 (Reuters) - Venezuela's government said on Monday that interim President Delcy Rodriguez met with U.S. envoy Laura Dogu, as the two countries gradually resume bilateral relations

The government said in a statement that the meeting took place at the Miraflores presidential palace to discuss "the work agenda between the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and the United States."

Rodriguez's brother, head of the national assembly legislature Jorge Rodriguez, attended the meeting, it added, as did Foreign Minister Yvan Gil, with whom Dogu met over the weekend following her arrival in Caracas .

“The governments of Venezuela and the United States have set out to advance on a roadmap to address matters of bilateral interest, through diplomatic dialogue and on the basis of mutual respect and international law,” the statement added.

After months of heightened tensions, the U.S. captured Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro a month ago, setting off a chain of changes in the country, including the swearing in of Rodriguez, the passage of a reform to its flagship oil law and the release of some political prisoners. Rodriguez has said she is seeking with the U.S., while Trump has said the relationship with the interim government is going well.

The two countries have to export up to $2 billion worth of Venezuelan crude to the United States, and on Friday Rodriguez announced a proposed "amnesty law" for hundreds of prisoners in the country, a move long demanded by the opposition and human rights groups.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 23:05:21 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WKYX2WNB25OOLDDBVKNQ35R6L4.jpg?auth=e6d37dad87f7e87879d68f0ac9894c08444186c0e35ea68c31f593bb5598bf61&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump says talks with Iran ongoing</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/trump-says-talks-with-iran-ongoing-2026-02-02/</link><description>Feb 2 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said Monday that talks with Iran were ongoing amid high tensions.

The ministry's comment, one of many it said were in response to questions put to Lavrov, also praised U.S. President Donald Trump's efforts at working for a resolution of the war and said he understood the fundamental reasons behind the conflict.

"The deployment of military units, facilities, warehouses, and other infrastructure of Western countries in Ukraine is unacceptable to us and will be regarded as foreign intervention posing a direct threat to Russia's security," the ministry said on its website.

It said Western countries - which have discussed a possible deployment to Ukraine to help secure any peace deal - had to understand "that all foreign military contingents, including German ones, if deployed in Ukraine, will become legitimate targets for the Russian Armed Forces".

The United States has spearheaded efforts to hold talks aimed at ending the conflict in Ukraine and a second three-sided meeting with Russian and Ukrainian representatives is to take place this week in the United Arab Emirates.

The issue of ceding internationally recognised Ukrainian territory to Russia remains a major stumbling block. Kyiv rejects Russian calls for it to give up all of its Donbas region, including territory Moscow's forces have not captured.

Moscow has repeatedly said it will not tolerate the presence in Ukraine of troops from Western countries.

The ministry said Moscow valued the "purposeful efforts" of the Trump administration in working towards a resolution and understanding Russia's long-running concerns about NATO's eastward expansion and its overtures to Ukraine.

It described Trump as "one of the few Western politicians who not only immediately refused to advance meaningless and destructive preconditions for starting a substantive dialogue with Moscow on the Ukrainian crisis, but also publicly spoke about its root causes".</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 23:05:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CJXHROLQY5KC3DP23HPDIBCQIU.jpg?auth=be451f7b6dcdb5a6369c86b11e374ec90aa218db6702a35b56d695148ea2a59a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Costa Rican populists win commanding victory but fall short of legislative supermajority</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/costa-rican-populists-win-commanding-victory-fall-short-legislative-2026-02-02/</link><description>SAN JOSE, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Laura Fernandez’s decisive presidential victory in Costa Rica on Sunday also delivered her Sovereign People’s Party (PPSO) a majority in Congress — the first time since 1990 that one party has secured both the presidency and control of the legislature.

The PPSO won 31 of 57 seats, short of the 38-seat supermajority Fernandez sought to advance more sweeping reforms, including judicial and constitutional changes and the ability to declare states of emergency that could temporarily limit civil liberties to fight crime.

"Those big reforms that people feared the government could implement, we're not going to see them," said Maria Fernanda Bozmoski, the director for Central America at the Atlantic Council, a Washington-based international affairs think tank.

While the PPSO can pass laws, budgets and make appointments without needing to negotiate with other parties, it has few allies in the new Congress.

The National Renovation Party (PNR), an evangelical party that often aligned with the government in the previous Congress, was left with zero seats.

The National Liberation Party (PLN), the country's oldest political party and main contender against the PPSO in the election, won 17 seats while the Broad Front (FA), a leftist party that has mounted the strongest opposition to the government, is the third-largest force with 7 seats.

The progressive Citizen Action Coalition will have one seat, occupied by former first lady Claudia Dobles, who ran against Fernandez and has voiced strong opposition to her, leaving one seat for the traditional right-wing Social Christian Unity Party (PUSC).

"The (ruling party's) aspirations of reconfiguring the political system fell a bit short with these results," said Ronald Alfaro, a researcher at Costa Rica's Center for Investigations and Political Studies (CIEP).

"For things that require 38 votes they're going to have to negotiate and we'll have to see how that unfolds," Alfaro added.

During his concession speech, PLN candidate Alvaro Ramos said his party would work with Fernandez on issues they agree on, but oppose her when they disagree.

"We need to keep fighting, that's our job, that's our commitment," Ramos said.

President Rodrigo Chaves often blamed Congress for blocking progress through gridlock and obstruction.

"The opposition is going to have to redefine itself because it won't be as easy to obstruct or block things," Alfaro said, adding that the vast majority of the legislators are new to Congress.

"We'll have to see how that block manifests, if they go their own ways or form an opposition alliance."</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 23:05:33 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/OG67I6EDDVL6BBUWFO2A6I27BY.jpg?auth=9306a63a94e5c155ca0205ff8b1fd61910b134278f6b29d30e97d180c94bf754&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Egypt's drone deployment to border raises stakes in Sudan's civil war</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/egypts-drone-deployment-border-raises-stakes-sudans-civil-war-2026-02-02/</link><description>CAIRO, Feb 2 (Reuters) - The deployment of a powerful model of Turkish combat drone to a remote airstrip on Egypt’s southwestern border signals a sharp escalation in Sudan’s civil war, suggesting one of its largest neighbours is being drawn deeper into the fray, more than a dozen officials and regional experts say.

Egypt, which shares the Nile River and a more than 1,200-kilometre frontier with Sudan, has provided staunch political backing to the country’s military in its nearly three-year conflict with the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) paramilitary group.

But while Egyptian security officials have privately acknowledged sending logistical and technical support to the Sudanese Armed Forces, until last year Cairo mostly refrained from direct intervention in fighting that has killed tens of thousands of people, displaced millions and spread famine across the vast country.

Cairo’s position toward the conflict started to change when the RSF made a series of advances in Sudan’s western Darfur region, first capturing a strategic northwestern triangle between Egypt and Libya in June and then overrunning the Sudanese military’s last foothold in Darfur, the city of al-Fashir, in October, according to eight regional analysts and three diplomats briefed by Egyptian officials.

Egypt’s presidency warned in December that the country’s national security was directly linked to Sudan’s, and Cairo would not allow its “red lines” to be crossed. Those lines include preserving Sudan’s territorial integrity and rejecting any “parallel entities” that threaten the country’s unity, it said.

Two Egyptian security officials told Reuters two airports in the south have been supplied with military equipment over the past eight months or so to secure the border and carry out military strikes to protect “national security.” The officials, who like other sources spoke on condition of anonymity, declined to provide details.

Satellite images from Vantor, a U.S. space technology firm, show a large drone on the apron of one of the airports, in East Oweinat, on September 29, December 28 and January 9.

Two military experts who reviewed the images told Reuters the aircraft was identifiable as a Bayraktar Akinci based on its distinctive body and wing design. The New York Times has also published imagery of Akinci drones at the East Oweinat airstrip, which they reported were being used for strikes in Sudan.

The Akinci is one of the most advanced drones manufactured by Turkish defence firm Baykar, with the ability to travel at high altitudes, remain airborne for 24 hours and carry a wide range of munitions.

Egypt’s Foreign Ministry and State Information Service did not answer questions about operations at East Oweinat or in Sudan. Sudan’s military also did not respond to requests for comment.

Egypt – along with Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and United States – is part of the so-called "Quad" of countries seen as most influential in the conflict, which has been trying, without success, to broker a ceasefire.

Cairo’s toughening stance adds another potentially explosive element to a conflict that has drawn in a wide range of foreign actors since April 2023, when the country’s military and the RSF fell out over how to integrate their forces during a planned transition to civilian rule.

U.N. experts have accused the UAE of providing weapons to the RSF, which Abu Dhabi denies. Sudan’s military has deployed Turkish and Iranian drones , and it has received political and other backing from Qatar and Saudi Arabia .

RSF head Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo has accused Egypt of being involved in airstrikes against the group since at least October 2024, which Cairo denied at the time. Shortly before al-Fashir's fall, Dagalo said his forces were being attacked by aircraft taking off from "airports in neighboring countries”, warning they would be considered a “legitimate target” for his fighters.

The RSF did not respond to questions for this article.

The New Arab, a London-based pan-Arab news outlet, quoted an Egyptian military official as saying Egypt carried out an airstrike on an RSF convoy in the border triangle area on January 9. A diplomat in Cairo briefed by Egyptian officials said the strike was carried out from an airbase in southern Egypt. Reuters could not independently verify the accounts.

Samir Farag, a retired Egyptian military officer, said East Oweinat is one of the “main bases through which Egypt can secure its southern borders.”

The airstrip is located in a remote farming region, about 60 km (37 miles) from the Sudan border, and was primarily used to support a desert reclamation project before the war.

“Egypt doesn’t allow anyone to be present on its borders and threaten its national security,” Farag said. “It will intervene directly and manage the situation. This is the right of every country in the world.”

DRONE DEPLOYMENT AT THE BASE

While only one Akinci is clearly visible on any given day in the Vantor imagery, an image captured by U.S. satellite firm Planet Labs on December 28 almost certainly shows two outside one of the hangars, according to Jeremy Binnie, Middle East specialist at Jane’s, a defence intelligence company. Akincis can also be seen outside multiple hangars, suggesting more than one is being used to store drones when they are not flying, he added.

The presence of support equipment and loading material around the aircraft, and the fact that they appear in different locations, suggest they are being used, said Wim Zwijnenburg, a military technology expert at Dutch peace organisation PAX.

The images reviewed by Reuters also show renovations underway at the airport between early July and the end of January. The runway was being repaved and possibly widened slightly, and several smaller roads were added. There were also signs of digging and construction, with at least two small structures added.

The RSF says its territory has been attacked repeatedly with Akincis, claiming its fighters shot down at least seven since June. Reuters could not verify the claims.

Two videos posted on social media in mid-January showed what RSF fighters said was an Akinci shot down near Nyala, the group’s main stronghold in Darfur. The two military experts told Reuters the wreckage was consistent with a crashed Akinci, but the news agency could not determine when and where the videos were shot, or who was operating the drone.

In February 2024, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said Ankara would sell drones to Egypt as the two countries normalised ties following a decade-long rupture, but he did not specify what kind.

A Turkish Defence Ministry source said the countries reached an agreement on the sale of Akincis the same year. The source did not provide further details. A Western diplomat, who meets regularly with Turkish officials, said they had privately defended Egyptian airstrikes on the RSF as legitimate and had confirmed drones were recently delivered for use in the war effort but did not give further details.

Five of the six flights into East Oweinat that appear in flight tracking data from FlightRadar24 since September came from Turkey. Of these, three were Turkish Air Force-operated cargo planes from Tekirdag, the Turkish city where Akincis are tested, the data shows.

Reuters could not determine what was on the flights, which took place on December 25, December 26 and January 7.

The Turkish Defence Industries Presidency (SSB), which handles such agreements, the Akincis’ manufacturer, Baykar, and Egypt’s government did not respond to questions about the sale.

Justin Lynch, managing director of the Conflict Insights Group consultancy, which closely tracks the war in Sudan, said the drone deployment at East Oweinat was “an indication of Egypt’s recent policy to be more involved in Sudan”.

The airport is less than 400 kilometres from Sudan’s border triangle, a strategically sensitive region on Egypt’s doorstep through which the RSF can receive supplies from southeastern Libya destined for Darfur.

Supplies sent through that corridor proved instrumental to the fall of al-Fashir , during which the RSF was accused of widespread atrocities, including gunning down hundreds of civilians and holding residents hostage for ransoms.

The city’s fall was a turning point in Egypt’s previously “ambiguous” stance toward the conflict, said Jalel Harchaoui, a contributor to Britain’s Royal United Services Institute think tank.

“The Egyptian military harbors no affinity whatsoever for the Rapid Support Forces. Yet Egypt depends on the United Arab Emirates, a major backer of the RSF, for financial assistance,” he said. “When al-Fashir finally fell … Cairo’s equilibrium shifted toward taking tougher measures against the RSF.”

Egypt may also have been emboldened by Saudi Arabia’s moves to curb the UAE's influence in Yemen, according to the analysts and diplomats who spoke with Reuters, a rivalry that has since spilled over into the Horn of Africa .

An Emirati official said the UAE was working with regional partners – including Egypt and Saudi Arabia – to secure a ceasefire in Sudan and that its “decisions have consistently favoured restraint over escalation".

If confirmed to be an AFC/M23 operation, it would be the furthest west the group has struck as part of its offensive against the government in Kinshasa.

AFC/M23 spokesperson Willy Ngoma said he had "no comment" on the claim from Congolese authorities. A government spokesperson for Rwanda, which United Nations experts and Western powers say backs AFC/M23, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The government of Tshopo province, where Kisangani is located, said in a statement on Sunday that the drones attempted to strike Bangoka International Airport between early Saturday and early Sunday but were shot down before reaching their target.

The statement described the aircraft as “kamikaze drones” carrying “non‑conventional munitions made up of several sub‑munitions.” No casualties or damage were reported.

Bangoka airport lies about 17 km from central Kisangani, hundreds of kilometres from the front lines in North and South Kivu provinces, where AFC/M23 has seized large swathes of territory since 2022, capturing the key cities of Goma and Bukavu in a lightning offensive last year.

The escalation spurred efforts by mediators including the U.S. and Qatar to end the fighting and facilitate Western investments in critical minerals in eastern Congo.

One diplomatic source and three security sources confirmed that a drone attack had taken place near the airport. It was not immediately clear what type of drones were used, but two of the security sources said they appeared to be relatively short range.

Since the fall of Goma to AFC/M23, Kisangani has become the main forward base for Congo’s military aircraft, including jets and drones used in operations in the east.

A local spokesperson for Congo's army declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 23:05:44 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump says Republicans should 'nationalize' voting in at least 15 places</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-says-republicans-should-nationalize-voting-least-15-places-2026-02-02/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Feb 2 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Monday that Republicans should "nationalize" and "take over" voting in at least 15 unspecified places, reiterating his false claims that U.S. elections are marred by widespread fraud.

In a podcast interview with his former FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino, Trump -- who continues to claim falsely that his 2020 election defeat was the result of fraud -- gave no details on what he intended.

Referring to immigrants, the president said on "The Dan Bongino Show": "These people were brought to our country to vote, and they vote illegally. And you know, amazing that the Republicans aren't tougher on it."

"The Republicans should say, we want to take over. We should take over the voting, the voting in at least many, 15 places. The Republicans ought to nationalize the voting," Trump said in the interview.

He did not specify the locations but said: "We have states that are so crooked and they're counting votes. We have states that I won that show I didn't win."

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for clarification of Trump's remarks.

Bongino returned to his podcast after leaving the Federal Bureau of Investigation last month.

Trump's comments came days after the FBI searched an election office in Georgia's Fulton County for 2020 records as the president continues to press false claims of fraud in his 2020 defeat, an accusation that has been rejected by courts, state governments and members of Trump's own former administration.

Trump, in a departure from law enforcement norms, spoke with some of the FBI agents by cellphone the day after the raid during a meeting they had with Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, the New York Times reported on Monday.

The U.S. will hold midterm elections in November that will determine control of Congress for the next two years.

"Following this release (of Epstein files) and subsequent media reporting, the Met has received a number of reports relating to alleged misconduct in a public office," Ella Marriott, commander of the Met police, said in a statement on Monday.

Lang, 86, knew Epstein for several years, requesting favours such as the use of his car or plane for himself or his family, French daily Le Monde reported.

French investigative website Mediapart also reported that Epstein in 2016 founded a company based in the US Virgin Islands, half of whose shares were owned by Lang’s eldest daughter Caroline.

But it said no files it reviewed suggested either father or daughter had been implicated in Epstein’s sexual crimes.

Lang said he first met Epstein through the US film director Woody Allen “about 15 years ago”.

“I was completely shocked when I discovered the crimes he had committed,” Lang, who has been president of the Paris-based Arab World Institute since 2013, said in a statement.

“I fully accept the ties I may have formed at a time when nothing suggested that Jeffrey Epstein could be at the heart of a criminal network,” he added.

“Had I known, I would have immediately cut off all contact with him.”

Epstein died by suicide in 2019 while in prison facing charges of sex trafficking underage girls.

Caroline Lang, a one-time actor and now a film producer, told Mediapart she met Epstein through Allen and his wife in 2012, and that one day the US financier told her he wanted to “invest in young French and international artists”.

She said his lawyers set up the company called Prytanee LLC, but that she did not invest any money in it. An email in the Epstein files suggests she instead contributed her knowledge of the art world, Mediapart reported.

She told the investigative website she had been “incredibly naive”.

Later Monday, Caroline Lang resigned as head of the Independent Production Union (SPI).

“I do not want this situation to in any way harm the union,” Lang said, who was only named as the SPI head three weeks ago.

A leading French conductor, Frédéric Chaslin, also named in the new batch of Epstein documents, meanwhile slammed reports of a 2013 email he sent to Epstein in which he said he had “found a formidable girl”.

“It is ... totally unacceptable and false to insinuate that I ‘found a girl’ for Jeffrey Epstein. The reality is simple and verifiable: he had asked me to recommend an interpreter to accompany him on visits to Parisian museums,” Chaslin wrote in a Facebook post in response to a report by the Diapason magazine on the email exchange.

In the 2013 email, Chaslin wrote: “I have found a formidable girl for your next stay in Paris. Philosophy student. 21. She looks a bit like the current wife of (Roman) Polanski.”

Epstein had at this time already been convicted of soliciting an underage person for prostitution.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 23:06:32 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/d6336572-0062-11f1-9017-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/f995f4712de941b40a1394c99426a444ea976788.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Syria security forces enter strategic al-Hassakeh as part of deal with Kurdish-led SDF</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260202-syria-security-forces-enter-strategic-al-hassakeh-as-part-of-deal-with-kurdish-led-sdf</link><description>A small contingent of security forces with Syria’s interior ministry entered the city of al-Hassakeh on Monday as part of a deal between Damascus and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces , or SDF, which control the city.

The SDF announced the new agreement with the central government on Friday, aiming to stabilise a ceasefire in the country that ended weeks of fighting, in which the Kurdish-led force lost most of the territory it previously held in northeastern Syria . It lays out steps toward integrating the force into the army and police forces, and integrating civilian institutions in SDF-controlled areas into the central government.

Under the deal, government military forces will not enter Kurdish-majority areas, but small contingents of security forces reporting to the interior ministry will enter the cities of al-Hassakeh and Qamishli to secure state-affiliated institutions such as the civil registry, passport offices and the airport, and to restart work at those institutions.

Local Kurdish police forces will continue to patrol both cities and will eventually be integrated into the interior ministry as well.

The entry of government forces into al-Hassakeh went forward as planned without any outbreaks of violence.

Later Monday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned the SDF against any attempts to “sabotage” the agreement reached with the Syrian government.

“With the latest agreements, a new page has now been opened before the Syrian people,” Erdogan said in a televised address. “Whoever attempts to sabotage this, I say clearly and openly, will be crushed under it.”

Turkey is a strong ally of the government in Damascus and regards the SDF as an extension of a Kurdish militant group that has led a decades-long insurgency in Turkey.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 23:06:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/a03389e2-0077-11f1-8b1e-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26033697269504.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Delayed French 2026 budget finally through, paves way for Macron’s military spending boost</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260202-delayed-french-budget-finally-through-paves-way-for-macron-military-spending-boost</link><description>France has adopted its delayed 2026 budget Monday, clearing the way for higher military spending promised by President Emmanuel Macron to confront threats linked to Russia’s war in Ukraine and Mideast conflicts.

The adoption of the budget marks the final step of a monthslong, chaotic process that exposed deep divisions in the fractured parliament, which proved unable to reach a compromise.

Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu ultimately opted to use his special constitutional power to pass the bill without a vote, surviving two no-confidence votes on Monday evening.

Macron has vowed to increase defence spending to counter what he describes as a widening range of threats, from Russia and nuclear proliferation to terrorism and cyberattacks .

France in December passed an emergency law to avoid a US-style government shutdown, but only the full 2026 budget provides the military with the needed funding to build up forces.

The defence ministry will get this year an additional €6.7 billion compared to 2025 — a notable exception as the state seeks to curb spending across most other sectors. This year, the armed forces are set to receive a new nuclear-powered attack submarine, 362 armoured vehicles to modernise the army, and new Aster surface-to-air missiles.

France is also launching its new voluntary military service this year aiming at training thousands of volunteers, mostly ages 18 and 19.

The government is targeting a budget deficit of 5 percent of gross domestic product, down from 5.4 percent in 2025. Public spending is expected to edge down slightly, from 56.8 percent to 56.6 percent of GDP as authorities try to rein in debt in the European Union’s second-largest economy.

France has come under pressure from the EU and credit rating agencies to reduce its debt, prompting the centre-right government to seek spending cuts.

However, with no majority in parliament, Lecornu also granted costly concessions to Socialists to keep them from backing efforts to topple his government. The most symbolic is the suspension of Macron’s unpopular pension changes to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64.

The state deficit is projected at €131.9 billion, almost stable compared with the previous year.

Businesses will bear several tax increases, including an extra tax on large companies’ profits that’s expected to raise €7.3 billion in 2026.

Macron, 48, is soon entering the last year of his presidency in spring 2027.

He has largely stepped back from domestic politics since his 2024 decision to call early legislative elections plunged parliament into turmoil and led to the collapse of successive governments over budget disputes.

Lecornu, the fourth prime minister in two years, has survived eight no-confidence votes initiated by the hard left and the far right . Macron, meanwhile, has focused on foreign policy, European affairs and defence.

In recent weeks, he has pushed for security guarantees for Ukraine in the event of a peace deal with Russia, joined European leaders in a show of solidarity with Greenland , and supported the inclusion of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard on the EU’s list of terrorist organisation.

As his sunglasses became a sensation at the Davos gathering of world leaders, Macron’s remarks that France prefers “respect to bullies”, seen as a rebuke to US President Donald Trump’s tariffs threats, drew worldwide attention.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 23:06:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/787049c2-0068-11f1-ad6d-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/000-94V77UX.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump says Mexico will stop sending oil to energy-starved Cuba</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/trump-says-mexico-will-stop-sending-oil-energy-starved-cuba-2026-02-02/</link><description>Feb 2 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday that Mexico would stop sending oil to Cuba as he ramped up a pressure campaign on the Caribbean nation.

"Mexico is gonna cease sending them oil," Trump told reporters in the White House Oval Office. He did not elaborate on why he believed this to be the case.

Mexican authorities did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Mexico is the single-largest supplier of oil to Cuba, which regularly suffers from energy shortages and mass blackouts. Cuba relies heavily on fuel imports of refined products to meet its demand for electricity generation, gasoline, and aviation fuel. U.S. sanctions and a deep economic crisis have prevented the Communist government from purchasing enough fuel for years, forcing it to depend on a small group of allies.

Reuters has reported that the Mexican government is reviewing whether to keep sending oil to Cuba, as it worries that Mexico could face reprisals from the United States over its policy to do so.

President Claudia Sheinbaum's administration said on Sunday it would seek to ship oil to Cuba for humanitarian reasons, “without seeking confrontation." But they also said aid would consist of "other" products for the coming week.

Tensions flared last month between Havana and Washington following the U.S. capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro, long a close ally of Cuba. Trump has labeled Cuba "an unusual and extraordinary threat" to U.S. national security and threatened tariffs on the U.S.-bound exports of any nation that sends oil to the communist-run island.

Cuba and the United States are in communication , a Cuban diplomat told Reuters on Monday, although he said the exchanges have not yet evolved into a formal "dialogue." Trump has also said the two sides are talking.

Mexico and many regional analysts think Cuba could face a humanitarian crisis if the country loses access to energy. Other countries might not make up for a shortfall from Mexico, given Washington's threats.

Trump has privately questioned Sheinbaum about crude and fuel shipments to Cuba, Reuters has previously reported. Sheinbaum responded that the shipments are "humanitarian aid," according to sources familiar with a call between the leaders. They added that Trump did not directly urge Mexico to halt the oil deliveries.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 23:31:27 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4EPB4EACRFMXZONLMSDLPASLKU.jpg?auth=08295237c0a5f5e872af66223a62676da674522e681f1006abf0ee1dc1c8914a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UN to deploy ceasefire monitoring mission in Congo, Qatar says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/un-deploy-ceasefire-monitoring-mission-congo-qatar-says-2026-02-02/</link><description>DAKAR, Feb 2 (Reuters) - The United Nations peacekeeping mission in Congo will send its first team to monitor a ceasefire between Congo’s government and the AFC/M23 rebel group in the coming days, Qatar’s foreign ministry said on Monday after hosting talks in Doha.

Qatar said the team would be deployed to Uvira, a strategic city in eastern Congo that AFC/M23 fighters captured in December during a rapid offensive, and which Congolese forces and allied militias re‑entered last month, restoring government control after the rebels announced they would withdraw.

The announcement late Monday is a sign of progress in Doha-mediated direct talks between Congo and the AFC/M23 rebels, who last year seized more land than they had ever held before in eastern Congo. The United States is hosting separate talks between Congo and Rwanda, which the United Nations and Western powers say backs AFC/M23, an allegation Kigali denies.

The Qatari foreign ministry said on Monday that Congo and M23 had agreed on detailed terms of reference for the ceasefire monitoring mechanism created under an agreement reached in October , and reaffirmed their commitments under the broader peace deal framework signed in November .

The latest push to activate ceasefire monitoring comes amid persistent fighting in the east.

Over the weekend explosive‑laden drones targeted the airport serving the northeastern Congolese city of Kisangani, Congolese authorities said.

If confirmed to be an AFC/M23 operation, it would be the furthest west the group has struck as part of its offensive against the government in Kinshasa.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 23:32:08 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/JMY4N2XYVJL5DF4PBJNCP5AZQE.jpg?auth=86f8efa0b4096d8f5fae089b383b9d001d29344efc9fd6acce77e52cd6fd2cdd&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukrainian capital Kyiv, other cities, under Russian  attack, officials say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/ukrainian-capital-kyiv-under-missile-attack-official-says-2026-02-02/</link><description>Feb 3 (Reuters) - Russian forces attacked the Ukrainian capital Kyiv with missiles early on Tuesday, officials said, with initial reports saying apartment blocks and other buildings had suffered damage.

Officials reported Russian air attacks on other Ukrainian regions, including Kharkiv, the country's second largest city, where the regional governor said two people were injured.

In Kyiv, Reuters witnesses reported loud explosions in the city after midnight and said both missiles and drones were being deployed.

Tymur Tkachenko, head of the city's military administration, said on Telegram that several apartment buildings, an education establishment and a commercial building had been damaged in districts east of the Dnipro River.

Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said a building housing a kindergarten had been set on fire and a non-residential building hit in eastern districts.

An air raid alert remained in effect more than two hours after it had been announced.

Videos posted on social media showed an apartment on the upper floors of a Kyiv block ablaze.

Ihor Terekhov, the mayor of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, reported several strikes in succession by drones and missiles.

U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes in Washington, D.C., halted , opens new tab the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's effort to terminate Haiti's Temporary Protected Status. The move would have taken effect on Wednesday despite spiraling violence there that has displaced more than 1.4 million people.

Reyes, who was appointed by Democratic former President Joe Biden, issued the ruling in a class-action lawsuit brought by Haitians seeking to stop the administration from exposing them to deportation by ending their legal status.

Reyes said in the ruling that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem likely violated the procedures required to terminate the protected status of Haitian immigrants in the U.S. as well as the U.S. Constitution's Fifth Amendment guarantee of equal protection under the law.

"Plaintiffs charge that Secretary Noem preordained her termination decision and did so because of hostility to nonwhite immigrants. This seems substantially likely," Reyes wrote.

The law firm representing the plaintiffs, Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner, praised the ruling, noting that Haiti remains extremely dangerous.

"This ruling recognizes the grave risks Haitian TPS holders would face if forced to return, and it ensures that they can remain here in the United States – as legislated by Congress - to continue their lives, contributing to their communities, and supporting their families," the firm said in a statement.

TPS is available to people whose home country has experienced a natural disaster, armed conflict or other extraordinary event. It provides eligible migrants with work authorization and temporary protection from deportation.

The Department of Homeland Security has moved to end the status for about a dozen countries as part of President Donald Trump's crackdown on immigration , saying TPS was always meant to be temporary and not a "de facto amnesty program."

Department spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin indicated in a social media post that the ruling would be appealed.

"Haiti's TPS was granted following an earthquake that took place over 15 years ago, it was never intended to be a de facto amnesty program, yet that’s how previous administrations have used it for decades. Temporary means temporary and the final word will not be from an activist judge legislating from the bench," McLaughlin said.

Haitians were first given TPS in 2010, after a devastating 7.0 magnitude earthquake struck their country. The U.S. has repeatedly extended the status, most recently under the Biden administration in July 2024.

The department at that time extended TPS for another 18 months through February 3, 2026, citing "simultaneous economic, security, political, and health crises" in Haiti, fueled by gangs and a lack of a functioning government.

Shortly after Trump took office, his administration tried to curtail those humanitarian protections for Haitians in February 2025, when Noem moved to truncate the Biden-era extension so it would expire in August.

After a federal judge in New York in July ruled Noem lacked statutory authority to do so, her department in November moved to terminate Haiti's TPS status, saying there were "no extraordinary and temporary conditions" in the country that would prevent migrants from returning.

UNICEF estimated in October that over 6 million people - more than half the population, including 3.3 million children - need humanitarian assistance.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 02:10:47 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/2EEFORPBYZIRDIXTYSYI4PVLT4.jpg?auth=a0ae32f9c49c72b5c1c3a05e8a480f081f7fe2869f22551f5b45a5f59a9cfc35&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Son of Norway's crown princess stands trial for rape and domestic violence</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/son-norways-crown-princess-stands-trial-rape-domestic-violence-2026-02-03/</link><description>OSLO, Feb 3 (Reuters) - The son of Norway's crown princess will stand trial on Tuesday on charges of rape, domestic violence, assault and drug possession, among other crimes, one of several cases that have shaken the Norwegian monarchy.

Marius Borg Hoiby, 29, son of Crown Princess Mette-Marit and stepson to Crown Prince Haakon, could face multiple years in prison if found guilty of the most serious of the 38 charges brought against him.

His lawyer Petar Sekulic told Reuters he did not admit criminal guilt for the charges of rape or domestic violence, but did admit guilt for some of the less serious matters.

"He will give a detailed explanation about this in court," Sekulic said.

The case is scheduled to run until March 19. Hoiby is scheduled to testify on Wednesday.

On Sunday Norwegian police detained him on suspicion of causing bodily harm, wielding a knife and violating a restraining order. A court ruled on Monday Hoiby could be held in custody for four weeks. His lawyer told Reuters he was considering an appeal.

The court case is the most serious crisis to hit the Norwegian royal family in peacetime, according to historian Trond Noren Isaksen, though Hoiby does not have a royal title and is outside the line of succession.

The start of the trial also comes days after his mother Mette-Marit apologised for her "poor judgment" for maintaining contacts with the late U.S. sex offender Jeffrey Epstein after he was convicted of child sex crimes in 2008.

Crown Prince Haakon and Crown Princess Mette-Marit are not planning to attend court proceedings, Haakon said in a statement, adding he trusted the justice system to be fair and proper.

About Marius, Haakon said: "We love him, he is an important part of our family. He is a Norwegian citizen, so he has the same responsibilities as everyone else, as well as the same rights," he said.

Haakon expressed sympathy for the alleged victims. "We think about them, we know many are going through a difficult time," he said.

The Nordic country is a constitutional monarchy in which the king is the formal head of state while political power rests with parliament and the government.

Among the charges against Hoiby are one count of rape with sexual intercourse and three counts of rape without intercourse, some of which he filmed on his telephone, the prosecution said.

In January, it added new charges, including of possession and transport of 3.5 kg (7.72 pounds) of marijuana.

In 2024 , police named Hoiby as a suspect of physical assault against a woman with whom he had been in a relationship.

Hoiby, in a statement to the media at the time, admitted to causing bodily harm to the woman while he was under the influence of cocaine and alcohol and of damaging her apartment. Hoiby said he regretted his acts.

The trial comes at a time of multiple challenges for the family, in addition to the ongoing scrutiny Mette-Marit is receiving for her ties to Epstein.

King Harald, 88, Europe's oldest living monarch, cut back activity in 2024 after being hospitalised to treat an infection and later receiving a pacemaker.

Mette-Marit is in need of a lung transplant after being diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis in 2018, a chronic disease that causes scarring in the lungs and leads to a reduced oxygen uptake.

Meanwhile, King Harald's daughter, Martha Louise, stepped down from official royal duties in 2022 to allow her to more freely pursue her own business ventures, and said both she and her husband, an American self-styled shaman, would refrain from using her title as princess in a commercial setting.

They both received criticism last year for starring in a Netflix documentary chronicling their daily lives, including their wedding, and for being critical of the king and queen.

"This must be seen in the context of all the controversies caused by Princess Martha Louise and her husband and that age and health issues have made it more difficult for the royal family to fulfil their duties, which has affected their visibility," said historian Isaksen.

Still, the monarchy remains popular. Some 70% of Norwegians support the monarchy as an institution, according to a Norstat poll for public broadcaster NRK conducted in January among 1,030 people and published on Friday. Only 19% want another form of government.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 02:11:10 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/TL4SU37LYBMKDEA25RRE4ED47I.jpg?auth=3dd4bb7fe10a7fd934b3b738ded0e3691573f96448aa9fc16ca9c94f554a94e4&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Bill and Hillary Clinton to testify before Congress in Epstein probe</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260203-bill-hillary-clinton-to-testify-congress-epstein-investigation</link><description>Bill and Hillary Clinton will testify in a US House investigation surrounding deceased sex offender Jeffrey Epstein , a spokesman for the ex-president said, heading off a potential vote to hold the couple in contempt.

They had originally refused to appear before lawmakers examining how authorities handled earlier investigations into the disgraced financier, who had connections and correspondence with the world's business and political elite.

"The former President and former Secretary of State will be there. They look forward to setting a precedent that applies to everyone," Angel Urena said on X.

The House Rules Committee had advanced resolutions accusing the Clintons of defying subpoenas to appear in person to explain their links to Epstein, who died in custody in 2019.

The Epstein affair continues to cast a long shadow over Washington, entangling some of the most prominent names in US politics and highlighting the sharp partisan battles that have shaped the scandal.

Democrats say the probe is being weaponised to attack political opponents of President Donald Trump -- himself a longtime Epstein associate who has not been called to testify -- rather than to conduct legitimate oversight.

Trump spent months trying to block the disclosure of investigative files linked to Epstein, who moved in elite circles for years, cultivating ties with billionaires, politicians, academics and celebrities.

Neither Trump nor the Clintons have been accused of criminal wrongdoing related to Epstein's activities.

In letters where they initially refused to appear in Washington, the Clintons had argued that the subpoenas were invalid because they lacked a clear legislative purpose.

Republicans say the Democratic couple's past links to the business tycoon, including Bill Clinton's use of his private jet in the early 2000s, justify in person questioning under oath.

Instead, the couple submitted sworn written statements describing their knowledge of Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex trafficking.

Bill Clinton acknowledged flying on Epstein's plane for Clinton Foundation-related humanitarian work, but said he never visited his private island.

Hillary Clinton said she had no meaningful interactions with Epstein, never flew on his plane and never visited his island.

The contempt vote and its targeting of the Clintons could have exposed divisions among congressional Democrats.

Some Democrats have privately acknowledged that their party has long argued no one should be beyond scrutiny in efforts to uncover the full scope of Epstein's crimes.

But others feared that advancing the contempt resolutions would have played into a partisan strategy to shift attention away from Trump's past contacts with Epstein.

The Justice Department released last week what it said would be the final batch of files related to the investigation into Epstein.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 02:12:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/019db34e-f09f-11f0-9c2f-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-13T163503Z-339867903-RC2NDCAR4CM1-RTRMADP-3-USA-TRUMP-EPSTEIN-CLINTONS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Britain unveils first national plan to curb 'forever chemicals' risks</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/environment/20260203-britain-national-plan-forever-chemicals-risks</link><description>Britain unveiled Tuesday its first-ever plan to tackle " forever chemicals " and reduce the risks they pose to health and the environment.

PFAs (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) are a group of some 10,000 human-manufactured chemicals used in everything from pizza boxes to cookware, to waterproof clothing.

They take an extremely long time to break down -- earning them their "forever" nickname -- and instead build up in the environment.

There is growing evidence their widespread use has created risks that "will likely remain for hundreds of years", according to the UK's Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs.

It said in a statement the new government plan aims to "understand where these chemicals are coming from, how they spread and how to reduce public and environmental exposure".

The full extent of PFAs in England's estuaries and coastal waters "will be assessed for the first time," it added.

PFAs are present in food and drinking water.

Chronic exposure to even low levels has been linked to liver damage, high cholesterol, reduced immune responses, low birth weights and several kinds of cancer.

Under the plan, "a consultation will be launched later this year on introducing a statutory limit for PFAS in England's public supply regulations."

Should permitted levels be exceeded, this would make it easier for regulators to "enforce against water companies breaking the rules".

"It's crucial that we protect public health and the environment for future generations," said Environment Minister Emma Hardy in the statement.

She noted the government would work with regulators, industry, and local communities "to ensure 'forever chemicals' are not a forever problem".

Safer alternatives to everyday items, such as period pads and waterproof clothing, could also be developed.

Traces of the chemicals have been found everywhere from Tibet to Antarctica and contamination scandals have gripped Belgium and the United States among other nations.

Their use is increasingly being restricted across the world due to adverse health effects.

A handful of US states, including California, implemented a ban on the intentional use of PFAS in cosmetics beginning in 2025, and several other states are slated to follow in 2026.

The European Union has also been studying a ban on the use of PFAs in consumer products.

A report last week said their continued use could cost Europe up to 1.7 trillion euros ($2 trillion) by 2050 because of their impact on people's health.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 02:12:07 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/5d39309e-ce4d-11f0-8f23-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2025-11-27T154534Z-1121068092-RC235IA3L2DK-RTRMADP-3-BRITAIN-BUDGET.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Epstein calls himself 'lowest level' offender in newly released interview</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260203-epstein-denied-he-was-devil-video</link><description>Jeffrey Epstein denied he was the "devil" and insisted he was only the lowest level of sexual predator in a video interview included in the latest release of files by US authorities.

The interview, which lasts around two hours, was conducted by President Donald Trump' s former advisor Steve Bannon. It appears to be filmed in the deceased financier's New York home on an unknown date.

Documents concerning Epstein and government investigations into him have been released in troves, highlighting his connections to political and business leaders worldwide.

"Do you think you're the devil himself?" Bannon asks Epstein, a convicted sex offender who died in prison in 2019 while awaiting trial for sex trafficking of underage girls.

"No, but I do have a good mirror," Epstein says smiling, wearing a black shirt and glasses. When questioned again, he adds, "I don't know. Why would you say that?"

Epstein, who pleaded guilty in 2008 to soliciting prostitution from an underage girl, also appears to downplay the seriousness of his conviction.

He opposes Bannon labeling him a "class three sexual predator" -- which indicates a most serious threat to public safety, according to a classification used in the United States.

"No, I'm the lowest," says Epstein.

"But a criminal," Bannon adds, to which Epstein responds: "Yes."

The confrontation followed Bannon asking Epstein if he considered his money "dirty" as he "earned it advising the worst people in the world."

Epstein insists he made his money legally but acknowledges that "ethics is always a complicated subject."

He argues that he gave cash to help eradicate polio in Pakistan and India in a bid to justify how he earned his money.

Documents show that Bannon had regular correspondence with Epstein, who offered to help the far-right political figure spread his conservative ideology in Europe.

Millions of pages on Epstein, along with photos and videos, have been published by US authorities since Trump took office in January 2025.

They have shed light on Epstein's ties to top business executives such as Microsoft's Bill Gates, celebrities such as filmmaker Woody Allen, and academics and politicians including Trump and former president Bill Clinton.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 02:12:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/35e1af82-fdfd-11f0-a704-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/EPSTEIN.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump cuts India tariffs after Modi agrees to stop Russia oil purchases</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/economy/20260202-trump-cuts-india-tariffs-after-modi-agrees-to-stop-russia-oil-purchases</link><description>US President Donald Trump announced a trade deal Monday to reduce tariffs on India , saying that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had promised to stop buying Russian oil over the war in Ukraine.

Trump said he was cutting levies on Indian goods to 18 percent. He had previously imposed 25 percent "reciprocal" tariffs on many products, plus an additional 25 percent for New Delhi's purchases of Moscow's oil.

The deal eases months of tensions over India's oil purchases -- which Washington says fund a conflict it is trying to end -- and restores the close ties between Trump and the man he describes as "one of my greatest friends."

But while Modi thanked Trump for the "wonderful" phone call and the easing of tariffs, he made no reference to Trump's assertion about halting Russian oil purchases.

"Out of friendship and respect for Prime Minister Modi and, as per his request, effective immediately, we agreed to a Trade Deal between the United States and India," Trump said in a post on Truth Social.

Trump said that the United States would lower the reciprocal duty imposed on India during his waves of global "Liberation Day" tariffs last year from 25 percent to 18 percent.

A White House official told AFP that an additional 25 percent tariff Trump had slapped on India in August for its purchase of Russian oil would also be dropped.

Trump added that Modi "agreed to stop buying Russian Oil, and to buy much more from the United States and, potentially, Venezuela. This will help END THE WAR in Ukraine."

The United States is effectively overseeing Venezuelan oil exports since toppling the South American country's leader, Nicolas Maduro, in a military operation in January.

India had further agreed to buy more than $500 billion in US energy, tech, agricultural, coal and other products, Trump said, without giving further details.

Modi was one of the first leaders to visit the White House after Trump's return to the presidency a year ago, but efforts to secure a trade deal had foundered over India's Russian oil purchases.

As recently as December, Russian President Vladimir Putin said during a visit to New Delhi that he was ready to continue "uninterrupted shipments" of fuel to India despite US pressure.

Trump also said in October that Modi had promised to stop buying Russian oil, but an agreement did not materialise at the time.

"Wonderful to speak with my dear friend President Trump today. Delighted that Made in India products will now have a reduced tariff of 18 percent," Modi said in a post on X on Monday.

The Indian leader however made no mention of oil sales.

A recent EU-India accord may have been may have been a catalyst for the sudden Trump announcement, said Tanvi Madan, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution's Center for Asia Policy Studies.

"It is possible that the Indian trade agreement with the EU... incentivized Washington to get to yes," Madan told AFP.

Madan added that the "devil will be in the details" in the sectors that will get relief under the deal.

For India "the Russia question remains," said Farwa Aamer, Director of South Asia Initiatives at the Asia Society Policy Institute.

"Even though it has and will change its oil import structure away from Russia, India would still want to keep relations steady," Aamer added.

India emerged as a major buyer of Russian oil after the start of the Ukraine war, providing Moscow with a crucial export market as Europe sharply reduced purchases.

In 2024, Russia supplied nearly 36 percent of India's total crude imports, around 1.8 million barrels of discounted oil per day.

Modi added however that "President Trump's leadership is vital for global peace, stability, and prosperity."

Trump has repeatedly claimed credit for ending the brief but intense armed conflict between nuclear-armed neighbors India and Pakistan in May.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 02:12:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/be84ea5a-0066-11f1-a74d-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/f4ddce0c3dd86c595d076023f4d6028b33a208e9.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Taiwan must look to democracies, not China, for trade cooperation, president says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/taiwan-must-look-democracies-not-china-trade-cooperation-president-says-2026-02-03/</link><description>TAIPEI, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Taiwan must look to fellow democracies, not China, for trade and economic cooperation, President Lai Ching-te said on Tuesday, as his government mapped out how the island plans to work with the United States on areas like AI and critical minerals.

Senior Taiwanese and U.S. officials last week discussed cooperation in artificial intelligence, tech and drones at a high-level forum launched during the first Trump administration, with the U.S. State Department praising Taipei as a "vital partner."

The two sides signed statements on cooperation on economic security and on the Pax Silica Declaration - a U.S.-led initiative aimed at securing AI and semiconductor supply chains amid intense competition from Beijing, Washington's main strategic rival and which claims Taiwan as its own territory.

Speaking at a news conference at the presidential office about the U.S.-Taiwan Economic Prosperity Partnership Dialogue, Lai lauded the outcome of those talks.

"Taiwan is on the right economic path and is striding confidently onto the world stage. Taiwan has both the capability and the confidence to work with its democratic partners to lead the next generation of prosperity," he said.

Lai was speaking as the deputy chairman of Taiwan's main opposition party the Kuomintang (KMT), Hsiao Hsu-tsen, was in Beijing for a think-tank exchange with China's Communist Party on ostensibly non-political issues like AI and tourism.

Lai said Taiwan's opposition "had their own positions", and pointed to the differences of Taiwan's slower economic growth under the previous KMT government, which signed a landmark trade deal with China, or the much faster growth since the Democratic Progressive Party took office in 2016.

"Do we want to continue collaborating with the U.S., Japan, Europe and other allied nations, or again lock ourselves into China?" he added.

There was no immediate response from the KMT to Lai's remarks, but Hsiao told the opening of the forum in Beijing that "peaceful development" serves the interests of both sides, according to a read out of his remarks provided by the party.

"We should cooperate across the Taiwan Strait to earn money from the world, rather than oppose each other across the strait and let foreign countries reap the benefits, exploiting Taiwan and hollowing it out," he said.

China refuses to speak to Lai, calling him a "separatist". He says only Taiwan's people can decide their future.

Speaking to reporters, Lai reiterated an offer to speak to Beijing, based on parity and equality.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 04:27:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5N45RQ44KBO6TJOQDBAFPG3L6I.jpg?auth=11faa96a7a27dd953bbca4ffdcc93d5c1819a873f1b8cdfe8b481c405e3768f0&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China's Xi calls for 'equal, multipolar world' as he meets Uruguay leader</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-xi-calls-equal-multipolar-world-he-meets-uruguay-leader-2026-02-03/</link><description>BEIJING, Feb 3 (Reuters) - China and Uruguay should should work together to advance an "equal and orderly multipolar world", President Xi Jinping told his counterpart Yamandu Orsi on Tuesday, according to a media pool report.

Orsi's visit is the first by a South American leader to the Chinese capital since the United States invaded Venezuela in January and captured then President Nicolas Maduro in a raid .

China and Uruguay should "work together to advance an equal and orderly multipolar world and an inclusive, universally beneficial economic globalisation," Xi said in his remarks, aiming to build a community with a shared future for mankind.

The meeting comes in the wake of a flurry of visits to China by Western leaders this year, from Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer to Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and Finland's Prime Minister Petteri Orpo.

Orsi said his visit aimed to "empower Uruguay in the world and generate opportunities, investment and development" in a Facebook comment on Sunday, following his arrival in Beijing.

He is leading a delegation of 150, including business leaders, on a visit that runs until February 7, which will also take in the commercial capital of Shanghai.

The timing is symbolically important for China, said Francisco Urdinez, a professor at the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile.

"For Beijing, hosting Orsi ... signals that South American countries remain eager to engage, despite the increasingly polarised geopolitical environment."

China was the top destination for Uruguayan agricultural products from wood pulp to soybeans and beef. Uruguay ran a trade surplus of $187.1 million with China in the first half of 2025.

Marcos, who is midway through his six-year term and denies wrongdoing, faces two separate complaints filed by a lawyer and activists, which hurdled an initial step at the House justice committee on Monday when lawmakers said both were "sufficient in form".

The committee reconvened on Tuesday to determine whether there was "substance" to move the complaints forward. The committee's decision, regardless of which way it goes, would be put to a vote of the lower house of Congress, which is dominated by allies of the president.

If the complaints against Marcos succeed in a vote of the House, he would be the second Philippine head of state to be impeached after Joseph Estrada, whose 2001 trial was aborted when some prosecutors walked out.

The complaints include Marcos' decision to allow his predecessor Rodrigo Duterte to be arrested and taken to The Hague to face trial at the International Criminal Court over thousands of killings during his notorious "war on drugs".

Marcos is also accused of abusing his authority in spending public funds that led to a corruption scandal over flood-control projects. His alleged drug use , which he has denied, also made him unfit to run the country, according to one of the complaints.

The office of Marcos said he respects the process.

"Even before, the president already said he did not do anything wrong, did not violate the law and did not commit an impeachable offence," Presidential press officer Claire Castro told a briefing on Monday.

If the lower house decides to impeach Marcos, it would be sent to the Senate for trial, where its 24 members serve as jurors. Five top officials have been impeached in the Philippines and of those, only one, a former chief justice, was convicted and removed from office.

Among the five was Marcos' estranged Vice President Sara Duterte, whose impeachment was struck down by the Supreme Court last year. She is facing new impeachment complaints and denies wrongdoing.

Gerville Luistro, who heads the justice committee, said its members would decide whether the alleged offences Marcos was accused of were enough to impeach him.

"It's not enough that an impeachable official committed wrongdoing. That wrongdoing must constitute an impeachable offence," Luistro told broadcaster Teleradyo.

Luistro said if lawmakers vote in favour of advancing the complaint, Marcos would have the chance to respond to the allegations. The backing of one-third of the House is needed to impeach the president.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 04:27:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/DWHNUHMKVFMZ3IVLN6IPMG4J3Q.jpg?auth=6a83c9fac72aaffbfdfcf9874f13281cde33d6004f45b5c795610759e766bb91&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Tulsi Gabbard says Trump requested her presence at FBI raid in Fulton County</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/tulsi-gabbard-says-trump-requested-her-presence-fbi-raid-fulton-county-2026-02-03/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Feb 2 (Reuters) - U.S. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said on Monday she was present at last week's FBI raid on an election facility in Georgia at the request of President Donald Trump and that her attendance was within her authority.

Gabbard wrote in a letter to lawmakers dated Monday that she observed FBI personnel executing a search warrant in Fulton County and was present there for a "brief period of time."

Top Democrats on the Senate and House of Representatives intelligence committees had called for Gabbard to brief their panels on why she was present at the raid and raised concerns about her presence.

Gabbard also said that while visiting the FBI field office in Atlanta, she "facilitated a brief phone call" for Trump to thank FBI agents for their work on the probe, a departure from law enforcement norms.

She added in the letter that Trump did not ask any questions and that she and Trump did not issue any directives.

The FBI searched Fulton County Election Hub and Operation Center on Wednesday, pursuing Trump's false claims that his 2020 election defeat was the result of widespread voting fraud.

Claims of voting fraud in the 2020 presidential election have been rejected by courts, state governments and members of Trump's own former administration.

Gabbard's letter was addressed to Democratic U.S. Senator Mark Warner and Representative Jim Himes. Warner's office said Gabbard's letter "raises more questions than it answers."

It is unusual for America's top intelligence official to be included in a domestic law enforcement operation as the remit of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) is overseas spying and protecting national security.

"My presence was requested by the President and executed under my broad statutory authority to coordinate, integrate, and analyze intelligence related to election security, including counter-intelligence, foreign and other malign influence and cybersecurity," Gabbard wrote.

Experts had raised legal questions over Gabbard's presence.

"The DNI has authorities set out by statute and they don't include investigating past elections for potential fraud," Robert Litt, who served as the top ODNI lawyer from 2009 to 2017, told Reuters last week.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 04:28:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/VZ7XERIX5VL53EKGAGBB733WYM.jpg?auth=944e2cbb1e297b5ef933aca8f3544d51966d2b6a95fcff84845601bf4f595abe&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Washington presses Venezuela interim leader on post-Maduro 'transition'</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260203-washington-venezuela-interim-leader-post-maduro-transition</link><description>Venezuela 's interim president Delcy Rodriguez solidified her new government Monday, appointing several cabinet members and meeting with Washington's new top diplomat in Caracas to address the country's "transition" after the ouster of Nicolas Maduro.

Laura Dogu, Washington's charge d'affaires in Venezuela, said on X she spoke with Rodriguez about US plans for "stabilisation, economic recovery, reconciliation and transition."

It was not immediately clear what Dogu meant by a "transition." Maduro had been in power since 2013 until US forces raided the country and captured him, but much of his government remains in place.

Venezuela's Foreign Minister Yvan Gil said after the meeting the diplomatic focus going forward would involve "addressing the differences and historical controversies between the United States and Venezuela."

"We reviewed the common agenda, especially on energy, trade, and politics," he added.

In addition to meeting with Dogu, Rodriguez made several key appointments to her presidential cabinet, including tapping former foreign minister Felix Plasencia to lead Venezuela's diplomatic mission in the United States.

"Very soon we'll have our diplomatic representative, Felix Plasencia, in Washington to accelerate diplomatic work, political work, and the work of developing our common agenda," Gil said.

Plasencia's appointment marks a pivotal change in diplomatic relations between Caracas and Washington, which were severed in 2019 after the United States refused to recognise Maduro's reelection and instead supported a parallel government led by then-opposition leader Juan Guaido.

Rodriguez also appointed Daniella Cabello -- the daughter of Venezuela's powerful interior minister, Diosdado Cabello -- as her cabinet's tourism minister.

The elder Cabello was widely considered to be Venezuela's second-most powerful figure after Maduro, and his backing for Rodriguez's government is seen as critical.

Cabello pledged the police's support for Rodriguez when she became country's leader after Maduro was ousted in a deadly US military operation last month and whisked away to New York to stand trial on drug charges.

The appointments come weeks after Rodriguez, formerly the vice president, cleared ranks among the country's top military brass, appointing 12 senior officers to regional commands.

Among those she dismissed was businessman Alex Saab, the minister of industry under Maduro and a close ally of the former president.

Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado meanwhile told reporters during a video call Monday that she would be willing to meet with Rodriguez "if it's necessary" in order to establish a "transition timeline."

"If it's necessary to exchange ideas in a meeting to define a transition timeline, it will happen," she said according to a transcript.

However, she added that Rodriguez's interim government "is still the mafia. They may have another name, but they are the mafia."</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 04:30:12 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/b23c7174-00a1-11f1-96a9-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/81eb07c1b81016a111c6c03f6e71200b3cafeb22.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China's Xi calls for 'equal, multipolar world' as he meets Uruguay leader</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/chinas-xi-calls-equal-multipolar-world-he-meets-uruguay-leader-2026-02-03/</link><description>BEIJING, Feb 3 (Reuters) - China and Uruguay should should work together to advance an "equal and orderly multipolar world", President Xi Jinping told his counterpart Yamandu Orsi on Tuesday, according to a media pool report.

China and Uruguay signed a joint declaration to deepen a strategic partnership on Tuesday as well as 12 cooperation documents covering science, technology, environmental cooperation, exports and imports of meat and intellectual property.

Orsi said Uruguay would like to intensify "trade in goods, especially through diversification, and to invest much more strongly in the area of ​​trade in services and investment," according to the pool report.

China and Uruguay's strategic partnership "is going through its best moment," he said, adding that it was the responsibility of both countries to "commit to raising it to a new level."

While traditional export sectors like meat and soy have played a central role in the relationship, others such as dairy present considerable potential, said Dr Diego Telias, a professor at the Universidad ORT Uruguay and an associate researcher at ICLAC, an institute that studies the impact of Chinese capital in Latin America.

A gap also remains in the area of service exports, he said, "an area in which Uruguay has successfully engaged with markets such as the United States, the United Kingdom and Europe, but not yet with China."</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:35:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/PGNWVOBW3NMRVLAZCIXD2OV32U.jpg?auth=1620ddb1e97a389e6926bc8cae4cb58f728122ca7bdc8964c67ca93335de48d9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran president gives go-ahead for talks with US</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/iran-president-gives-go-ahead-talks-with-us-2026-02-03/</link><description>DUBAI, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Talks with the U.S. should be pursued to secure national interests as long as "threats and unreasonable expectations" are avoided, President Masoud Pezeshkian posted on X on Tuesday.

Reuters could not immediately verify the report.

The plan was discussed on several occasions in December and January between Ukrainian, European and American officials and would involve a multi-tiered response to any breaches of an agreed armistice by Russia, the report said.

Envoys from Kyiv, Moscow and Washington will meet in Abu Dhabi on Wednesday and Thursday for talks aimed at ending the war, FT said.

As per the proposal, any Russian breach of a ceasefire would prompt a response within 24 hours, starting with a diplomatic warning and, if necessary, action by Ukrainian army to halt the infraction, the newspaper said.

If hostilities continued beyond that, the proposal would move to a second phase of intervention using forces from the so-called coalition of the willing, which includes many EU members and the UK, Norway, Iceland and Turkey, the report said.

The report added that in the case of an expanded attack, a coordinated response by a Western-backed force, incorporating the U.S. military would be triggered 72 hours after the initial breach.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:37:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia is ready for a new world with no nuclear limits, Ryabkov says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/russia-is-ready-new-world-with-no-nuclear-limits-ryabkov-says-2026-02-03/</link><description>MOSCOW, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Russia is ready for the new reality of a world with no nuclear arms control limits after the New START treaty expires later this week, Russia's point man for arms control said on Tuesday.

Unless Moscow and Washington reach a last-minute bilateral understanding of some kind, the New START treaty, signed in 2010 by U.S. President Barack Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, will expire on February 5.

"The lack of an answer is also an answer," Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov was quoted by state news agency TASS as saying in Beijing on the absence of a response from Washington on Russian proposals to extend the limits of New START.

Russia was ready for the new reality of the world's two largest nuclear powers having no limits for the first time in decades, Ryabkov said.

He also said Russia supported China's position on arms control.

On Iran, he said the United States' proposals to Iran were tantamount to ultimatums.

He said that if the U.S. pumped lots of missile defence systems onto Greenland then Russia would have to take compensatory measures in its military sphere.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 06:53:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/PYHLSES2URNMNGNRBTS7BSUEDI.jpg?auth=a9f8ca0e74868220157a9215d34b8075325d0cff95131d2dd05afa97dde55556&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Live: Iran’s president Pezeshkian seeks 'fair and equitable negotiations' with US</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260203-live-iran-s-president-pezeshkian-seeks-fair-and-equitable-negotiations-with-us</link><description>Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told CNN that he believed a nuclear deal with the US was achievable. The interview was broadcast on Monday.

"So I see the possibility of another talk if the US negotiation team follows what President Trump said: to come to a fair and equitable deal to ensure that there is no nuclear weapons," he said.

"So if that is the case, I am confident that we can achieve a deal," he added.

Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has ordered the start of nuclear talks with the United States, as his US counterpart Donald Trump threatened "bad things" if no deal with the Islamic Republic was struck.

"Taking into account demands from friendly regional countries to respond ‍to the US ​President's suggestion for talks, I instructed the foreign ‌minister to prepare the ground for ‍equitable and fair negotiations ... should an atmosphere free of threats and unreasonable ‍expectations arise," Pezeshkian wrote on social media.

Trump has maintained he is hopeful that Washington will "work something out" with Iran but also warned on Monday that "bad things would happen" if no deal is reached.

"I think that the region has gone through various calamitous confrontations. I don't think we need another one, but I would like to see direct Iranian-American negotiations leading to understandings that we don't have these issues every other day," he said.

Iran and the United States will resume nuclear talks on Friday in Turkey, Iranian and U.S. officials told Reuters on Monday, and U.S. President Donald Trump warned that with big U.S. warships heading to Iran, bad things would probably happen if a deal could not be reached.

U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi will meet in Istanbul in an effort to revive diplomacy over a long-running dispute about Iran's nuclear programme and dispel fears of a new regional war, while a regional diplomat said representatives from countries such as Saudi Arabia and Egypt would also participate.

The East African country enacted the Anti-Homosexuality Act in 2023, defying pressure from Western governments as well as local and international rights groups.

Described as one of the world's harshest laws targeting the LGBT community, it carries a sentence of life in prison for same-sex intercourse and imposes the death penalty in cases deemed "aggravated".

That categorisation includes repeat offences, gay sex that transmits terminal illness, or same-sex intercourse with a minor, an elderly person or a person with disabilities.

The then 20-year-old man from Soroti in northeastern Uganda spent nearly a year on remand after he was detained in August 2023 and charged with aggravated homosexuality , his lawyer Douglas Mawadri told Reuters on Tuesday.

The man was accused of "unlawful sexual intercourse" with a 41-year-old man.

During proceedings which lasted more than two years, prosecutors amended the indictment and charged the man with having "carnal knowledge against the order of nature," an offence under Uganda's penal code that carries life imprisonment, Mawadri said.

On Monday "the magistrate discontinued the case upon finding that the accused is of unsound mind after a long detention on remand", Mawadri told Reuters.

Mawadri said the ruling was delivered orally in court and a written version would be available at a later date.

A spokesperson for Uganda's judiciary had no immediate comment.

Uganda's Anti-Homosexuality Act in 2023 drew widespread condemnation an threats of sanctions, and led the World Bank to suspend new funding to Uganda for nearly two years. The U.S. imposed visa restrictions on some Ugandan officials.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 07:43:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics to showcase Italy's Alpine venues</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260203-milan-cortina-winter-olympics-to-showcase-italy-s-alpine-venues</link><description>The 2026 Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics open on Friday as the Games return to their traditional heartland of the European Alps for the first time in 20 years, while organisers are praying skiing great Lindsey Vonn is fit to compete.

These Games will use a host of existing venues, meaning they will stretch for 350 kilometres across northern Italy from Cortina – one of the world's iconic skiing locations – to Milan, with other "clusters" spread through the Alps.

Organisers say that avoiding new construction meets the sustainable brief for an event often accused of creating white elephants, but they admit it has added complexity too.

The first Olympics since the re-election of US President Donald Trump are set to be buffeted by global turbulence.

Italy has maintained that it will retain control of all security operations after it emerged that a branch of the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) will be sent to Italy in an "advisory" role, sparking anger in the host nation .

Olympic power Russia 's team of just 13 must compete as neutrals, a sanction imposed by the International Olympic Committee after Moscow invaded Ukraine weeks after the last Winter Games in Beijing in 2022.

The sports programme begins on Wednesday, but the Games officially start two days later with a spectacular opening ceremony at the San Siro stadium in Milan featuring performances from US singer Mariah Carey and Italian opera star Andrea Bocelli.

US Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio are expected to attend.

When the full programme of sport gets under way, all eyes will be on Vonn, whose comeback at 41 could be the storyline of this Olympics, provided she can recover from the hard fall she suffered in a World Cup race in Crans-Montana, Switzerland , on Friday.

Following the crash, Vonn said she had injured her left knee, the joint that was fortified with titanium in surgery which allowed her to return to the circuit last year after retiring in 2019.

Vonn insisted "my Olympic dream is not over" and she is due to give an update on Tuesday.

Also eagerly awaited is the men's ice hockey competition, with stars from the National Hockey League (NHL) in the US and Canada – the world's strongest – taking part for the first time since 2014.

Kirsty Coventry, the new IOC president, is also under scrutiny as she oversees her first Games since her election as the movement's first woman leader in March.

Coventry admitted that the approach of using existing venues, which are often long distances apart, has complicated the task for organisers.

"I think initially we all thought, 'oh, well, we'll just have it be a little bit more dispersed because that's more sustainable'. Yes, that is very true, but it has added additional complexities in the delivery of the Games," the Zimbabwean said.

Two of the new venues, the sliding centre in Cortina for the bobsleigh , skeleton and luge events and the main ice hockey arena in Milan have caused the most headaches.

The location of the sliding centre became a political hot potato after the IOC initially said those events would have to be held at existing sites in Switzerland or Austria .

But the insistence in late 2023 of Italy's Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini that the events be held in Italy led to a breakneck race to build a track in Cortina, where the 1956 Winter Olympics were held.

Construction didn't start until February 2024, sparking open opposition from the IOC, but it was completed just in time for pre-approval in March last year – a win for Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni 's hard-right government.

Meanwhile, repeated delays to the construction of the main ice hockey arena, located in the Santa Giulia district on the outskirts of Milan, led to uncertainty right up until last month over the participation of the NHL players.

Those doubts weren't removed until the successful hosting of a test event at the venue less than a month ago.

Organisers admitted on Sunday that some parts of the Santa Giulia venue are unfinished, but insisted all the scheduled games there would go ahead.

Milan-Cortina estimate the final bill for the Olympics will be 5.2 billion euros ($6 bn). Of that 3.5 bn euros is going on infrastructure and 1.7 bn euros on staging the Games.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 07:43:48 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/c98d7ace-00b7-11f1-ab95-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/cb249e23735e3970895f52c961aa8e42f635f3fc.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Malaysian court acquits French man facing possible death penalty on drug charges</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260203-malaysian-court-acquits-french-man-facing-possible-death-penalty-on-drug-charges</link><description>A French national facing a possible death penalty in Malaysia on eight drug-related charges was acquitted Tuesday, freeing him after nearly two and a half years in detention .

The High Court in the northern city of Alor Setar ruled that prosecutors failed to prove that Tom Félix, 34, had control, custody or possession of the drugs in the case.

"The accused is, therefore, released and acquitted," Alor Setar High Court judge Evawani Farisyta Mohammad said.

Félix, in court wearing a white shirt and trousers, his hands cuffed, looked visibly pleased as the judge delivered the decision.

The former Veolia executive appeared to have lost a considerable amount of weight since his arrest, his parents said.

Jean Luc and Sylvie Félix were seen embracing after the ruling.

Félix and his Malaysian business partner were detained in 2023 after police discovered 1.86 kilograms of cannabis in the common area of a home they shared.

Authorities later said Félix was also found in possession of 11.7 grams of the drug.

He denied all the charges.

If convicted, Félix faced the death penalty or a cumulative sentence of 104 years in prison, 54 strokes of the cane and a 27,000 euro ($31,000) fine, his mother previously told AFP.

Drug trafficking and possession are serious offences in Malaysia, which still allows capital punishment for cases involving large quantities of narcotics.

However, death sentences are no longer mandatory, and no executions have been carried out since 2018.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 08:41:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/565240f6-00d2-11f1-b344-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/000-47K42W9.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Paris prosecutor's cybercrime unit searches French office of Musk's X</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/paris-prosecutors-cybercrime-unit-searches-french-office-musks-x-2026-02-03/</link><description>PARIS, Feb 3 (Reuters) - The Paris prosecutor's office said a search was underway at the French offices of Elon Musk's social media network X on Tuesday as part of an investigation opened in January 2025 .

Although pro-government pollsters put Fidesz ahead, the 21 Institute poll published by news site 24.hu was the second this week to put Tisza ahead and show Our Homeland winning enough seats to enter parliament.

Nationalist Orban faces the biggest challenge to his rule since Fidesz swept to victory in 2010 although the outcome remains highly uncertain, with opinion polls showing that many voters are still undecided.

The 21 Institute poll, conducted between January 28 and February 2, put Tisza on 35% support among all voters, up from 34% in December. Fidesz was on 28% support, up from 26%.

The poll showed 53% of decided voters supported Tisza and 37% backed Fidesz, a similar level to December.

The poll showed that Our Homeland (Mi Hazank) would be the only other party to pass the 5% threshold required for entry into parliament.

A Publicus Institute poll published on Monday by Nepszava newspaper showed 48% of decided voters supporting Tisza and 40% backing Fidesz, with Our Homeland on more than 5% support. It also showed 27% of voters were undecided, after 31% in December.

Tisza is led by former government insider Peter Magyar who has said his party would curb corruption, unlock billions of euros in frozen European Union funds to boost the economy, and firmly anchor Hungary in the EU and NATO.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 09:43:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/DE5I3T2RVZPU5CPTE3Y7VIIPAQ.jpg?auth=7f1063af919eed20fc088f7564ad654e5e02101542d94535043751d1416ee011&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Poland detains Defence Ministry employee suspected of collaborating with Russia, Onet reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/poland-detains-defence-ministry-employee-suspected-collaborating-with-russia-2026-02-03/</link><description>WARSAW, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Poland's Military Counterintelligence Service has detained an employee of the Defence Ministry suspected of collaborating with Russian intelligence, news website Onet reported citing sources.

Trump said on Thursday that Russian President Vladimir Putin had agreed to stop striking Kyiv and "various towns" during cold weather.

The Kremlin said the truce would last until Sunday but did not link it to the subzero temperatures.

Russia hit Kyiv "in the bitter cold with another massive strike" overnight, Tymur Tkachenko, the head of the city's military administration, said Tuesday on Telegram.

The emergency services said in a later post that three people in Kyiv had been wounded.

Kyiv ​Mayor ⁠Vitali Klitschko said ‍that ​1,170 residential ​buildings in the capital were left without ‍heating following the strikes.

In the eastern city of Kharkiv, two people were wounded by Russian shelling, regional military chief Oleg Synegubov said.

The hours-long attack targeted energy infrastructure and aimed to "cause maximum destruction ... and leave the city without heat during severe frost", Synegubov wrote on Telegram.

Authorities had to cut heating to more than 800 homes to prevent the wider network from freezing, he said, urging people to go to round-the-clock "invincibility points" around the city if they needed to warm up.

Overnight temperatures plunged to minus 17C in Kyiv and sank as low as minus 23C in Kharkiv.

Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky on Tuesday said Russia was prioritising more attacks over peace talks , after Moscow fired dozens of missiles and hundreds of drones at Ukraine overnight.

"Taking advantage of the coldest days of winter to terrorise people is more important to Russia than turning to diplomacy," Zelensky wrote on social media, adding Russian forces had attacked with "more than 70 missiles in total, as well as 450 attack drones."

Russia's invasion of Ukraine will hit the four-year mark on February 24.

Washington has sought to craft a peace settlement between both sides, but the first round of trilateral talks held in Abu Dhabi last weekend failed to yield a breakthrough.

A second round is due to begin on Wednesday in the Emirati capital.

Zelensky said on Monday that recent "de-escalation" with Russia was helping build trust in negotiations, apparently referring to a break in attacks on energy facilities.

But territory remains a sticking point, and the warring sides have not yet shown willingness for compromise.

Russia wants full control of Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region, which Kyiv has ruled out, saying such a move would only embolden Moscow.

After failing in its aim of a lightning offensive to capture Kyiv and topple Ukraine's leadership in a matter of days in 2022, Russia has been bogged down in the face of Ukrainian defences and is now mounting a grinding advance that has come at huge human cost.

Moscow's troops accelerated their advance in Ukraine throughout January, capturing almost twice as much land as in the previous month, according to an AFP analysis.

Russia seized 481 square kilometres in January, analysis of data from the Institute for the Study of War, which works with the Critical Threats Project, showed.

The January gains were up from 244 square kilometres in December 2025 and one of the largest advances during a winter month since Russia invaded four years ago.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 09:45:08 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/498a3cb6-00cd-11f1-980d-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/1693e0e5307de4a5fd9cffaa89fd6f0505740d2e.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump's tariff cut spells relief in India despite scant details</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/india/trumps-tariff-cut-spells-relief-india-despite-scant-details-2026-02-03/</link><description>NEW DELHI, Feb 3 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's move to slash tariffs on Indian imports sparked a relief rally across the Asian country's markets on Tuesday, lifting sentiment among exporters and policymakers even as details of the agreement remained scant.

Trump announced a trade deal with India on Monday to cut tariffs to 18% from 50% in exchange for New Delhi halting Russian oil purchases and lowering trade barriers.

But Trump's social media post was not followed by any details of the deal from the White House or the Indian government.

An Indian government official said India has agreed to buy petroleum, defence goods and aircraft from the U.S., while partly opening up its guarded agriculture sector under the agreement .

New Delhi has also lowered tariffs on imported cars to address Washington's immediate demands, according to the official.

Trump said India will buy more American goods with purchases rising to over $500 billion, including energy, coal, technology, agricultural and other products. He did not specify any time-frame.

"India's tariff agreement with the U.S. removes its earlier disadvantage versus peers," said Neelkanth Mishra, chief economist at Axis Bank.

The deal helps affected Indian gems and jewellery, leather, plastics, ceramics and auto components and non-tech foreign investment, he added.

Among Asian peers, U.S. tariffs on goods from Indonesia stand at 19% while the rate for Vietnam and Bangladesh stands at 20%.

India's exports to the U.S. rose 15.88% year-on-year to $85.5 billion in January-November, while imports stood at $46.08 billion, Indian government data showed.

The announcement of the trade deal has reduced a great deal of global uncertainty, India's economic affairs secretary , Anuradha Thakur, said at an event in New Delhi on Tuesday.

It also lifted investor sentiment . India's benchmark stock index, the Nifty 50 (.NSEI) , opens new tab , was up nearly 3% and the rupee climbed over 1% to 90.40 per dollar in early trading.

"Lower tariffs will not only improve price competitiveness but also help Indian exporters integrate more deeply into U.S. supply chains,” said S.C. Ralhan, president of the Federation of Indian Export Organisations.

Reduction in U.S. tariffs on most Indian goods will reinvigorate India's exports to the U.S., Moody's Ratings said in a statement.

Despite the announcement by Trump and a post on X from Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, details of the deal remain scant.

Indian refiners will need a wind-down period to complete Russian oil deals before imports from that country can be halted, and they have so far not been ordered by the government to stop such imports, Reuters reported .

The Kremlin said it had heard no statements from India about halting purchases of Russian oil.

Moody's said immediately stopping Russian oil imports could be disruptive to India’s economic growth.

"A complete shift toward non-Russian oil could also tighten supply elsewhere, raise prices and pass through to higher inflation given that India is one of the world’s largest oil importers,” it said.

The India-U.S. trade deal will ensure more exports of American farm products to India's massive market, U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said in a post on social media, without giving any details.

In the past, India's trade deals have typically excluded some sensitive farm and dairy items, as New Delhi maintains the need to protect millions of subsistence farmers.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 10:40:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KEMCEHU52FM2NAD7TRLXKQDOBM.jpg?auth=3d740c864e9d6dd0b664e264955c281d154114f7be4e07c785529dd6f63103df&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iranian police say 139 foreigners arrested over unrest in Yazd province</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iranian-police-say-139-foreigners-arrested-over-unrest-yazd-province-2026-02-03/</link><description>DUBAI, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Iranian police said 139 foreign nationals have so far been arrested in the central province of Yazd for their participation in recent protests, the semi-official Tasnim news agency reported on Tuesday, without specifying their nationalities.

Yazd, a predominantly desert province with a relatively small population above 1 million, was one of many provinces affected by nationwide protests in January.

The protests, which started in December over economic hardships and quickly turned political, were repressed in the most violent crackdown since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. The official death toll stands at 3,117, although rights groups say many more people have been killed. U.S.-based rights group HRANA has said that nearly 50,000 people have so far been arrested.

Authorities blame Israel and the United States for fomenting the violence.

"These (foreign) individuals played an active role in organising, inciting, and directing riotous actions, and in some cases were in contact with networks abroad," Yazd's police commander Ahmad Negahban was quoted as saying by Tasnim.

Judicial authorities have warned of severe consequences for unrest-linked detainees who committed violent acts.

"Those who played a role in this American sedition and supported it will not be spared," Iran's judiciary spokesperson Asghar Jahangir said on Tuesday.

Iranian media reported on Monday the arrest of four foreigners in Tehran over last month's unrest, a shift from earlier reports announcing daily arrests of suspected protest ringleaders without pointing to foreign nationals.

Following a 12-day war in June in which Israel relied on agents within Iran for its early offensive, Tehran accelerated a campaign to deport mainly Afghan nationals, who represent the largest foreign community in the country.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 10:40:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Guinea president keeps mines minister in post-election government</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/guinea-president-keeps-mines-minister-post-election-government-2026-02-03/</link><description>CONAKRY, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Guinea President Mamady Doumbouya, who came to power in a coup and was sworn in for a seven-year term last month, has retained his mines minister but appointed new ministers of finance, justice and security as part of his government.

The former special forces commander, thought to be in his early 40s, has been leading the West African nation since seizing power in 2021.

Guinea holds the world's largest bauxite reserves and the richest untapped iron ore deposit at Simandou , where a massive mining project was launched in November.

The following month, Doumbouya won the presidential election that completed the return to civilian rule. Last week, Doumbouya announced that Amadou Oury Bah would stay on as prime minister.

According to a decree read on Monday night on state television, Mariama Cire Sylla, a former World Bank country representative who had been serving as agriculture minister, will now lead the Ministry of Economy, Finance and Budget.

Ibrahima Sory Tounkara, who acted as a judge during a trial for a 2009 stadium massacre that killed more than 150 people, was appointed justice minister.

General Ahmed Mohamed Diallo was named minister of security and civil protection.

The mines minister, Bouna Sylla, was first appointed to the role in 2024.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 10:41:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WFFOGPAH2FPODDL5ZDIDSQY2MI.jpg?auth=0300683d85ba1f984c9d6f5d5603676020330ce5131bd04705337c0060a8d11a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>NATO's Rutte says reaching deal to end war will require tough choices</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/natos-rutte-says-reaching-deal-end-war-will-require-tough-choices-2026-02-03/</link><description>KYIV, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Reaching a peace deal to end Russia's war in Ukraine will require tough choices, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said on Tuesday.

Iran and the United States will resume nuclear talks on Friday in Turkey, Iranian and U.S. officials told Reuters on Monday. U.S. President Donald Trump warned that with big U.S. warships heading to Iran, "bad things" would probably happen if a deal could not be reached.

The UAE, a highly influential Gulf Arab power and close U.S. ally, said a long-term solution was needed.

"I think that the region has gone through various calamitous confrontations. I don't think we need another one, but I would like to see direct Iranian-American negotiations leading to understandings so that we don't have these issues every other day," the UAE president's adviser Anwar Gargash told a panel at the World Governments Summit in Dubai.

U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi will meet in Istanbul in an effort to revive diplomacy over a long-running dispute about Iran's nuclear programme and dispel fears of a new regional war. A regional diplomat said representatives from countries such as Saudi Arabia and Egypt would also participate.

The U.S. naval buildup near Iran follows a violent crackdown against anti-government demonstrations last month.

Trump, who stopped short of carrying out threats to intervene, has since demanded Tehran make nuclear concessions and sent a flotilla to its coast. He said last week Iran was "seriously talking", while Tehran's top security official Ali Larijani said arrangements for negotiations were under way.

Iran’s leadership is increasingly worried a U.S. strike could break its grip on power by driving an already enraged public back onto the streets, according to six current and former officials.

In high-level meetings, officials told Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei that public anger over last month's crackdown - the bloodiest since the 1979 Islamic Revolution-- has reached a point where fear is no longer a deterrent , four current officials briefed on the discussions said.

Iranian sources told Reuters last week that Trump had demanded three conditions for resumption of talks: Zero enrichment of uranium in Iran, limits on Tehran's ballistic missile programme and ending its support for regional proxies.

Iran has long rejected all three demands as unacceptable infringements of its sovereignty, but two Iranian officials told Reuters its clerical rulers saw the ballistic missile programme, rather than uranium enrichment, as the bigger obstacle.

Tehran's regional sway has been weakened by Israel's attacks on its proxies - from Hamas in Gaza to Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen and militias in Iraq - as well as by the ousting of Iran's close ally, former Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

In June last year the United States struck Iranian nuclear targets , joining in at the close of a 12-day Israeli bombing campaign. Since then, Tehran has said its uranium enrichment work has stopped.

Recent satellite imagery of two of the targeted sites, Isfahan and Natanz, appears to show some repair work since December, with new roofing over two previously destroyed buildings. No other rebuilding was visible, according to the imagery provided by Planet Labs and reviewed by Reuters.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 10:41:17 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KQW4J4IZ4JPCFA4XU24M2GTG5M.jpg?auth=53de3ac8191085788961bd5a0f48c9f842113c79e46782fb50e3a5b17222ce65&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Tunisia upholds and increases jail terms for opponents and security officials</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/tunisia-upholds-increases-jail-terms-opponents-security-officials-2026-02-03/</link><description>TUNIS, Feb 3 (Reuters) - A Tunisian appeal court on Tuesday upheld and increased lengthy prison sentences on high-profile politicians, including opposition leader Rached Ghannouchi and former security officials, as part of a crackdown on dissent.

Among those sentenced on charges of conspiring against the state in the mass trial were Nadia Akacha, the former chief of staff to President Kais Saied.

Akacha, who was sentenced in absentia after fleeing abroad, received a 35-year jail term, TAP state news agency said.

Rached Ghannouchi, 84, veteran head of the Islamist-leaning Ennahda party, was handed an increased 20-year prison sentence, up from the previous 14-year term.

Ghannouchi, who was speaker of the elected parliament dissolved by Saied in 2021, has been in prison since 2023. With this new sentence, the total sentences against him on several charges rise to 50 years.

A total of 21 were charged in the conspiracy case, with 10 already in custody and 11 having fled the country.

The court upheld 35-year sentences against former intelligence chief Kamel Guizani, former foreign minister Rafik Abdessalem, and Mouadh Ghannouchi, the son of Rached Ghannouchi. All three are outside the country.

The accused deny the charges, arguing that the case has been politically fabricated to silence Saied's opponents.

Most opposition leaders, some journalists and critics of Saied, have been imprisoned since he seized control of most powers in 2021.

Saied dissolved parliament in 2021 and began ruling by decree, then dissolved the independent Supreme Judicial Council and sacked dozens of judges, a move that opposition figures called a coup which undermined the nascent democracy that in 2011 sparked the Arab Spring uprisings.

Saied rejects the accusations and says his steps are legal and aim to end years of chaos and corruption within the political elite.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 10:41:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BZWI4CJLFVKO7A5E2L6O6BVEUY.jpg?auth=e9e6b41272547a8a252ebc02963c4bbd36a1b747fcbe98be31e21c759670ae5e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>NATO's Rutte to meet Zelenskiy in Kyiv, FT says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/natos-rutte-meet-zelenskiy-kyiv-ft-says-2026-02-03/</link><description>Feb 3 (Reuters) - NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has arrived in Kyiv and will meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, a Financial Times correspondent said in a post on X.

The boy, named in local media as Austin Appelbee , made it across four kilometres of ocean to raise the alarm.

He had gone out kayaking and paddle-boarding on the water Friday afternoon with his family.

But the waves soon grew, flipping their boards and filling their kayak with water as they were dragged further out into the ocean.

"I was really scared," the young teen told reporters.

"I was just thinking in my head, like thinking I was going to make it through. But I was also thinking about all my friends at school, and friends at my Christian youth," he said.

"I just said: 'Alright, not today, not today, not today. I have to keep on going'."

The youngster said he started heading for shore with just his life jacket but later abandoned it to swim unencumbered.

"I was very puffed out, but I couldn't feel how tired I was."

The boy said he was trying to think of happy things, at one point singing the "Thomas the Tank Engine" theme song.

"At this time, you know, the waves are massive, and I have no life jacket on. So anyway, I just keep swimming. I do breaststroke. I do freestyle. Survival backstroke."

When he reached the beach, the teen said he called emergency services and asked them to deploy boats, helicopters and planes.

"My family is out at sea," he told them.

Marine rescue volunteer Paul Bresland said the teen's four-hour swim saved his family.

A search helicopter found his mother and two children wearing life jackets and clinging to a paddleboard at 8:30pm, police said. They had drifted 14 kilometres from the tourist town of Quindalup after spending up to 10 hours in the water.

"He swam, he reckons, the first two hours with a life jacket on," Bresland told national broadcaster ABC.

"And the brave fella thought he's not going to make it with a life jacket on, so he ditched it, and he swam the next two hours without a life jacket.

"I thought, mate, that is incredible," said Bresland, describing the boy's efforts as "superhuman".

Police inspector James Bradley said the boy's actions "cannot be praised highly enough".

"His determination and courage ultimately saved the lives of his mother and siblings," he told the ABC.

The boy's mother, named in local media as Joanne, has also been praised for keeping her family alive during hours out at sea with her other son, 12-year-old Beau, and eight-year-old daughter Grace.

"It seemed nice and calm to begin with," the mother told reporters.

"One of the hardest decisions I've ever had to make was to say to Austin: 'Try and get to shore and get some help, this could get really serious really quickly'," the mother was quoted as saying.

"As the sun went down I thought: 'Something's gone terribly wrong here', and my fear was that Austin didn't make it," she said.

"Everything goes through your head."</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 10:41:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/a9f26f36-00e8-11f1-9acd-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26034352526728.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Paris prosecutor's cybercrime unit raids X’s French office</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260203-paris-prosecutor-s-cybercrime-unit-raids-x-s-french-office</link><description>The ⁠Paris prosecutor's office said a search was under way at the French offices of ​Elon Musk's social media network ‍X on Tuesday as part of an ​investigation opened in January 2025 .

Trump, who has voiced a desire for American dominance over all of Latin America, has in recent months had an up-and-down relationship with Petro, a former anti-imperialist guerrilla who was elected Colombia's president in 2022.

In October, Trump called Petro an " illegal drug leader " though he provided no evidence, and in January, he floated military action against the longtime ally, which he has accused of failing to control the narcotics trade.

Petro, for his part, has been harshly critical of the U.S. president. He has said the Trump administration's deadly strikes on alleged drug boats amount to war crimes, and he described the U.S. operation last month deposing Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro as a "kidnapping."

In January, the two leaders held a phone call that both described positively, a surprise thaw that resulted in Petro's invitation to Washington. Trump told reporters on Monday that Petro's tone had changed of late, implying that he had become more acquiescent after the Maduro raid.

"We're gonna have a good meeting," Trump said.

Still, if the two men have anything in common, it is that they behave unpredictably, speak elliptically and change opinions quickly. One Colombian source acknowledged that the meeting could be "tense" given the sometimes stubborn personalities of the two presidents.

At the Tuesday meeting, Colombian officials plan to deliver a detailed presentation on their main anti-drug achievements, including cocaine seizure figures, said three sources with knowledge of the matter.

Will Freeman, fellow for Latin America studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, said the meeting could go smoothly if Petro sticks to discussing counternarcotics matters, rather than broader philosophical disagreements.

"But everything we know about both presidents' personalities suggests that's not going to happen," he said.

If the two leaders fail to reach a more lasting rapprochement, it could have profound implications for regional security, analysts said.

Colombia is the world's top producer of coca, the main ingredient in cocaine, and hosts several U.S.-designated terrorist organizations. But it has also been one of Washington's staunchest allies in the region, working closely with successive administrations to suppress drug flows northward.

Under Petro, coca production in Colombia has climbed, though the exact figures are a matter of dispute. Bogota argues that while the government has shifted away from forced eradication - a policy that can harm subsistence farmers - it has ramped up seizures and more sophisticated interdiction efforts.

For foreign leaders, meetings with Trump can be fraught, and many have resorted to flattery to minimize tension with the president and his advisers.

It was far from clear, however, that Petro - who has positioned himself as a thorn in Washington's side for almost all of his career - will choose that route.

Last week, he urged Colombian migrants to return from Chile, Argentina and the United States so as not to be treated like "slaves." He also said it is better to live in Havana than in Miami, which he described as traffic-clogged and cultureless.

Colombia has requested the meeting be held in private, a Colombian official said. But Trump, who is famously media-hungry, often asks reporters to enter the Oval Office at the last minute.

Petro himself has struck an upbeat if lofty tone.

"I think we should fill ourselves with optimism," Petro told public television station RTVC before departing for Washington. "I'll be expecting you on Tuesday, when I am meeting with the president, to be in all the public squares, to build the chain of affection, the certainty of love."</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 11:35:52 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/N2V23VGRIZJSJJXKV4U2UYRRX4.jpg?auth=814e195bd49b35707e9f3a5587f06129c1434e6a84d25225f5e3903d342b3251&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China to ban 'hidden' car door handles to address safety fears</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/china-ban-hidden-car-door-handles-address-safety-fears-2026-02-03/</link><description>BEIJING, Feb 3 (Reuters) - China will ban 'hidden' car door handles from 2027, becoming the first country to phase out a design pioneered by Tesla (TSLA.O) , opens new tab and adopted by Chinese competitors including Xiaomi (1810.HK) , opens new tab .

The hidden handle design, which functions through a key fob or mobile phone or by manually pressing it, has drawn scrutiny in both the United States and China over potential safety risks.

Last year, the U.S. auto safety agency opened a defect probe into Tesla Model 3 sedan's emergency door release controls. Tesla, which did not comment on the investigation at the time, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.

China's industry ministry said on Monday that under its new safety technical requirements, every car door should be equipped with both exterior and interior handles.

Mechanical release designs will be mandatory, with innovations such as electrical handles optional.

China's new policy sets out rules for where handles must be located on the outside of a car and how they should function to ensure that they can be opened in the event of an accident. It also requires interior handles to be clearly visible.

New vehicle models must align their door handle design with the new regulation from January 1, 2027 while approved models will come under the rules by January 1, 2029, the ministry said.

Chinese state media reported in October that the driver of a Xiaomi SU7 Ultra sedan died in an accident after passers-by were unable to open the door to pull him out of the burning vehicle.

Xiaomi, which has not commented publicly on the incident, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 11:36:03 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LLUV7BCNUFPKXAXRNFUXQ6C4R4.jpg?auth=ad5747dd77d44ba679c1d292f5b5631b88a4f4b6c2940bb6d2715f44ee2549c3&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Greenland foreign minister hopeful to find common ground with US that will respect its red lines</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/greenland-foreign-minister-hopeful-find-common-ground-with-us-that-will-respect-2026-02-03/</link><description>COPENHAGEN, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Greenlandic Foreign Minister Vivian Motzfeldt said on Tuesday that she was hopeful and optimistic that the Arctic island would find common ground with the United States that respected its red lines .

"It was the first medical evacuation through this route since sometime in 2025," he said referring to a limited number of evacuations during an early 2025 ceasefire.

Over 18,500 patients are awaiting evacuations after the two-year war, he said, with trauma injuries from the war as well as chronic conditions such as cancer and diabetes.

A UNICEF spokesperson said that more than 3,000 of them were children. Gaza health authorities are choosing whom to prioritise among the sick and wounded, Lindmeier said.

In the long-planned vote, 141 of parliament's 169 members supported the continuation of the monarchy, while 26 members cast ballots in favour of ending the reign of King Harald and his descendants, according to the official tally.

Supporters of the monarchy say the institution brings stability by being above partisan politics and that it has served Norway well since independence from Sweden in 1905.

Republican proponents argue that political power already rests with Norway's elected parliament and the government, adding that the inherited privilege of the royals does not belong in a democratic society.

"The sponsors seek to amend the constitution so that Norway's head of state is elected by the people, that is, a president," read the now-failed proposal from a group of seven members of parliament representing parties from across the political spectrum.

Still, Crown Princess Mette-Marit was criticised by the prime minister on Monday who said she had displayed poor judgement in having contacts with Jeffrey Epstein , following fresh reports of her ties with the late U.S. sex offender.

On Saturday, Mette-Marit, the spouse of the heir to the throne, Haakon, apologised for the contact, which occurred in the years after Epstein was found guilty of child sex crimes in 2008.

An opinion poll conducted on Monday for Norwegian daily Verdens Gang found that 61% of Norwegians favour keeping their royals in place, down from 72% last year, while support for a republic rose 10 percentage points to 27%, the survey released on Tuesday showed.

Asked whether Mette-Marit should become Norway's next queen, 44% said no while only 33% said yes, while the rest did not express an opinion, the survey of 1,014 respondents by polling institute InFact showed.

Separately on Tuesday, Mette-Marit's son from a previous relationship, Marius Hoiby, 29, went on trial . He has been accused of rape, domestic violence, assault and drug possession. He was arrested again at the weekend on suspicion of further crimes.

Hoiby has denied the most serious accusations against him, including those of rape and domestic violence, while admitting to some lesser charges.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 11:37:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/AMXTCUICZVJP7OQ5ZFX6UOWXE4.jpg?auth=ce010ea1c09c43572075b39600019df4b2787ae3f8928b015bfe253595cdb512&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Why are French prosecutors investigating Elon Musk's X?</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/technology/why-are-french-prosecutors-investigating-elon-musks-x-2026-02-03/</link><description>PARIS, Feb 3 (Reuters) - French prosecutors said on Tuesday they were widening an investigation into Elon Musk's social media platform X and that they have summoned the tech billionaire for questioning in April.

The UKMTO said it is investigating the incident, which happened in the inbound Traffic Separation Scheme of the Strait of Hormuz.

Numerous small armed vessels attempted to contact the vessel via VHF radio, but it ignored requests to stop and continued on its planned route, the agency said.

The strait links the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea beyond.

OPEC members Saudi Arabia, Iran, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Iraq export most of their crude via the strait, mainly to Asia.

Three vessels, two in 2023 and one in 2024, were seized by Iran near or in the strait.

Here are some reactions from governments and regulators since the start of January as well as xAI's response:

The European Commission on January 26 opened an investigation into whether Grok disseminates illegal content such as manipulated sexualised images in the EU. The probe will examine whether X assesses and mitigates risks as required under the bloc's digital rules.

Britain's media regulator Ofcom has launched an investigation to determine whether sexually intimate deepfakes produced by Grok violated its duty to protect people in the UK from potentially illegal content, under the Online Safety Act.

The Information Commissioner's Office - Britain's privacy watchdog - launched its own investigation on February 3, saying the reported creation of the sexualised images, including of children, raised serious concerns under UK data protection law.

Paris prosecutor's cybercrime unit raided X's office in Paris on February 3 and ordered Musk to face questions in April regarding a widening investigation over alleged algorithmic bias, complicity in the detention and diffusion of images of child‑pornographic nature and the violation of a person’s image rights with sexually explicit deepfakes.

Germany's media minister said EU rules provided tools to tackle illegal content and alleged the problem risked turning into the "industrialisation of sexual harassment."

Italy's data protection authority warned that using AI tools to create "undressed" deepfake imagery of real people without consent could amount to serious privacy violations or criminal offences.

Swedish political leaders condemned Grok-generated sexualised content after reporting that imagery involving Sweden's deputy prime minister was produced from a user prompt.

India's IT ministry sent X a formal notice on January 2 over alleged Grok-enabled creation or sharing of obscene sexualised images, directing that the content be taken down and requiring a report on actions being taken within 72 hours.

Japan also probed X over Grok, stating that the government would consider every option to prevent the generation of inappropriate images.

Indonesia said it had blocked access to Grok, a move meant to protect women and children from AI-generated fake pornographic content, citing the country's strict anti‑pornography laws.

Malaysia restored access to Grok in January for its users after X implemented additional safety measures.

The Philippines will reinstate access to Grok after its developer pledged to remove image-manipulation tools that had sparked child-safety concerns, the country's cybercrime investigation unit said in January.

California's governor and attorney general said on January 14 they were demanding answers from xAI amid the spread of non-consensual sexual images on the platform.

Canada's privacy watchdog said it was widening an existing investigation into X after reports that Grok was generating non-consensual, sexually explicit deepfakes.

Brazil's government and federal prosecutors gave xAI 30 days to prevent the chatbot from spreading fake sexualised content.

Australia's regulator eSafety said in January it was investigating Grok-generated sexualised deepfake images, assessing adult material under its image‑based abuse scheme and noting that child-related examples it had reviewed did not meet the legal threshold for child sexual abuse material under Australian law.

HOW HAS xAI RESPONDED?

xAI said on January 14 it had restricted image editing for Grok AI users and blocked users, based on their location, from generating images of people in revealing clothing in "jurisdictions where it's illegal." It did not identify the countries.

It had earlier limited the use of Grok's image generation and editing features only to paying subscribers.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 13:04:17 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/YDM7ZFTLJJI5LHSR4QJR6TOHHY.jpg?auth=39c4516da4f7542d06b530b413e5dfb1bc77949b544c232b9c0c94ce5cd253de&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Top EU diplomat to visit Kyrgyzstan for talks on sanctions</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/top-eu-diplomat-visit-kyrgyzstan-talks-sanctions-2026-02-03/</link><description>BISHKEK, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Kyrgyzstan said on Tuesday the European Union's sanctions envoy would visit on February 26 after a report that the EU was planning to ban some exports to the Central Asian country for allegedly facilitating Russian sanctions evasion.

Bloomberg News reported last week that the EU was considering the first use of its "last resort" anti-sanctions evasion tool by banning exports of certain categories of goods to Kyrgyzstan.

In a statement, Kyrgyzstan's government said Deputy Prime Minister Daniyar Amangeldiev held a video call with EU envoy David O'Sullivan on Tuesday and they agreed on "constructive and substantive dialogue on sanctions-related issues".

It said further talks would take place during O'Sullivan's visit to Bishkek later this month.

A mountainous country of 7 million people, Kyrgyzstan has enjoyed rapid economic growth in recent years, partly by becoming a main clearinghouse for trade with Russia redirected by Western sanctions imposed on Moscow over its war in Ukraine.

Several Kyrgyz bank and cryptocurrency firms have come under U.S., EU and British sanctions for allegedly facilitating illicit trade with Russia.

Kyrgyzstan, a former Soviet republic, continues to host Russian military bases and is in a customs union with Russia, where many of its citizens work as migrant labourers.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 14:26:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Syrian security convoy heads to key Kurdish city under US-backed deal</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/syrian-security-convoy-heads-key-kurdish-city-under-us-backed-deal-2026-02-03/</link><description>Feb 3 (Reuters) - Syrian government security forces moved towards the Kurdish-controlled northeastern city of Qamishli on Tuesday, security sources and witnesses said, as they implement a U.S.-backed deal to bring Kurdish-run regions under the control of Damascus.

The deal, declared on Friday , staved off the prospect of further confrontation between Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa's government and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, which lost swathes of eastern and northern Syria to government troops in January.

The government forces are expected to be stationed in several Syrian state buildings in Qamishli and also at the city's airport, a Syrian official and a Kurdish security source told Reuters ahead of the deployment.

Reuters witnesses said dozens of villagers obstructed a convoy of security forces as it approached the outskirts of the city, the de facto political centre of the Kurdish-led administration.

On Tuesday, interior ministry vehicles entered the ethnically-mixed city of Hasakah, about 80km (47 miles) south of Qamishli.

Friday's accord foresees a phased integration of Kurdish fighters with government forces. The United States has hailed the agreement as a historic milestone towards unity and reconciliation after 14 years of civil war in Syria.

The SDF was once Washington's main Syrian ally, playing a vital part in the fight against Islamic State militants.

But its status weakened as U.S. President Donald Trump built ties with Sharaa, a former al Qaeda commander who has now brought almost all of Syria back under the authority of Damascus.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 14:27:04 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/H3WRKXRT65NKHM5QCIJ5VY3SNE.jpg?auth=62421b72e45f827feb915ba81c10ea32be20c812d30694fee8b25ab0bcdcef1f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Greece to soon announce social media ban for children under 15, government source says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/society-equity/greece-soon-announce-social-media-ban-children-under-15-government-source-says-2026-02-03/</link><description>ATHENS, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Greece is "very close" to announcing a social media ban for children aged under 15, a senior government source told Reuters on Tuesday.

"Russian investment in their Northern Fleet, and in particular, in their subsurface capabilities, is undiminished," General Gwyn Jenkins, First Sea Lord of the Royal Navy, told French think tank IFRI's naval conference in Paris.

"Despite the horrendous cost in terms of national resource and blood to Russia, of their egregious invasion of Ukraine, they have continued to pump resource into their Northern Fleet and their subsurface capabilities," he said.

Jenkins, who was speaking alongside top navy chiefs from the United States, France, Italy and the Netherlands, said Russia's activity was testing Western capabilities, given how long it took to upgrade, build and develop new vessels in a fast-changing technological environment.

"It doesn't take many assets to fix us as allies, because we have a very low risk tolerance of allowing a aggressive actor operating in our backyard, and that does take a lot of resource to respond to," Jenkins said.

Vice-Admiral Harold Liebregs, commander of the Royal Netherlands Navy echoed Jenkins' comments saying Russia was being increasingly emboldened in the North Sea and loitering over vital infrastructure, possibly preparing further actions.

"We see ships operating drones that fly over our territory, and we see the shadow fleet, or Dark Fleet, that's fueling the Russian war economy, using ships that are ill maintained, not insured, and posing all kinds of liability issues in our precious North Sea," he said.

"I think the main point here is that we should not accept this as the new normal, because it pushes us back in a position where we have less freedom to manoeuvre, and that creates a less suitable strategic position."</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 14:30:08 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/M2JZHKKNCNI5ZIKYZ22YY74N2E.jpg?auth=19147dbe047f0d08df81c7f5de6f6956bde3e6044839d99d46742e0523495c5f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Snow causes delays, some cancellations at Frankfurt airport</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/snow-causes-delays-some-cancellations-frankfurt-airport-2026-02-03/</link><description>FRANKFURT, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Passengers at Frankfurt airport face delays and isolated flight cancellations on Tuesday due to heavy snowfall, operator Fraport (FRAG.DE) , opens new tab said.

Iran and the United States will discuss Iran's nuclear programme on Friday in Turkey, Iranian and U.S. officials told Reuters on Monday. U.S. President Donald Trump said that with big U.S. warships heading to Iran, "bad things" would probably happen if a deal could not be reached.

A source familiar with the situation said on Tuesday that Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner would take part in the talks, along with U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Kushner's plans. Ministers from other countries in the region are also expected to attend.

An Iranian diplomatic source said Tehran's view of the talks is neither optimistic nor pessimistic, adding that the Islamic Republic's defensive capabilities are non-negotiable and that it is ready for any scenario.

"It remains to be seen whether the United States also intends to conduct serious, result-oriented negotiations or not," the source said.

Iranian sources have said Trump is also seeking to limit Iran's ballistic missile programme, which Iranian officials say is an essential component of the country's defence.

Earlier the UAE, a highly influential Gulf Arab oil producer and close U.S. ally, said the region cannot afford another conflict.

"I think that the region has gone through various calamitous confrontations," the UAE president's adviser Anwar Gargash told a panel at the World Governments Summit in Dubai.

"I don't think we need another one, but I would like to see direct Iranian-American negotiations leading to understandings so that we don't have these issues every other day."

Iran should rebuild its relationship with Washington to reach a wider geo-strategic deal which could help Tehran repair its economy ravaged by U.S. sanctions, Gargash said.

Gulf Arab states are worried that Iran will carry out its threat to target U.S. bases on their territory should Trump attack the Islamic Republic again.

In June, the United States struck Iranian nuclear targets, joining in at the close of a 12-day Israeli bombing campaign. Since then, Tehran has said its uranium enrichment work - which it says is for peaceful, not military purposes - has stopped.

Recent satellite imagery of two of the targeted sites, Isfahan and Natanz, appears to show new roofing over two destroyed buildings but no other signs of rebuilding, according to the imagery provided by Planet Labs and reviewed by Reuters.

The meeting in Istanbul aims to revive diplomacy over the long-running dispute about Iran's nuclear programme and dispel fears of a new regional war.

The U.S. naval buildup near Iran follows a violent crackdown against anti-government demonstrations last month.

Trump, who stopped short of carrying out threats to intervene, has since demanded nuclear concessions from Iran and sent a flotilla to its coast. He said last week Iran was "seriously talking", while Tehran's top security official Ali Larijani said arrangements for negotiations were under way.

The priority of the Istanbul talks is to avoid conflict and de-escalate tension, a regional official told Reuters. Regional powers including Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Egypt, Oman, and the United Arab Emirates were also invited, he said.

Iran’s leadership is increasingly worried a U.S. strike could break its grip on power by driving an already enraged public back onto the streets, according to six current and former officials.

Officials told Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei that public anger over last month's crackdown - the bloodiest since the 1979 Islamic Revolution-- has reached a point where fear is no longer a deterrent , four current officials briefed on the discussions said.

Iranian sources told Reuters last week that Trump had demanded three conditions for resumption of talks: Zero enrichment of uranium in Iran, limits on Tehran's ballistic missile programme and ending its support for regional proxies.

Iran has long said all three demands are unacceptable infringements of its sovereignty, but two Iranian officials told Reuters its clerical rulers saw the ballistic missile programme, rather than uranium enrichment, as the bigger obstacle.

One Iranian official said: "Diplomacy is ongoing. For talks to resume, Iran says there should not be preconditions and that it is ready to show flexibility on uranium enrichment, including handing over 400 kg of highly enriched uranium (HEU), accepting zero enrichment under a consortium arrangement as a solution."

Tehran's regional sway has been weakened by Israel's attacks on its proxies - from Hamas in Gaza to Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen and militias in Iraq - as well as by the ousting of Iran's close ally, former Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 16:12:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KQW4J4IZ4JPCFA4XU24M2GTG5M.jpg?auth=53de3ac8191085788961bd5a0f48c9f842113c79e46782fb50e3a5b17222ce65&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>French prosecutors seek public office bans in Le Pen appeals trial</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/french-prosecutors-seek-public-office-bans-le-pen-appeals-trial-2026-02-03/</link><description>PARIS, Feb 3 (Reuters) - French prosecutors urged an appeals court on Tuesday to largely confirm a previous court's ruling against French far-right officials in an EU embezzlement trial, without saying yet how this will apply to longtime party chief Marine Le Pen .

The initial ruling, in March last year, was a major setback for Le Pen as it banned her from running for office for five years, effective immediately.

If that ruling is fully confirmed, Le Pen will not be able to run in next year's presidential election. If the ban is substantially shorter, or if there is no ban, she could still take part.

In last year's ruling the court said that Le Pen had been "at the heart" of a scheme to misappropriate more than 4 million euros of EU funds and use them to pay the far-right party's staff back home.

Le Pen told the court in her appeals trial that she had no sense of having done anything wrong, and had appealed against the ruling along with others from her party.

The prosecutor's office wants public office bans to be decided this time too, Thierry Ramonatxo, Advocate General at the Paris General Prosecutor’s Office told the appeals court.

"We will seek office bans," he said. "Parliamentary assistants worked for the party but were paid by Europe. That's the stark reality."

The prosecutors are expected to specify later in the day what sentences they will seek for each of the defendants, including Le Pen, with the ruling expected in the coming weeks or months.

In last year's ruling, Le Pen also received a four-year prison sentence - two years of which are suspended and two years of which are to be served under home detention, as well as a 100,000-euro fine. These were not enforced immediately.

The RN and two dozen party figures were also found guilty of diverting European Parliament funds.

Le Pen has run three times for president.

If she cannot run next year, party president Jordan Bardella looks set to become the RN's candidate.

Bardella, 30, has helped expand the RN's appeal among younger voters though some analysts question whether he has the experience to win over the broader electorate the RN needs to secure victory in 2027.

The appeals court ruling is also subject to appeal though France's highest court, the Cour de Cassation.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 16:12:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/TBAPSQV5B5NPNBYSLKGUAZSGTM.jpg?auth=f2763ce51c15d570763edba845197ebe0d6c59f1aee53dab798d4243b613b716&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Exclusive: Somaliland expects Israel trade deal, has minerals to offer, leader says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/somaliland-expects-israel-trade-deal-has-minerals-offer-leader-says-2026-02-03/</link><description>JERUSALEM, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Somaliland expects to reach a trade agreement soon with Israel, the first country to recognise its independence, and is willing to offer rights to valuable mineral deposits as part of a deal, its leader said in an interview with Reuters.

Israel in late December became the first country to recognise the Republic of Somaliland, a northeastern part of Somalia that has claimed independence for decades. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel would seek immediate cooperation in agriculture, health, technology and the economy.

Speaking to Reuters via video link from Dubai where he was attending the World Government Summit, Somaliland President Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi said no bilateral economic deal with Israel had yet been reached, but Somaliland expected to sign "a partnership agreement".

"At the moment, there is no trade, and there is no investment from Israel. But we are hoping 100% (for) their investment, their trade, and hopefully we will engage with the business people and the government of Israel soon," he said.

"Somaliland is a very rich country in resources - minerals, oil, gas, marine, in agriculture, energy and other sectors.... We have meat, we have fish, we have minerals and they (Israel) need them. So trade can start from these main sectors," he said. "The sky is the limit."

He said in return Somaliland would seek access to Israeli technology.

Somaliland says its mineral resources include vast reserves of lithium, critical for batteries and electric vehicles. In 2024 the Saudi Mining Company Kilomass secured an exploration deal there for lithium and other critical minerals.

Abdullahi said he was grateful to Israel for being first to recognise Somaliland. While Somaliland also hopes for future military cooperation with Israel, he said establishing Israeli military bases had not been discussed.

He said he had accepted an invitation from Netanyahu and would visit Israel soon, but no date had yet been set. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar visited Somaliland a month ago.

Abdullahi said he expects all United Nations countries eventually to follow Israel's lead, including the United Arab Emirates and the United States, though he said it was normal for recognition to take time.

He said he had a good working relationship with the U.S. and believes President Donald Trump will "someday" recognise Somaliland. Last month, he pitched investment deals at a dinner in Davos attended by Trump's son Eric .

Israel's decision to recognise Somaliland has drawn an angry response from Somalia, and has also been criticised by China, Turkey, Egypt and the African Union.

Somaliland also cooperates with the UAE, with DP World a big investor in the Berbera port. The UAE has "not decided officially yet but they are just one of the countries we expect to recognise Somaliland," Abdullahi said.

"An objective and thorough investigation of the circumstances of doubtful legality as well as international legal cooperation is only possible if a pre-trial investigation is launched," Lithuania's prosecutor general's office said in a statement, without naming any suspects or specific crimes.

Earlier on Tuesday, President Gitanas Nauseda called for a principled law enforcement investigation into the case.

Lithuanian media have reported that the names of several Lithuanian models and arts figures are reported in the files, published last week by the U.S. Justice Department.

Several performers have announced a boycott of an arts festival, Midsummer Vilnius, whose promoter, Valdas Petreikis, is mentioned in the files as having received payments from Epstein.

Petreikis has said he was unaware of Epstein's crimes at the time of their acquaintance, denies wrongdoing and is withdrawing from promoting arts events due to the public backlash.

Lithuanian police and prosecutors are currently assessing publicly released information, analysing the legal framework and exchanging information with partners, the prosecutor general's office said.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 17:29:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia's Putin and Saudi crown prince discuss work of OPEC+, Kremlin says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/russias-putin-saudi-crown-prince-discuss-work-opec-kremlin-says-2026-02-03/</link><description>MOSCOW, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin held a phone call with Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the Kremlin said on Tuesday, saying they had agreed to deepen cooperation in the political, economic, trade and humanitarian spheres.

The accused, a 37-year-old Romanian and a 54-year-old Greek, tampered with the vessels by pouring more than 20 kg of steel pellets into an engine block, puncturing freshwater lines, removing fuel tank caps and disabling fuses in the onboard electronics, according to the investigators.

The sabotage was discovered during pre-departure checks as one of the ships, the corvette "Emden", was preparing for its inaugural journey to the port city of Kiel.

The activities could have led to significant damage if left undetected, the prosecutor general's office said, adding that investigations were still ongoing.

The two men were arrested in Hamburg and a village in Greece, with their residences in Hamburg, Romania and Greece searched by authorities.

According to Greek police officials and security sources, the 54-year-old man was arrested in the early morning hours inside his home in northern Greece following a European arrest warrant issued on behalf of Germany.

Among the items confiscated from his home were six mobile phones, three USB sticks, a SIM card and a hard drive, and evidence of 19 bank accounts, officials said.

According to Greek court documents, the arrested men were tasked with painting work on the corvette "Koeln" in June 2025. During the work, they manually shut the control panel, cutting power off on the vessel and risking starting a fire.

Germany's defence ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

A spokesperson for the prosecutor's office in Hamburg declined to say whether authorities suspected Russia of being behind the sabotage.

Political leaders and military officials have accused Russia of engaging in acts of sabotage, espionage, and hybrid warfare since Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

The Kremlin has repeatedly denied such allegations, dismissing them as unsubstantiated.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 17:29:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China warns Panama of 'heavy prices' to pay after CK Hutchison contract quashed</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/china-calls-panama-court-ruling-ck-hutchison-port-contracts-shameful-pathetic-2026-02-03/</link><description>BEIJING, Feb 3 (Reuters) - China warned Panama on Tuesday there would be "heavy prices" to pay after a court ruling there annulled Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison's (0001.HK) , opens new tab contract to operate two ports at the Panama Canal.

China's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office called the ruling by Panama's Supreme Court "absurd," "shameful and pathetic," and vowed to defend the interests of Chinese firms.

Panamanian authorities did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Last week's court ruling annulled a key contract that Panama Ports Company, a CK Hutchison subsidiary, has held since the 1990s to operate container terminals at the canal's Pacific and Atlantic entrances.

The legal decision, which cited constitutional violations and concerns over public interest, was seen as a win for Washington amid intensifying U.S.-China rivalry over the control of global trade routes.

The ruling threatens to disrupt the Hong Kong conglomerate's proposed $23-billion sale of 43 ports in 23 countries, including the two at the Panama Canal, to a consortium led by BlackRock (BLK.N) , opens new tab and Mediterranean Shipping Company.

"The ruling ignored the facts, breached trust, and seriously damaged the legitimate rights and interests of enterprises in Hong Kong, China," the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office said on its social media account.

"China has sufficient means and tools, and sufficient strength and ability to defend a fair and just international economic and trade order," the office said.

If the Panamanian authorities "insist on having their own way ... heavy prices both politically and economically will surely be paid!" it added.

The court decision was welcomed by U.S. authorities. John Moolenaar, chair of the U.S. House Select Committee on China, called it a "win for America."

Without naming the U.S. in the statement, the Chinese office said "some country has ... used bullying tactics to force other countries to obey their will," and that Panama had "willingly succumbed" to hegemonic power.

U.S. President Donald Trump, who initially celebrated the proposed $23-billion ports sale, has called for the U.S. to " take back " the Panama Canal in the face of Chinese influence.

CK Hutchison's subsidiary last week said the ruling was inconsistent with the legal framework that had allowed it to operate the ports.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 17:29:17 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/25SD7DAJEJPL5KLMC5MZJDYYSI.jpg?auth=ccfe4b48180a49ad7c8c31a413e1e5bf6fe016edb0b0646953399fa703d88966&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Sudanese army says it has broken siege of famine-stricken Kadugli</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/sudanese-army-says-it-has-broken-siege-famine-stricken-kadugli-2026-02-03/</link><description>Feb 3 - The Sudanese army said it broke a years-long siege on the city of Kadugli on Tuesday, potentially providing tens of thousands of people a reprieve from famine and signaling a shift in the war's momentum.

The conflict between the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) has displaced millions, drawn in regional powers and caused a vast humanitarian crisis since it broke out in April 2023.

Its latest frontline is the greater Kordofan region , which the RSF began sweeping through after the rainy season ended late last year.

"With God's help and guidance, your Sudanese Armed Forces and supporting forces have succeeded in opening the Kadugli-Dalanj road, after a heroic battle," the army said in a statement.

The RSF did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Kadugli and nearby al-Dalanj had been under siege on and off since the start of the war. There was an escalation in fighting after the SPLM-N, which controls territory in the state and elsewhere, joined forces with the RSF last year.

The army broke the siege of al-Dalanj last week.

In Kadugli the siege caused famine conditions confirmed by a global hunger monitor last year, and in both cities civilians were subjected to devastating drone attacks that have continued since the sieges were broken, residents said.

Jan Egeland, head of Norwegian Refugee Council, said he witnessed "massive, unchecked suffering" among those who fled Kadugli to camps in SPLM-N territory.

"The mothers had one recurrent story," he said in an interview with Reuters on Tuesday. "The drones are hitting their homes that are torched, and the people flee for their lives after having been starved for months," Egeland said.

People fleeing the siege of al-Fashir, which fell to the RSF in October, gave similar accounts.

Few aid agencies remain active in Kadugli or elsewhere in South Kordofan. The siege has driven up prices, according to local aid workers, with a kilo of flour reaching 80,000 Sudanese pounds (about $22).

That has put food out of reach for many, forcing them to eat leaves, while medicine and doctors are scarce, the aid workers said.

According to the United Nations, more than 80% of Kadugli's population, or some 147,000 people, have fled.

The army's advance was aided by a breakdown in the RSF's supply lines from Libya into the Kordofan region, an army source and an SPLM-N source told Reuters.

Reuters reported on Monday that Egypt had deployed drones at an airstrip near its borders with Sudan and Libya, in what experts and officials said was a sign of its deepening involvement in Sudan. Libya's Kufrah airport , a major conduit for RSF supplies, announced on January 16 it would close for one month for renovations, though airport officials denied this was linked to Sudan's war.

Egypt has not acknowledged supporting the army militarily, but has said its national security is directly linked to Sudan's.

The army's advance was largely enabled by drone attacks and by allied armed groups recently recruited from local Nuba tribes, both sources said.

Egeland said that shifts in the war's frontlines had not alleviated civilian suffering, while efforts at a settlement, led by the United States, had failed.

"The peace diplomacy has failed to prevent that armed men, ruthless men, do whatever they want with the civilian population that they first starve and then attack," he said.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 17:29:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/EJ2XUVMQX5PNZIA43VPUKJEZFY.jpg?auth=67624ac3b5a533dc03ad7453d7471a10b11ad8c8691bf46905df64877900322a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UK ex-US ambassador Peter Mandelson quits House of Lords amid Epstein scandal</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260203-uk-ex-us-ambassador-peter-mandelson-quits-house-of-lords-amid-epstein-scandal</link><description>The UK 's former ambassador to the United States, Peter Mandelson , is stepping down as a member of the upper house of parliament, it was announced Tuesday, as a scandal deepened over his ties to late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein .

The veteran Labour politician, former UK government minister and EU trade commissioner had announced he was resigning from the House of Lords as of Wednesday, Speaker Michael Forsyth told members.

"The clerk of the parliaments has today (Tuesday) received notification from Lord Mandelson of his intention to retire from the House, effective from February 4 (Wednesday)," Forsyth said.

The move came shortly after Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Mandelson had "let his country down" after a slew of emails released by US authorities which detailed his cosy ties with the American financier.

Starmer told ministers he was "appalled" at revelations regarding Mandelson that emerged over the weekend, according to a Downing Street readout of a cabinet meeting.

"The alleged passing on of emails of highly sensitive government business was disgraceful," the prime minister said, adding he was not yet "reassured that the totality of information had yet emerged" regarding Mandelson's links with Epstein.

Starmer also said he had asked officials to draft legislation to strip Mandelson of his peerage "as quickly as possible" and made it clear the government "would cooperate" with any police inquiries into the matter.

London's Metropolitan Police said Monday that they were reviewing reports of a possible "misconduct in a public office... to determine if they meet the criminal threshold for investigation".

Starmer has faced mounting criticism of his initial decision to appoint Mandelson as Britain's ambassador to Washington, before sacking him last September, less than a year into his post, over his ties to Epstein.

The Epstein affair is casting a long shadow over Washington and Europe, entangling some of the most prominent names in politics.

The US Justice Department on Friday released what it said would be the final batch of pages, photos and videos from the Epstein files, adding fuel to a political drama that has put pressure on President Donald Trump .

Trump spent months trying to block the disclosure of investigative files linked to Epstein, who moved in elite circles for years, cultivating ties with billionaires, politicians, academics and celebrities.

On Monday, it emerged that former US president Bill Clinton and his wife, Hillary, will testify in a US House investigation into Epstein, heading off a potential vote to hold the couple in contempt.

Neither Trump nor the Clintons have been accused of criminal wrongdoing related to Epstein's activities.

Meanwhile, the European Commission said Tuesday it will look into whether Mandelson, who served as the EU's trade chief between 2004 and 2008, broke its code of conduct over his Epstein ties.

Mandelson – a back-room architect of Labour's revival as an electoral force in the 1990s under Tony Blair – quit the party on Sunday to avoid causing it "further embarrassment" from the slew of revelations.

Bank records released on Friday by the US authorities suggested that in 2009, Mandelson, who was then business secretary, forwarded an economic briefing to Epstein intended for then-leader Gordon Brown , captioning it: "Interesting note that's gone to the PM."

Epstein also appeared to have transferred a total of $75,000 (£55,000) in three payments to accounts linked to the top Labour politician between 2003 and 2004.

Mandelson, 72, told the BBC on Sunday he had no memory of the money transfers and did not know whether the documents were authentic.

His comments were "gobsmacking" and caused the public "to lose faith in all politicians", Starmer told his cabinet.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 17:29:33 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/2fec1944-011f-11f1-aeea-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26033470028233.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Digital sovereignty (2/3): Can Europe’s businesses survive without US Big Tech?</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/technology/20260203-digital-sovereignty-can-european-businesses-survive-without-us-big-tech</link><description>When a German business lobby asked IT executives how they would fare without access to US technology, their reply offered a sobering reality check for champions of European autonomy .

More than 95% said they wouldn’t survive two years if the United States cut off access to its digital technologies and services, according to the survey carried out last year by Bitkom, Germany’s largest digital industry association.

Compared with earlier surveys, Bitkom’s findings pointed to growing pessimism about the resilience of German businesses at a time of heightened tensions between the Trump administration and Europe.

There is widespread fear that Europe’s businesses could end up as collateral damage in the event of a deeper transatlantic fallout, says Bertrand Trastour, global sales director for Stormshield, an Airbus subsidiary specialising in sovereign cybersecurity solutions.

“It's clearly on people’s minds,” Trastour acknowledges. “I’m using an American smartphone as we speak. What would we do without it? We don't have any viable alternatives in Europe for certain types of equipment.”

According to the Bitkom survey, an abrupt shortage of high-tech gear from the likes of Apple or Google is a key concern voiced by German business, for whom coping without US-made smartphones, laptops or tablets is inconceivable.

It's not just the American hardware that Europe’s businesses depend on. “One wonders what would happen if US software publishers were to suspend the licences they provide for European companies,” Trastour says.

Without access to customer relationship management (CRM) tools provided by California-based Salesforce, for instance, many factories in Europe would be forced to drastically scale back their operations, resulting in layoffs.

Washington could also choose to place export controls on certain advanced technologies, mirroring steps already taken to curb the rise of China’s AI industry.

Limiting chip exports to Europe would significantly curtail research and development on the continent, warns Christophe Grosbost, chief strategy officer at the Innovation Makers Alliance.

“We are very dependent on GPUs, the graphics chips sold mainly by Nvidia, which are used to run the data centres where information is stored to train AI models,” Grosbost explains.

But European companies are not entirely helpless, says Trastour, whose company provides cybersecurity solutions that are strictly “French- or European-made".

“The goal is to build technological autonomy,” Trastour explains. “We cannot completely wean off US tech, but by using European functional building blocks [software that performs specific functions] we can come up with a technological mix that offers a degree of resilience.”

Experts point to an abundance of European tools and services , many of which remain little-known.

Jitsi, a collaborative communication tool developed by Bulgaria's Emil Ivov, is touted as an alternative to Microsoft Teams. European cloud providers like France's OVH and Switzerland's Infomaniak have emerged as viable competitors to larger North American firms.

The French government announced in late January that its 2.5 million civil servants will stop using Zoom, Microsoft Teams and others by 2027 in favour of Visio, a homegrown videoconferencing system.

While the Trump administration once championed “alternative facts”, America's Big Tech firms are no fans of alternatives to their tools and platforms. Competitors are required to fend off accusations of monopoly, but they remain largely invisible, crushed by “the massive marketing budgets that tech giants have been showering on the public for decades”, says Martin Hullin, head of the European Network for Technological Resilience and Sovereignty at the Bertelsmann Foundation, a German think tank.

Yet there is a world beyond Gmail, Word, X, Chrome and Apple. Europe, in particular, is home to “many small companies with very interesting ideas and products that are sometimes of better quality than their American equivalents”, argues Frans Imbert-Vier, CEO of technology consulting firm UBCOM and a key advocate of European technological independence.

The hard part is often finding them. Who, for example, has ever heard of Olvid, a French alternative to WhatsApp and text messaging?

France’s Emmanuel Macron has sought to set an example with his “start-up nation” slogan. His government has developed a whole batch of homegrown digital tools to escape American control, aiming to replace Teams with “Visio”, Google Drive with “Files”, and WeTransfer with “FranceTransfer”.

With strained EU-US relations leading to renewed interest in technological sovereignty, some experts in the field have posted catalogues of alternative solutions online.

For each American software programme, Austrian IT developer Constantin Graf has compiled an almost exhaustive list of European alternatives. The ambitious German project Digital Independence Day is less exhaustive but more educational. Its website offers step-by-step instructions on how to switch, for instance, from PayPal to Wero, a European mobile payment system.

But ditching US tools and systems in favour of European alternatives is far from straightforward, particularly for large companies that operate internationally, warns Francesca Musiani, head of the Internet and Society Centre at France’s National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS).

“Large international firms tend to build their entire productivity frameworks on a stack of highly integrated American 'bricks’ such as the cloud, collaborative tools (like Teams), CRM and AI,” she explains. Removing one “brick” risks destabilising the entire system.

Unlike government agencies, Musiani adds, private companies “cannot always invoke sovereignty or national security to justify choosing alternative solutions that are sometimes more expensive or less efficient in the short term”.

Moreover, the bigger players “tend to be risk-averse and inclined to maintain the status quo” rather than migrate thousands of employees and retrain them on new systems, notes Johan Linaker, a specialist in digital sovereignty and innovation at the Research Institutes of Sweden (RISE). This conservative culture “can be counterproductive” if a rapid shift towards European solutions is required.

Smaller, nimbler companies may be quicker to jump on the technological autonomy bandwagon but would still face a bumpy ride.

“It won't happen overnight and it will require investment in training, research and acquisition,” says Frans Imbert-Vier, CEO of technology consulting firm UBCOM and an advocate of European technological independence.

Pointing to such “invisible costs” of decoupling from American technology, Musiani warns that the process “can lead to errors, frustrations and productivity losses”, in turn resulting in a “loss of competitiveness” – particularly in the face of competition from the US.

Helping to facilitate this transition is where European authorities need to step in, says Imbert-Vier.

“In 2024, the European Union purchased €111 billion worth of American technology,” notes the UBCOM CEO, for whom part of this expenditure could have been “directed towards supporting European innovation” instead.

Martin Hullin, director of the European Network for Technological Resilience and Sovereignty at Germany's Bertelsmann Foundation, warns that sticking with a single service provider – i.e., the United States – is “very short-term thinking” that poses a long-term risk to efficiency.

He argues that companies need the courage to take decisions that might be costly in the short term but will ultimately make them more resilient.

Research published last year by Hullin and other economists concluded that Europe needs to invest around €300 billion over 10 years to establish economic sovereignty in technology.

But a failure to do so could prove even costlier in the long run, experts warn.

While decoupling “carries an economic cost, being too dependent on a monopoly across the Atlantic probably carries a greater one”, argues Trastour.

“It’s a strategic decision and it has to be made now.”

Their journey from Egypt on Monday through the frontier post and across the "yellow line" zone controlled by Israel and an allied Palestinian militia group, involved lengthy delays and the confiscation of gifts including toys, one of the women said.

"It was a journey of horror, humiliation and oppression," said 56-year-old Huda Abu Abed by phone from the tent her family is living in at Khan Younis in southern Gaza .

Her account was supported by that of another woman Reuters interviewed, and by comments from a third woman interviewed on Arab television.

In response to a Reuters request for comment, Israel's military denied its forces had acted inappropriately or mistreated Palestinians crossing into Gaza, without addressing the specific allegations made by the two women interviewed.

About 50 Palestinians had been expected to enter the enclave on Monday but by nightfall only three women and nine children had been let through, Palestinian and Egyptian sources said, with another 38 stuck waiting to clear security.

Of the 50 people waiting to leave Gaza, mostly for medical treatment, only five patients with seven relatives escorting them managed to cross into Egypt on Monday.

Abu Abed said the returnees, who were restricted to a single suitcase each, first encountered problems at the crossing where European border monitors confiscated toys they were taking home as gifts, she said.

She spent a year in Egypt for heart treatment but returned before it was finished because she missed her family. An adult daughter had also travelled to Egypt for medical treatment. An adult son was killed in December 2024 and she was not able to say goodbye to him, she said. Two other children are in Gaza.

Once through the crossing and on the Gaza side of the border, the 12 returnees boarded a bus for their journey through the Israeli-controlled zone and across the "yellow line" demarcating Israeli and Hamas-held zones.

A second woman, Sabah al-Raqeb, 41, said the bus, escorted by two four-wheel-drive vehicles, was stopped at a checkpoint manned by Israel-backed Palestinian gunmen who identified themselves as belonging to the Popular Forces, commonly known as the Abu Shabab militia.

The women's family names were read out over a loudspeaker and each was led by two men and a woman from Abu Shabab militia to a security point where Israeli forces were waiting. They were then blindfolded and handcuffed, she and Abu Abed said.

They were asked about their knowledge of Hamas, about the October 7, 2023 attack on Israel that triggered the war, and other issues relating to militancy, the two women said. The Palestinian anti-Hamas gunmen also said they could remain in the Israeli-held zone, Raqeb said.

"The officer asked me why I came back to Gaza. He said it was destroyed. I told him I came back for my children and family," said Raqeb, who has returned to her seven children living in a tent after leaving Gaza two years ago for what she had expected to be a short trip for medical treatment.

Abu Abed said the questioning lasted more than two hours.

In a statement denying any wrongdoing, Israel's military said there were no known incidents of inappropriate conduct, mistreatment, apprehensions or confiscation of property by the Israeli security establishment.

It said there was an "identification and screening process at the 'Regavim' screening facility, which is managed by the security establishment in an area under (Israeli military) control." It said that process followed screening by European personnel as part of a mechanism agreed upon by all parties.

The Rafah crossing, the sole route in or out for nearly all Gaza's more than 2 million inhabitants, has been shut for most of the war. It was meant to be reopened in the first phase of the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas agreed in October.

Rafah, a city of a quarter of a million people, was almost entirely depopulated during the war as Israel told all residents to leave before conducting extensive demolitions that have left it a wasteland of rubble.

The city lies in a security cordon retained by Israel after its troops pulled back to the yellow line in October, and where the Popular Forces are also operating.

Since the forces' leader, Yasser Abu Shabab, was killed last year they have been led by his deputy, Ghassan Dahine. "The Fifth Unit under my command will play an important security role regarding entry and exit through the Rafah crossing," Israel's Ynet news website quoted Dahine as saying.

Some 20,000 Gazans are hoping to leave for treatment abroad. Despite the slow reopening, many of them said the step brought relief. On Tuesday, 50 Palestinians were expected to cross into Gaza from Egypt, according to an Egyptian source.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 18:29:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/23WWQKWSQZJXDBFH4FB7M7WYSE.jpg?auth=e7534117e395488289915cda3eb769a7f99ffd8a539b5c9b2d925b716294b4b9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>French prosecutors seek 5-year ban from public office for Le Pen in appeal trial</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/french-prosecutors-seek-5-year-ban-public-office-le-pen-appeal-trial-2026-02-03/</link><description>PARIS, Feb 3 (Reuters) - French prosecutors on Tuesday requested a four-year prison sentence and a five-year ban from public office for far-right leader Marine Le Pen in her appeal trial over the misuse of European Union funds.

The announcement follows weeks of sometimes violent tumult in Minneapolis, where U.S. President Donald Trump has deployed thousands of armed, masked agents as he tries to deport more migrants than any of his predecessors.

New York Attorney General Letitia James said the state's new legal observers would be volunteer employees from her office, trained to observe, without interfering, whether Trump's immigration enforcement "remains within the bounds of the law."

"I am proud to protect New Yorkers' constitutional rights to speak freely, protest peacefully, and go about their lives without fear of unlawful federal action," James, a Democrat, said in a statement. "We have seen in Minnesota how quickly and tragically federal operations can escalate in the absence of transparency and accountability."

A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which enforces immigration law, did not respond to a request for comment.

Trump, a Republican, has reserved his most aggressive surges in immigration enforcement for states governed by his political opponents, particularly California, Illinois and Minnesota. New York is home to one of the biggest and busiest DHS field offices, but Trump has not announced any major enforcement surge in the state.

He says the deportations of many migrants, including some who were legally admitted into the U.S., are necessary to reduce crime, although his argument is often contradicted by crime data.

In Minneapolis, residents have come out in protest, many blowing whistles and recording video as immigration agents in military-style gear roam the streets. Twice in January, immigration agents fatally shot U.S. citizens who had come out to protest or observe: Renee Good and Alex Pretti.

Minnesota's leaders have accused the Trump administration of going too far and violating the constitutional rights of both migrants and U.S. citizens, including their rights to observe and protest government actions.

In New York, small groups of legal observers are common at street protests, sometimes wearing the bright green hats of the National Lawyers Guild, focused on whether local police are violating rights or laws that protect freedom of speech.

But a formal state-organized effort to deploy legal observers to monitor federal law enforcement appears to be new. James, an outspoken foe of Trump who successfully sued him and his real estate firm for financial fraud, says she will use information gathered by the observers to decide whether to bring legal challenges.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 18:29:26 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/L2A5BZXBYVLLDCEXH6IPJUVLVA.jpg?auth=813565f365dbf6f71a785f9805167b9e240fb2e47f812b32b489dea7d11ce43a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US military says some forces have been dispatched to Nigeria</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/us-military-says-some-forces-have-been-dispatched-nigeria-2026-02-03/</link><description>DAKAR, Feb 3 - The U.S. has sent a small team of troops to Nigeria, the general in charge of the U.S. command for Africa said on Tuesday, the first acknowledgment of U.S. forces on the ground since Washington struck by air on Christmas Day.

President Donald Trump ordered airstrikes on what he described as Islamic State targets in Nigeria in December and said there could be more U.S. military action there.

Reuters earlier reported that the U.S. had been conducting surveillance flights over the country from Ghana since at least late November.

The top general said the U.S. team was sent after both countries agreed that more needed to be done to combat the terrorist threat in West Africa.

"That has led to increased collaboration between our nations to include a small US team that brings some unique capabilities from the United States," General Dagvin R.M. Anderson, head of the U.S. military's Africa Command AFRICOM, told journalists during a press briefing on Tuesday.

Anderson did not provide further details about the size and scope of their mission.

Defense Minister Christopher Musa confirmed that a team was working in Nigeria but did not provide further details.

A former U.S. official said the U.S. team appeared to be heavily involved in intelligence gathering and enabling Nigerian forces to strike terrorist-affiliated groups.

Nigeria has come under intense pressure by Washington to act after President Trump accused the West African nation of failing to protect Christians from Islamist militants operating in the northwest.

The Nigerian government denies any systematic persecution of Christians, saying it is targeting Islamist fighters and other armed groups that attack both Christian and Muslim civilians.

Boko Haram and Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) fighters have intensified attacks on military convoys and civilians, and the northwest remains the epicentre of the 17-year Islamist insurgency.

The U.S. military’s Africa Command said the strike was carried out in Sokoto state in coordination with Nigerian authorities and killed multiple ISIS militants.

The strike came after Trump in late October began warning that Christianity faces an "existential threat" in Nigeria and threatened to militarily intervene in the West African country over what he says is its failure to stop violence targeting Christian communities.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 18:29:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/VMZ4CUVL7RM45OLVKQSJMCEVCU.jpg?auth=f30556c92a1c42f3aee27a8f11225e9e7775ce863d006fab3eb9fc1d2a68d10e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ex-general quits Italy's League party, posing problem for Meloni</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/ex-general-quits-italys-league-party-posing-problem-meloni-2026-02-03/</link><description>ROME, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Former army general Roberto Vannacci quit the League group, part of Italy's governing coalition, on Tuesday to set up his own far-right party, potentially complicating Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's hopes of winning re-election next year.

Vannacci shot to prominence two years ago, promoting what he said were traditional Italian values, while disparaging LGBTQ people, migrants, minorities and feminists.

Despite being forced out of the military, League leader Matteo Salvini embraced Vannacci's values and brought him into his party, making him the deputy chief in the hope he would help revive the group's faltering movement.

However, Vannacci remained aloof from much of the League hierarchy and on Tuesday confirmed that he planned to go it alone a week after trademarking the logo for a new political group called Futuro Nazionale (National Future).

"No boxer wins a fight by throwing moderate hooks," Vannacci said on X, promising to lead an uncompromising right-wing party.

Pollsters predict he could win up to 2% of the vote, not enough to enter parliament, but possibly a decisive drain on support for Meloni and her coalition allies.

"On paper the centre-left and centre-right camps are quite close together, so taking even two percentage points away from the right could be very relevant," said Lorenzo Pregliasco, who founded the YouTrend polling firm.

The next national election is scheduled for 2027.

Salvini said he was "disappointed and bitter".

"We are used to thinking that words like honour, discipline and loyalty have a precise meaning, especially for those who have worn a uniform," Salvini wrote on X, accusing Vannacci of betraying his trust.

Salvini had hoped that bringing him into the League would broaden its appeal and halt its slide in the polls.

At first the gamble seemed to pay off: Vannacci helped the League secure a respectable 9% in the 2024 European elections, briefly silencing more moderate figures in the party who were unhappy with his outspoken views.

But instead of fusing with the League, Vannacci built his own faction within the party, held rallies outside of Salvini's control and refused to contribute to party coffers, shunning standard expectations for elected officials.

Pregliasco said he could draw away voters from both the League and also Meloni's conservative Brothers of Italy party, which has become more moderate since forming the backbone of the current government.

"My right is true, coherent, identity-driven, strong, convinced, enthusiastic, pure and contagious," Vannacci said on X. "This is the only right I know."</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 18:29:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/QNS5BARVWNMJPDRUGZ3WDNAQPQ.jpg?auth=2508eedbd4c4e931da44aa3863a0ce428a4968e781df7be63108b1bb50bfb852&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iraq's Maliki says he would welcome decision to replace him as PM candidate</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iraqs-maliki-says-he-would-welcome-decision-replace-him-pm-candidate-2026-02-03/</link><description>Feb 3 (Reuters) - Iraq's former Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, nominated by a powerful alliance of Shi'ite political parties to return to the premiership, said on Tuesday that he would welcome a decision to replace his candidacy.

Prosecutors allege Malami, in November 2022, knowingly abetted terrorism financing by refusing to prosecute suspected terrorism financiers whose case files were forwarded to him while he served as attorney general.

The pair pleaded not guilty and were ordered to remain in the custody of the Department of State Security ahead of commencement of trial on February 20 after rejecting an oral bail.

The arraignment adds to Malami's widening legal troubles, which include separate ongoing money‑laundering proceedings and a related asset‑forfeiture case before the Federal High Court.

In December, Malami was charged with 16 counts of money laundering and conspiracy involving billions of naira.

Defence lawyers argued the pair had already spent two weeks in detention and were brought to court from the hospital, but the judge insisted on a formal bail motion.

Prosecutors also claimed Malami and his son were found in December 2025 in possession of a firearm and cartridges without a valid licence.

These offences are punishable under provisions of Nigerian law.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 18:29:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Turkey determined to take relations with Saudi Arabia to higher level, Erdogan tells crown prince</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/turkey-determined-take-relations-with-saudi-arabia-higher-level-erdogan-tells-2026-02-03/</link><description>ANKARA, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Turkey's President Tayyip Erdogan met Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Riyadh on Tuesday and told him Turkey was determined to take relations to a higher level in areas including renewable energy and defence industry, Erdogan's office said.

Zelenskiy said Ukraine had been expected to make concessions, but it was also up to Russia to make concessions, mainly "to stop the aggression".

Details surrounding the circumstances of his death were not immediately clear.

While Saif al-Islam is well-known in the north African country, especially for his role in shaping policy before 2011, his public profile has receded in recent years.

In 2015, a Libyan court passed a death sentence in absentia on Saif al-Islam for suppressing peaceful protests during the country's 2011 revolution that ended his father's rule.

He has also been provisionally charged by the International Criminal Court for alleged crimes against humanity, a case his lawyers failed to dismiss.

In 2021, Saif al-Islam registered as a presidential candidate for a December vote that eventually collapsed amid a political deadlock.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 19:28:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/3PTZYNBD4JJTJHGGLKM6GQJ3LE.jpg?auth=d01ee0d57a7a3718c060dc2e90fef748f14f58d7856b665257f151d3fe794f61&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump's call to 'nationalize' elections draws furious pushback from Democrats</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trumps-call-nationalize-elections-draws-furious-pushback-democrats-2026-02-03/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Feb 3 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s call for Republicans to "nationalize" elections drew pushback on Tuesday from lawmakers, including from a few Republicans, as Democrats voiced fresh concern that he intends to interfere with the November midterms that will determine control of Congress.

In a podcast interview with former FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino released on Monday, Trump repeated his false claims that the 2020 election was stolen from him and said his party should “take over” and " nationalize " voting in at least 15 places, without detailing what he meant.

Under the U.S. Constitution, state governments oversee elections, not the federal government, and most contests are administered by county and local officials.

Democratic elected officials and voting rights advocates said Trump’s comments, just days after the FBI searched the election office in Fulton County, Georgia, for 2020 ballots, show he plans to try to undermine or perhaps even manipulate the results of this year’s elections.

"This is not about the 2020 election," Democratic U.S. Senator Mark Warner of Virginia said at a press conference. "This is frankly about what comes next."

The party in power has historically lost seats in midterm elections, and Democrats need to flip only three Republican-held districts in November to gain control of the U.S. House of Representatives .

A senior Republican campaign operative told Reuters that it did not appear that there was an overarching strategy behind Trump's comments, beyond an ongoing Justice Department effort to procure voter rolls from many Democratic-leaning states.

"I think this is just an idea that if we fix elections, we'll never lose," the operative said.

Lawmakers and election experts were less sanguine.

“The last time he started talking like this, his allies minimized the risks and we ended up with Jan 6,” Brendan Nyhan, a political science professor at Dartmouth College wrote on X, referring to the January 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by a mob of Trump supporters.

Democratic U.S. Senator Dick Durbin called Trump's comments "outrageous" but "not unexpected" in an X post.

"What it tells us is he’s very worried about the outcome of that election and he’s prepared to violate the most basic constitutional guarantees in America to ensure his victory," he added.

Trump has often expressed a desire to overhaul the country’s elections, based on false conspiracy theories that his loss in 2020 to Democrat Joe Biden was fueled by fraud. He has called for mail-in ballots to be outlawed, questioned the security of voting machines and claimed falsely that millions of non-citizens regularly cast ballots.

The two top congressional Republicans, House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, did not offer support for taking over elections but defended Trump’s demands that voters provide proof of U.S. citizenship and photo identification.

Thune told reporters on Tuesday he was “not in favor of federalizing elections.”

“I'm a big believer in decentralized and distributed power,” he said. “It's harder to hack 50 election systems than it is to hack one.”

Johnson said it was not necessary to take over elections in some states, but argued that Trump’s concerns about election integrity were justified.

Some hardline Republicans briefly threatened on Tuesday to block a deal to end a partial government shutdown unless the bill includes citizenship and voter ID provisions.

Last week, the FBI executed a search warrant for 2020 ballots in Fulton County, Georgia, a central battleground in Trump’s unsuccessful effort that year to remain in power, which will also host one of the most competitive Senate races this year . The county district attorney’s office charged Trump with election interference in 2023, though the case was dropped in November, a year after Trump won his second term in office.

Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, appeared in Georgia alongside the FBI, alarming Democratic lawmakers. It’s highly unusual for the director of national intelligence to be involved in operations involving domestic elections, particularly if there is no clear foreign nexus.

Warner, who co-chairs the Senate intelligence committee, has said the Office of the Director of National Intelligence has not alerted Congress to any foreign threats to election infrastructure.

Gabbard's presence in Georgia "under a thin veil of legitimacy" raised "serious legal and constitutional questions and politicizes an institution that must remain neutral and apolitical," Warner said on Tuesday.

Gabbard said in a letter to Warner and Congressman Jim Himes, the Democratic co-chair of the House intelligence committee, that Trump had requested her presence at the FBI raid last week. She also said she has the legal authority to coordinate and analyze election security matters.

In April, Gabbard said at a cabinet meeting that her office was investigating election integrity issues, asserting there was evidence that electronic voting systems are “vulnerable to exploitation to manipulate the votes being cast.”</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 19:28:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5JYIY6GU6ZPVTGGWSVAEUNQ63I.jpg?auth=ce1103a31310c584d001b876ed9b03f5d75e39dfbfc50020fad44f30d232a86e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UK police confirm investigation into Mandelson over Epstein leaks</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-police-confirm-investigation-into-mandelson-over-epstein-leaks-2026-02-03/</link><description>LONDON, Feb 3 (Reuters) - British police said on Tuesday they have launched an investigation into Peter Mandelson, Britain's former ambassador to the U.S., over alleged misconduct in public office following the release of millions of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein.

Islamabad would join a small group of countries with a diplomatic presence in Benghazi, in a move that could boost eastern authorities in their rivalry with Libya's west.

Libya descended into turmoil after a 2011 NATO-backed uprising toppled Muammar Gaddafi and has been divided into eastern and western authorities since a 2014 civil war. The U.N.-recognised government in Tripoli controls the west, while LNA leader Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar's forces based in Benghazi hold the east and south, including major oilfields.

Haftar discussed the consulate with officials during an ongoing visit to Pakistan, the sources said.

He met Pakistan's army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir in Rawalpindi on Monday to discuss "professional cooperation", the Pakistani military said.

On Tuesday, Haftar and his son Saddam met Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to discuss "ways to enhance bilateral cooperation across various fields, in addition to addressing regional and international issues of mutual interest," the LNA's media office said in a statement.

The department previously said Haftar met senior Pakistani army officials "within the framework of strengthening bilateral relations". It did not give further details and Reuters could not immediately reach eastern Libyan authorities for comment.

Pakistan's prime minister's office and foreign ministry did not respond to requests for comment.

Pakistan's air force said in a statement that Saddam Khalifa Haftar met Air Chief Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu to discuss expanding defence cooperation, including joint training, with Islamabad reaffirming its support for the "capability development" of the Libyan air force.

Pakistan's army chief visited Benghazi in December, where he signed a multibillion-dollar defence deal with the LNA, previously reported by Reuters.

All three sources, who declined to be identified because they were not authorised to speak to the media, said the decision to open a consulate in Benghazi was linked to the $4 billion defence deal, one of Pakistan's largest-ever arms sales.

Libya has been under a U.N. arms embargo since 2011, although U.N. experts have said it is ineffective. Pakistani officials involved in the December deal said it did not violate U.N. restrictions.

Haftar has historically been an ally of the UAE, which supported him with air power and viewed him as a bulwark against Islamists, while Pakistan - the only nuclear-armed Muslim-majority nation - signed a wide-ranging mutual defence pact with Saudi Arabia late last year.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 19:28:42 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UAE pledges $500 million for Sudan aid as Washington gathers donors</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/uae-pledges-500-million-for-sudan-aid-washington-gathers-donors-2026-02-03/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Feb 3 - The United Arab Emirates on Tuesday pledged to donate $500 million to a U.N. fund for humanitarian aid for Sudan, amid a U.S. push to renew efforts towards a truce in the conflict that has devastated the country.

Sudan has accused the UAE of arming the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) which have been fighting the Sudanese army in the civil war that broke out in April 2023 - a charge the UAE denies but U.N. experts and U.S. lawmakers have found credible.

Speaking at a donor event in Washington, UAE state minister Lana Nusseibeh said her country wanted to see a truce in the conflict, without referring to her country’s alleged support for the RSF.

Nusseibeh has previously said the UAE condemns violations by both warring parties and wants to see an independent, civilian-led government in Sudan.

The U.S. special envoy for Africa, Massad Boulos, said he expected a total of $1.5 billion of new funding to be pledged at the Washington event, including an additional $200 million for Sudan from the United States. Other states represented at the event did not make clear promises of new aid.

The conflict in Sudan has killed tens of thousands of people, displaced millions and spread famine across the vast country. Fighting has raged in several areas in the past few months, with the latest frontline in the southern Kordofan region, where the army has claimed progress in recent days.

Boulos said Washington was pushing for a truce to be agreed upon by the parties in Sudan ahead of the start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan on February 17.

Boulos admitted that progress had been disappointing since President Donald Trump in November said he would intervene to stop the conflict at the request of Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

“We would have hoped to achieve peace much, much earlier,” said Boulos. “We’ve amplified our efforts and yet we haven’t really achieved that much yet, in terms of the humanitarian truce, which was the first item on the milestone roadmap.”

Officials from Egypt and Saudi Arabia would meet U.S. and UAE officials as part of a so-called Quad grouping that is working on a U.S. peace proposal, Boulos said, adding that the text of a peace plan had been accepted by those parties.

The warring parties themselves are yet to agree to a temporary truce or to the U.S. peace plan, but Boulos said he hoped it would ultimately be presented to the U.N. Security Council and then to Trump’s Board of Peace .</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 19:28:48 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/IR2CTH3T2NPBPK3AXGYAQGWUMM.jpg?auth=c49ece88623d7a1305ea6a911017f4a79efefb7c69096bc8881e40772fbf3b97&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>French prosecutors seek 5-year ban from office for far-right leader Marine Le Pen in appeal trial</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260203-french-prosecutors-seek-5-year-ban-from-office-for-far-right-leader-marine-le-pen-in-appeal-trial-no-immediate-enforcement</link><description>French prosecutors on Tuesday demanded that an appeal court maintain a five-year ban on far-right leader Marine Le Pen from holding public office over an EU parliament fake jobs scandal . They did not ‌request an immediate ‍enforcement of the sentence.

A lower court last year banned Le Pen, a three-time presidential candidate, from running for office for five years, in a bombshell ruling that has thrown her 2027 presidential run into jeopardy.

She is hoping to beat that ruling on appeal, but prosecutors are pushing for bans on holding public office over a fake jobs scam at the European Parliament – an accusation the 57-year-old far-right leader denies.

"We are going to ask you to largely uphold the criminal liability established in the initial trial , and ineligibility sentences will of course be sought," prosecutor Thierry Ramonatxo told a Paris court.

Le Pen, her National Rally party and 11 others are appealing the ruling by the lower court, which also sentenced her to four years in jail, including two suspended, and fined her €100,000 ($116,000).

The first trial found Le Pen, along with 24 former European Parliament lawmakers, assistants and accountants as well as the party itself, guilty of operating a "system" from 2004 to 2016 that used European Parliament funds to employ National Rally staff in France.

Not all of those convicted have appealed.

The prosecutor's office had requested bans from public office ranging from one to five years for Le Pen and 23 others in the initial trial.

The lower court ordered that Le Pen's office ban take effect immediately – not waiting for her appeal – and also handed bans to other defendants.

During the appeal trial from mid-January, Le Pen denied the National Rally had any "system" to embezzle European Parliament funds and said her party acted in "complete good faith".

The appeal trial wraps up this month. A verdict is expected this summer.

If the court upholds the first ruling, Le Pen will be prevented from running in the 2027 French presidential election, widely seen as her best chance to win the country's top job after several failed attempts.

She made it to the second round in the 2017 and 2022 presidential polls, before losing to Emmanuel Macron , who cannot run again next year after having held two consecutive terms in office.

Le Pen now again risks the maximum sentence of 10 years in prison and a €1 million ($1.16-million) fine if the appeal fails.

She is hoping to be acquitted – or at least for a shorter election ban and no time under house arrest.

Ramonatxo, the prosecutor, pushed back at claims last year that the judiciary had in any way aimed to "block a party leader's ascent to the highest executive office".

"To suggest that the judiciary could oppose the will of the sovereign people is inaccurate," he said.

"A judge is the guardian of the law and merely applies it."

A court in April handed down an eight-month suspended sentence to a 76-year-old man over a death threat against the judge who convicted Le Pen.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 19:29:02 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/ade13b5c-010d-11f1-bb89-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-02-03T075206Z-1490315012-RC26EJA9HALW-RTRMADP-3-FRANCE-POLITICS-LE-PEN.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Two dead, eight injured in strike on Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/two-dead-eight-injured-strike-ukraines-zaporizhzhia-2026-02-03/</link><description>Feb 3 (Reuters) - A Russian drone attack killed two people aged 18 and injured nine other people on Tuesday in the southeastern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia, the regional governor said.

In a meeting with the U.S. envoy, Netanyahu "made clear his position that Iran has repeatedly proven that its promises cannot be trusted," a statement from his office said.

Two Israeli officials said the meeting was also attended by Israel's spy agency head David Barnea, Defense Minister Israel Katz and military commander Eyal Zamir.

Iranian sources told Reuters last week that Trump had set three conditions for resumption of talks: Zero enrichment of uranium in Iran; limits on Tehran's ballistic missile programme; and ending its support for regional proxies, which align with longstanding Israeli demands.

Iran has long said all three demands are unacceptable infringements of its sovereignty, but two Iranian officials told Reuters its clerical rulers saw the ballistic missile programme, rather than uranium enrichment, as the bigger obstacle.

Iran and the United States will resume nuclear talks on Friday in Turkey. U.S. President Donald Trump has warned that with U.S. warships heading to Iran, bad things would probably happen if a deal could not be reached.

Tensions between Tehran and Washington are running high and the arrival of a U.S. aircraft carrier and supporting warships in the Middle East has expanded Trump's ability to take military action if he so wishes, after repeatedly threatening intervention over Iran's bloody crackdown.

During the early January protests, witnesses and rights groups said, security forces crushed demonstrations with lethal force, leaving thousands dead and many wounded. Tehran blamed the violence on "armed terrorists" linked to Israel and the U.S.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 20:02:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LI2WOKX3DJIIBIPKKGEWW4YZDM.jpg?auth=7959ec3bc0c5403da91cdb036d7b34dcbd134c011ed63af4d76a21c054ddf2d5&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Colombia's Petro says discussed Venezuelan gas, fight against drugs with Trump</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/colombias-petro-says-discussed-venezuelan-gas-fight-against-drugs-with-trump-2026-02-03/</link><description>BOGOTA, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Colombian President Gustavo Petro told local radio station Caracol on Tuesday that he and his U.S. counterpart Donald Trump had discussed the possibility of exporting Venezuelan gas via Colombia, the fight against drug trafficking and Colombia's trade and drugs spat with Ecuador at a White House meeting.

The two men have clashed since Trump began his current term, with the U.S. leader repeatedly accusing Petro's administration, without evidence, of enabling a steady flow of cocaine into the U.S., imposing sanctions on the Colombian leader and threatening military action against the South American country. Petro, in turn, has harshly critiqued U.S. support for Israel and called for criminal proceedings over U.S. missile attacks on suspected drug-running boats in the Caribbean.

But the relationship seemed to thaw last month and photos posted on X by Petro suggested their meeting had been cordial. They discussed the eradication - but not aerial fumigation - of coca crops, Petro said, and he asked Trump to help capture major drug traffickers living internationally and to mediate tensions with Ecuador's President Daniel Noboa.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 21:02:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/S6PPWNTNVZLMHC2HAO47LRQ7VY.jpg?auth=7d553caf539281bc26f74776c897ca510f37bac8f828051df86aebd96a669954&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, son of Libya's late dictator, killed in the northern African country, report say</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/africa/20260203-seif-al-islam-gaddafi-son-of-libya-s-late-dictator-killed-in-the-northern-african-country-report-say</link><description>Saif al-Islam Gaddafi , the son of Libya 's late long-time ruler, has died, relatives reported on Tuesday, without providing details on his death.

His adviser, Abdallah Othman Abdurrahim, confirmed his death in a social media post, without giving details.

"Seif al-Islam has fallen as a martyr," his cousin, Hamid Kadhafi, told Libyan network al-Ahrar, adding that the family had no further details.

Abdullah Othman Abdurrahim told al-Ahrar TV channel that Seif al-Islam was killed in his house by a group of four unidentified men. "Four armed men stormed the residence of Seif al-Islam Kadhafi after disabling surveillance cameras, then executed him," Abdurrahim was reported as saying.

Media outlets said he had died in Zintan, in northwestern Libya , although his whereabouts had long been unknown.

Hamid Kadhafi, his cousin, told al-Ahrar TV he had "fallen as a martyr".

Seif al-Islam, 53, had been seen as his father's successor. In 2021, he announced he would run for president, but those elections were indefinitely postponed.

While he held no official position in the North African country under his father's rule, he had been described as Libya's de facto prime minister, cultivating an image of moderation and reform prior to the 2011 Arab Spring revolt.

But that reputation soon collapsed when he promised "rivers of blood" in the face of the uprisings.

He was arrested in November 2011 in southern Libya following a warrant by the International Criminal Court ( ICC ).

He was sentenced to death in 2015 after a speedy trial but was granted amnesty.

Libya expert Emadeddin Badi said Seif al-Islam's death was "likely to cast him as a martyr for a significant segment of the population, while also shifting electoral dynamics by removing a major obstacle to presidential elections ".

"His candidacy and potential success had been a central point of contention," Badi wrote on X.

Muammar Gaddafi's last spokesman, Moussa Ibrahim, also posted on the social network: "They killed him treacherously. He wanted a united, sovereign Libya, safe for all its people."

"I spoke with him two days ago. He spoke of nothing but a peaceful Libya and the safety of its people."

Libya has struggled to recover from chaos that erupted after a NATO-backed uprising in 2011 overthrew long-time ruler Muammar Gaddafi.

Libya remains divided between a UN-backed government based in Tripoli and an eastern administration backed by Haftar.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 21:03:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/b182e38e-013d-11f1-892a-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/AP21348664966656-1.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UK's Starmer discussed Ukraine in call with Trump, British government says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/uks-starmer-discussed-ukraine-call-with-trump-british-government-says-2026-02-03/</link><description>Feb 3 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Keir Starmer spoke to U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday and discussed the situation in Ukraine, including the overnight Russian attacks on the country, the UK government said.

A coastguard official said they spotted a dingy transporting migrants towards Chios, which lies a few miles off the coast of Turkey, and ordered them to turn back.

"The smugglers manoeuvred toward the coast guard vessel causing a collision
 ," the official told Reuters.

Reuters was unable to independently verify how exactly the collision occurred. The nationality of the migrants was not clear.

Two coast guard officers were injured and transferred to hospital and 24 migrants have been rescued, a second official told Reuters. Witnesses reported that about 30-35 people were on board, a government official said.

The coast guard said that a search and rescue was underway with coast guard vessels, private boats and divers assisting the operation.

Greece, in the southeast corner of the European Union, has long been a favoured gateway to Europe for migrants and refugees from the Middle East, Africa and Asia.

In 2015-2016, Greece was at the frontline of Europe's migration crisis and nearly one million people landed on its islands, including Chios, from Turkey.

In recent years, arrivals have dropped and Greece has toughened its stance on migrants. Since 2019, the centre-right government has reinforced border controls with fences and sea patrols.

Greece has come under scrutiny for its treatment of migrants and refugees approaching by sea, including one shipwreck in 2023 in which hundreds of migrants died after what witnesses said was the coastguard’s attempt to tow their trawler.

The EU border agency said last year that it was reviewing 12 cases of potential human rights violations by Greece, including some allegations migrants seeking asylum were pushed back from Greece's frontiers.

Greece denies that it violates human rights or that it forcefully returns asylum seekers from its shores.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 21:58:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Exclusive: US authorizes US diluent supply to Venezuela oil sector</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/us-treasury-issues-license-authorizing-us-diluent-supply-venezuela-official-says-2026-02-03/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Feb 3 (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department on Tuesday issued a new license authorizing the export and sale to Venezuela of U.S. diluents, a key fuel needed to produce exportable crude oil grades in the OPEC country, according to a document shown to Reuters by an administration official.

The authorization, which is Washington's second general license granted so far to ease sanctions on Venezuela following the U.S. capture of President Nicolas Maduro last month, supports the administration's policy of recovering Venezuela's oil sector, the document says.

The government of Tshopo province, where Kisangani is located, said in a statement on Sunday that eight explosive‑laden drones had targeted the airport serving Kisangani.

The airport lies about 17 km from central Kisangani, hundreds of kilometres from the front lines in North and South Kivu provinces, where AFC/M23 has seized large swathes of territory since 2022, capturing the key cities of Goma and Bukavu in a lightning offensive last year.

In a post on X, Corneille Nangaa, who leads the AFC, said the attack demonstrated that Congo's military no longer had air superiority.

"The use of Kisangani as a platform for projecting terror against our territories is now prohibited. The sanctuary of this rear base is over," he said.

What does it already do?</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/trump-tells-minnesota-help-more-with-us-immigration-enforcement-what-does-it-2026-02-03/</link><description>Feb 3 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump says he wants more help from Minnesota with enforcing federal immigration laws. Minnesota says its state-run prison system has long cooperated with federal immigration agents, to the maximum extent required and allowed by law. So do many sheriff-run county jails.

Trump administration officials have said the deployment of thousands of armed agents into Minnesota's cities to deport migrants would continue if they do not get more cooperation from state and local officials. The agents have fatally shot two U.S. citizens in Minneapolis who were observing or protesting the surge, sparking angry demonstrations across the country.

Here is where Minnesota cooperates with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, where it does not, and how it says constitutional rights limit giving the Trump administration what it is seeking.

Tom Homan, the White House "border czar" dispatched by Trump in late January to Minnesota, puts it in simple terms: "Let us in the damn jail." ICE has long sought greater access to migrants in local jails and state prisons across the U.S., including those under a deportation order by the federal government.

When ICE learns that a migrant it is seeking to deport is in state, county or local custody, it often sends over a written "detainer request" form, asking that the jail or prison hold onto the migrant for up to 48 extra hours past when they would have otherwise been released.

Anyone convicted of a serious crime under Minnesota law is almost certain to serve their sentence in the prison system run by the state's Department of Corrections, which in January created a "Combating DHS Misinformation" section , opens new tab on its website, referring to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, under which ICE falls.

The DOC says it has long cooperated with ICE, and abides by state law , opens new tab that requires it to notify ICE each time it takes into custody someone convicted of a felony who is not a U.S. citizen, even if ICE has not yet sent a detainer request. As of early February, there were about 8,000 people in DOC prisons, of whom around 380 were not U.S. citizens, according to the department.

The DOC says it always cooperates with ICE detainer requests, working with ICE agents ahead of the prisoner's release date at the end of their state custodial sentence to arrange a transfer to federal custody. In 2025, this successfully happened with all 84 state prisoners sought by ICE, the department says.

Minnesota's jails are generally run by elected county sheriffs and house a much more rapidly shifting population than the state prisons: people who have been arrested but not yet charged, people accused of a crime who are being prosecuted but not yet convicted, and people who are serving short sentences for minor crimes, such as drunk-driving or low-value shoplifting.

Some sheriffs cooperate with ICE in a similar manner as the state prison system: sheriffs in seven of Minnesota's 87 counties have signed formal cooperation agreements , opens new tab with ICE. Others say cooperation can undermine public safety if immigrants who are victims of or witnesses to crimes are afraid to come forward.

The Hennepin County sheriff's office, which runs Minneapolis' main jail, used to let ICE agents in to interview people in its custody. That ended in 2018, after the election of a new sheriff with a policy of not cooperating, which has been carried on by the present sheriff, Dawanna Witt, who was elected in 2022.

Under the U.S. Constitution's Tenth Amendment, the federal government cannot command state officers to help it enforce federal laws, a violation of state sovereignty. But it can ask the states to volunteer their assistance.

In 2025, Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison told state prosecutors in an advisory opinion , opens new tab that "Minnesota law prohibits state and local law enforcement agencies from holding someone based on an immigration detainer if the person would otherwise be released from custody."

Detaining someone for up to 48 hours is an arrest like any other, Ellison wrote, and neither Minnesota nor federal law gives local officials the authority to make an arrest based on a request by another agency without a judge-signed arrest warrant.

He cited a 2019 ruling by the Minnesota Court of Appeals, Esparza v. Nobles County, that found that a sheriff continuing to detain someone after they were free to go under state law was likely unconstitutional.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 23:30:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/6LAYQ4U4VNK2FFO4W3RTXMDRXI.jpg?auth=24cfc9a24f3c7c8307e48bac458518b4ea0aac6e454de12974e0793719b3b754&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Petro and Trump strike conciliatory tone after year of tensions</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260203-petro-and-trump-strike-conciliatory-tone-after-year-of-tensions</link><description>Colombian President Gustavo Petro and US President Donald Trump appeared to bury the hatchet on Tuesday after a year of sparring that culminated in threats by Trump to topple the left-wing leader as he did in Venezuela .

“My impression of the meeting a few hours ago is first and foremost that it was positive,” Petro told reporters after meeting Trump at the White House behind closed doors.

Trump said he “got along very well” with the leader whom he recently accused of pumping cocaine into the United States and had warned to “watch his ass” after the fall of Venezuela’s Nicolas Maduro .

“He and I weren’t exactly the best of friends, but I wasn’t insulted because I never met him. I didn’t know him at all, and we got along very well,” Trump said at the White House hours after the talks ended.

Trump said the two countries were “working on” anti-drug trafficking cooperation, as well as on lifting US sanctions the Republican had imposed on the South American country.

Fears in Bogota that Petro could be subjected to one of Trump’s famously fiery televised Oval Office confrontations were dispelled when reporters were kept out.

Instead, it was Petro and his office who posted a series of pictures of the meeting.

“You are great,” Trump wrote to Petro as he signed a copy of his 1987 book Art of the Deal , according to the photos.

Despite being worlds apart politically, the Colombian returned praise for the 79-year-old US leader.

“The truth is I like straightforward Americans, people who say what they feel. We’re different, undoubtedly, by a lot. But frankness comes first,” he said.

The two leaders reclined in gold chairs in the Oval Office as they talked, accompanied by US Vice President JD Vance , Secretary of State Marco Rubio and senior Colombian officials, according to photos released by Petro’s office.

They also shared a warm handshake in the West Wing colonnade, next to portraits of former US presidents that Trump recently installed, along with unflattering biographies of some of his recent predecessors.

Petro also said after the meeting that Trump had agreed to mediate Colombia ’s trade war with Ecuador .

The South American neighbours have imposed import tariffs of 30 per cent on one another in a dispute over how to tackle drug trafficking – also a major political issue for Trump.

It was a far cry from the previous harsh rhetoric between a pair who come from absolute opposite ends of the political spectrum.

The Colombian had repeatedly defended Venezuela’s leader Nicolas Maduro, a fellow left-winger, before his capture by US forces on January 3. He also criticised deadly US air strikes on alleged drug trafficking boats.

Trump, meanwhile, has been pressing Colombia to crack down on drug trafficking, threatening military strikes on its territory as he had against both Venezuela and Mexico .

After the Maduro raid, an emboldened Trump stepped up his barbs, saying a Venezuela-style action against Petro “sounds good to me”.

But things turned a corner after an unexpectedly warm phone call on January 7.

“I mean, he’s been very nice over the last month or two,” Trump said on Monday on the eve of the visit. “He was certainly critical before that, but somehow, after the Venezuelan raid, he became very nice.”

Petro said on X shortly before the meeting that during the talks he was “determined to continue strengthening the relationship between two nations that share a common goal: the fight against drug trafficking”.

In an apparent reference to strikes on drug boats in the Caribbean and Pacific that have killed more than 100 people, he added that he wanted to do so “from an approach that prioritises life and peace in our territories”.

In an olive branch to Trump hours before their talks, Petro extradited an accused drug lord to the United States after a months-long suspension of such transfers.

Colombia also abruptly agreed on Friday to accept US deportation flights – reversing the very decision that triggered the falling-out between Trump and Petro last year.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 23:31:10 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/7250c52a-0122-11f1-ad81-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/HAP43fCWUAA2Ufr.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Lula tribute at Rio Carnival stirs political controversy ahead of elections</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260203-lula-tribute-at-rio-carnival-stirs-political-controversy-ahead-of-elections</link><description>The face of the Brazilian president is omnipresent as a samba school rehearses its Carnival parade in front of thousands of spectators chanting the refrain of its theme song: “Ole, ole, ole, ola; Lula, Lula!”

The decision by samba school Academicos de Niteroi to pay homage to veteran leftist President Inacio Lula da Silva at this year’s Carnival extravaganza has raised eyebrows just eight months before elections.

Academicos de Niteroi will be the first to parade down Rio de Janeiro ’s Sambodrome on February 15, at the start of the three-day competition that is the peak of the city’s annual Carnival festivities.

Twelve samba schools will compete in parades featuring thousands of participants, with colossal, often animated floats, booming drum sections, and dancers draped in little more than beads and glitter.

Each year the schools choose a theme linked to Brazilian culture, history, or popular figures.

While Academicos argues it wants to honour Lula to thank him for his social welfare policies, the opposition has denounced the parade as equivalent to a campaign event months before official campaigning begins in August.

Lula, 80, who is expected to attend the parade as a spectator, is seeking a fourth term in the October elections .

“This is not propaganda , it’s a tribute. Many people in our school were able to get an education thanks to the president’s public policies,” Hamilton Junior, one of the school’s directors, told AFP.

Junior said it was the story of a man from Brazil ’s poor north-east who “faced many hardships and became one of Brazil’s greatest presidents”.

During technical rehearsals at the Sambodrome – which draw large crowds – dancers dressed as steelworkers in reference to Lula’s past occupation.

The lyrics of the song recount Lula’s poor childhood in rural Pernambuco, his move to Sao Paulo, his union activism , and social policies implemented under his different administrations.

There is no mention of the October election, but the song does not shy away from Brazil’s current political scene .

It refers to “ tariffs and sanctions” imposed by US President Donald Trump to punish Brazil for putting his ally, former far-right leader Jair Bolsonaro , on trial for plotting a coup.

Trump has since lifted many of these measures.

The song also includes the phrase “no amnesty”, a nod to efforts by Bolsonaro’s supporters to reduce a 27-year prison sentence he began serving in November.

A large screen mounted on the back of a truck displayed images mocking Bolsonaro – showing him in a prison uniform or with blood-stained hands, a reference to his Covid scepticism.

Bolsonaro has anointed his eldest son, Senator Flavio Bolsonaro, as his political heir and presidential candidate.

One of the composers of the samba told local media that Lula had cried when Academicos leaders travelled to Brasilia last year to play the song for him.

Centre-right lawmaker Kim Kataguiri filed a lawsuit demanding Academicos return the one million reais ($180,000) each of the 12 schools receives in federal funding for the parade.

“It is unacceptable that the president sends one million reais, and even worse in an election year, to a samba school to celebrate a festival whose main theme is the president himself,” Kataguiri told AFP on Tuesday.

Lawmakers from the right-wing Partido Novo asked Brazil’s Federal Court of Auditors to block the funding.

A senator allied with Bolsonaro demanded that the courts prohibit the television broadcast of the parade.

The Brazilian agency for the promotion of international tourism, Embratur, which provides the funds, said in a statement that it “respects the artistic autonomy and freedom of expression of the samba schools”.

Watching the rehearsal, Adriano Santos, a 43-year-old social worker from the Rocinha favela, said the samba school was “being brave, innovative”.

“There will be those who like it and those who don’t, but I believe this parade will represent Brazil.”</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 23:31:12 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/2cf2f05e-eca8-11f0-be23-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-08T145548Z-254263623-RC22XIAG0K49-RTRMADP-3-BRAZIL-POLITICS-LULA.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump signs $1.2 trillion funding bill, ending government shutdown</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260203-trump-ends-government-shutdown</link><description>US President Donald Trump signed a roughly $1.2 trillion government funding bill on Tuesday, ending a partial federal shutdown that began over the weekend and setting the stage for an intense debate in Congress over Homeland Security funding.

The president moved quickly to sign the bill after the House approved it by a 217–214 vote.

“This bill is a great victory for the American people,” Trump said.

Tuesday’s vote wrapped up congressional work on 11 annual appropriations bills that fund government agencies and programmes through September 30, ending the partial government shutdown that began on Saturday.

Passage of the legislation marked the end of one funding fight, but the start of another. That is because the package funds the Department of Homeland Security for only two weeks, through February 13, at the behest of Democrats who are demanding tighter restrictions on immigration enforcement after the shooting deaths of Alex Pretti and Renee Good by federal officers in Minneapolis .

Difficult negotiations lie ahead, particularly for the agency that enforces the nation’s immigration laws – US Immigration and Customs Enforcement , or ICE.

House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries quickly warned that Democrats would not support any further temporary funding for Homeland Security without substantial changes to its immigration operations, raising the potential of another shutdown for the department and its agencies.

“We need dramatic change in order to make sure that ICE and other agencies within the Department of Homeland Security are conducting themselves like every other law enforcement organisation in the country,” Jeffries said.

House Speaker Mike Johnson said he expects the two sides will be able to reach an agreement by the deadline.

“This is no time to play games with that funding. We hope that they will operate in good faith over the next 10 days as we negotiate this,” Johnson said. “The president, again, has reached out.”

But Johnson’s counterpart across the Capitol, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R–S.D., sounded less optimistic. “There’s always miracles, right?” Thune told reporters.

The funding bill that cleared Congress on Tuesday contained provisions that appealed to both parties.

Republicans avoided a massive catch-all funding bill known as an omnibus as part of this year’s appropriations process. Such bills, often taken up before the holiday season with lawmakers anxious to return home, have contributed to higher federal spending, they say.

Democrats were able to fend off some of Trump’s most draconian proposed cuts while adding language to help ensure funds are spent as stipulated by Congress.

Still, Johnson needed near-unanimous support from his Republican conference to proceed to a final vote. He narrowly secured it during a roll call that was held open for nearly an hour as leaders worked to gain backing from a handful of GOP lawmakers seeking to advance unrelated priorities.

The final vote was not much easier for Republican leaders. In the end, 21 Republicans joined the vast majority of Democrats in voting against the bill, while the same number of Democrats sided with most Republicans in voting in favour.

Trump weighed in on Monday in a social media post, urging Republicans to stay united and telling holdouts: “There can be NO CHANGES at this time.”

The partial shutdown that is now ending differed in many ways from the autumn impasse, which affected more agencies and lasted a record 43 days.

That earlier standoff centred on extending temporary coronavirus pandemic-era subsidies for people receiving health coverage through the Affordable Care Act. Democrats were unsuccessful in securing their inclusion in the deal to end that shutdown.

Congress has since made progress. Some of the six appropriations bills passed before Tuesday ensured the current shutdown had less impact. Key programmes such as nutrition assistance and fully operating national parks and historic sites were already funded through September 30.

The remaining bills passed on Tuesday mean the vast majority of the federal government is now funded.

“You might say that now that 96 per cent of the government is funded, it’s just 4 per cent that’s outstanding,” Johnson said. “But it’s a very important 4 per cent.”</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 23:58:03 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/20301b28-0119-11f1-b2fd-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-02-03T011157Z-247941225-RC2YDJA2NHUU-RTRMADP-3-USA-CONGRESS-TEXAS-HOUSE.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Thailand's ex-PM Abhisit returns to political fray in boost for his party</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/thailands-ex-pm-abhisit-returns-political-fray-boost-his-party-2026-02-04/</link><description>BANGKOK, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Passersby stopped Thailand's former Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva every now and again to ask for selfies as the salt-and-pepper-haired leader walked through a bustling market in Bangkok, campaigning for general elections on February 8 .

"Good to see you again, still handsome just like before," said one noodle vendor, reflecting voters' persisting warm feelings for the Oxford-trained economist, who is making an unexpected comeback to frontline politics.

Abhisit's return has fuelled a revival of his Democrat Party, reshaping an electoral contest that formerly looked like a three-way tussle among the ruling Bhumjaithai Party, the progressive People's Party and the populist Pheu Thai Party .

"I just want to offer a choice and revive the party," Abhisit, 61, told Reuters, as he strolled down a major road in the capital, greeting office workers on lunch breaks.

"Every time I meet people, they are frustrated with the lack of choice."

Government employee Yuttapum Rattanamanee, a voter in the northeast, said he was one of four in his family backing the Democrats again because Abhisit came back to lead the party.

"When Abhisit left, the party lost its power because people no longer trusted the leadership," the 37-year-old added. "Abhisit is capable, competent and honest."

Thailand's oldest political party, the Democrats had long dominated the south and Bangkok, before sliding into decline after a military coup in 2014.

Despite the goodwill, Abhisit is unlikely to get enough support to become prime minister , a survey showed last week.

But he has helped his party win back conservative voters after years of lacklustre efforts, said Olarn Thinbangtieo, a political scientist at Burapha University.

"Its earlier decline came from leadership that drifted away from the party's principles," Olarn added. "His return has lifted support."

As prime minister from 2008 to 2011, Abhisit faced prolonged street protests by the "Red Shirt" populist movement backed by former premier Thaksin Shinawatra, who also founded Pheu Thai.

In 2010, he ordered a military crackdown on demonstrations in central Bangkok that killed 90, a toll rights groups blamed on "excessive and unnecessary lethal force" used by security forces seeking to restore order.

But Thai courts dismissed all the criminal cases faced by Abhisit and senior officials, with no convictions.

Abhisit stepped away from politics after the Democrats won just 52 of 500 seats up for grabs in the 2019 general election. In 2023, the party slid further, clinching just 25 seats.

Now the Democrats are resurgent, opinion polls largely driven by Abhisit's personal appeal show.

A survey by the National Institute of Development Administration (NIDA) ranked Abhisit third among likely prime ministerial candidates last week, while his Democrat Party took fourth place overall.

That suggests the party could emerge as a pivotal force in talks to form a coalition after an election that is expected to give no single party an outright majority.

The Democrats' gains could come at the expense of the ruling Bhumjaithai, splitting conservative and older voters nationwide, Olarn added.

Nevertheless, the NIDA survey put Abhisit a distant third to be prime minister, after frontrunner People's Party leader Natthaphong Ruengpanyawut and second-ranked Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul

FLOOD-HIT SOUTH

Much of Abhisit's support comes from his party's traditional southern heartland, parts of which were ravaged by catastrophic floods in November, killing 145 in nine provinces.

In the key province of Songkhla, swamped by its highest single-day rainfall in 300 years, a January survey showed Abhisit as the top choice for premier, well ahead of the incumbent Anutin.

"It suggests that southern people are coming back, warming to us," Abhisit added.

But winning in the capital, Thailand's single largest electoral block with 33 seats and 4.5 million voters, which was almost entirely swept by a predecessor of the People's Party in 2023, will be a tough task for the Democrats, he said.

"Ideally, we would have liked more preparation," Abhisit said, referring to the party's campaign in Bangkok.

The snap elections came after Anutin dissolved parliament in December, in the midst of a fierce border conflict with neighbouring Cambodia, which analysts said was timed to help the ruling party ride a wave of heightening nationalism .

Yet the current campaign is not solely based on nostalgia for Abhisit, who became prime minister aged 44, after a youthful start as a member of parliament at 27.

"It's about transforming the party as well as reviving it," he said. "We're bringing back the principles people once supported us for."</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 02:04:44 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/47P3VPHUP5JWPDKJOHGG42MQCI.jpg?auth=8ca8eb35b934b14163353bedaf6b1cc7443f2828f5c874e8d33fa08086f1ddc8&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UK police launch investigation into Mandelson over Epstein leaks</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/starmers-government-aids-police-probe-into-mandelsons-epstein-leaks-2026-02-03/</link><description>LONDON, Feb 3 (Reuters) - British police on Tuesday launched an investigation into Peter Mandelson, Britain's former ambassador to the U.S., over alleged misconduct in public office, following claims that he leaked market-sensitive information to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

London's Metropolitan Police said in a statement that the investigation follows the receipt of reports alleging misconduct in public office, including a referral from the British government.

Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government handed material to the police to investigate whether Mandelson leaked information to Epstein during the financial crash.

Starmer told his ministers on Tuesday that Mandelson's alleged leaks to Epstein were "disgraceful." A few hours later, Mandelson said he would retire from parliament's upper house, the House of Lords.

"The Met will continue to assess all relevant information brought to our attention as part of this investigation and won't be commenting any further at this time," Police Commander Ella Marriott said.

Separately, Thames Valley Police said in a statement they were reviewing a new claim against the former Prince Andrew.

Mandelson, a major player in the Labour governments of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown more than two decades ago, is facing possible criminal charges after emails released by the U.S. as part of the Epstein investigation suggested he had leaked confidential government documents to the financier.

The Times newspaper, which first reported the police investigation, said officers were expected to interview Mandelson and take statements from senior Labour figures, including former Prime Minister Brown.

Following the announcement of the investigation into Mandelson, a government spokesperson said it stood "ready to provide whatever support and assistance the police need."

The emails suggest that in 2009, Mandelson sent Epstein a memo written for Brown about possible UK asset sales and tax changes, and in 2010 gave Epstein advance notice of a 500-billion-euro ($590 billion) bailout by the European Union.

Mandelson, 72, was fired from his ambassadorial role in September, seven months after being appointed, after documents emerged showing he had remained close to Epstein for much longer than he had previously acknowledged.

In one message, he appeared to tell Epstein that his earlier conviction, for procuring a child for prostitution, was wrong and he should fight for early release.

On Tuesday, Starmer told his cabinet he was not reassured that the totality of the information had yet emerged, according to his spokesperson.

His comments marked his strongest condemnation yet of the man he appointed ambassador to Washington last year despite his known association with Epstein, who committed suicide in prison in 2019.

"The prime minister said he was appalled by the information that had emerged over the weekend in the Epstein files," his spokesperson said.

Late on Sunday, Mandelson resigned from the Labour Party to prevent "further embarrassment", after a new release of millions of documents exposed details of his closeness to Epstein, including suggestions of payments to Mandelson and his husband.

The scandal has sparked concerns about Starmer's decision to appoint Mandelson as ambassador instead of a career diplomat, a decision advocated by his chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney.

Labour lawmaker Clive Efford, speaking in parliament on Monday, said the "key question here is who advised the prime minister?"

MANDELSON: NO RECOLLECTION OF EPSTEIN PAYMENTS

Mandelson has not responded to requests about the allegations. A spokesperson, however, has said Mandelson had no recollection of financial payments, totalling $75,000, from Epstein, as suggested by other emails and media reports.

In an interview with the Times conducted late last month and published on Tuesday, Mandelson said Epstein had been a "master manipulator." He added: "I've had a lot of bad luck, no doubt some of it of my own making."

Starmer, seeking to get on the front foot after some of his lawmakers said Downing Street's initial response over the weekend was not strong enough, has ordered an investigation into Mandelson's links with Epstein during Brown's government.

Brown, however, pre-empted him, saying that he had asked officials to look into the matter back in September but that he had been told they had unearthed no departmental records.

The former prime minister said on Monday that after the "shocking new information" came to light in the latest tranche of Epstein papers, he had asked for "a wider and more intensive inquiry to take place."

Starmer has also called for the former Prince Andrew to testify before a U.S. congressional committee, following new revelations about his links to Epstein.

Asked about the situation at a meeting in Dubai on Tuesday, Prince Edward, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor's younger brother, said: "It's really important always to remember the victims," echoing previous statements from King Charles and Queen Camilla.

A Thames Valley Police spokesperson said the force was aware of allegations that a woman was taken to an address in Windsor, where the former prince resides, for sexual purposes in 2010.

The woman's lawyer told the BBC over the weekend that the woman, who is not British, was in her 20s at the time and was allegedly sent to Britain by Epstein for a sexual encounter with Mountbatten-Windsor. He has always denied any wrongdoing.

"We are assessing the information in line with our established procedures," the police spokesperson said, adding that the force takes any reports of sexual crimes extremely seriously.

A review does not necessarily lead to an investigation.

Here are contenders from among 93 eligible names parties have submitted as potential candidates for prime minister.

The caretaker prime minister and leader of the Bhumjaithai Party, Anutin , 59, secured the top post in September last year by outmanoeuvring the ruling Pheu Thai party just hours after a court sacked then-premier Paetongtarn Shinawatra .

His frenetic lobbying for support from Paetongtarn's coalition partners and the opposition underlines his credentials as a seasoned political dealmaker willing to work with any party to get in government.

Bhumjaithai was not a contender in the 2023 and 2019 elections, taking 71 and 51 seats respectively, but it was enough to win the staunch royalist key positions such as interior and health minister and deputy prime minister.

In a volatile political climate fraught with bitter rivalries, Anutin has been a rare bridge between warring political elites, giving him significant pull across party lines.

Though considered a conservative, he famously led a successful campaign to decriminalise cannabis in Thailand.

Bhumjaithai's short stint as ruling party and a slew of defections from other parties could give the former construction tycoon Anutin a stronger hand this time.

Staying on as prime minister will depend on his bargaining power as much as it will the ballot box.

Natthaphong, 38, is a former businessman and software engineer who ran a cloud service firm after university.

He was elected to parliament in 2019 with the progressive Future Forward Party, a forerunner for the Move Forward Party and its latest incarnation, People's Party .

The fan of video games played a crucial role in overseeing the online strategy of his parties, with Move Forward's mastery of social media campaigning key to its 2023 election victory.

After a court dissolved Move Forward in August 2024 and banned its top leaders for planning to amend a law that protects the monarchy from criticism, Natthaphong was unveiled as leader of its successor People's Party before becoming Thailand's youngest Leader of the Opposition in parliament.

Yodchanan , 46, is the son of former Prime Minister Somchai Wongsawat and part of the billionaire Shinawatra clan, the founders of the Pheu Thai party , and the dominant force in Thai politics for much of the last 25 years.

An engineer by training, Yodchanan spent most of his adult life in academia and is a professor in biomedical engineering at Bangkok's Mahidol University.

A political novice, his only government role has been as adviser on technology policies to the last Pheu Thai-led administration. He has big shoes to fill.

In a recent Reuters interview , he described himself as a very small guy, "on the shoulder of a giant", referring to his uncle, the polarising, currently jailed tycoon and former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra.

His aunt is ex-premier Yingluck Shinawatra. Both were toppled in military coups.

Yodchanan's cousin Paetongtarn Shinawatra was also prime minister and like his father, she was removed from power by a Constitutional Court verdict, as were two other premiers from outside the family. In all, six prime ministers under Pheu Thai or its previous incarnations were ousted.

If Yodchanan gets the top job, history would suggest it may not end well .

Career diplomat Sihasak, 67, is Thailand's foreign minister on his first foray into politics with the Bhumjaithai Party in its effort to recruit expertise and technocrats.

A former Thai ambassador to Japan, France and the United Nations in Geneva, Sihasak is well known in Southeast Asia and joins Anutin as the second of Bhumjaithai's two eligible candidates for premier.

Srikanya, 44, is deputy leader of the People's Party, a role she held with Move Forward. She had initially been tipped to become leader of the progressive movement when Move Forward was disbanded.

Educated in Thailand and France and holder of two master's degrees, Srikanya was Move Forward's finance minister-designate in 2023 before its attempt to form a government was blocked .

Abhisit , 61, was prime minister from 2008 to 2011 during major bouts of political violence and came to office only after a court removed two other premiers.

Media-savvy and a skilled orator, Abhisit was born and brought up in Britain, studying at Eton College and Oxford University, and holds Thai and British nationality.

Once backed by Thailand's conservative establishment, Abhisit's Democrat Party has been in decline but seeks to reinvent itself and could play an important role in government formation.

He has recently been a more neutral figure in politics and a return as prime minister should not be ruled out if crisis and deadlock ensue.

Veerayooth, 46, has a doctorate from Britain's Cambridge University and lectured in Japan before becoming an economic adviser to Move Forward. He is the third candidate of the People's Party's, a backup if Natthaphong and Sirikanya are banned by a court, as happened to its last two leaders.

They are among 44 former Move Forward lawmakers being investigated on accusations of ethics breaches for attempting to amend the royal insult law in 2021. If that case goes to the Supreme Court, they could face long political bans.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 02:05:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/PYUVKWBOHJN7JA7MPABX6EPPLE.jpg?auth=84536b0157ea65a3117eb555656532960588f7b9fe0f02b5d6f6b6482fe921ae&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US condemns South Africa's expulsion of Israeli diplomat</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/us-condemns-south-africas-expulsion-israeli-diplomat-2026-02-04/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Feb 3 (Reuters) - The United States on Tuesday condemned South Africa's decision to expel Israel's top diplomat last week, a State Department spokesperson said, calling the African nation's step a part of prioritizing "grievance politics."

"Expelling a diplomat for calling out the African National Congress party's ties to Hamas and other antisemitic radicals prioritizes grievance politics over the good of South Africa and its citizens," Tommy Pigott, the State Department's deputy spokesperson, said on X.

South Africa's embassy in Washington had no immediate comment.

On Friday, South Africa declared the top diplomat at Israel's embassy persona non grata and ordered him out within 72 hours.

It accused him of "unacceptable violations of diplomatic norms and practice," including insulting South Africa's president.

Israel responded by expelling South Africa's senior diplomatic representative to its country.

Israel and South Africa have had strained relations since South Africa in 2024 brought a genocide case in the International Court of Justice against Israel over its assault on Gaza.

Multiple rights groups, experts and scholars have also called Israel's assault a genocide. Israel denies that and called its actions self-defense following an October 2023 Hamas attack.

The genocide case has also contributed to U.S. President Donald Trump's attacks on Pretoria, including verbal scolding, trade sanctions and an executive order last year cutting U.S. funding.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 02:06:33 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran demands Oman venue for US talks as tensions rise in Middle East</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260204-iran-demands-oman-venue-for-us-talks-as-tensions-rise-in-middle-east</link><description>Iran is demanding that talks with the US this week be held in Oman , not Turkey, and that the scope be narrowed to two-way negotiations on nuclear issues only, a regional source said on Tuesday, adding new complications to an already delicate diplomatic effort.

Iran's move to change the venue and agenda for the talks, scheduled for Friday in Istanbul, comes amid heightened tensions as the US builds up forces in the Middle East .

Regional players have pushed for a resolution of a standoff that has led to mutual threats of air strikes and stirred fears of escalation into a wider war.

The US military on Tuesday shot down an Iranian drone that “aggressively” approached the Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea, the US military said, in an incident first reported by Reuters.

US President Donald Trump , who warned on Monday that “bad things” would probably happen if a deal could not be reached with Iran, told reporters at the White House on Tuesday: “We are negotiating with them right now.” He did not elaborate and declined to say where he expected the talks to take place.

The regional diplomat with knowledge of Iran's demands said Tehran sought “to change the format, they want to change the scope.”

“They only want to discuss the nuclear file with the Americans, while the US wants to include other topics such as the (ballistic) missiles and the activities of Iran's proxies in the region.”

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News that talks with Iran were still scheduled to take place later this week.

Iran's foreign ministry spokesperson said consultations on the venue were still under way, Iranian Nour News reported later on Tuesday. The spokesperson said planning has been carried out to hold the negotiations in the coming days and that Turkey , Oman and several other countries had expressed readiness to host the meeting.

A source familiar with the situation said earlier on Tuesday that Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner was due to take part in the talks, along with US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Aragchi.

Ministers from several other countries in the region, including Pakistan, Saudi Arabia , Qatar, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, had also been expected to attend, but the regional source told Reuters that Tehran now wants only bilateral talks with the US.

The US naval buildup follows Iran's violent crackdown against anti-government demonstrations last month.

Trump, who stopped short of carrying out threats to intervene, has since demanded nuclear concessions from Iran and sent a flotilla to its coast.

The priority of the diplomatic effort is to avoid conflict and de-escalate tension, a second regional official told Reuters earlier.

Iran’s leadership is increasingly worried a US strike could break its grip on power by driving an already enraged public back onto the streets, according to six current and former Iranian officials.

With tensions running high, an Iranian Shahed-139 drone flying toward the Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier “with unclear intent” was shot down by an F-35 US fighter jet, the US military said.

Iran's Tasnim news agency said connection had been lost with a drone in international waters, but the reason was unknown.

US Central Command said in another incident on Tuesday, this one in the Strait of Hormuz, Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps forces harassed a US-flagged tanker.

“Two IRGC boats and an Iranian Mohajer drone approached M/V Stena Imperative at high speeds and threatened to board and seize the tanker,” said Navy Captain Tim Hawkins, a spokesperson for Central Command.

Maritime risk management group Vanguard said the Iranian boats ordered the tanker to stop its engine and prepare to be boarded. Instead, the tanker sped up and continued its voyage.

Hawkins said a US Navy warship, the McFaul, was operating in the area and escorted the Stena Imperative, which was “proceeding safely.”

Earlier, the United Arab Emirates , a highly influential Gulf Arab oil producer and close US ally, said the region cannot afford another conflict and negotiations are needed.

Gulf Arab states are worried that Iran will carry out its threat to target US bases on their territory should Trump attack the Islamic Republic again.

In June, the United States struck Iranian nuclear targets, joining in at the close of a 12-day Israeli bombing campaign. Since then, Tehran has said its uranium enrichment work – which it says is for peaceful, not military, purposes – has stopped.

Iranian sources told Reuters last week that Trump had demanded three conditions for the resumption of talks: zero enrichment of uranium in Iran, limits on Tehran's ballistic missile programme, and ending its support for regional proxies.

Iran has long said all three demands are unacceptable infringements of its sovereignty, but two Iranian officials told Reuters that its clerical rulers saw the ballistic missile programme, rather than uranium enrichment, as the bigger obstacle.

One Iranian official said there should be no preconditions and Tehran is ready to show flexibility on uranium enrichment, including handing over 400 kg of highly enriched uranium, accepting zero enrichment.

Tehran's regional influence has been weakened by Israel's attacks on its proxies – from Hamas in Gaza to Hezbollah in Lebanon , the Houthis in Yemen and militias in Iraq – as well as by the ousting of Iran's close ally, former Syrian President Bashar al-Assad .</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 02:07:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/acbd8a52-0151-11f1-bd4e-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26030462309994.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Art teacher critically injured by student in southern France school stabbing</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260204-student-stabs-teacher-in-french-art-school</link><description>A 14-year-old school student stabbed an art teacher in southern France on Tuesday, leaving the 60-year-old in critical condition, a prosecutor said.

The pupil stabbed the teacher at least three times and was subsequently arrested on suspicion of attempted murder , said Raphael Balland, the public prosecutor in the southern city of Toulon.

There were no known “religious or political connotations” at this stage, Balland said.

“All we know is that there had been tensions with this teacher recently, and that he was angry with her,” the prosecutor added during a press briefing.

France’s education minister, Edouard Geffray, headed to La Guicharde secondary school, where the stabbing took place, in the town of Sanary-sur-Mer.

“My thoughts immediately go out to the victim, her family and the entire educational community, whose deep shock I share,” he wrote on X.

President Emmanuel Macron was being kept up to date on the teacher’s condition, presidential aides said.

France has seen a series of incidents in which pupils have attacked teachers or other schoolchildren.

A 14-year-old schoolboy was last year charged with the murder of a teaching assistant after allegedly stabbing her to death in June.

He attacked the 31-year-old, a mother of a young boy, during a bag search in the eastern town of Nogent.

In a separate case, a student in April killed a girl and wounded several other pupils in a stabbing spree in the western city of Nantes.

Panama's Supreme Court last week ruled the contracts violated Panama's constitution by giving the company exclusive privileges and tax exemptions.

It is unclear how long the arbitration proceedings could take, although given the political sensitivities involving the U.S. and China and the complexity of the deal, it could drag on for a number of years, some analysts said.

"This is an example of the increasing interconnection between international trade, geopolitics and law," said Jason Karas, international disputes specialist and managing partner of Karas So LLP in association with Mishcon de Reya.

The decision and move to seek arbitration casts further doubt on the future ownership of the two ports, which CK Hutchison has operated for nearly three decades, and the company's planned $23 billion deal to sell its port businesses.

"The board strongly disagrees with the determination and corresponding actions in Panama," CK Hutchison said in a statement to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

"The group continues to consult with its legal counsel and reserves all rights, including recourse to additional national and international legal proceedings in the matter."

The Panamanian government did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Ja Ian Chong, an associate professor of political science at the National University of Singapore, said international arbitration proceedings usually take a few years, and it is voluntary for a state to honour the decision.

"Panama can just ignore CK Hutchison ... I think that’s apparent to CK Hutch. They probably want to show to shareholders that they are doing all they legally can," he said.

The conglomerate may also want to show the Beijing and Hong Kong governments it is doing all it can to "avoid blame" amid China and U.S. tension, he added.

CK Hutchison's shares were up 2% on Wednesday in early trade, while the Hang Seng Index (.HSI) , opens new tab was down 0.4%.

China on Tuesday warned Panama there would be "heavy prices" to pay for the court ruling which it called "absurd" and "shameful and pathetic".

The two Panama Canal ports are at the heart of a $23 billion buyout bid led by BlackRock (BLK.N) , opens new tab and Mediterranean Shipping Company of CK Hutchison's 43 ports in 23 countries. BlackRock and MSC did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters.

After Beijing criticised the deal, the conglomerate said in July it was in talks to include a Chinese "major strategic investor" in the consortium.

Sources have said the Chinese investor is COSCO (1199.HK) , opens new tab , and it was seeking a large stake, while the others were keen for it to be a minority shareholder, a position that became a sticking point in talks.

The court ruling has made the future of the deal unclear, but some analysts think a transaction can be finalised without the two Panama Canal ports included in the portfolio of assets.

"The deal may continue with the remaining ports. The twist is that with the two key ports' situation crystallized by the Panama Supreme Court, actually the ports deal may have a clearer path to completion, from the legal perspective," said Winston Ma, New York University School of Law adjunct professor.

He said CK Hutchison could use the arbitration process to seek damages and compensation for having the contracts annulled.

The deal opened a new front in contention between the United States and China, as they grapple for control of the world's most important trade routes.

CK Hutchison's Balboa and Cristobal ports are considered strategic assets in the Panama Canal, the main seaborne trading route into the United States. Balboa is at the canal's Pacific entrance while Cristobal is at the Atlantic entrance.

The Panamanian court decision was welcomed by some U.S. lawmakers as a "win for America". President Donald Trump, who initially celebrated the proposed $23-billion ports sale, has called for the U.S. to "take back" the Panama Canal in the face of Chinese influence.

APM Terminals Panama, a Maersk (MAERSKb.CO) , opens new tab subsidiary, said on Friday it was willing to operate the Balboa and Cristobal terminals temporarily, to prevent any impact on regional and global trade.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 04:20:16 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BN6V5K3NPRLPZMAT5U2BJ4DIX4.jpg?auth=033cc7e68c308371d0182b21779f3a662d1a40a090eb0420caa71205fb1e3c3f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Maduro supporters rally in Caracas a month after US-led ouster</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260204-maduro-supporters-rally-in-caracas</link><description>Thousands of backers of Venezuela’s former leader Nicolas Maduro , who was ousted in a deadly US military operation, marched in Caracas on Tuesday to demand his freedom.

“Venezuela needs Nicolas,” chanted the crowd, a month to the day since he was spectacularly toppled and whisked away to stand trial on drug charges in New York.

Interim president Delcy Rodriguez has been walking a tightrope since then – trying to hold on to support from Washington but also from Maduro acolytes in her government and the Venezuelan people.

Several demonstrators, many of them public sector workers, held photos of Maduro and of his wife, Cilia Flores, who was also seized in the US raid.

The march, called by the government, stretched for several hundred metres, accompanied by trucks blaring music.

“These people are not American ,” said Maduro’s son, Nicolas “Nicolasito” Maduro Guerra, a deputy in Venezuela ’s National Assembly.

“We have achieved a profound anti-imperialist consciousness.”

Many protesters waved Venezuelan flags and were dressed in the red colours of the ruling “Chavista” movement named after Maduro’s socialist predecessor, Hugo Chavez .

“We feel confused, sad, angry. There are a lot of emotions,” said Jose Perdomo, a 58-year-old municipal employee who also declared his backing “for the decisions taken by our interim president, Delcy Rodriguez”.

He added that “sooner or later they will have to free our president”.

Rodriguez was a staunch backer of Maduro and served as his vice president.

US President Donald Trump has said he is willing to work with her as long as she toes Washington’s line, particularly on granting access to Venezuela’s vast oil reserves .

Under pressure, Rodriguez has started freeing political prisoners and opened Venezuela’s nationalised hydrocarbons industry to private investment.

The countries have rekindled diplomatic relations severed in 2019 after Maduro was accused of stealing his first re-election, with American envoy Laura Dogu’s arrival in Caracas on Saturday.

On Tuesday, in a video issued by the US mission, she pointed to a three-phase plan for the crisis-stricken South American country, ending in “the transition to a friendly, stable, prosperous and democratic Venezuela”.

Rodriguez confirmed the meeting, calling it a “frank conversation”.

Earlier on Tuesday, hundreds of university students and relatives of political prisoners also marched in the capital, calling for the quick approval of an amnesty law promised by Rodriguez.

Rodriguez said Tuesday she is working “intensely” on the amnesty law “that would allow us, in this whole period of political violence, of extremism, to carry out a national policy”.

The law has not yet come before parliament, whose leader is the acting president’s brother, Jorge Rodriguez, another staunch Chavista and Maduro backer.

Opposition deputy Stalin Gonzalez told AFP he expects the first debate on amnesty to be brought to the floor on Thursday.

“I hope that the amnesty opens the door to reconciliation, coexistence, peace and democracy,” he said.

Anti-government protests had been rare since the crackdown on demonstrations against Maduro’s contested claim to another re-election in 2024.

More than 2,000 people were jailed at the time.

“Freedom is in the streets and no one can stop it!” chanted the crowd.

The opposition in Venezuela has been calling for fresh elections to be held after Maduro’s ouster .</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 04:20:47 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/0ab086a4-0103-11f1-b73f-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-29T201700Z-1724631766-RC28BJA5NSKC-RTRMADP-3-VENEZUELA-OIL-LAW-MARCH.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Rights group condemns detention of Chinese journalists after corruption report</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/rights-group-condemns-detention-chinese-journalists-after-corruption-report-2026-02-04/</link><description>BEIJING, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Reporters Without Borders (RSF) late on Tuesday condemned the detention of two independent Chinese journalists, one a prominent investigative reporter, after they published a story alleging corruption by a local official in southwestern China.

The Paris-headquartered advocacy group said journalists Wu Yingjiao and Liu Hu, who gained national recognition more than a decade ago for uncovering graft among high-profile figures, were detained on Sunday in China's Sichuan province.

Police in Chengdu, the provincial capital of Sichuan, said in a statement on Monday they were investigating a 50-year-old man surnamed Liu, a 34-year-old man surnamed Wu and others on suspicion of "making false accusations" and "illegal business operations."

The statement added that they had been placed under "criminal coercive measures" - a legal term that typically refers to detention.

The authorities only provided their surnames, but several Chinese media and RSF identified the two as Liu Hu and Wu Yingjiao.

Police authorities in Chengdu did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

The arrests followed the January 29 publication of a co-authored investigative report on the social media platform WeChat which examinined alleged corruption involving Pu Fayou, the Communist Party secretary of Pujiang county in Sichuan.

Pu could not be immediately reached for comment.

The report has since been deleted from WeChat, a common step taken by censors in cases involving sensitive government exposes.

Liu is a former investigative reporter at New Express. He was detained by Beijing police in 2013 on charges of "picking quarrels and provoking trouble" for allegedly "fabricating and spreading rumours", but was later released on bail after spending 364 days in detention, said RSF.

Aleksandra Bielakowska, RSF's advocacy manager for the Asia-Pacific region, said the detention of the two journalists highlights a "restrictive and hostile" environment for independent reporting in China.

"We call on the international community to intensify pressure on the Chinese regime, rather than pursue a normalisation of relations that only enables further repression and allows the authorities to continue targeting reliable reporters," Bielakowska said.

Leaders of many democratic nations from South Korea, Canada to the United Kingdom have visited Beijing this year as they seek to improve relations with China amid ongoing trade and security tensions with the United States.

China ranked 178 out of 180 in the 2025 Reporters Without Borders Press Freedom Index.

Guardiola was speaking at a pre‑match press conference ahead of City's League Cup semifinal second leg against Newcastle United, five days after he voiced support for children in the occupied Palestinian territories at a charity concert in Barcelona.

"Never, ever in the history of humanity have we had the information in front of our eyes watching more clearly than now," Guardiola told reporters on Tuesday in Manchester.

"The genocide in Palestine, what happened in Ukraine, what happened in Russia, what happened all around the world - in Sudan, everywhere," he said, referring to the Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories.

"What happened in front of us? Do you want to see it? It's our problems as human beings. It's our problems."

He said society must work collectively to improve.

"Look what happened in the United States of America, Renee Good and Alex Pretti were killed. Tell me how you can defend that," Guardiola said. The fatal shootings of the two U.S. citizens by federal immigration agents sparked widespread protests in the United States.

"When I see the images, I am sorry it hurts. That is why in every position I can help speak up to be a better society, I will try and will be there. All the time. It is for my kids, my families, for you.

Saturday's wave of coordinated attacks by the separatist Baloch Liberation Army brought Pakistan's largest province to a near standstill as security forces exchanged fire with insurgents in more than a dozen places, killing 197 militants.

"I thought the roof and walls of my house were going to blow up," said Robina Ali, a housewife living near the main administrative building in the fortified provincial capital of Quetta, where a powerful morning blast rocked the area.

Fighters of the BLA, the region's strongest insurgent group , stormed schools, banks, markets and security installations across Balochistan in one of their largest operations ever, killing more than 22 security officials and 36 civilians.

Police officials gave details of the situation on condition of anonymity as they were not authorised to speak to the media.

In the desert town of Nushki, home to about 50,000, the insurgents seized control of the police station and other security installations, triggering a three-day standoff.

Police said seven officers were killed in the fighting before they regained control of the town late on Monday, while operations against the BLA continue elsewhere in the province.

"More troops were sent to Nushki," said one security official. "Helicopters and drones were used against the militants."

Pakistan's interior ministry did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Pakistan's largest and poorest province, mineral-rich Balochistan borders Iran and Afghanistan and is home to Beijing's investment in the Gwadar deepwater port and other projects.

It has grappled with a decades-long insurgency led by ethnic Baloch separatists seeking greater autonomy and a larger share of its natural resources.

The BLA, which has urged people of the province to support the movement, said on Tuesday it had killed 280 soldiers during its Operation "Herof", Black Storm, but gave no evidence.

Security officials said the weekend attacks began at 4 a.m. on Saturday with suicide blasts in Nushki and the fishing port of Pasni and gun and grenade attacks in 11 more places, including Quetta.

The insurgents seized at least six district administration offices during the siege and had advanced at one point to within 1 km (3,300 ft) of the provincial chief minister's office in Quetta, the police officials said.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 06:53:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/SVEJ5NU7MNNEDFNEKCH5X6PLIY.jpg?auth=a64f66e197e9d7b214f62f72367754736dc0465e49b34be95ed906d26751b1ad&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Handbags and hashtags: Japan's Takaichi rides youth-led craze into election</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/handbags-hashtags-japans-takaichi-rides-youth-led-craze-into-election-2026-02-04/</link><description>TOKYO, Feb 4 (Reuters) - The handbag she carries is sold out, her pink pen has gone viral and even her favourite snacks are in hot demand: Japan's 64-year-old leader Sanae Takaichi has sparked an unlikely youth-led craze that could propel her to a big election win.

Polls suggest 'sanakatsu', roughly translated as 'sanamania', can help give Japan's first female prime minister a decisive mandate in Sunday's general election and unleash the spending plans she has promised will jolt the country's moribund economy.

Backed by her personal popularity, her ruling coalition could capture as many as 300 seats in the 465-seat lower house, polls this week showed, a remarkable turnaround given her predecessor resigned after losing control of both chambers in ballots over the last 15 months.

What's perhaps even more surprising is the appeal of the staunchly conservative leader with voters under 30, estimated by one recent poll at over 90%. Her overall popularity stands at around 60%.

Takanori Kobayashi, director at Hamano, the company that makes the $900 black leather bag that Takaichi regularly totes, says he has been stunned by the young people clamouring to buy the item on a nine-month backlog.

"The bag is usually bought by people in their forties or fifties," Kobayashi said at the company's factory in Nagano, central Japan, where press clippings of the prime minister are pinned to a notice board.

"But since it became well known, probably through social media, we have seen a lot of interest from customers in their twenties and thirties."

There has been a similar online buzz around the pink ballpoint pen she uses to scribble notes in parliament and the shrimp rice crackers she was seen clutching while riding a train.

Takaichi has built a social media following that dwarfs those of her rivals, both inside her ruling Liberal Democratic Party and across the opposition. She has about 2.6 million followers on X, compared with around 64,000 for Yoshihiko Noda, leader of the main opposition party.

Takaichi's personal approval ratings are almost double that of the LDP, traditionally a male-dominated party, according to a poll released on Monday by public broadcaster NHK.

Her viral posts stand out in Japan's usually staid politics, such as clips of her drumming to the hit song Golden from Netflix's K-Pop Demon Hunters with South Korean President Lee Jae-myung, or serenading Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni with 'Happy Birthday' in Italian.

When Takaichi announced the snap poll on January 19, she cast the vote as a de facto referendum on her leadership and policies, including fiscal expansion and a plans to strengthen defences to counter China's growing military might.

"Can you entrust the management of the nation to Sanae Takaichi? I ask the people directly to judge," she said.

She surprised voters and politicians with an election "to get an endorsement in a way that is actually rather presidential," said Koichi Nakano, a political science professor at Sophia University in Tokyo.

Takaichi's approach has won over Haruka Okuyama, a 32-year-old office worker who attended her first campaign rally in Akihabara, an anime and gaming culture hub in central Tokyo.

"A lot of young people follow social media these days, and I think there’s been an increase in conservative thinking among them," Okuyama said, pulling a magazine from her bag that she said she bought because Takaichi was on the cover.

Perched atop a campaign truck outside Akihabara station, Takaichi spoke about her modest upbringing outside Japan's political elite, and covered topics from the cost of hair salons to controlling immigration.

Takaichi, whose mother was a police officer and father worked at a car company, has said she has drawn inspiration from Margaret Thatcher , the daughter of a shopkeeper who became Britain's first female and longest-serving modern premier.

"She has a clear, decisive way of speaking," said Takeo Fujimura, a 24-year-old clerical worker who had volunteered to hand out paper Japanese flags at the event. "She communicates in a bright, positive way and I think that energy resonates with young people."

Not everyone at the rally had made up their mind.

Tomomi Kawamura, a 37-year old housewife, said she admired Takaichi's social media savvy, but was undecided on who to vote for. Rising prices were her main worry, she said, echoing concerns among other voters that the yen's slide - triggered in part by Takaichi's promised fiscal largesse - is fuelling inflation.

"Prices are so high," Kawamura said. "I want something done about that."

Some analysts question whether enough of the youth the prime minister has attracted will turn out to deliver the landslide that polls predict she will win on Sunday. Younger people have historically been less likely to vote than older generations that have underpinned the LDP's near unbroken post-war rule.

But even a modest win would underline how her personal appeal has single-handedly revived the fortunes of a party whose long grip on power was slipping fast, said David Boling, a principal at The Asia Group, a strategic advisory firm .

"The power of her personality seems to be transcending politics," he said.

Trade Minister Le Manh Hung met with several U.S. companies in the energy and technology sectors, including executives from Apple, Exxon Mobil, GE, AES and Excelerate Energy, according to a statement from the ministry.

The White House in October said the United States and Vietnam would finalise a trade agreement that will keep tariffs on most Vietnamese goods at 20% but remove duties on certain products.

Vietnam's shipments to the United States, its largest export market, reached a record high of $153 billion last year, despite the tariffs.

During the trip, trade minister Hung witnessed the signing of several memorandums of understanding with U.S. companies to buy American crude oil, ethanol and corn, Vietnam state media reported on Wednesday.

The MOUs were signed with Chevron, Marquis Energy and ADM Asia-Pacific Trading in Washington, the Vietnam News Agency reported.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 06:54:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CJGKTS5MNRKJFLMEA5MZO5OXPI.jpg?auth=0d55f47cf0074e623fffac30bf64eb52ef1dd5ebda7f8427e24b44c43237808f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US renews trade pact with African countries, bringing tariff relief</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260204-us-renews-trade-pact-with-african-countries-bringing-tariff-relief</link><description>The United States on Tuesday renewed the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) through the end of the year, an agreement that allows many African countries to access the US market duty-free.

US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said in a statement that President Donald Trump had signed into law a reauthorisation of the trade preference program through December 31, 2026, with retroactive effect from September 30, 2025 – the date it had expired.

"AGOA for the 21st century must demand more from our trading partners and yield more market access for US businesses, farmers, and ranchers," Greer said.

Trump has used trade and tariffs – which he has called his "favorite word" – as a carrot and a stick to reshape international relations, as he sees fit.

In a statement, Greer vowed to "work with Congress over the next year to modernise the program to align with" current US policy.

A cornerstone of US-Africa trade relations for 25 years, the AGOA has allowed the United States to buy billions of dollars of duty-free cars, clothes and other items from select African countries each year.

But the deal, which operates in 32 African nations, expired last September, affecting thousands of jobs and forcing exporters to absorb high tariff duties.

In 2024, $8.23 billion worth of goods were exported under the accord, half of which came from South Africa , mainly cars, precious metals and farm produce, and one fifth from Nigeria , mainly oil and other energy products, according to the United States International Trade Commission (USITC).

Smaller countries were hard hit, too. Lesotho 's textiles sector, the country's biggest employer, was hard hit by AGOA's expiration, and hundreds of workers demonstrated in the capital Maseru in late October against cuts sparked by the new American customs tariffs .

Negotiators from Ukraine, Russia and the United States were set to gather in Abu Dhabi on Wednesday, seeking to advance fraught talks on how to end the four-year war.

Several rounds of diplomacy between the sides have failed to strike a deal on ending Europe's deadliest conflict since World War II, which began when Russia invaded in February 2022.

The main sticking point is the long-term fate of territory in eastern Ukraine.

Moscow is demanding that Kyiv pull its troops out of swathes of the Donbas, including heavily fortified cities atop vast natural resources, as a precondition of any deal. It also wants international recognition that land seized in the invasion belongs to Russia.

Kyiv has said the conflict should be frozen along the current front line and has rejected a unilateral pull-back of forces.

The former prince, 65, had hoped to stay at Royal Lodge, his Windsor home of decades, for longer, the Sun newspaper said, but he was moved under the cover of darkness on Monday and driven to a cottage in Sandringham, the king's Norfolk estate.

A royal source confirmed that he was now resident there, but that he might occasionally return to Windsor in the coming weeks while a transitionary phase was completed.

"With the latest batch of Epstein files it was made clear to him that it was time to go," the Sun quoted a friend as saying.

"Leaving was so humiliating for him that he chose to do it under the cover of darkness."

Charles stripped Andrew of his titles in October and said he would be moved after details emerged of his ongoing relationship with Epstein.

The king has also said that his sympathy is with the victims of abuse.

New files related to Epstein published by the U.S. Justice Department on Friday included emails suggesting that Andrew maintained regular contact with Epstein for more than two years after he was found guilty of child sex crimes.

He has denied wrongdoing in connection with Epstein and had previously denied maintaining ties with the financier after Epstein's 2008 conviction, apart from a 2010 visit to New York to end their relationship.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 07:44:19 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/PMQZWJNIFNPCBCYPEXRIX4LNUQ.jpg?auth=e7dc9365afc943b2416d908db896437d10f6b1947bbea121653f5c07021c5922&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Taiwan must pass defence spending to avoid giving wrong impression, president says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/taiwan-must-pass-defence-spending-avoid-giving-wrong-impression-president-says-2026-02-04/</link><description>TAIPEI, Feb 4 (Reuters) - If Taiwan's opposition-controlled parliament continues to block $40 billion in proposed extra defence spending the international community could misunderstand the island's determination to defend itself, President Lai Ching-te said on Wednesday.

Pressure from politicans in the United States, Chinese-claimed Taiwan's most important international backer and arms supplier despite a lack of formal diplomatic ties, has grown on parliament not to hold up defence spending.

On Monday, U.S. Senator Roger Wicker, chairman of the Armed Services Committee and one of the strongest advocates for Taiwan in the U.S. Congress, wrote on X that he was "disappointed" to see Taiwan's opposition parties slash Lai's defence budget.

At a meeting of his Democratic Progressive Party, Lai said if the opposition continued blocking the plans and presses on with their own version, "This is bound to delay improvements to defence capabilities".

That "could lead the international community to misunderstand Taiwan's determination to defend itself and to safeguard peace in the Indo-Pacific", Lai added, in comments provided by his party.

Another U.S. lawmaker, Republican Senator Dan Sullivan, a staunch Trump administration supporter, directly criticised the Kuomintang (KMT), Taiwan's largest opposition party, senior officials of which are now visiting Beijing .

"It doesn't take a genius to figure out what's going on here," he said on X, in reference to the visit. "I've warned before - short changing Taiwan's defence to kowtow to the CCP is playing with fire."

Taiwan's opposition-dominated parliament has blocked Lai's budget plan , including missiles and drones as well as the new "T-Dome" air defence system, pushing instead for a proposal to fund only certain U.S. arms, rather than the entire package.

The KMT says while it supports strengthening Taiwan's defences, it has a right to fully scrutinise government spending plans and will not sign "blank cheques".

"We thank members of the U.S. Senate for their valuable input," it said in an English-language statement.

"The KMT remains fully committed to safeguarding Taiwan's security, strengthening our defence capabilities, and also engaging constructively through dialogue to advance peace and stability across the Strait."

China regularly stages military exercises around Taiwan, and refuses to talk to Lai, calling him a "separatist". Lai says only Taiwan's people can decide their future.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 07:45:39 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5425YUFTENKQBG7WGKZHER7FHQ.jpg?auth=c15a44c62d88d53bd890cb9879fd098f316a34141e21e616c95f22c8abab0046&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Philippines House panel finds bid to impeach Marcos lacks substance</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/philippines-house-panel-finds-bid-impeach-marcos-lacks-substance-2026-02-04/</link><description>MANILA, Feb 4 (Reuters) - The Philippine House justice committee on Wednesday said two impeachment complaints against President Ferdinand Marcos Jr, accusing him of corruption, violating the constitution and betraying public trust, were lacking in substance.

On a third day of discussions about the complaints filed separately by a lawyer and activists, the committee overwhelmingly decided both lacked merit. Marcos, who is midway through his term in office, had denied wrongdoing.

The House of Representatives is expected to convene for a plenary vote where it could either uphold the committee's findings or override the decisions. The chamber is currently dominated by loyalists of the president.

The committee did not announce the next steps to be taken to handle the two complaints.

For Marcos to be impeached it must be supported by at least one-third of the lower house. If that happens, he would be the second Philippine head of state to be impeached after Joseph Estrada, whose 2001 trial was aborted when some prosecutors walked out.

The complaints against Marcos included his decision to allow his predecessor Rodrigo Duterte to be arrested and taken to The Hague to face trial at the International Criminal Court over thousands of killings during his notorious "war on drugs".

Marcos, 68, was also accused of abusing his authority in spending public funds that led to a corruption scandal involving flood-control projects. His alleged drug use , which he has denied, also made him unfit to run the country, according to one of the complaints.

If the lower house decides to impeach him, the Senate would be required to convene for trial, where its 24 members serve as jurors.

Five top officials have been impeached in the Philippines and only one of those, a former chief justice, was convicted and removed from office.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 07:46:10 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/NQACGGZCYVP7TBKCUUODCCB2QI.jpg?auth=7dfc8f88aab402ba7f0bd7c562e57b0d3f70eed2a5bbbda8e15ae2ef61a02d38&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>At least 35 killed as bandits raid Kwara state community, lawmaker says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/least-35-killed-bandits-raid-kwara-state-community-lawmaker-says-2026-02-04/</link><description>BAUCHI, Nigeria, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Armed bandits killed at least 35 people and burned homes and shops during an attack late on Tuesday on a remote community in Nigeria's north-central Kwara State, a state lawmaker said on Wednesday.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 08:43:19 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/J2OT46IMSVO2LHG3HHCW3T5WGM.jpg?auth=1bb42dc711388997fd45b2f1aac58ca16ebd233c55b315fd77faa5f6343d7aff&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US and Iran to hold nuclear talks in Oman amid heightened tensions, diplomat says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/us-iran-hold-nuclear-talks-oman-amid-heightened-tensions-diplomat-says-2026-02-04/</link><description>DUBAI, Feb 4 - Nuclear talks between the United States and Iran are expected to take place in Oman on Friday, a regional diplomat said, with a possible confrontation looming as U.S. President Donald Trump builds up forces in the Middle East.

Trump has warned that "bad things" would probably happen if a deal could not be reached, ratcheting up pressure on the Islamic Republic in a standoff that has led to mutual threats of air strikes and stirred fears of escalation into a wider war.

Iran has said it will not make concessions on its formidable ballistic missile programme, calling that a red line in negotiations.

The Trump administration agreed to an Iranian request to move the talks from Turkey and negotiations are still ongoing about whether Arab and Muslim countries from the region will join the talks in Oman, Axios reporter Barak Ravid said on Tuesday, citing an Arab source.

The U.S. military on Tuesday an Iranian drone that "aggressively" approached the Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea, the U.S. military said, in an incident first reported by Reuters.

Trump told reporters at the White House on Tuesday: "We are negotiating with them right now." But he did not elaborate and declined to say where he expected the talks to take place.

A source familiar with the situation said Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, was due to take part in the talks, along with U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi.

Ministers from several other countries in the region including Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates had also been expected to attend, but the regional source told Reuters that Tehran now wanted only bilateral talks with the U.S.

The U.S. naval buildup follows Iran's violent crackdown against anti-government demonstrations last month in the deadliest domestic unrest in Iran since its 1979 revolution.

Trump, who stopped short of carrying out threats to intervene, has since demanded nuclear concessions from Iran and sent a flotilla to its coast.

The priority of the diplomatic effort is to avoid conflict and de-escalate tension, a regional official told Reuters earlier.

a U.S. strike could break its grip on power by driving an already enraged public back onto the streets, according to six current and former Iranian officials.

With tensions running high, an Iranian Shahed-139 drone flying toward the Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier "with unclear intent" was shot down by an F-35 U.S. fighter jet on Tuesday, the U.S. military said.

Iran's Tasnim news agency said connection had been lost with a drone in international waters, but the reason was unknown.

The U.S. Central Command said in another incident on Tuesday, this one in the Strait of Hormuz, Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps forces harassed a U.S.-flagged tanker.

"Two IRGC boats and an Iranian Mohajer drone approached M/V Stena Imperative at high speeds and threatened to board and seize the tanker," Navy Captain Tim Hawkins, a spokesperson for the Central Command, said.

Maritime risk management group Vanguard said the Iranian boats ordered the tanker to stop its engine and prepare to be boarded. Instead, the tanker sped up and continued its voyage.

In June, the United States struck Iranian nuclear targets, joining in at the close of a 12-day Israeli bombing campaign. Since then, Tehran has said its uranium enrichment work - which it says is for peaceful, not military purposes - has stopped.

Iranian sources told Reuters last week that Trump had demanded three conditions for resumption of talks: zero enrichment of uranium in Iran, limits on Tehran's ballistic missile programme and ending its support for regional proxies.

Iran has long said all three demands are unacceptable infringements of its sovereignty, but two Iranian officials told Reuters its clerical rulers saw the ballistic missile programme, rather than uranium enrichment, as the bigger obstacle.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 08:43:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/QZRJR563SJOB5JV5OZVXNRWSAY.jpg?auth=03ff0310ce9bbab79d488f8bab76ddcebf93635bd0b0fca3a8add9da8207bd10&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Art teacher critically injured by student in southern France school stabbing</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260204-art-teacher-critically-injured-by-student-in-southern-france-school-stabbing</link><description>A 14-year-old school student stabbed an art teacher in southern France on Tuesday, leaving the 60-year-old in critical condition, a prosecutor said.

The pupil stabbed the teacher at least three times and was subsequently arrested on suspicion of attempted murder , said Raphael Balland, the public prosecutor in the southern city of Toulon.

There were no known “religious or political connotations” at this stage, Balland said.

“All we know is that there had been tensions with this teacher recently, and that he was angry with her,” the prosecutor added during a press briefing.

France’s education minister, Edouard Geffray, headed to La Guicharde secondary school, where the stabbing took place, in the town of Sanary-sur-Mer.

“My thoughts immediately go out to the victim, her family and the entire educational community, whose deep shock I share,” he wrote on X.

President Emmanuel Macron was being kept up to date on the teacher’s condition, presidential aides said.

France has seen a series of incidents in which pupils have attacked teachers or other schoolchildren.

A 14-year-old schoolboy was last year charged with the murder of a teaching assistant after allegedly stabbing her to death in June.

He attacked the 31-year-old, a mother of a young boy, during a bag search in the eastern town of Nogent.

In a separate case, a student in April killed a girl and wounded several other pupils in a stabbing spree in the western city of Nantes.

The Israeli military said tanks had fired on Gaza and airstrikes had been launched after a gunman shot at Israeli soldiers and seriously injured a reservist.

The strikes targeted Gaza City and the southern city of Khan Younis. A Gazan health official told Reuters that Israel had also halted the passage of patients through the Rafah border crossing to Egypt, two days after it had reopened , allowing a trickle of Palestinians to cross for the first time in months.

A spokesperson for the Red Crescent said patients had arrived at a hospital in Khan Younis in preparation for crossing Rafah for treatment, only to be informed that Israel had postponed the evacuations.

"They called the patients and said today there is no travel at all, the crossing is closed," Raja'a Abu Teir, a Palestinian patient who was set to be evacuated, told Reuters at the hospital, where several patients were waiting in ambulances.

The Israeli agency that controls access to Gaza, COGAT, said in a statement on Wednesday that Rafah crossing remained open, but they had not received the necessary coordination details from the World Health Organization to facilitate the crossing.

The WHO did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Reopening the crossing was one of the requirements under the October ceasefire that set out the first phase of U.S. President Donald Trump's plan to stop fighting between Israel and Palestinian Hamas militants .

Sixteen patients from Gaza and 40 of their escorts crossed into Egypt on Tuesday, Gazan medics told Reuters.

A Hamas police source told Reuters that at least 40 people crossed from Egypt to Gaza late on Tuesday.

In January, Trump declared the start of the second phase of the ceasefire where the sides would negotiate the shattered enclave's future governance and reconstruction.

Key issues like the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the over 50% of Gaza they currently occupy and the disarmament of Hamas remain unresolved, while the fragile ceasefire has been marked by near-daily violence.

Since the start of the ceasefire, Israeli fire has killed at least 530 people, most of them civilians, according to Gaza health officials. Palestinian militants have killed four Israeli soldiers in the same period, according to Israeli authorities.

Israel's two-year offensive on the Gaza Strip killed more than 71,000 Palestinians, according to Gazan health authorities, displaced most of its population, and left much of the strip in ruins.

The October 7, 2023, Hamas attack that triggered the war killed around 1,200 people in Israel, according to Israeli tallies.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 09:44:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CLV7RDLXPJKPTO7Y4ZYLURGBXM.jpg?auth=42fada67bff6559491d50b65642df68049ee6dd18aecb8127f700a005b6679b8&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Eswatini high court dismisses case challenging deal on U.S. deportees</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/eswatini-high-court-dismisses-case-challenging-deal-us-deportees-2026-02-04/</link><description>MBABANE, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Eswatini's high court has dismissed a case filed by human rights lawyers who argued that the government's deal with the United States to accept third-country deportees was unconstitutional, a copy of the judgment seen by Reuters on Wednesday showed.

The web of arms control deals negotiated in the decades since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, considered the closest the world ever came to intentional nuclear war, were aimed at reducing the chance of a catastrophic nuclear exchange.

Unless Washington and Moscow reach a last-minute understanding of some kind, the world's two biggest nuclear powers will be left without any limits for the first time in more than half a century when the New START treaty expires.

There was confusion about the exact time it would lapse, though arms control experts told Reuters they believed this would happen at 2300 GMT on Wednesday - midnight in Prague, where the treaty was signed in 2010.

Matt Korda, associate director for the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists, said that if there was no agreement to extend its key provisions, neither Russia nor the United States would be constrained if they wanted to add yet more warheads.

"Without the treaty, each side will be free to upload hundreds of additional warheads onto their deployed missiles and heavy bombers, roughly doubling the sizes of their currently deployed arsenals in the most maximalist scenario," he said.

Korda said it was important to recognise that the expiry of New START did not necessarily mean an arms race given the cost of nuclear weapons.

U.S. President Donald Trump has given different signals on arms control. He said last month that if the treaty expired , he would do a better agreement.

So far, Russian officials said, there has been no response from Washington on President Vladimir Putin's proposal to extend the limits of the treaty beyond expiry.

Total inventories of nuclear warheads declined to about 12,000 warheads in 2025 from a peak of more than 70,000 in 1986, but the United States and Russia are upgrading their weapons and China has more than doubled its arsenal over the past decade.

Arms control supporters in Moscow and Washington say the expiry of the treaty would not only remove limits on warheads but also damage confidence, trust and the ability to verify nuclear intentions.

Opponents of arms control on both sides say such benefits are nebulous at best and that such treaties hinder nuclear innovation by major powers, allow cheating and essentially narrow the room for manoeuvre of great powers.

Last year, Trump said that he wanted China to be part of arms control and questioned why the United States and Russia should build new nuclear weapons given that they had enough to destroy the world many times over.

"If there's ever a time when we need nuclear weapons like the kind of weapons that we're building and that Russia has and that China has to a lesser extent but will have, that's going to be a very sad day," he said in February last year.

"That's going to be probably oblivion."</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 09:44:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ZO6SHJLI25IELBXE4EBM67RY3E.jpg?auth=88629a5f5502bc21391ce529f02bb43424a0f80811335df826c56a1c9e8384af&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Storm Leo pounds Iberian Peninsula with torrential rains</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/storm-leo-pounds-iberian-peninsula-with-torrential-rains-2026-02-04/</link><description>RONDA, Spain, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Spanish and Portuguese authorities braced on Wednesday for the impact of Storm Leo, suspending classes in some areas and warning against travel, just one week after deadly Storm Kristin wreaked havoc across the Iberian Peninsula.

Spain's state meteorological agency AEMET forecast that some parts of the southern Sierra Grazalema may see rainfall equivalent to a full year of precipitation from the storm.

Authorities are concerned about the heightened risk of flooding as the ground remains saturated from the preceding storm and heavy rains last month.

Spain recorded 119.3 mm of rainfall in January, 85% above the 1992-2020 average, making it the second-wettest January of the 21st century, the Environment Ministry said.

The regional government in Spain's southern Andalusia region urged residents to avoid non-essential travel, warning that public safety alerts could quickly escalate to the highest red-alert level as the storm evolves, regional leader Juanma Moreno said.

In-person classes were suspended across the region, apart from in Almeria province, while Spain's Military Emergency Unit was on alert to provide a rapid response, including flood rescue, the stabilisation of landslide-prone areas and the monitoring of mining tailings ponds at risk of overflow.

Day centres for the elderly and disabled have been closed, and local governments in affected areas were advised to cancel outdoor sports activities, while about 3,000 people have been evacuated from areas most at risk of flooding.

High-risk regions include Grazalema, Campo de Gibraltar, Ronda and parts of Jaen, where residents received mobile alerts warning of the potential for heavy rainfall.

Emergency personnel, along with two aircraft and two helicopters, have been deployed to monitor flood-prone zones and provide real-time updates, Moreno said.

In Portugal, the national Civil Protection Service raised its preparedness to the highest level as its commander warned of a "very complex" meteorological situation ahead.

The Portuguese armed forces deployed up to 3,000 personnel and 42 inflatable boats with marine teams along flood-prone sections of the country's major rivers as weather conditions were forecast to worsen throughout the week.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 09:44:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LQJ4TA4PUJPI5HNG6IMUJNH5UI.jpg?auth=2f9ec97856b8eb53def28be0ed1bf8790f5690faf89535a5a78ddc8abb324b90&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Key South African coalition partner to get new leader in April</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/south-africas-da-leader-wont-seek-re-election-april-2026-02-04/</link><description>JOHANNESBURG, Feb 4 (Reuters) - South Africa's Democratic Alliance leader John Steenhuisen said on Wednesday that he would not seek re-election in the party's leadership contest in April but would continue in his role as agriculture minister.

Steenhuisen has led the pro-business DA since 2019 and has been overseeing the government's response to a worsening foot-and-mouth disease outbreak .

The DA is the second-biggest party in the coalition government formed in June 2024 after an election in which the African National Congress lost its parliamentary majority for the first time since the end of white minority rule in 1994.

"For the rest of this term of office, I will focus all of my time and energy as Minister of Agriculture on defeating the most devastating foot-and-mouth disease outbreak our country has ever seen," Steenhuisen told a press conference.

Political analysts say Cape Town Mayor Geordin Hill-Lewis, another senior DA member, is likely to stand for party leader in April and take over from Steenhuisen.

Steenhuisen has faced allegations that he used a party-issued credit card for personal expenses, although a DA investigation found no evidence that he had misappropriated funds.

"My term will be remembered for leading the DA into national government and putting South Africa on a new path to prosperity," he told reporters.

The DA has roughly 22% of seats in South Africa's lower house of parliament, while the ANC has 41%.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 09:45:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CRTJOWDTJBK3HC6RND6KFRQUB4.jpg?auth=537125b61297e65e37dff8a3bc42cd4970c0e682a75c38f2744611dc7d0b2be7&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>South Korea parliament to finalise bill on US investment fund by March 9</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/south-korea-parliament-finalise-bill-us-investment-fund-by-march-9-2026-02-04/</link><description>SEOUL, Feb 4 (Reuters) - South Korea's National Assembly has agreed to finalise a bill to make investments in the United States by March 9 under a trade deal between the countries, the ruling and main opposition parties said on Wednesday.

U.S. President Donald Trump threatened last week to hike tariffs on imports from South Korea, blaming a delay in enacting a trade deal in which the Asian ally promised to invest $350 billion in the United States.

A special committee will be set up on February 9 and have the power to draft the bill, which will be finalised by March 9, the two main parties' floor leaders said in a briefing.

South Korea's ruling Democratic Party in November introduced the bill to establish a special fund to finance the investment committed in the U.S. in return for lowering the tariffs to 15% on Korean autos.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 09:45:03 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/SG37C6AUHRJPJKROYZXZU4RZG4.jpg?auth=ab3f1b8b6f8e99d1c59022bf2a6fb8b6ff33ce1bd31b6fe29005f7bf9efe102d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Estonia detains ship heading for Russia suspected of smuggling</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/estonia-detains-ship-heading-russia-suspected-smuggling-2026-02-04/</link><description>COPENHAGEN, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Estonia's Tax and Customs Board said late on Tuesday it had detained a container ship sailing under the Bahamian flag in Estonia's internal waters that may be linked to smuggling from Ecuador.

"There is reason to believe that the vessel may have been used for smuggling," the authority said in a statement.

"The police special unit K-Commando boarded the ship, after which the vessel was detained under national supervision for the purpose of carrying out a customs inspection".

The ship, named Baltic Spirit, was en route from Ecuador to St. Petersburg in Russia and is not part of the Russian shadow fleet nor is it subject to European Union sanctions, they added.

The Bahamas-flagged refrigerated container vessel was anchored near Tallinn on Wednesday, having traveled there from a port in Colombia, according to ship tracking service MarineTraffic.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 09:45:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Researchers turn to UK archive to solve under-50s bowel cancer mystery</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/health/20260204-researchers-turn-to-uk-archive-to-solve-under-50s-bowel-cancer-mystery</link><description>In a dusty hospital basement on the outskirts of London , over 100 years of medical history lines the shelves, neatly arranged in row after row of cardboard specimen boxes.

Largely forgotten until recently, it is hoped this unique archive will help unravel the mystery of the rising number of younger people getting bowel cancer .

The archive contains tens of thousands of tumour and tissue specimens, some dating back to the early 20th century.

Preserved in formaldehyde and paraffin wax, they come from patients treated at the UK 's national bowel hospital, St Mark's, in northwest London.

In a study which began in January, researchers are using cutting-edge technology to compare archive tumours from the 1960s with ones from the present day.

Historically, patients treated at the hospital would have had a "very difficult time" with the disease, said Kevin Monahan, a consultant gastroenterologist, who is co-leading the groundbreaking project by St Mark's and the Institute of Cancer Research, London.

Their recovery – even after surgery – would have been "far from certain".

"We want to think about whether we can convert the suffering that they went through decades ago into a new hope for their grandchildren and their great grandchildren and others who might be at risk," he said.

The growing numbers of younger people being diagnosed with bowel cancer has left doctors worldwide perplexed.

According to Bowel Cancer UK, cases of the disease in people under 50 in Britain have increased by over 50 percent in the past 25 years.

Over 2,600 cases are diagnosed annually out of the nearly 44,000 cases across all age groups.

Research published by Bristol University and others in the British Journal of Surgery in 2020 showed an "exponential increase" over a similar period, with the conclusions supported by findings from both European and American studies.

"We can't time travel back to the 1960s... to see what people were exposed to (but)... in a way we have a record of it... within these boxes," Monahan said.

The bowel cancer expert and co-study lead, Trevor Graham of the London institute, aims to map how the DNA differs in the 1960s specimens from the ones of the current day.

By sequencing the DNA and using other laboratory techniques that "weren't possible even five years ago", they hope to pinpoint what is driving modern-day cases.

The project comes around a decade after the entire archive at St Mark's was nearly consigned to the hospital incinerator.

But after medics persuaded managers to hold on to it for a little longer, it was saved.

One ledger of yellowing pages vividly evokes the cases of patients from 1919, the year after the end of World War I .

The neatly-typed medical notes are accompanied with hand-drawn specimen pictures by the doctors.

Changes to diet, lifestyle and environmental pollutants such as microplastics have all been suggested as potential causes of the rise in cases, but definitive proof has been elusive.

Monahan's own hunch centres on a subtype of the E. coli bacteria in the gut.

"This bacteria may be carcinogenic, and the mark of that carcinogen in DNA has been found in younger people with bowel cancer under 50, four times as commonly as it has been in people with all cancer after the age of 50," he said.

If caught early, 90 percent of cases can be successfully treated, according to the National Health Service.

But Monahan said a bowel cancer diagnosis could be devastating for younger patients still juggling young families and trying to progress in their careers.

"Someone who's 35... very rarely do they think: 'Oh, I might have bowel cancer,'" he said.

Bowel cancer was previously only rarely seen in patients in their 20s and 30s.

Many younger patients wrongly blame themselves, Monahan said.

Exercising regularly and maintaining a healthy weight are important for general health, he stressed, but there are other factors when it comes to bowel cancer.

"Where I see people who are newly diagnosed with bowel cancer at a young age, they say: 'Why? Why has this happened to me? Because I'm healthy. I eat healthy, I exercise regularly.'

"And I say to them: 'It's nothing to do with what you have done.'"

The research project is expected to report its findings in three years.

Thanks to the archive, the researchers had a "great legacy", Monahan added. "We have an opportunity here to use that legacy."</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 09:45:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/6fe2388c-0177-11f1-b112-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/66094c651a7cdf1a3b42bd1e26c266daedf27282.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran demands Oman venue for US talks amid rising regional tensions</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260204-iran-demands-oman-venue-for-us-talks-amid-rising-regional-tensions</link><description>Iran is demanding that talks with the US this week be held in Oman , not Turkey , and that the scope be narrowed to two-way negotiations on nuclear issues only, a regional source said on Tuesday, adding new complications to an already delicate diplomatic effort.

Iran's move to change the venue and agenda for the talks, scheduled for Friday in Istanbul, comes amid heightened tensions as the US builds up forces in the Middle East .

Regional players have pushed for a resolution of a standoff that has led to mutual threats of air strikes and stirred fears of escalation into a wider war.

The US military on Tuesday shot down an Iranian drone that “aggressively” approached the Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea, the US military said, in an incident first reported by Reuters.

US President Donald Trump , who warned on Monday that “bad things” would probably happen if a deal could not be reached with Iran, told reporters at the White House on Tuesday: “We are negotiating with them right now.” He did not elaborate and declined to say where he expected the talks to take place.

The regional diplomat with knowledge of Iran's demands said Tehran sought “to change the format, they want to change the scope”.

“They only want to discuss the nuclear file with the Americans, while the US wants to include other topics such as the (ballistic) missiles and the activities of Iran's proxies in the region.”

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News that talks with Iran were still scheduled to take place later this week.

Iran's foreign ministry spokesperson said consultations on the venue were still under way, Iranian Nour News reported later on Tuesday. The spokesperson said planning has been carried out to hold the negotiations in the coming days and that Turkey, Oman and several other countries had expressed readiness to host the meeting.

A source familiar with the situation said earlier on Tuesday that Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner was due to take part in the talks, along with US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Aragchi.

Ministers from several other countries in the region, including Pakistan , Saudi Arabia , Qatar , Egypt and the United Arab Emirates , had also been expected to attend, but the regional source told Reuters that Tehran now wants only bilateral talks with the US.

The US naval buildup follows Iran's violent crackdown against anti-government demonstrations last month.

Trump, who stopped short of carrying out threats to intervene, has since demanded nuclear concessions from Iran and sent a flotilla to its coast .

The priority of the diplomatic effort is to avoid conflict and de-escalate tension, a second regional official told Reuters earlier.

Iran’s leadership is increasingly worried a US strike could break its grip on power by driving an already enraged public back onto the streets, according to six current and former Iranian officials.

With tensions running high, an Iranian Shahed-139 drone flying toward the Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier “with unclear intent” was shot down by an F-35 US fighter jet, the US military said.

Iran's Tasnim news agency said connection had been lost with a drone in international waters, but the reason was unknown.

US Central Command said in another incident on Tuesday, this one in the Strait of Hormuz , Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps forces harassed a US-flagged tanker.

“Two IRGC boats and an Iranian Mohajer drone approached M/V Stena Imperative at high speeds and threatened to board and seize the tanker,” said Navy Captain Tim Hawkins, a spokesperson for Central Command.

Maritime risk management group Vanguard said the Iranian boats ordered the tanker to stop its engine and prepare to be boarded. Instead, the tanker sped up and continued its voyage.

Hawkins said a US Navy warship, the McFaul, was operating in the area and escorted the Stena Imperative, which was “proceeding safely”.

Earlier, the United Arab Emirates , a highly influential Gulf Arab oil producer and close US ally, said the region cannot afford another conflict and negotiations are needed.

Gulf Arab states are worried that Iran will carry out its threat to target US bases on their territory should Trump attack the Islamic Republic again.

In June, the United States struck Iranian nuclear targets, joining in at the close of a 12-day Israeli bombing campaign. Since then, Tehran has said its uranium enrichment work – which it says is for peaceful, not military, purposes – has stopped.

Iranian sources said last week that Trump had demanded three conditions for the resumption of talks: zero enrichment of uranium in Iran, limits on Tehran's ballistic missile programme, and ending its support for regional proxies.

Iran has long said all three demands are unacceptable infringements of its sovereignty, but two Iranian officials told Reuters that its clerical rulers saw the ballistic missile programme, rather than uranium enrichment, as the bigger obstacle.

One Iranian official said there should be no preconditions and Tehran is ready to show flexibility on uranium enrichment, including handing over 400 kg of highly enriched uranium, accepting zero enrichment.

Tehran's regional influence has been weakened by Israel's attacks on its proxies – from Hamas in Gaza to Hezbollah in Lebanon , the Houthis in Yemen and militias in Iraq – as well as by the ousting of Iran's close ally, former Syrian President Bashar al-Assad .</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 09:45:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/acbd8a52-0151-11f1-bd4e-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26030462309994.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukraine, Russia begin second round of US-brokered peace talks in Abu Dhabi</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/ukraine-russia-begin-second-round-us-brokered-peace-talks-abu-dhabi-2026-02-04/</link><description>KYIV, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Ukrainian and Russian negotiators began a second round of U.S.-brokered talks in Abu Dhabi on Wednesday, seeking to advance efforts to end Europe's biggest conflict since World War Two.

The two-day trilateral meetings come after President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said that Russia had exploited a U.S.-backed energy truce last week to stockpile munitions, attacking Ukraine with a record number of ballistic missiles on Tuesday.

"Another round of negotiations has begun in Abu Dhabi. The negotiation process started in a trilateral format — Ukraine, the United States, and Russia," Rustem Umerov, Ukraine's top negotiator, said on the Telegram app.

Umerov said that teams would also meet in separate groups to discuss specific negotiation tracks and would then follow up with a joint meeting to synchronise positions.

Over the past year, U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has pushed both Kyiv and Moscow to find a compromise to end the four-year conflict, triggered by Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, but the two sides remain far apart on key points despite several rounds of talks with U.S. officials.

The most sensitive issues are Moscow's demands that Kyiv give up land it still controls and the fate of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe's largest, which sits in a Russian-occupied area.

Moscow wants Kyiv to pull its troops out of all of the eastern Donetsk region, including a belt of heavily fortified cities regarded as one of Ukraine's strongest defences, as a precondition for any deal.

Ukraine said the conflict should be frozen along the current front line and has rejected any unilateral pullback of its forces.

Russia currently occupies about 20% of Ukraine's national territory, including Crimea and parts of the eastern Donbas region seized before the 2022 invasion.

Military analysts have said that Russian forces have gained about 1.5% of Ukrainian territory since the start of 2024.

Polls show that the majority of Ukrainians oppose a deal that hands Moscow land. Kyiv residents told Reuters on Wednesday they were sceptical the new round of talks would bring any major breakthroughs.

"Let's hope that it will change (something), of course. But I don't believe it will change anything now. We will not give in, and they will not give in either," Serhii, 38, a taxi driver, told Reuters.

The first round of talks was held in the UAE last month, marking the first direct public negotiations between Moscow and Kyiv.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 10:39:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/NLRXNNQWLNNQFIOEZBKGML7CUU.jpg?auth=686e90c4c6db713ee9b8cf080803d2bf997a48330e810aade9166f2a5c72bba5&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Socialist poised to defeat far-right leader in Portugal presidential vote, poll shows</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/socialist-poised-defeat-far-right-leader-portugal-presidential-vote-poll-shows-2026-02-04/</link><description>LISBON, Feb 4 (Reuters) - The moderate Socialist candidate is poised for a decisive victory over the populist far-right leader in Sunday's presidential election run-off in Portugal, according to a new poll.

Antonio Jose Seguro, ex-Socialist leader, leads with 67% in voting intentions, versus 33% for the leader of anti-establishment Chega, Andre Ventura, according to the survey by Catolica University pollsters released by broadcaster RTP late Tuesday.

In the five decades since Portugal's Carnation Revolution ended authoritarian rule, a presidential runoff has occurred only once before, in 1986, highlighting political fragmentation and voter frustration with mainstream parties amid the far-right's rise.

Portugal's presidency is largely ceremonial, but plays a key role in mediating the country's divided political landscape and holds powers to veto legislation and dismiss the government.

Seguro has said he would be a moderate, unifying president, independent of partisan politics, and would not act as a "shadow prime minister", refusing to interfere in the government's day-to-day role.

By contrast, Ventura has warned he would be "an interventionist president", vowing to fight decades of mainstream party corruption and advancing a strong anti-immigration agenda.

He faces criticism for remarks seen as racist towards the Roma community and South Asian immigrants.

Chega, founded less than seven years ago, emerged last May as the main opposition force after winning 22.8% of the vote in a parliamentary election.

Ventura's critics say he is only using the presidential election to further strengthen and expand his party's presence in the country.

The survey, conducted between January 29 and February 2, interviewed 1,601 people and has a margin of error of 2.4%.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 10:39:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/E5UA324NQ5L7VOZKW7SYVFQP7I.jpg?auth=ea539fb6fa416198125f2dadb2c56289af8bf4a2128fcb92a106cd233f8745ce&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Pope Leo urges Russia and US to renew last nuclear arms treaty</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/pope-leo-urges-russia-us-renew-last-nuclear-arms-treaty-2026-02-04/</link><description>VATICAN CITY, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Pope Leo on Wednesday urged leaders in Russia and the United States to renew their last nuclear arms control treaty, New START , which caps the number of strategic nuclear weapons deployed by each country.

Leo, the first U.S. pope, said during his weekly audience at the Vatican that the current world situation "calls for doing everything possible to avert a new arms race."

The treaty, signed in 2010, is due to expire on Thursday. Russian President Vladimir Putin proposed in September that the treaty could be informally extended for another year, but as of Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump had not responded.

"I issue an urgent appeal not to let this instrument lapse," said the pope. "It is more urgent than ever to replace the logic of fear and distrust with a shared ethic, capable of guiding choices toward the common good."

The expiring of New START would mark the end of more than half a century of constraints on nuclear weapons.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 10:40:43 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/NU4Y55YRQNMNDJZLEIRTHTZX44.jpg?auth=265d6b6dec1a036936fed00bc9da61c0dd75732038ec4fe8feac47c92380cc71&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Vital aid flights to Houthi-held capital in Yemen to resume, says UN</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/vital-aid-flights-houthi-held-capital-yemen-resume-says-un-2026-02-04/</link><description>GENEVA, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Vital aid flights to the Houthi-controlled capital of Yemen, blocked for a month by the Iran-aligned group, will resume this month, allowing critical supplies to reach millions in need amid a worsening humanitarian crisis, the U.N. said on Wednesday.

The Houthis' decision on Tuesday to approve flights for the month of February will allow aid groups to enter and exit the capital, Sanaa, which is under the group's control, U.N. Resident Coordinator and Humanitarian Coordinator for Yemen Julien Harneis said in a statement.

The U.N. has warned of a worsening humanitarian crisis in Yemen with some 21 million people needing aid, including millions living in Houthi-controlled areas.

Yemen has suffered 11 years of conflict between the Houthis, who seized the capital Sanaa in 2014, and the internationally recognised government based in Aden. Some 4.8 million people are internally displaced and nearly half a million children require treatment for severe malnutrition.

On Friday, the U.N. had said the Houthis had not let the U.N. Humanitarian Air Service fly to Sanaa for over a month or to the city of Marib for over four months. These flights are the only way for NGO workers to enter and exit Houthi-controlled areas, Harneis said, and U.N. operations are limited to government-held areas.

The Houthis have previously described the work of some U.N. agencies as a political, military and intelligence operation aimed at subjugating Yemenis - allegations the United Nations denies.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 10:41:04 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7HNSHAEN2ZL3LODSQI2KPEHBHU.jpg?auth=dc376cfaee0bcfebaac9cfa99da5bbf11ae760c7bef2cc96de6dde48ee19f094&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Myanmar junta plans 'super-body' to tighten grip on military, new government</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/myanmar-junta-plans-super-body-tighten-grip-military-new-government-2026-02-04/</link><description>Feb 4 (Reuters) - Myanmar's junta will form a new entity to oversee both the military and civilian administration, a move experts say will allow paramount ruler Min Aung Hlaing to become president without loosening his grip on the powerful armed forces.

Just days after the completion of a final phase of an election that will see a parliament convene next month and power transferred to a nominally civilian government, the junta announced its plans in state media late Tuesday to create the five-member Union Consultative Council.

Its mandate is exceptionally broad, granting it control over every critical component of national security and the legislative process, said Naing Min Khant, program associate at the Institute for Strategy and Policy - Myanmar think-tank.

"The formation of the Union Consultative Council represents a significant institutional shift, likely to create a 'super-body' designed to hold supreme authority above the executive, legislative, and judicial branches," Naing Min Khant said.

A spokesperson for the junta did not answer calls seeking comment on the council.

Min Aung Hlaing took control of Myanmar in a 2021 coup that ousted a civilian government led by Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi and triggered widespread protests that expanded into a nationwide civil war.

More than 93,000 people have since been killed in violence in Myanmar, according to the Armed Conflict Location &amp; Event Data Project.

The 69-year-old Min Aung Hlaing has indicated he intends to hand over "state responsibilities" to the next government. He is widely expected to become president.

The military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party swept the election , winning 81% of available upper and lower house seats in a contest criticised by the United Nations, some Western nations and rights groups as a one-sided exercise to keep the ruling generals in power through proxies.

State-run media did not provide a reason for why the council was being formed.

According to two lawyers, it will potentially enable Min Aung Hlaing to become president while ensuring he retains full control over the military, which has governed Myanmar for five of the past six decades.

It would also ensure he had control over the civilian-led administration and legislative matters, they said.

"I believe that this newly appointed Union Consultative Council will oversee the new (military) Commander-in-Chief on one hand, and the government on the other," said Kyee Myint, adding that the body would prevent any successor to Min Aung Hlaing as military chief from holding too much power.

But there appears to be no oversight for the new council, according to Naing Min Khant.

The gathering comes after President Donald Trump on Monday launched a strategic stockpile of critical minerals, called Project Vault , backed by $10 billion in seed funding from the U.S. Export-Import Bank and $2 billion in private funding.

China has wielded its chokehold on the processing of many minerals as geo-economic leverage, at times curbing exports and suppressing prices and undercutting other countries' ability to diversify sources of the materials used to make semiconductors, electric vehicles and advanced weapons.

South Korea, India, Thailand, Japan, Germany, Australia, and the Democratic Republic of Congo are among countries attending the Washington meeting, though the U.S. has not released a full list.

Beijing's expanded export controls on rare earths last year caused production delays and shutdowns for auto manufacturers in Europe and the U.S., and a China-generated glut of lithium has stalled plans to expand production in the U.S.

Such dependencies have unnerved Washington and its partners, which nonetheless have struggled for years to implement policies to stand up durable domestic mining and processing alternatives for lithium, nickel, rare earths and other critical minerals.

China's leverage was on full display in October when Trump agreed to trim tariffs on the country in exchange for Beijing's pledge to hold off on stricter restrictions on rare earths exports.

The talks underscore a broader U.S. push to work with partners to counter China's dominance over critical minerals by coordinating policy tools at a time when Trump has angered allies with his sweeping "America First" tariff policies.

Washington and its partners are weighing measures that include aligning trade and investment incentives, encouraging new mining and processing capacity outside China, and exploring market interventions such as price floors, strategic stockpiles and export restrictions to reduce Beijing's leverage over supply chains vital to advanced manufacturing and national security.

"I think this is a recognition by the United States that it must act in concert with others to reduce its vulnerability in areas where China has supply dominance," said Scott Kennedy, who leads the Chinese business and economics program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.

U.S. Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum said on Tuesday that 11 more countries would be named to a critical minerals trade club this week, joining the U.S., Australia, Japan, South Korea, Saudi Arabia and Thailand. He said 20 more countries showed "strong interest" in joining the coalition.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Vice President JD Vance will deliver remarks at the meeting of ministers from across Europe, Asia, Africa and Latin America, which according to the State Department, aims to "advance collective efforts to strengthen and diversify critical minerals supply chains."

"China has long played an important and constructive role in keeping the global industrial and supply chains of critical minerals safe and stable and is willing to continue to make active efforts in this regard," China's embassy in Washington told Reuters when asked about the meeting.

Industry experts say countries must find the right balance of incentives to boost investment in critical minerals production.

Those could include deploying newly created Section 232 tariffs in coordination with allies to establish industry-wide price floors for specific materials.

The Trump administration last year struck a price-floor agreement with rare earths producer MP Materials, but Reuters has reported the administration may now be moving away from company-specific deals in favor of a broader, international approach.

Washington's Group of Seven partners and the European Union have considered price floors , opens new tab to promote rare earth production, as well as taxes on some Chinese exports to incentivize investment.

Australia, which has been positioning itself as a critical minerals alternative to China, has also said it would establish a strategic reserve of minerals, expected to be ready by the second half of 2026.

Canberra is also considering setting a price floor to support local critical minerals projects.

"The reality is that none of us have tested these tools in this context. So, we're looking to see which will be most effective. Most likely it will be a bit of a menu of tools ... I don't think there's going to be a one silver bullet," one meeting participant told Reuters on condition of anonymity.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 10:41:27 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/I7GSK7W2ZRKOTLEK2L5T3TOLVA.jpg?auth=c3c419c43fe2e20e8151c9236e643ae9accd7f8fcaf745504dd2488a908bfcf8&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>In pictures: Northern Morocco floods force evacuation of 50,000 people</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/africa/20260204-in-pictures-northern-morocco-floods-force-evacuation-50-000-people</link><description>More than 50,000 people have been evacuated from their homes in northern Morocco due to severe weather and heavy rainfall affecting several provinces, the interior ministry said on Tuesday.

The evacuations began on Friday, mostly in Larache province, where the city of Ksar El Kebir – about 100 kilometres (62 miles) south of Tangier – has seen significant flooding, the ministry said.

Evacuees were partly taken in by relatives elsewhere, while those requiring assistance were sent to temporary shelters set up by the authorities, the ministry said.

Morocco's national weather service forecast heavy rains, strong winds and snowfall at altitudes above 1,500 metres from Monday to Wednesday in several provinces.

Authorities said the Moroccan army had been deployed to support relief efforts on the instructions of King Mohammed VI .

Last December, 37 people were killed in sudden floods in Safi, in Morocco's deadliest weather-related disaster in the past decade.

In recent weeks, severe weather and flooding in neighbouring Algeria killed two people, including a child.

In Tunisia , at least five people are dead, with others still missing, after the country saw its heaviest rainfall in over 70 years last month.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 10:42:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/ad022144-01ab-11f1-bcde-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-02-02T182851Z-160873474-RC2ACJAMMSSM-RTRMADP-3-MOROCCO-FLOODS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Libyan prosecutors open probe into killing of Gaddafi's son Seif al-Islam</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/africa/20260204-libyan-prosecutors-open-probe-into-killing-of-gaddaffi-son-seif-al-islam</link><description>Libyan prosecutors said Wednesday they were investigating the killing of Seif al-Islam Gaddafi , son of slain ruler Muammar Gaddafi , in the city of Zintan.

The public prosecutor's office said forensic experts had been dispatched to Zintan in northwest Libya, where he was shot dead, adding that efforts were underway to identify suspects.

"The victim died from wounds by gunfire," the office said in a statement, adding that investigators were looking to "speak to witnesses and anyone who may be able to shed light on the incident".

A lawyer of Seif al-Islam, Marcel Ceccaldi, said he was killed by an unidentified "four-man commando" who stormed his house in Zintan on Tuesday.

Libya has struggled to recover from profound instability that erupted after a NATO-backed uprising in 2011 overthrew Muammar Gaddafi.

Libya remains divided between a UN-backed government based in Tripoli and an eastern administration backed by Khalifa Haftar .

Neither authority has commented on Seif al-Islam's death.

The only public reaction came from Moussa al-Kouni, vice-president of the Presidential Council representing the Fezzan region.

Putin said the Moscow-Beijing relationship was an important stabilising factor at a time of growing global turbulence, in a Russian state television broadcast of the talks.

Xi, speaking via an interpreter, called for the countries to work out a "grand plan" to further bilateral relations which he said were advancing in the right direction.

China and Russia declared a "no limits" strategic partnership days before Putin sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine in February 2022.

Since then, China has emerged as an economic lifeline for Russia by stepping up trade with the northern neighbour while Western powers piled sanctions on Moscow.

Xi and Putin last met in Beijing when China staged a massive military parade in September that was also attended by North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un.

During that meeting, Xi said China-Russia ties had "withstood international turbulence" and pledged to coordinate with Moscow on issues concerning their core interests.

Ukraine and Europe have accused Beijing of providing direct military aid to Russia's war effort. Beijing denies the accusations and says it is not a party to the conflict.

On Tuesday, senior diplomats of the two countries met in Beijing to discuss the global security situation and other issues and reached "broad consensus", the Chinese foreign ministry said.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 11:33:56 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CWIXRLIRZBK5BBVLCANKSWJ65Q.jpg?auth=8529ca334d9290d0dd8df7a76dbf07905eeb9c1618cdccf185ca272d917df253&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Greenland shatters temperature record, redrawing economy from fishing to minerals</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/cop/greenland-shatters-temperature-record-redrawing-economy-fishing-minerals-2026-02-04/</link><description>NUUK, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Greenland, the Arctic island coveted by U.S. President Donald Trump, experienced its warmest January on record this year, as a rate of warming four times faster than the global average redraws the outlook for sectors from fishing to mining.

Trump has said the U.S. must own Greenland, an autonomous part of the Kingdom of Denmark, for security reasons although he has backed away from threats to take the island by force .

Preliminary temperature readings from the Danish Meteorological Institute in the Greenlandic capital Nuuk averaged +0.2 degrees Celsius (32.4 degrees Fahrenheit) in January, the highest on record and well above the historical average of -7.7 degrees between 1991 and 2020.

"Climate change is already clearly visible on Greenland," said Jacob Hoyer, head of the National Centre for Climate Research at the Danish Meteorological Institute.

"From the records we can see that it is warming four times faster than the mean temperature hike in the world."

The warm weather means sea ice extends less far south along the coast each winter and is thinner even where it does exist, making it difficult to use for transport, according to Hoyer.

It can also affect the mainstay of Greenland's economy - fishing. Catches of mainly shrimp, halibut and cod are the biggest export and accounted for 23% of gross domestic product in 2023, according to Statistics Greenland, while the industry provides 15% of all jobs.

"The waters around Greenland are also warming up, and that can change the ecosystem and the fishery business. It will most likely have an impact," said Hoyer, adding it was too early to tell exactly how.

While Trump has chiefly highlighted security concerns, Greenland also holds strategic mineral resources that could play a part in the power struggle for the island. A Danish survey published in 2023 showed 25 of the 34 minerals deemed "critical raw materials" by the European Commission were found there.

Red tape surrounding mining concessions, harsh conditions and opposition from indigenous groups have historically made mining expensive. The flip side of the warming climate could be that such ventures become more profitable as extraction and shipping become less costly, Hoyer said.

Still, businesses in many established sectors face uncertainty in the here and now. Casper Moller, owner of a company providing tours for tourists, says the lack of snow and ice makes these difficult by snowmobile or skis.

"So, what we are doing at this moment is just crossing our fingers that we will reach more snow quite soon," he said.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 11:34:07 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/OY3FQFZKDBPHBAKL4XPRSZ74RY.jpg?auth=ad0f8a92819c8a033f2a0c79c1c3c6f3be07ed6e150019e27cfc1d37350dc560&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuelan expats who helped propel Canada oil sands growth see return home as unlikely</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/venezuelan-expats-who-helped-propel-canada-oil-sands-growth-see-return-home-2026-02-04/</link><description>CALGARY, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Professional engineer Luis Cabana couldn't take a walk in downtown Calgary in the mid-2000s without someone he knew calling out to him in Spanish.

Office towers in the corporate heart of Canada's oil and gas sector were at the time heavily populated with Venezuelan expats who had fled persecution and economic stagnation in their home country.

Wintry and vast, Canada is geographically far from the heat and humidity of Venezuela. But the oil sands of northern Alberta and Venezuela's Orinoco Belt produce a remarkably similar variety of thick, tar-like heavy crude, a fact that over the decades prompted thousands of Venezuela's best and brightest engineers, scientists and geologists to move to cities like Calgary, Edmonton and Fort McMurray.

"We were over-represented. I knew another professional at every single company downtown," said Cabana, who came to Canada in 2006 and spent more than a decade in project management positions in Canada's energy sector.

These expats helped Canada develop its oil sands and become the world's largest producer of heavy crude, even as Venezuela's own oil production declined. And in spite of U.S. President Donald Trump's stated goal to revive Venezuela's oil industry, many Venezuelans who built careers in Canada say they are unlikely to return to the country of their birth as they have built lives elsewhere.

Trump's move to revive Venezuela's oil industry has sparked anxiety in Canada, as an increase in heavy oil supply from Venezuela could displace some of the oil that refiners in the United States buy from Canada.

A significant increase in Venezuelan output is unlikely for years, however, because U.S. companies are reluctant to invest in big-ticket, multi-year projects without signs of long-term political stability and a new legal framework with wide endorsement in the South American country.

Reuters spoke to four Venezuelans in Canada, each of whom came to the country during one of several waves of migration starting in the early 2000s. One of the most significant occurred between 2001 and 2010, after the rise of Hugo Chavez's regime, and following a massive strike at state-owned oil company PDVSA and the resulting collapse of the Venezuelan oil industry.

Some of the 7,450 Venezuelans who - according to federal statistics - came to Canada during that period had occupied senior roles at PDVSA. Chemist Pedro Pereira, who had been director of PDVSA's technology strategy and was blacklisted by the Venezuelan government after the strike, took a position at the University of Calgary where he led nanotechnology research for oil sands applications. He also recruited dozens of other Venezuelans with expertise in heavy oil to join him.

"I ended up producing technology not for Venezuela – which was the country that paid abundantly for the education of all these people – but for Canada," said Pereira, who today runs his own Calgary-based tech company focused on renewable energy.

Many other Venezuelans migrated to the oil sands hub of Fort McMurray, a small, northern Alberta city surrounded by boreal forest.

"When I got there it was minus 35 (Celsius), and when I left Caracas, it was plus 25, so it was a bit of a shock," said Lino Carrillo, who had worked in heavy oil processing and refining in Venezuela before being recruited by Canada's Suncor Energy in 2004.

Venezuela's oil industry decline coincided with the growth of Canada's, as the early part of this century was a period of significant oil sands expansion driven by high oil prices and technological breakthroughs.

"People appreciated the Venezuelan knowledge," said Carrillo. "I believe Canada would have accomplished what it did with the development of the oil sands anyway, but what they did was they brought in people with 15, 20 years of experience and that helped shortcut the path."

Carrillo, who worked in a number of senior oil sands management positions and is now retired, maintains close ties to Venezuela and even worked directly on the development of opposition party leader Maria Machado's energy platform .

Machado, who fled the South American nation in a daring seaborne escape in December, is competing for Trump's ear with members of Venezuela's government and seeking to ensure she has a role in governing the nation going forward.

Many expats say even if Venezuela begins to rebuild its oil industry and returns to democracy, a reverse wave of migration from Canada's oil sands back to the Orinoco Belt is unlikely.

"Venezuelan expats have lots of conversations about 'will they go back, how can they help their country recover,'" said Pereira. "But it's two generations that have passed now, and the ones that have expertise, most of them are at least 55 years old."</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 11:34:52 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CCCENAUSVZP2RJVJ4F2CN7HNQU.jpg?auth=06e4bbad6a636ac317ce9d66fda395d0a0e2b1ae01dbdf5485b28404ba8e827f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Man convicted of attempting to assassinate Trump to be sentenced</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/man-convicted-attempting-assassinate-trump-be-sentenced-2026-02-04/</link><description>FORT PIERCE, Florida, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Ryan Routh , a man accused of hiding in the bushes of a Florida golf course with a semi-automatic rifle to try to assassinate Donald Trump less than two months before the 2024 U.S. election that returned him to the presidency, is set to be sentenced on Wednesday.

Prosecutors have asked U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon to sentence Routh to life in prison during the hearing in Fort Pierce, Florida. Routh, 59, was convicted by a jury last September of five criminal counts including attempted assassination after serving as his own defense lawyer at trial .

Prosecutors said in a court filing that Routh's crimes "undeniably warrant a life sentence" because he had plotted the assassination for months, was willing to kill anybody who got in the way and has expressed neither regret nor remorse.

Routh has asked the judge, a Trump appointee, to impose a 27-year term.

In a court filing, Routh denied that he intended to kill Trump, and said he was willing to undergo psychological treatment for a personality disorder in prison. Routh suggested that jurors were misled about the facts of the case by his inability to mount a proper legal defense at trial.

Routh, who at the time of his arrest had resided most recently in Hawaii after previously living in North Carolina, also was convicted of three illegal firearm possession charges and one count of impeding a federal officer during his arrest.

Secret Service agents spotted Routh hiding in bushes a few hundred yards (meters) from where Trump was golfing at Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach on September 15, 2024. Routh fled the scene and left behind an assault-style rifle but was later arrested.

The incident occurred two months after a bullet fired by a gunman grazed Trump's ear at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Both incidents came in the run-up to the November 2024 election in which Trump regained the presidency after having been defeated four years earlier by Democrat Joe Biden.

Trump, a Republican, turned the attempted assassinations into a campaign issue, saying the U.S. Justice Department under Biden could not be trusted with investigations.

Prosecutors said Routh arrived in South Florida about a month before the incident, staying at a truck stop and tracking Trump's movements and schedule.

Routh carried six cellphones and used fake names to conceal his identity, according to trial evidence, and prosecutors said he lay in wait in thick bushes for nearly 10 hours on the day of the incident. Investigators on the scene found the assault-style rifle, two bags containing body armor-like metal plates and a video camera pointed at the golf course.

Routh pleaded not guilty in the case but fired his lawyers and opted to represent himself at trial despite lacking any formal legal training.

His meandering opening statement touched on topics including the origin of the human species and the settlement of the American West before he was cut off by Cannon, who warned him against making a mockery of the courtroom. Routh's defense strategy focused on what he described as his nonviolent nature, but he offered little pushback as a parade of law enforcement witnesses detailed the evidence in the case.

Prosecutor John Shipley told jurors that Routh's plot was "carefully crafted and deadly serious," adding that without the Secret Service's intervention "Donald Trump would not be alive."

After the jury read the verdict, Routh appeared to try to stab himself with a pen several times and had to be restrained by U.S. marshals. His daughter yelled in court that her father had not hurt anyone and that she would get him out of prison.

Trump lauded the verdict in a post on his Truth Social site, writing, "This was an evil man with an evil intention, and they caught him."</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 11:35:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WNHPPXBGLVLCDJFPL5DWFRXORI.jpg?auth=dff60a1d0483fcc96e108980e207d16fe90f4a21294603acc6593d0426c0e1fc&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Exclusive: State prisons grew deadlier and more violent amid guard shortage</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/state-prisons-grew-deadlier-more-violent-amid-guard-shortage-review-finds-2026-02-04/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Feb 4 (Reuters) - State prisons in the United States became more violent and nearly 50% deadlier over the past five years as authorities struggled to keep enough guards on the job, according to a government-funded report to be released on Wednesday.

The United States locks away more people than any other nation, including about 1 million people in state-run prisons. The previously unreported evaluation, paid for by the U.S. Department of Justice and conducted by an initiative called Safe Inside, found that those systems are under increasing strain, even as many states sharply reduced the number of people they locked up.

“We have less staff and they’re asked to do more,” said John Wetzel, a former head of Pennsylvania’s prison system and the chairman of Safe Inside, a nonpartisan research effort focused on improving state prisons. “We’re seeing the increased deaths, increase of assaults and there’s no argument that these are going up.”

The staff shortages mean prisons have fewer people on duty to protect inmates, and fewer who can take them to medical appointments, Wetzel said.

The rising death rate came as the number of assaults on inmates increased 54% over the same period, and the number of assaults on prison staff rose 77%, the review found. The report did not include details about the raw numbers of assaults.

The death rate among state prisoners increased 47% between 2019 and 2024, the most recent years for which the organization could gather data. The deaths include homicides, suicides and violence, and the report concluded that understaffing and high turnover “likely contribute” to the increase, though researchers said they lacked enough data to prove causation.

The review based that report on conditions in 12 state prison systems; most of the rest, it said, did not report adequate information on the number of people who died in their custody. It found that the death rate was 2.8 for every 100,000 prisoners in 2019; by 2024 it had risen to 4.1.

“There is not enough personnel to provide the attention that is needed to people in state custody,” said Maria Goellner, vice president of Families Against Mandatory Minimums, which advocates reducing the number of people in prison. “So you do see increased neglect, abuse and violence, and horrendous prison conditions.”

She added part of the problem is that states are imprisoning people "who don't need to be there."

The increase in deaths was particularly sharp in some states. In Alabama, researchers documented 337 inmates who died in 2024, compared to 99 in 2019. In California, which operates one of the nation’s largest prison systems, deaths among inmates were largely unchanged even though the state cut its prison population by nearly a quarter.

Spokesmen for the Alabama and California prisons did not respond to questions about the deaths.

The researchers chose those years so that they would not capture deaths from the coronavirus pandemic, which wreaked havoc in some jails and prisons and also pushed state and local governments to free thousands of people to slow the virus’s spread. Michael Thompson, the director of Safe Inside, said the death rate has increased faster than could be explained by prisoners getting older or sicker.

Prisons throughout the United States have struggled for years to hire enough guards and other staff, and to keep the ones they have. New York , opens new tab and Florida , opens new tab have sent thousands of National Guard soldiers to fill gaps in understaffed prisons.

The Safe Inside review found understaffing cost states more than $2 billion in overtime in 2024, 80% more than five years earlier. Some prison workers told researchers that they worked multiple 18-hour shifts in a row and that some facilities were so shorthanded that it was common for guards to be unable to take a bathroom break because there was no one to fill in for them while they were gone. That pressure, in turn, makes it harder to keep workers from quitting.

In Michigan, for example, the report found that one of every six prison jobs was unfilled last year. At some prisons, almost a third of jobs were vacant.

A spokeswoman for Michigan’s Department of Corrections, Jenni Riehle, said the rate of unfilled jobs had fallen slightly since then.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 11:36:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/PXYN6JVXVJI33EEIUKDDNZ34IU.jpg?auth=66c608e7d5ee52eade77ad248ac6fc76343d7ad0903892e6486dd89ba424516f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>In Kyiv freezing under Russian attacks, a veteran plumber fights back by fixing the heat</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/kyiv-freezing-under-russian-attacks-veteran-plumber-fights-back-by-fixing-heat-2026-02-04/</link><description>KYIV, Feb 4 (Reuters) - At 66, railway worker Volodymyr Vasyliev could have long since been fully retired. Instead, he was below ground in the middle of a 24-hour shift, trying to fix pipes that had burst under a Soviet-era high-rise, part of an army of technicians drafted in to keep Ukrainians warm through the coldest winter yet of war.

As Russia keeps pounding Ukraine's heating and power system in what Ukrainians say is a campaign to freeze them into submission, fixing pipes is Vasyliev's way of fighting back.

"What, am I supposed to forgive them? Say, 'That's it, I give up'?" he said on a break from his shift in the city's northeastern outskirts. "They'll never see the day."

Ukrainian negotiators met their Russian counterparts on Wednesday in Abu Dhabi for a new round of U.S.-brokered talks aimed at ending the nearly four-year war.

Meanwhile, Moscow's forces have been hammering Ukraine's energy grid, knocking out power and heating for long periods in Kyiv and other major cities as temperatures hover as low as -20 Celsius (-4 F) in the capital.

Russia briefly paused strikes after President Vladimir Putin made a promise to U.S. President Donald Trump, but resumed them on Monday with some of its worst attacks yet, knocking out heat to more than 1,000 residential towers in Kyiv.

Vasyliev is one of a group of nearly 250 state railway workers from around the country dispatched in recent weeks to prop up recovery efforts in Kyiv. They have so far restored heating or water to 160 buildings, the company says.

During a recent visit by Reuters, he was snaking through the darkness of a damp cellar scattered with debris and dust from broken insulation. Clanking metal echoed. Another bundled worker held a hissing flame to a pipe.

Later, in his own kitchen where power had just returned after a 12-hour outage, Vasyliev teared up while recalling an elderly woman who attempted to pay him during a shift.

"Her son is fighting (in the war), and there she is with the money," he said, his voice crackling. "Our people are wonderful."

Polling suggests Russia's attacks have done little to break Ukrainians' will.

Sixty-five percent say they are ready to endure fighting as long as necessary, according to a survey released on Monday by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology.

A Reuters reporter in court said that the comedian, Artemy Ostanin , had been handed a sentence of five years and nine months and a fine of 300,000 roubles ($3,908).

It was the latest in a series of rulings which have harshly punished people judged by the authorities to have spoken rudely or falsely about the Russian army at a time when it is fighting in Ukraine.

Ostanin was also convicted of offending the feelings of Christians with another off-colour joke he made about Jesus, which angered Orthodox nationalists.

Ostanin, who had apologised to anyone whose feelings he had hurt, denied wrongdoing and said that the joke he made about the war veteran had made no mention of the conflict in Ukraine.

His arrest and treatment were punishment enough for any offence he had caused, Ostanin said during his trial.

Russia passed sweeping censorship laws in 2022 shortly after it went to war in Ukraine. Pro-Kremlin figures and organisations have since publicly denounced people they deem to have broken those laws, and have reported them to the authorities.

Prosecutors said the six defendants, whose trial began in November, were members of the now-banned group Palestine Action, which organised the assault on the Elbit Systems UK facility in Bristol, southwest England, in August last year.

The six – Charlotte Head, 29, Samuel Corner, 23, Leona Kamio, 30, Fatema Zainab Rajwani, 21, Zoe Rogers, 22, and Jordan Devlin, 31 – all denied charges of aggravated burglary, violent disorder and criminal damage.

Rajwani, Rogers and Devlin were found not guilty of violent disorder by a jury at London's Woolwich Crown Court, while it could not reach verdicts on the same charge against Head, Corner and Kamio after more than 36-and-a-half hours of deliberation.

Corner had also denied causing grievous bodily harm with intent for hitting a female police sergeant with a sledgehammer. The jury was unable to reach a verdict on that count.

The six defendants hugged in the dock and waved to supporters in the public gallery, who cheered loudly after the judge had left the court.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 13:02:43 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>At least seven killed, eight hurt in Russian attacks in Ukraine-controlled Donetsk, governor says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/least-seven-killed-eight-hurt-russian-attacks-ukraine-controlled-donetsk-2026-02-04/</link><description>Feb 4 (Reuters) - At least seven people were killed and eight more hurt in Russian attacks in the town of Druzhkivka in the Ukraine-controlled frontline region of Donetsk in the east, the regional governor said on Wednesday.

European NATO members including Finland have been rethinking their foreign policy strategies in recent weeks, after U.S. President Donald Trump in January inflamed tensions with his European allies over Greenland, an overseas territory belonging to Denmark.

Finland will update its foreign and security policy doctrine to reflect the changes in the international situation, Stubb told members of Parliament in a speech.

"We must honestly acknowledge that the United States is undergoing change. Its approach to its allies, as well as its way of conducting foreign policy, is also changing," he said, calling the U.S. nevertheless "an important ally".

Stubb has sought to maintain close relations with Trump to seek his support for Ukraine amid Russia's invasion and to boost Finland's own security as a neighbour to Russia.

"The foreign policy of the current U.S. administration is underpinned by an ideology that conflicts with our own values," Stubb said, giving as examples of such conflicts of values the U.S. undermining the existing international order, operating outside international institutions and downplaying the importance of Europe.

Stubb gave no timeline for the foreign and security policy review, but said the work with the government was only beginning.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 13:03:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/OE3MQRBJ45OOBGFGWT3NRIAOBA.jpg?auth=7ea16356970e6a6c5a50123ee5f2fcc72be0e585c62c985b5c79aeb2ca8778ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Quidditch team from Ugandan village harbours Harry Potter-inspired World Cup dreams</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/africa/20260204-quidditch-team-from-ugandan-village-harbours-harry-potter-inspired-world-cup-dreams</link><description>Far from the legendary skies above Hogwarts school, a young woman chased a "Golden Snitch" highlighting how the craze for Harry Potter 's favourite sport, Quidditch, has taken hold in a remote Ugandan village.

In a clearing surrounded by banana trees, around 135 kilometres (80 miles) from the capital Kampala, players ran around with sticks between their legs instead of broomsticks.

The adapted version of Quidditch is officially called quadball, and does not require the same magical or flying abilities as the sport invented by J.K. Rowling for her world-conquering fantasy books .

But it has gained a following around the world and it came to Katwadde, deep in rural southern Uganda, in 2013 thanks to primary school teacher John Ssentamu, who discovered the sport after reading a Harry Potter book over the shoulder of someone on a bus.

"The word 'Quidditch' meant nothing to me, neither in English nor in any other language, so I went on Google," Ssentamu, 47, said.

"I was like hey it's a game... it's beautiful. I think I could introduce this to my community," he said.

Ssentamu put together a team around Good Shepherd Primary school where he teaches.

Ten years of hard work paid off in 2023 when Ssentamu's team hosted and won the first national quadball tournament. The east African country now has more than 200 players.

The aim of quadball is to throw balls through hoops. But Ssentamu loves the way it combines elements of netball, football, volleyball , and rugby – and also the equality between men and women, which is an official requirement for every team.

But without magic, reality can intrude.

The team lacks the funds to travel, said Ssentamu, and despite invitations, they have been unable to attend the quadball World Cup , held every two years since 2012 in Europe or the Americas .

Thirty-one teams took part in the last World Cup, a three-day event in Belgium last year.

"My dream is to see a team from here going to the World Cup of Quidditch, because it would be a revelation for the whole world," he said.

Still, the sport has boosted the community in Katwadde, attracting children to the school in an area where education is not always a priority.

Vicky Edith Nabbanja, Ssentamu's daughter, is one of the "beaters", who can temporarily knock opposing players out of the game with dodgeballs.

"It has brought youth together and it has opened up their minds" while also helping to create "a community of belonging", the 25-year-old said.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 13:03:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/7f47659e-01b9-11f1-8400-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/000-946W2FF.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Italy foiled Russia-linked cyberattacks on embassies, Olympic sites, minister says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/italy-foiled-russia-linked-cyberattacks-embassies-olympic-sites-minister-says-2026-02-04/</link><description>MILAN, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Italy has thwarted a series of cyberattacks targeting its foreign ministry facilities, including an embassy in Washington, as well as websites linked to the Winter Olympics and hotels in Cortina d’Ampezzo, Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani said on Tuesday.

Marius Borg Hoiby, 29, son of Crown Princess Mette-Marit and stepson to Crown Prince Haakon, could face years in prison if found guilty of the most serious of the 38 charges against him.

On Tuesday, the first day of his trial, he pleaded not guilty to the most serious charges of rape and domestic violence but admitted some lesser charges, including driving too fast.

He also said he was partially guilty - a plea allowed under Norwegian law - of aggravated assault and reckless behaviour.

On Wednesday, on his first day on the witness stand, Hoiby said it was very difficult for him to give testimony, in front of so many journalists.

"It is very difficult for me to speak in front of so many people. I have been surrounded by the press since I was three. I have been harassed ever since," he said, breaking down in tears.

After a moment, he said he had received "heavy medication" and said he would try to do as much as he could.

"I am known as the son of Mummy," he said, referring to Mette-Marit. "Which means I have an extreme need for affirmation," he said. "A lot of sex, a lot of alcohol."

"Few can relate to the life I have led. A lot of parties, alcohol, some drugs," he said.

Wearing jeans and a dark blue jumper over a beige shirt, Hoiby, who spoke with his arms crossed over his chest, sometimes consulted his handwritten notes in the notebook in front of him.

Among the charges against Hoiby are one count of rape with sexual intercourse and three counts of rape without intercourse, some of which he filmed on his telephone, the prosecution has said.

He denied the videos on his phone show acts of rape.

"If I had thought I had material that showed an assault, I would never have kept that material," he said, noting he had never shared them with anyone.

Hoiby's trial is scheduled to run until March 19.

The trial comes at a time of multiple challenges for the royal family, in addition to the ongoing scrutiny of Mette-Marit over her ties to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

The royal palace told Reuters on Wednesday Mette-Marit had postponed until further notice a planned private trip abroad, without providing further details.

That news was first reported by daily Aftenposten.

An opinion poll conducted on Monday for daily newspaper Verdens Gang showed a fall in the number of Norwegians in favour of keeping the monarchy - to 61% from 72% last year - and a 10-percentage-point rise to 27% in those who want a republic.

King Harald, 88, Europe's oldest living monarch, cut back activity in 2024 after being hospitalised to treat an infection and later receiving a pacemaker.

Mette-Marit herself is in need of a lung transplant after being diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis in 2018, a chronic disease that causes scarring in the lungs and leads to a reduced oxygen uptake.

Meanwhile, King Harald's daughter, Martha Louise, stepped down from official royal duties in 2022 to allow her to more freely pursue her own business ventures, and said both she and her husband, an American self-styled shaman, would refrain from using her title as princess in a commercial setting.

They both received criticism last year for starring in a Netflix documentary chronicling their daily lives, including their wedding, and for being critical of the king and queen.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 14:08:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LHEHMEEL3VJWDKWQY6PE63T7E4.jpg?auth=9642e9ff1558751524ded28caa9c2f3cc9f4c12ec7853bf281a4c7190bd20259&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'Angel Meloni' scrubbed off Rome church painting on priest's orders</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/angel-meloni-scrubbed-off-rome-church-painting-priests-orders-2026-02-04/</link><description>ROME, Feb 4 (Reuters) - An angel restored with the face of Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has been scrubbed off a wall painting in a central Rome church on the orders of the parish priest, following a political and clerical uproar .

One of two angels in a chapel of the Basilica of St Lawrence in Lucina, close to government headquarters, was altered to look virtually identical to the 49-year-old right-wing leader, Italy's first woman premier.

The image was spotted on Saturday by centre-left newspaper la Repubblica and stirred outrage among opposition figures and irritation from Cardinal Baldo Reina, Vicar General for the diocese of Rome.

When the church opened on Wednesday, the Meloni-like face had been painted over, leaving the angel headless.

"I always said that if (the Meloni image) proved divisive we would remove it," the church priest Daniele Micheletti told Italian news agency ANSA.

"There was a procession of people that came to see it instead of listening to Mass or praying. It wasn't acceptable."

The amateur artist who restored the painting, Bruno Valentinetti, was quoted by Repubblica on Wednesday as saying he had been asked to erase it by the Vatican.

A spokesperson for the Holy See declined to comment. The Rome diocese said it would release a statement later.

On Saturday, Cardinal Reina expressed "bitterness" over the incident, ordered an investigation and warned that "images of sacred art and Christian tradition cannot be misused or exploited".

The Italian Culture Ministry also announced an inquiry, while Meloni laughed off the incident. She posted a picture of the disputed painting on Instagram, with the caption "No, I definitely don't look like an angel", and a laughing emoji.

The altered wall painting was done in 2000, and is not under any heritage protection. Valentinetti is its original author and was asked to restore it to fix water damage, priest Micheletti said on Saturday.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 14:09:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/6BY4VDXFMVIJFJQRDW45ULR43A.jpg?auth=4beb498595e345b2557463faaf5c4b67ef2b142147f1d1a164fe891a68ae0bff&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia says uranium proposal for Iran is still on the table</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/russia-says-uranium-proposal-iran-is-still-table-2026-02-04/</link><description>MOSCOW, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Russia's foreign ministry said on Wednesday that a proposal to remove uranium from Iran as part of a deal to ease U.S. concerns was still on the table, but that it was for Tehran to decide whether or not to remove it.

Despite a US-brokered truce entering its second phase last month , violence has continued in the Gaza Strip , with Israel and Hamas accusing each other of breaching the agreement.

The latest bloodshed came days after Israel partly reopened the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt, the only exit for Gazans that does not pass through Israel.

The health ministry, which operates under Hamas authority, said that 21 people were killed in a series of strikes, with at least 38 others wounded, updating an earlier figure given by the territory's civil defence agency.

Among the dead were three children, said the agency, which operates as a rescue force under the Hamas authority.

"We were sleeping when suddenly shells and gunfire rained down on us," said Abu Mohammed Haboush, whose son was killed.

"Young children were martyred, my son and my nephew were among the dead. We lost many young men," he said, adding that he and his family were living far away from the so-called "Yellow Line", where Israeli forces are stationed.

AFP images showed mourners offering prayers in the compound of Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City, where several bodies wrapped in white shrouds were laid out.

An AFP photograph showed a relative holding a body of a child wrapped in a shroud at the hospital as relatives gathered around him.

Three bodies were brought to Nasser Hospital after Israeli strikes hit homes and tents housing displaced Palestinians in the southern Khan Younis area, the civil defence agency said.

Fourteen more bodies were taken to Al-Shifa Hospital, its director Mohamed Abu Salmiya said in a statement.

"We also received dozens of wounded. The situation is extremely difficult in the hospitals of the Gaza Strip due to the severe shortage of medicines and medical supplies," Abu Salmiya said.

Israel scrutinises all aid into besieged Gaza, a tiny coastal territory surrounded by fences, walls and the Mediterranean Sea.

The Israeli military said it had launched strikes after "terrorists opened fire on troops" Wednesday, seriously wounding an officer, adding that it considers the incident a violation of the ceasefire .

It said the troops came under attack near the "Yellow Line", without specifying which side of the line the troops were on.

The ceasefire took effect after two years of war in Gaza, sparked by Hamas's October 2023 attack on Israel.

Following what was reportedly US pressure, Israel allowed the opening of the Rafah crossing, but limited passage to patients and their travel companions.

Sick and wounded Gazans have begun crossing into Egypt to seek medical treatment since Monday.

On Tuesday, 45 people crossed into Egypt and 42 entered the territory, a source at the Palestinian Red Crescent Society said.

Shortly after midnight Wednesday, those meant to enter during the day on Tuesday arrived in Gaza through Rafah in a large bus, an AFP journalist reported.

Relatives of those returning from Egypt screamed in joy, hugging and crying.

"I am so happy to be back with my husband, my children, my family, my loved ones, and of course, my homeland," Fariza Barabakh, who returned that day, said.

"It's an indescribable feeling, thank God. What can I say? My two young children didn't recognise me, but thank God. I hope it will be alright," Yusef Abu Fahma, another returnee, said.

Gaza's health ministry says at least 556 people have been killed in Israeli strikes since the ceasefire took effect on October 10, while the Israeli military says four of its soldiers have been killed over the same period.

Saturday was among the deadliest days, with the civil defence agency reporting at least 32 people killed in Israeli attacks, which the military said were in response to a Hamas ceasefire violation.

The Budapest Municipal Court declined to comment on the specific case, but said in an email: "In general, in pending case(s) it is up to the relevant judge to take the step(s), who would assess the cases in line with his/her oath taken as a judge."

Budapest, run by liberal mayor Gergely Karacsony, has been locked in a financial dispute with Orban's government over a "solidarity tax" payable to the state. The dispute contributed to a Moody's downgrade of the city's credit rating .

Orban, in power since 2010, faces a tough reelection bid in parliamentary elections set for April 12.

The European Union has suspended billions of euros worth of funding over Orban's controversial rule-of-law reforms, hitting Hungary's economy.

Invoking special emergency powers, Orban said in a decree on Tuesday the pending lawsuit over the tax for 2023–2025 would be "terminated by the court." He said the tax must be collected.

Karacsony said the move was intended to prevent the city from "fighting in the courts against the extremely unjust and unlawful solidarity contribution."

"No longer even caring about pretences, the government has directly attacked the rule of law," he said in a Facebook post.

A government spokesman did not respond to Reuters' queries.

Kristof Andras Kadar, co-chair of legal advocacy group, the Hungarian Helsinki Committee, said the decree violated a core legal principle.

"This is the separation of the branches of power, as the executive branch – which is one of the parties to the lawsuit – suddenly says the court must end the case," he said.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 15:09:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LZSO72IN7NIT7JTQQCKW3S7EQE.jpg?auth=ecc9c48f98778ef256d02ab1178e319d5f951e9a71c91b8e0661b17f8ae8c21d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UK's Starmer expresses regret over Mandelson, says ex-ambassador 'lied repeatedly'</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uks-starmer-says-mandelson-repeatedly-lied-about-epstein-regrets-appointing-him-2026-02-04/</link><description>LONDON, Feb 4 - Prime Minister Keir Starmer expressed regret on Wednesday for appointing Peter Mandelson as UK ambassador to Washington, saying the Labour veteran had created a "litany of deceit" about his ties to U.S. sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

Starmer gave way to a demand by the opposition Conservative Party that the government publish information on how Mandelson was appointed. But he sought to narrow the scope of documents to be released, saying he would not publish any that could be prejudicial to national security or international relations.

Mandelson, a government minister when Starmer's Labour Party was last in power more than 15 years ago, quit the House of Lords on Tuesday over links to Epstein, and is now under police investigation for alleged misconduct in office.

Files released by the U.S. Justice Department last week include emails suggesting Mandelson had leaked government documents to Epstein, and that Epstein had recorded payments to Mandelson or his then-partner, now husband.

Mandelson has said he does not recall having received payments. He has not commented publicly on the allegations he leaked documents, and did not respond to messages seeking comment.

Starmer defended his own response, saying he had moved quickly to strip all titles and roles from a man he accused of "betraying" Britain.

But Starmer's explanation of how Mandelson was appointed did little to quieten opposition voices, who said the ambassador's selection in late 2024 put a question mark over the judgment of Starmer and his closest adviser, Morgan McSweeney.

"I am as angry as anyone about what Mandelson has been up to. The disclosures that have been made this week of him passing sensitive information at the height of the response to the 2008 financial crash is utterly shocking and appalling," Starmer told a rowdy session of parliament.

"He has betrayed our country, he's lied repeatedly, he's responsible for a litany of deceit. But this moment demands not just anger but action and that's why we've moved quickly," he said after telling lawmakers he had agreed with King Charles to remove Mandelson from the sovereign's formal body of advisers .

Parliament was due to vote later on Wednesday on the release of documents related to Mandelson's appointment.

Starmer appointed Mandelson in late 2024, arguing that Mandelson's past work in the governments of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown and as the EU's trade commissioner made him an ideal person to navigate relations with Washington under President Donald Trump.

Starmer sacked Mandelson in September after seven months in the job, when documents emerged showing Mandelson had remained close to Epstein after the financier was found guilty in 2008 of child sex crimes.

Emails released last week appeared to indicate that in 2009 Mandelson sent Epstein a memo written for Brown about possible UK asset sales and tax changes, and in 2010 gave Epstein advance notice of a 500-billion-euro ($590 billion) bailout by the European Union.

On Tuesday, Starmer's government passed a dossier about Mandelson to police, who launched an investigation into Mandelson over alleged misconduct in public office.

"The Metropolitan Police have been in touch with my office this morning to raise issues about anything that would prejudice their investigations," Starmer told parliament. "We are in discussion with them about that."</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 15:10:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/TBCLKG75D5NUVLGADX4AN2DFOU.jpg?auth=0631b09a424e4e60a8b5deae1f6b672d7a1325fcec5292e37a5d8a821c053631&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Cyprus confirms death of Russian ex-Uralkali CEO Baumgertner</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/cyprus-confirms-death-russian-ex-uralkali-ceo-baumgertner-2026-02-04/</link><description>NICOSIA, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Russian businessman Vladislav Baumgertner, a former chief executive of potash giant Uralkali, has been confirmed dead in Cyprus after going missing on January 7, authorities said on Wednesday.

Baumgertner's body was found on January 15 in a coastal area in the southern part of the island, but DNA testing was required to confirm his identity. The location where he was found falls within a civilian area controlled by the British Sovereign Base Areas in Cyprus.

"The circumstances and cause of his death are under investigation by the Criminal Investigation Department of police of the British bases," a spokesperson for the bases said, adding that Baumgertner's family had been informed.

Baumgertner, 53, had been living in the southern Cypriot city of Limassol in recent years.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 15:11:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russian comedian jailed nearly six years over war veteran joke</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-comedian-jailed-nearly-six-years-over-war-veteran-joke-2026-02-04/</link><description>MOSCOW, Feb 4 (Reuters) - A Russian stand-up comedian was convicted of inciting hatred and jailed for nearly six years on Wednesday over a joke he made about a legless war veteran, which triggered outrage among nationalists and military bloggers.

A Reuters reporter in court said that the comedian, , had been handed a sentence of five years and nine months and a fine of 300,000 roubles ($3,908).

It was the latest in a series of rulings which have harshly punished people judged by the authorities to have spoken rudely or falsely about the Russian army at a time when it is fighting in Ukraine.

Ostanin was also convicted of offending the feelings of Christians with another off-colour joke he made about Jesus, which angered Orthodox nationalists.

His arrest and treatment were punishment enough for any offence he had caused, Ostanin said during his trial.

Russia passed sweeping censorship laws in 2022 shortly after it went to war in Ukraine. Pro-Kremlin figures and organisations have since publicly denounced people they deem to have broken those laws, and have reported them to the authorities.

Ostanin's problems began after he performed in front of a small audience in March last year and joked about how an impoverished war veteran who had lost his legs after being blown up by a mine, and was now forced to get around on a skateboard, had run over his foot while navigating a Moscow underpass.

Ostanin also referred to a wheelchair as a "stump carrier."

Ostanin was not a household name at the time and a video of the moment he told the joke's punchline showed a panel of four fellow comedians remaining straight-faced as the sound of several audience members laughing rang out.

But video of the joke was seized upon by war bloggers and nationalists on the Telegram social media app, causing it to go viral with critics accusing Ostanin of crossing a line by crassly mocking veterans who were risking their lives on the battlefield.

Sorok Sorokov, a powerful Orthodox nationalist group, said many Russians had not understood that times had changed and that the state should tighten its control over such performances to stem what it called a general decline in moral values.

"In recent years, comedians have often crossed red lines and made jokes about topics that are taboo in any normal society," said Georgy Soldatov, director of the group's human rights centre.

Frightened by the backlash against his performance, Ostanin tried to flee Russia in March last year but was arrested by police in neighbouring Belarus, a close ally of Russia, and returned to Moscow to face charges.

Asked by the judge on Wednesday whether he understood his sentence, Ostanin said: "To hell with your judicial practice. No, I don't."</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 15:11:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/QPZ7CXANYVIS5JTT7SHFWNIUGA.jpg?auth=75abb2a8a0306a1db6da4989c312a875ccd5d2b3afbea40e23382690bdcd77c0&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China's Xi and Trump talk by phone, Chinese state media report</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/chinas-xi-trump-hold-call-chinese-state-media-reports-2026-02-04/</link><description>BEIJING, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Chinese President Xi Jinping spoke with U.S. President Donald Trump by phone on Wednesday, state broadcaster CCTV said, ahead of an expected visit by Trump to China in April and hours after Xi had a virtual meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin .

The latest test of Iran's missile capabilities occurred during the 12-day war in June 2025 with Israel during which Tehran fired salvoes of ballistic missiles into Israel, killing dozens of people and wrecking dozens of buildings and apartment blocks in the country's centre and north.

According to an analysis from the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) and AEI Critical Threats Project, Israel "likely destroyed around a third of the Iranian missile launchers" during the conflict.

Iranian officials have repeatedly said Tehran had recovered from the damage incurred during the war and that its capabilities are better than ever.

A ballistic missile is a rocket-propelled weapon that is guided during its initial ascent but follows a free-fall trajectory under gravity for most of its flight. It delivers warheads - containing either conventional explosives or potentially biological, chemical or nuclear munitions - over varying distances, with classifications ranging from short to intercontinental ranges depending on the missile type.

Western powers regard Iran's ballistic missile arsenal both as a conventional military threat to Middle East stability and a possible delivery mechanism for nuclear weapons, should Tehran develop them. It denies any intent to build atomic bombs.

Iran has the largest stockpile of ballistic missiles in the Middle East, according to the U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence. Iranian missiles have a self-imposed range of 2,000 km (1,240 miles), which officials in the past said was enough to protect the country since it covers the distance to Israel.

Many of Iran's missile sites are located in and around the capital Tehran. There are at least five known underground "missile cities" in various provinces, including Kermanshah and Semnan, as well as near the Gulf region.

The arsenal encompasses multiple long-range missiles that can reach Israel, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies. It says these include the Sejil, with a range of 2,000 km; Emad, 1,700 km; Ghadr, 2,000 km; Shahab-3, 1,300 km; Khorramshahr, 2,000 km; and Hoveyzeh 1,350 km.

The semi-official Iranian news outlet ISNA published a graphic in April 2025 showing nine Iranian missiles it said could reach Israel. These included the Sejil, which ISNA said was capable of flying at more than 17,000 km (10,500 miles) per hour and had a range of 2,500 km (1,550 miles); the Kheibar, with a range of 2,000 km (1,240 miles); and the Haj Qasem, with a range of 1,400 km (870 miles).

The Arms Control Association, a Washington-based think tank, says Iran's ballistic arsenal included the Shahab-1, with an estimated range of 300 km (190 miles); the Zolfaghar with 700 km (435 miles); Shahab-3 with 800-1,000 km (500 to 620 miles); Emad-1, a missile under development with a range up to 2,000 km (1,240 miles), and a Sejil model under development with an expected range of 1,500-2,500 km (930 to 1,550 miles).

Iran says its ballistic missiles provide an important deterrent and retaliatory force against the U.S., Israel and other potential regional targets.

According to a 2023 report by Behnam Ben Taleblu, a Senior Fellow at the U.S.-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies, Iran continues to develop underground missile depots complete with transport and firing systems, as well as subterranean missile production and storage centres. In 2020, Iran fired a ballistic missile from underground for the first time, it said.

"Years of reverse-engineering missiles and producing various missile classes have also taught Iran about stretching airframes and building them with lighter composite materials to increase missile range," the report said.

In June 2023, Iran presented what officials described as its first domestically made hypersonic ballistic missile, the official IRNA news agency reported. Hypersonic missiles can fly at least five times faster than the speed of sound and on a complex trajectory, which makes them difficult to intercept.

The Arms Control Association says Iran's missile programme is largely based on North Korean and Russian designs and has benefited from Chinese assistance.

Iran also has cruise missiles such as the Kh-55, an air-launched nuclear-capable weapon with a range up to 3,000 km (1,860 miles).

Iran responded to U.S. participation in Israel's air war against Iran in June by firing missiles at the U.S. Al Udeid air base in Qatar, but Tehran gave advance warning and no one was hurt. Washington announced a ceasefire hours later.

Iran's Revolutionary Guards used missiles in January 2024 when they said that they had attacked Israel's spy headquarters in Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurdistan region, and that they had also fired at Islamic State militants in Syria.

Tehran also announced missile strikes targeting two bases of a Baloch militant group in neighbouring Pakistan.

Saudi Arabia and the U.S. have said they believe Iran was behind a drone and missile attack on Saudi Arabia's prized oil facilities in 2019. Tehran denied the allegation.

In 2020, the Islamic Republic launched missiles at U.S.-led forces in Iraq, including the al-Asad air base, in retaliation for a U.S. drone strike that killed Major General Qassem Soleimani, a top commander of the Revolutionary Guards.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 15:16:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/Z3D6PFJBV5KSBD5QPIB7PD3TZM.jpg?auth=40dba258b63af677143e4e9d2b4b76bde884c0691f94461d9164519a1be83afb&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Exclusive: Donors reluctant to fund US-led Gaza plan as Hamas disarmament push stalls</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/donors-reluctant-fund-us-led-gaza-plan-hamas-disarmament-push-stalls-sources-say-2026-02-04/</link><description>JERUSALEM, Feb 4 (Reuters) - The U.S. has yet to secure funding commitments for its Gaza reconstruction plan as potential donors voice concerns that disagreements over Hamas disarmament could lead Israel to resume full-scale war in the enclave, sources told Reuters.

Hamas laying down its weapons is a key requirement under Donald Trump's plan to end the Gaza war. It calls for Israel's military to withdraw troops as Hamas disarms and for Gaza's reconstruction to be overseen by a "Board of Peace" chaired by the U.S. President.

Trump's plan got a boost this week with the reopening of Gaza's Rafah border crossing with Egypt. But sources close to Hamas say the group has yet to start talks on disarming, meant to precede the start of rebuilding Gaza's destroyed cities .

Two sources with direct knowledge of the Board's planning said that countries were hesitant to commit funds to a rebuilding plan unveiled last month by Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, until Hamas disarms.

"Countries want to see the funding will go for reconstruction within demilitarized places, and not to throw the money into another war zone," one of the sources said.

"If we pass that obstacle, then funding will not be an issue."

Seven Western diplomats told Reuters that the funding holdup, which has not been previously reported, was also being driven by a demand by some potential donors for funds to be managed by the United Nations rather than the Board of Peace.

The funding delay leaves Gaza's devastated population in limbo, unable to begin clearing rubble or rebuilding basic infrastructure, and feeds into worries among U.S. allies that a fragile October truce, shaken by repeated Israeli attacks in Gaza, could break down and lead to a resumption of heavy fighting between Israel and Hamas militants.

Alongside governments, potential donors could also include private sector contributors, the diplomats and the two sources said. They estimated the potential rebuilding cost to be in the range of $100 billion.

That money would fund a "New Gaza" rebuilt from scratch to include seafront residential towers, data centres and industrial parks, Kushner said at the World Economic Forum in Davos on January 22.

The plan does not call for compensation for Palestinians who saw their homes destroyed. Two of the diplomats said that it was not clear how the "New Gaza" plan would address land rights .

Kushner said in Davos that an event would be held in Washington in the coming weeks "where we'll announce a lot of the contributions that will be made ... from the private sector."

But the two sources familiar with the Board's planning said a date for that conference had not yet been set.

"In the meantime, we're not waiting for the event. There is discussion one on one," one of the sources said, without identifying specific donor targets.

A senior European diplomat said that no European or Western country had yet committed funds for Gaza's reconstruction.

"We need some serious private money ... The Europeans are not capable of funding it," the senior European diplomat said, citing fiscal constraints and growing domestic opposition within Europe to foreign aid spending.

Wealthy, oil-rich Gulf Arab states have expressed hesitation at financing Gaza's reconstruction without a broader political solution that includes Hamas disarming.

Representatives for the Board of Peace and for its Palestinian technocratic committee did not immediately respond to requests for comment for this story.

After a two-year Israeli assault that left most of Gaza in ruins and Hamas weakened, the group is still believed to possess rockets, which several Western intelligence sources estimate to number in the hundreds. It is also estimated to possess thousands of light weapons including rifles.

Senior officials in Israel, which launched the assault after the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack, say they do not believe Hamas will lay down its weapons without the use of force and that the military is preparing to return to war.

The first phase of Trump's plan left Hamas in control of a bit under half of Gaza, where the group polices streets and has reestablished its hold. Israel accuses Hamas of planning or attempting to carry out attacks on its troops, prompting strikes that have killed hundreds.

Hamas has agreed to discuss disarmament with other Palestinian factions, but neither Washington nor regional mediators had presented the group with any detailed or concrete disarmament proposal, two Hamas officials told Reuters .

One of the sources with knowledge of the Board's planning said it would be difficult to secure private sector financing without at least some progress toward disarmament.

"We came to the conclusion that if you really want to (rebuild) with the full spectrum of financing, you need peace area pricing," the source said, suggesting the cost of financing would be risk-adjusted to the level of security in a given area.

"Now it doesn't mean that we wait for the full process to be done, but we want to see that it's really happening with full cooperation."

One of the first tasks will be clearing an estimated 68 tonnes of rubble and war debris in Gaza. The Board of Peace was in talks with several parties to award potential rubble clearing contracts, the source and a U.S. official familiar with the matter said.

Several rubble clearing contracts could be awarded, the source said, adding that the aim is for tenders and the awarding of contracts to eventually be managed by a Palestinian technocratic body overseen by the Board.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 15:16:43 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HWIVS64RMBMKVLZWGBMHYNPJG4.jpg?auth=badf1d93cf148696b122f2c03d74d318eb7d714c4574bb01a1ff0c74753f51ad&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russian comedian jailed nearly six years over war veteran joke</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-comedian-jailed-nearly-six-years-over-war-veteran-joke-2026-02-04/</link><description>MOSCOW, Feb 4 (Reuters) - A Russian stand-up comedian was convicted of inciting hatred and jailed for nearly six years on Wednesday over a joke he made about a legless war veteran, which triggered outrage among nationalists and military bloggers.

About 700 of the roughly 3,000 federal officers deployed around Minnesota will be withdrawn, Homan said. The immigration operations have upended the Twin Cities and escalated protests, especially since the killing of protester Alex Pretti, the second fatal shooting by federal officers in Minneapolis .

“Given this increase in unprecedented collaboration, and as a result of the need for less public safety officers to do this work and a safer environment, I am announcing, effective immediately, we’ll draw down 700 people effective today — 700 law enforcement personnel,” Homan said during a news conference.

Last week, Homan said federal officials could reduce the number of federal agents in Minnesota, but only if state and local officials cooperate. His comments came after President Donald Trump seemed to signal a willingness to ease tensions in the Minneapolis and St. Paul area.

Homan pushed for jails to alert ICE to inmates who could be deported, saying transferring such inmates to the agency is safer because it means fewer officers have to be out looking for people in the country illegally.

At the news conference on Wednesday, Homan also said he is not leaving Minneapolis until a crackdown on illegal immigration is complete.

"I'm not leaving until we get it all done," said Homan.

The White House has long blamed problems arresting criminal immigrants on places known as sanctuary jurisdictions, a term generally applied to state and local governments that limit law enforcement cooperation with the Department of Homeland Security.

When questioned, Homan said he thinks the ICE operation in Minnesota has been a success.

“Yeah, I just listed a bunch of people we took off the streets of the Twin Cities, so I think it's very effective as far as public safety goes,” Homan said. “Was it a perfect operation? No. No. We created one unified chain of command to make sure everybody is on the same page. And make sure we follow the rules. I don’t think anybody, purposely, didn’t do something they should have done."</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 15:18:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/b9e63cde-01d7-11f1-ae3e-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26034550897384.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Germany seeks broader spy powers to counter rising hybrid threats</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/germany-seeks-broader-spy-powers-counter-rising-hybrid-threats-2026-02-04/</link><description>BERLIN, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Germany's government wants to give its spy agencies broader powers to confront rising hybrid threats, a sensitive step in a country where intelligence operations remain tightly constrained by post-war limits designed to prevent a repeat of Nazi abuses.

Many attacks on Germany in recent years were thwarted only thanks to intelligence shared by allies whose agencies operate with wider powers, Thorsten Frei, head of the German chancellor's office, acknowledged this week.

Frei, of the ruling conservatives, is calling for a "paradigm shift" that would allow the foreign intelligence agency, the BND, to deploy more intrusive surveillance tools, including access to private mobile phones and the ability to store data for up to a year.

"The aim is to be on an equal footing with our European partners in the field of intelligence gathering," he told Tagesspiegel newspaper.

"Intelligence services cooperate worldwide, and the only hard currency that counts is information."

Long dogged by questions over Nazi-era continuities , the BND has sought to define itself against Germany's two darkest intelligence legacies: Nazi repression and the Stasi's surveillance state.

That history must now be weighed against the heightened threats facing Germany, Frei said.

"In a time that is becoming increasingly threatening, we cannot stop at intelligence gathering alone," he said. "To protect our country, we must also put our services in a position to carry out certain operations."

Beyond collecting and analysing data, the BND should also be empowered to disrupt radio links during drone attacks and to disable so-called cryptocurrency wallets used to finance murders or acts of sabotage, he said.

Frei said legislation to reform the agency should be adopted this year, although it is likely to face resistance from opposition parties. No draft bill has yet been submitted to the Bundestag.

He also wants oversight of the BND to be concentrated in parliament's intelligence control committee, rather than requiring the agency to answer additionally to the so-called G10 commission, which monitors surveillance measures that interfere with communications privacy.

The proposals have drawn criticism from the opposition.

"Anyone who at the same time wants to extend data-retention periods and reduce oversight bodies is acting recklessly and blind to democracy," senior Left Party lawmaker Clara Buenger was quoted as saying by Tagesspiegel.

She warned that the plans represented "a massive leap in powers and in escalation risk."

Separately, Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt is pushing for similar upgrades to the domestic intelligence agency, the BfV, to allow it more surveillance methods and operational capabilities.

Both agencies have seen sharp increases in their budgets of more than 25% this year.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 16:12:04 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/FQAPMQIDPRKYTLQIQHMDU7LGPA.jpg?auth=5b0a215dde3c31bad064793ab70dd0bf88a9845204ee4c0273e67bab3b053f06&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Four people, including two Chinese nationals, arrested in France on suspicion of spying</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/four-people-including-two-chinese-nationals-arrested-france-suspicion-spying-2026-02-04/</link><description>PARIS, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Four people, including two Chinese nationals, have been arrested in France on suspicion of spying for China and have been brought before an investigative judge, the Paris public prosecutor's office said on Wednesday

On February 4, the cybercrime division of the Paris public prosecutor's office opened a judicial investigation into the affair, said the prosecutor's office in a statement.

This followed the discovery that two Chinese nationals had entered French territory with the aim of capturing satellite data from the Starlink network and data from entities of vital importance, particularly military entities, in order to transmit it to their country of origin, namely China.

Four people were brought before the investigating judge, with two of them being remanded in custody, it added.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 16:12:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/J2OT46IMSVO2LHG3HHCW3T5WGM.jpg?auth=1bb42dc711388997fd45b2f1aac58ca16ebd233c55b315fd77faa5f6343d7aff&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Explainer: Why is UN warning of 'imminent financial collapse'?</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/why-is-un-warning-imminent-financial-collapse-2026-02-04/</link><description>GENEVA/WASHINGTON, Feb 4 (Reuters) - U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres is sounding the alarm on U.N. finances, warning that the world body is at risk of "imminent financial collapse" due to unpaid fees and a budget rule that forces it to return unspent funds.

Guterres has repeatedly spoken about the U.N.'s worsening liquidity crisis but this was his starkest warning yet, and it came as the United States, its main contributor - and debtor - is retreating from multilateralism on numerous fronts.

Here are some questions and answers about U.N. finances:

In a letter to member states last week, Guterres said there was a record $1.57 billion in outstanding dues for the U.N.'s regular budget, without naming the nations that owed them.

U.N. officials say more than 95 percent of what is owed to the regular U.N. budget is owed by the United States - $2.19 billion by the start of February. The U.S. also owes another $2.4 billion for current and past peace-keeping missions and $43.6 million for U.N. tribunals.
On December 30, the U.N. General Assembly approved $3.45 billion for the regular U.N. budget for 2026, following weeks of negotiations. This covers costs of running U.N. offices around the world, including the headquarters in New York, staff salaries, meetings and development and human rights work.

U.N. officials say the U.S. did not pay into the regular budget last year and owes $827 million for that, as well as $767 million for 2026. Next in line were Venezuela and Mexico, owing $38 million and $20 million respectively.

Contributions depend on economy size. The U.S. accounts for 22% of the regular budget, followed by China with 20%. Fees are officially due by Feb. 8 and so far 41 states have paid for 2026, a U.N. document showed , opens new tab .

Without naming the United States, U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said this week the U.N's "cash-flow problem" could be solved "if member states, who have an obligation to pay, pay."

The crunch comes at a time when U.S. President Donald Trump has launched a Board of Peace with himself as lifetime chair, which some fear could undermine the United Nations, a body with 193 member states formed in the ashes of World War Two that works to maintain international peace and security.

Under Trump, as well as refusing to make mandatory payments to the U.N.'s regular and peacekeeping budgets, the U.S. has slashed voluntary funding to U.N. agencies with their own budgets, and moved to exit U.N. organizations including the World Health Organization. In December, the U.N. appealed for a 2026 aid budget only half the size of what it had hoped for in 2025 , acknowledging a plunge in donor funding at a time when humanitarian needs have never been greater.

Guterres launched a reform task force last year , UN80, seeking to cut costs and improve efficiency. The approved 2026 regular budget is roughly $200 million higher than he proposed, but about 7 per cent lower than the approved 2025 budget.

Guterres warned in his letter that the U.N. could run out of cash by July and cited a "Kafkaesque" requirement for it to credit back hundreds of millions of dollars in unspent dues to states each year even if it never received the money. U.N. officials hope to overhaul this "bizarre" rule, which Guterres has called "a race to bankruptcy."

WHAT HAS THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION SAID?

Speaking to Politico on Sunday, Trump , opens new tab cast himself as the savior of the U.N. but declined to say if the U.S. would pay up.

According to Politico, Trump said he was unaware the U.S. was behind in its commitments but was sure he could "solve the problem very easily" and get other countries to pay — if only the U.N. would ask.

The White House and State Department did not respond when asked if the U.S. will pay, or if Trump meant that other countries should put up the money instead.

A senior State Department official did though say that "the U.N. needs to get back to basics" and accused it of wasting money.

"We have no interest in continuing to spend American tax dollars on such waste, fraud and abuse," the official said.

"The U.N. continues to pay its staff far more than for comparable U.S. government positions, provide unacceptable benefits and pensions, and increase the number of high-level bureaucrats in New York - up over 30% - in the last two years alone. The U.N. also spent $340 million just on meetings and conferences last year."

According to a draft U.N. budget document seen by Reuters in September, U.N. cost-savings plans for next year envisaged far smaller cuts to senior staff than to lower ranks .

It showed just two of 58 department head posts in the layer of under-secretaries-general beneath Guterres, or 3%, would go, compared to around 19% across the board and up to 28% for one lower-ranking category, according to Reuters calculations.

A U.N. official said Guterres aimed to deliver on reform while limiting the impact of cutbacks. If the U.S. did not pay, "at the end of the day, meetings can't be organized, work's not done, staff is not being paid," the official said.

At the White House, the two presidents agreed to joint military and intelligence actions against Colombian criminal capos who together produce and supply much of the world's cocaine.

Colombian Defence Minister Pedro Sanchez said the two countries would target Ivan Mordisco, Colombia's most wanted rebel; Chiquito Malo, commander of the Clan del Golfo cartel; and Pablito, an ELN guerrilla leader operating on the Venezuelan border.

The Petro-Trump pact upends years of spluttering Colombian efforts to negotiate peace accords with big criminal groups.

Colombia produces about 70 percent of the world's cocaine, and the United States is by far the world's largest consumer.

"These are not new Colombian targets, but they are new targets for a joint US-Colombia operation," Sanchez told Colombia's Caracol radio.

Sanchez said Venezuela would also be asked to join the campaign. Many cartel and guerrilla fighters have traditionally found safety crossing the Colombia-Venezuela border.

The Colombian governments have long accused Caracas of funding and offering a safe haven to leftist guerrilla and cocaine trafficking groups.

But after the ouster of Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro , there are hopes that security cooperation can improve.

Talks with the Gulf Clan had been ongoing for about five months in Qatar.

"This would be an attack on the good faith and commitments of Doha," the Gulf Clan said in a statement on social media announcing it would "temporarily" leave the negotiating table and hold internal consultations.

Israel controls the entry of all goods and people into the besieged Palestinian territory, where humanitarian conditions remain dire despite a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas which came into effect on October 10.

A justice ministry statement said the smuggled goods were worth millions of Israeli shekels and included cartons of cigarettes, iPhones, batteries, communication cables, car parts and more.

It described the operation as a "serious case of organised, systematic, and sophisticated smuggling of various goods into the Gaza Strip for profit", which began in the summer of 2025, when war was still raging in Gaza.

The justice ministry statement said charges had been filed against 12 individuals and one company.

A joint statement from the police and Israel's Shin Bet domestic intelligence agency confirmed they had "arrested several Israeli citizens and Gaza Strip residents who smuggled goods prohibited from entering the Gaza Strip".

It said those arrested included reservists in the Israeli military.

The statement added that the suspects had been "willfully ignoring the direct contribution of this activity to the strengthening of terrorist organisations in the Strip", notably Hamas.

"This morning (Wednesday), the Southern District Prosecutor's Office filed indictments against 12 of the suspects for offences including assisting the enemy in wartime, performing actions with property for terrorist purposes, obtaining something by fraud under aggravated circumstances, bribery offences, and economic offences," it added.

Israeli media reported that the brother of Israel's Shin Bet chief, David Zini, was allegedly linked to smuggling cigarettes into Gaza.

Reports said that Bezalel Zini was expected to be indicted on Thursday.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 16:18:08 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/e0ca775a-01d4-11f1-bb85-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25306600276744.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'Nobody wants to die': Ukrainians flee from southeast as Russia lurches forward</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/nobody-wants-die-ukrainians-flee-southeast-russia-lurches-forward-2026-02-04/</link><description>TAVRIISKE, Ukraine, Feb 4 (Reuters) - In the last few weeks, buses have stopped running to the village of Tavriiske in southeast Ukraine from the major city of Zaporizhzhia, some 50 km (31 miles) away.

As the war with Russia has drawn nearer, the village is slowly emptying. Maryna Vyshnevska, 35, said it had become too dangerous for her and her five children - some of the few remaining residents - to stay.

"We thought they (the Russians) would be driven back and all this would stop," Vyshnevska said, before packing her family and a handful of belongings into a police evacuation bus. "But when we realised it would only get worse and worse, it was better to leave."

As Russia and Ukraine start new U.S.-brokered peace talks in Abu Dhabi on Wednesday, Moscow's forces have slowly ground forward along various parts of the 1,200-km (745 mile) front line in recent months.

While closing on the so-called "fortress belt" of cities in the eastern Donetsk region, Russian troops are also advancing toward Zaporizhzhia - which is the capital of one of four Ukrainian regions the Kremlin has claimed as its own despite occupying only part of the Zaporizhzhia region.

Fighting has intensified in recent weeks in key areas of the southeastern front, Ukraine's military has said, particularly around the town of Huliaipole - 40 km (25 miles) to the east of Tavriiske.

In Tavriiske and nearby villages, which sit in a bulge in the frontline with Russian forces on three sides, residents told Reuters during a recent visit that they feared for their lives amid the constant threat of drone and bomb attacks.

Police teams and volunteers roam the main regional road - which is shrouded in anti-drone netting - to rescue residents in danger. Local authorities said almost no families remain in the area around Tavriiske.

"Every day, every week, we see more destruction and a greater risk of entering towns like these," said volunteer Vlad Makhovskyi, 51, adorned with a tactical helmet and gear.

At one location, two men lugged an elderly woman out of a ramshackle house on a bright pink bed sheet.

Nataliia Fedorenko, 66, broke down into tears describing the mounting emotional toll of remaining in a war zone as fighting worsened. Like Vyshnevska, she also left.

The BLA is the strongest of a number of insurgent groups long operating in the province bordering Afghanistan and Iran, a mineral-rich region that is home to Beijing's investment in Gwadar deep-water port and other projects.

Here are facts about the group, which has also targeted Chinese interests.

The BLA seeks independence for Balochistan, a province located in Pakistan's southwest and bordering Afghanistan to the north and Iran to the west.

It is the biggest of several ethnic insurgent groups that have battled the federal government for decades, saying it unfairly exploits Balochistan's rich gas and mineral resources.

The group says Balochistan's natural wealth belongs to its people and rejects federal control over resource extraction and security.

Balochistan's mountainous border region serves as a safe haven and training ground for the Baloch insurgents and Islamist militants.

Once considered a low-intensity insurgency, attacks by the Baloch Liberation Army have grown more frequent, coordinated and lethal in recent years.

The group stunned Pakistan's security establishment in 2022 when it stormed army and navy bases.

In August 2024, militants carried out coordinated attacks across Balochistan, including highway assaults in which passengers were pulled from buses and shot after identity checks.

In March 2025, militants opened fire on the Jaffar Express passenger train after sabotaging railway tracks, briefly taking hostages and triggering a major security operation , officials and local media said.

The BLA has deployed women suicide bombers, including in an attack on Chinese nationals in Karachi, and is designated a foreign terrorist organisation by the United States. Pakistan accuses India and Afghanistan of backing the militants, an allegation both countries deny.

The BLA often targets infrastructure and security forces in Balochistan, but has also struck in other areas - most notably the southern port city of Karachi .

The insurgents target Pakistan's army and Chinese interests, in particular the strategic port of Gwadar on the Arabian Sea, accusing Beijing of helping Islamabad to exploit the province.

Militants have killed Chinese citizens working in the region and attacked Beijing's consulate and language centre in Karachi.

It has also attacked civilians, migrant labourers from other provinces, a shift officials say marks an escalation in tactics.

The BLA, separately, was also at the centre of tit-for-tat strikes last year between Iran and Pakistan over what they called militant bases on each other's territory, which brought the neighbours close to war.

Balochistan is an important part of China's $65 billion investment in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, a wing of President Xi Jinping's Belt and Road initiative.

It is home to key mining projects, including Reko Diq , run by mining giant Barrick Gold (ABX.TO), and believed to be one of the world's largest gold and copper mines.

China also operates a gold and copper mine in the province.

The decades-old insurgency has continued to keep the province of some 15 million people unstable and created security concerns around Pakistan's plans to access untapped resources.

It is Pakistan's largest province by area, but smallest by population. Balochistan also has a long Arabian Sea coastline, not far from the Gulf's Strait of Hormuz oil shipping lane.

Hundreds of Baloch activists, many of them women, have protested in Islamabad and Balochistan over alleged abuses by security forces - accusations the government denies.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 17:27:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/SVEJ5NU7MNNEDFNEKCH5X6PLIY.jpg?auth=a64f66e197e9d7b214f62f72367754736dc0465e49b34be95ed906d26751b1ad&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Norway's Socialist Party backs down from threat to LNG electricity project</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/norways-socialist-party-backs-down-threat-lng-electricity-project-2026-02-04/</link><description>OSLO, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Norway's Socialist Party has withdrawn its support for a proposal to block Equinor's Hammerfest liquefied natural gas plant from receiving a planned onshore power connection, clearing the way for the grid development to proceed.

Parliament is due on Thursday to vote on an opposition proposal seeking to revoke the LNG plant's planned link to the power grid, but the motion is likely to fail without backing from the Socialist Party.

The government approved the connection in 2023 to cut greenhouse gas emissions at the plant on Melkoeya island off Hammerfest and extend its lifetime.

Critics say hooking up the currently gas-driven plant to the regional grid could deprive other companies of electricity, push up local prices and harm the interests of Sami Indigenous reindeer herders.

The far-left Red Party had tabled a motion to kill the plan, seeking to instruct the minority Labour government to "facilitate the release of the power allocated to the electrification project on Melkoeya" by grid operator Statnett.

Several political parties, including the right-wing Progress, had signalled they would back the proposal in recent weeks, putting it on course for approval.

The Socialist Party said on Wednesday it remained opposed to the project but was withdrawing its support for the motion because it was "in practice unlawful".

Earlier on Wednesday, Equinor (EQNR.OL) , opens new tab CEO Anders Opedal warned that the motion would have repercussions far beyond Hammerfest.

"This creates uncertainty for everyone who works on and with Melkoeya, but also for everyone who makes investments based on agreements in Norway and for Europe that needs the energy," Opedal said.

The charity said in a statement that South Sudanese government forces were the only armed party in the country with the capacity to perform aerial attacks.

Jonglei state's information minister declined comment when contacted by Reuters, directing all questions to the army.

An army spokesperson did not answer calls seeking comment.

Clashes that the United Nations says are occurring at a scale not seen since 2017 have been convulsing South Sudan for months, raising fears of a rekindling of civil war in Africa's youngest country.

Some of the fiercest fighting has taken place in Jonglei, located in the country's east on the border with Ethiopia, where government forces are seeking to halt an offensive by fighters loyal to Sudan People's Liberation Army-in-Opposition (SPLA-IO).

MSF said one of its staff members had suffered minor injuries in the airstrike on the hospital in Lankien, adding it had evacuated the hospital and discharged patients hours earlier after receiving information about a possible attack.

In a separate incident earlier on Tuesday, MSF said its health facility in Pieri, also in Jonglei, was looted by unknown assailants, rendering it unusable.

MSF said it was the only health provider serving about 250,000 people in Lankien and Pieri.

Late last month South Sudan's military ordered civilians and personnel from the United Nations mission and all charities to evacuate three counties in Jonglei state ahead of an operation there against opposition forces.

The U.N. mission has said that at least 180,000 people in Jonglei have been displaced by recent fighting.

South Sudan's 2013-18 civil war was fought along largely ethnic lines and cost about 400,000 lives.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 17:28:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Norway's Socialist Party backs down from threat to LNG electricity project</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/norways-socialist-party-backs-down-threat-lng-electricity-project-2026-02-04/</link><description>OSLO, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Norway's Socialist Party has withdrawn its support for a proposal to block Equinor's Hammerfest liquefied natural gas plant from receiving a planned onshore power connection, clearing the way for the grid development to proceed.

The charity said in a statement that South Sudanese government forces were the only armed party in the country with the capacity to perform aerial attacks.

Jonglei state's information minister declined comment when contacted by Reuters, directing all questions to the army.

An army spokesperson did not answer calls seeking comment.

Clashes that the United Nations says are occurring at a scale not seen since 2017 have been convulsing South Sudan for months, raising fears of a rekindling of civil war in Africa's youngest country.

Some of the fiercest fighting has taken place in Jonglei, located in the country's east on the border with Ethiopia, where government forces are seeking to halt an offensive by fighters loyal to Sudan People's Liberation Army-in-Opposition (SPLA-IO).

MSF said one of its staff members had suffered minor injuries in the airstrike on the hospital in Lankien, adding it had evacuated the hospital and discharged patients hours earlier after receiving information about a possible attack.

In a separate incident earlier on Tuesday, MSF said its health facility in Pieri, also in Jonglei, was looted by unknown assailants, rendering it unusable.

MSF said it was the only health provider serving about 250,000 people in Lankien and Pieri.

Late last month South Sudan's military ordered civilians and personnel from the United Nations mission and all charities to evacuate three counties in Jonglei state ahead of an operation there against opposition forces.

The U.N. mission has said that at least 180,000 people in Jonglei have been displaced by recent fighting.

South Sudan's 2013-18 civil war was fought along largely ethnic lines and cost about 400,000 lives.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 17:31:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Digital sovereignty (3/3): Are European citizens trapped into using US Big Tech?</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/technology/20260204-digital-sovereignty-european-citizens-trapped-into-using-us-big-tech</link><description>Digital sovereignty in Europe is not just an issue for states and companies. “We've had almost 8,000 participants who've signed up for the campaign in less than a month. That's more than we were expecting,” said Bergliot Christensen, who took part in the launch in early January of the Danish initiative Digital Stemme (“Digital Voice”) , which aims to help individuals regain control of their digital lives from the Big Tech giants.

“We launched our initiative on January 1, right around the time that US President Donald Trump started accelerating his rhetoric about invading Greenland ,” Christensen said.

“And I think that just made everything click in a new way where we don't just need to talk about how these things are an issue, we need to start acting – and we need to do it now.”

Tech giants have become so embedded in modern life that it is easy to forget how much power and influence they have over normal people just living their lives.

Christensen said there has long been “a feeling that something isn't right with the way that we all assembled online communities that don't always have our best interests in mind”.

“Then, shortly after Trump’s election, that photo of him posing with all the major tech bosses, looking smug, came to reinforce that impression,” she said.

While Danes have found themselves on the front lines of the pressure campaign from Donald Trump, they are not the only ones developing a technological aversion to anything “Made in USA”.

In Germany , the Chaos Computer Club – Europe’s oldest and largest hacktivist group – launched “Digital Independence Day,” or DI-Day , on January 6.

The initiative consists of monthly meetings across Germany, held on the first Sunday of each month, aimed at helping beginners “de-Google” their habits.

“We want to offer concrete, free and gradual help to get rid of American services. The idea is to turn a process that can seem tedious and technical into something rather fun and collaborative,” said Jochim Selzer, one of the Chaos Computer Club’s spokespersons on “digital self-defence”.

The aim is not to do everything at once. “For example, we first try out LibreOffice. Then, at the following event, we try switching from X to Mastodon. On the third meeting, we add Signal to our phones,” Selzer said.

In France , the French Data Network, a group promoting free software, backed the DI-Day initiative.

These Danish and German efforts may look like militant acts – and in part, they are.

But Trump’s threats to use technological leverage to pressure Europe do not concern only state sovereignty and the competitiveness of European companies.

“It's also an issue for individuals. Personally, I'm worried about my children and my grandchildren,” said Harald Wehnes, spokesperson for the Digital Sovereignty working group of the German Informatics Society.

A computer scientist at the University of Würzburg, Wehnes published an open letter denouncing what he calls “American technological imperialism” , which he says aims to turn Europe and its inhabitants into a “digital colony” of Washington and Big Tech – powerful multinationals such as Google , Meta and Amazon.

“Digital platforms [Facebook, Instagram, X] control the flow of information,” said Martin Hullin, director of the European Network for Technological Resilience and Sovereignty at the Bertelsmann Foundation, a German thinktank.

“Algorithms can polarise and disinformation can also undermine social cohesion,” he added.

There are precedents. “The Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2018 showed how data available on social networks can be exploited to influence user behaviour,” warned Frans Imbert-Vier, chief executive of the Swiss technology consulting firm UBCOM and an advocate of technological independence.

The collection of personal data on Facebook allowed Cambridge Analytica , a data analysis firm, to tailor political advertisements in an effort to influence US voters in 2016.

And those who oppose such practices may face consequences from the tech giants, who have little interest in relinquishing their position.

“Two German activists that are fighting hate online have been doing so very well for the past years that they ended up being banned from traveling to the US,” Hullin said.

The ban was imposed on the grounds that they were acting against freedom of expression.

German authorities denounced the decision as an attempt to impose a vision of free speech on Europeans that serves the purposes of Trump and billionaire X owner Elon Musk .

Christensen fears that digital dependence on these platforms has already backfired on Europeans amid the stand-off between Europe and Washington.

“I can’t prove it, but during a rally some people found that their posts about this event were not getting as much traction and reach on Facebook as they used to. And that naturally led to the question, is Facebook suppressing information about this demonstration in Denmark ?”

“We shouldn't tolerate having our discussions controlled by external forces located in a country with which we are in conflict,” she added.

Individuals targeted by the US administration could find themselves cut off from key aspects of digital life, with tangible consequences.

“What happens if you no longer have access to certain online payment methods or shopping sites where you used to buy your groceries?” Hullin asked.

Without Apple Pay, PayPal or access to Amazon, digital life can quickly become much more complicated.

While the Trump administration once championed “alternative facts”, America's Big Tech firms are no fans of alternatives to their tools and platforms. Competitors are required to fend off accusations of monopoly, but they remain largely invisible, crushed by “the massive marketing budgets that tech giants have been showering on the public for decades”, says Martin Hullin, head of the European Network for Technological Resilience and Sovereignty at the Bertelsmann Foundation, a German think tank.

Yet there is a world beyond Gmail, Word, X, Chrome and Apple. Europe, in particular, is home to “many small companies with very interesting ideas and products that are sometimes of better quality than their American equivalents”, argues Frans Imbert-Vier, CEO of technology consulting firm UBCOM and a key advocate of European technological independence.

The hard part is often finding them. Who, for example, has ever heard of Olvid, a French alternative to WhatsApp and text messaging?

France’s Emmanuel Macron has sought to set an example with his “start-up nation” slogan. His government has developed a whole batch of homegrown digital tools to escape American control, aiming to replace Teams with “Visio”, Google Drive with “Files”, and WeTransfer with “FranceTransfer”.

With strained EU-US relations leading to renewed interest in technological sovereignty, some experts in the field have posted catalogues of alternative solutions online.

For each American software programme, Austrian IT developer Constantin Graf has compiled an almost exhaustive list of European alternatives. The ambitious German project Digital Independence Day is less exhaustive but more educational. Its website offers step-by-step instructions on how to switch, for instance, from PayPal to Wero, a European mobile payment system.

Activists from the Chaos Computer Club and the organisers of Denmark’s Digital Stemme initiative acknowledge that detoxing from GAFAM is hard. “Individuals are embedded in an American digital ecosystem where they can connect with family, colleagues and friends. If they leave it, they become the social black sheep,” Imbert-Vier said.

Many non-American alternatives also struggle to attract users.

“It's no fun being on the most perfect social network if nobody else is there,” Christensen said.

That is why most advocates of digital autonomy stress the urgency of acting now – while frustration with the US remains strong enough in Europe to trigger a sizeable shift toward European digital options.

But there is reason to be circumspect.

“There was similar interest in [digital sovereignty] issues in 2013 after Edward Snowden’s revelations about NSA surveillance. But it didn't last long,” Selzer said.

Human Rights Watch Executive Director Philippe Bolopion said global democracy was now back at 1985 levels, according to some metrics. He said Russia, China and the United States were all less free than 20 years ago, and 72% of the world's population was now living under autocracy.

"It's actually incredible to see how the Trump administration has really undermined all the pillars of U.S. democracy, all the checks and balances on power," Bolopion told reporters.

"We see a sort of very hostile environment in the U.S. and a very rapid decline of ... the quality of democracy in this country."

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Bolopion also said in the report that the Trump administration had leaned on racist tropes and "embraced policies and rhetoric that align with white nationalist ideology."

He criticized what he said was degrading treatment of immigrants and asylum seekers, the killing of two people in Minneapolis, and the deportation of hundreds of migrants to a mega-prison in El Salvador known for its harsh conditions, among other elements of Trump's immigration crackdown.

Masked immigration officers, often in tactical military-style gear, have become a common sight across the U.S. and protests have erupted in several cities.

Trump's hardline immigration agenda was a potent campaign issue that helped him win a return to the White House in 2024. Trump wanted Americans to feel safe in their communities and had pledged to remove "dangerous criminal aliens" from the U.S., a spokesperson said in defense of his immigration policy last week.

Human Rights Watch also cited strikes on suspected drug boats and criticized Trump for turning Venezuela over to President Nicolas Maduro's deputy after his capture , which Bolopion told reporters in a news conference was "risking a new human rights disaster."

Trump has said he should get the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to broker peace in a number of global conflicts. Human Rights Watch was skeptical, saying he had downplayed serious human rights violations by Russia in Ukraine, done nothing to stop atrocities in Sudan, and failed to pressure the Israeli government to stop crimes in Gaza, where Human Rights Watch has accused Israel of committing genocide and extermination . Israel has repeatedly rejected any accusation of genocide.

Elsewhere, the report said Chinese authorities systematically denied freedom of expression, freedom of religion and other rights, while Russia had further intensified a crackdown on dissent and civil society.

But in 2026 "the fight for the future of human rights will play out most sharply in the U.S., with consequences for the rest of the world," Bolopion said.

"Many Western allies have chosen to stay silent on U.S. actions because they fear increasing tariffs and weakening alliances. What we urgently need now is a strong global alliance of countries promoting human rights and the rules-based world order."</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 18:08:43 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/V5YO7FTUSZIULIWDDAVGWLJDPA.jpg?auth=68202fd72153f2efdbe7aa2c9cd3050ae2ab1cac3884af76b665037453280993&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UNICEF calls for criminalization of AI content depicting child sex abuse</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/technology/unicef-calls-criminalization-ai-content-depicting-child-sex-abuse-2026-02-04/</link><description>Feb 4 (Reuters) - The United Nations children's agency UNICEF on Wednesday called for countries to criminalize the creation of AI-generated child sexual abuse content, saying it was alarmed by reports of an increase in the number of artificial intelligence images sexualizing children.

The agency also urged developers to implement safety-by-design approaches and guardrails to prevent misuse of AI models. It said digital companies should prevent the circulation of these images by strengthening content moderation with investment in detection technologies.

"The harm from deepfake abuse is real and urgent. Children cannot wait for the law to catch up," UNICEF said in a statement. Deepfakes are AI-generated images, videos, and audio that convincingly impersonate real people.

UNICEF also raised concerns about what it called the "nudification" of children, using AI to strip or alter clothing in photos to create fabricated nude or sexualized images.

At least 1.2 million children across 11 countries disclosed having their images manipulated into sexually explicit deepfakes in the past year, according to UNICEF.

Britain said on Saturday it plans to make it illegal to use AI tools to create child sexual abuse images, making it the first country to do so.

Concerns have increased in recent years about the use of AI to generate child abuse content, particularly chatbots such as xAI's Grok - owned by Elon Musk - which has come under scrutiny for producing sexualized images of women and minors.

A Reuters investigation found the chatbot continued to produce these images even when users explicitly warned the subjects had not consented.

xAI said on January 14 it had restricted image editing for Grok AI users and blocked users, based on their location, from generating images of people in revealing clothing in "jurisdictions where it's illegal." It did not identify the countries. It had earlier limited the use of Grok's image generation and editing features only to paying subscribers.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 18:08:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HVZU6566JNOQZHCCVAU6XGT2LY.jpg?auth=ee9e2e0196b1788ed0a758314c1294e662f72905cf7c5b0f9c635437b3169db1&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US carries out strikes in Syria targeting Islamic States, military says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-carries-out-strikes-syria-targeting-islamic-states-military-says-2026-02-04/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Feb 4 (Reuters) - U.S. Central Command said on Wednesday that it carried out five strikes against multiple Islamic State targets in Syria, including a weapons storage facilities with 50 precision munitions.

The German citizen, identified only as Maja T., was arrested in Berlin in December 2023 on a European arrest warrant and was subsequently transferred to Hungary.

The presiding judge found Maja T. guilty of "attempting bodily harm... as part of an organised crime group".

According to the indictment, Maja T. was part of a far-left group that planned to take up an "ideological fight with violent attacks against sympathisers of the extremist right" with the aim of assaulting people with "various instruments capable of causing death."

The case drew international attention when Germany's Constitutional Court ruled in February 2025 that it had been unlawful to extradite Maja T., who identifies as non-binary, to Hungary, upholding her argument that the decision violated the European Union's Charter on Fundamental Rights.

Under Prime Minister Viktor Orban, Hungary has introduced anti-LGBTQ+ policies, including laws that Brussels says discriminate against people on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity.

Authorities in Hungary - an EU member but which has clashed with Brussels on a range of issues including LGBT rights and the rule of law - have given assurances that non-binary people are not subject to discrimination or violence in prisons there.

Maja T., who was one of several individuals to go on trial over the attacks, told the court that the accusations against her were political.

The German justice ministry said it had no comment.

The first accused in the trial was Italian teacher Ilaria Salis, who was released from house arrest in June 2024 after she was elected a member of the European Parliament. Prosecutors were seeking an 11-year sentence for her. Salis and her family said she was innocent.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 18:09:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/E4PQK34NDVK3BCNPRAY6BCFKSQ.jpg?auth=0243a957f56bc63180319b01230d87a3e3a802b4ee51830fffc6cad86b5a0ef2&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Germany's Merz heads to Saudi, Gulf in quest for new partners</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/germanys-merz-heads-saudi-gulf-quest-new-partners-2026-02-04/</link><description>BERLIN, Feb 4 (Reuters) - German Chancellor Friedrich Merz began a tour of Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates on Wednesday aiming to forge energy and arms partnerships as Europe's biggest and richest economy sought to reduce dependence on the U.S. and China.

"We need such partnerships more than ever at a time when politics is increasingly being determined by major powers," Merz said at the start of his three-day trip, adding the aim of such alliances was to preserve freedom, security and prosperity.

"Our partners may not all share the same values and interests, but they share the view that we need a world order in which we trust agreements and treat each other with respect," he added.

The tour, which follows visits to Brazil and South Africa last year and India last month, is part of a broader German initiative to diversify global alliances.

"In such a network of partnerships, we reduce unilateral dependencies, mitigate risks and create new opportunities together for our mutual benefit," said Merz.

In the Gulf, Merz said he wanted deeper cooperation in the energy and armaments sectors, adding Berlin was adopting a less restrictive approach on arms exports. Germany's economy minister prepared the ground last week.

Relations with Saudi Arabia deteriorated after the killing of Saudi Arabian journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018. Merz said while some improvements in human rights had taken place, there was more to be done and he would discuss this.

The Gulf states, with large sovereign wealth funds, already play a role in Germany's economy. Qatar is one of the largest foreign investors in Germany, holding stakes in companies such as Volkswagen, utility RWE and shipping group Hapag-Lloyd.

Merz said he would address broader regional issues, calling for greater peace, stability and cooperation, including normalization with Israel.

"One day, Israel should also be a welcome part of this order, not a rejected foreign body," said Merz, addressing the balance Gulf states maintain on Israel and Palestinians.

On Iran, Merz said he had three demands: that Tehran stops violence against its own people, halts its military nuclear programme and ends destabilizing activities in the region.

Germany remains one of Israel's closest allies in Europe, while Gulf states have navigated differing approaches to Iran, particularly since the Gaza war.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 18:09:03 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/PFSAWLW4TNL7JFYHX4XLB2SUVY.jpg?auth=49d94fb7d9a517fb9fd6cb967bc5e4e1515bf17592595980c819186d773a2524&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Serbia seeks EU gas deals as it reduces Russian supplies, says President Vucic</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/serbia-seeks-eu-gas-deals-it-reduces-russian-supplies-says-president-vucic-2026-02-04/</link><description>BELGRADE, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Serbia is diversifying its energy supply away from Russia and is already in talks to buy natural gas via a European Union purchasing mechanism, President Aleksandar Vucic said on Wednesday in an interview with Reuters.

The Balkan country, which wants to join the EU, is one of Europe's few remaining buyers of Russian natural gas - over 80% of its supplies come from there.

But the EU has pressured Serbia to find alternatives as it tries to reduce cash flows to President Vladimir Putin's Ukraine war chest.

Serbia failed to secure a new long-term contract with Russia's Gazprom last year, and a short-term deal reached in December expires on March 31.

Vucic said he understood EU policy towards Russian energy, saying "we have to adjust our energy policies to certain demands and requests."

"Still we will have big quantities of Russian gas, but we are taking more and more from Europeans," Vucic added in an interview at the presidency in Belgrade, flanked by an EU flag.

He said Serbia was aiming to secure 500 million cubic metres of gas annually, about a fifth of its needs, under the EU's communal gas-buying initiative , which it joined last year.

Serbia is already purchasing gas from Azerbaijan, via Bulgaria, and construction of a gas pipeline to North Macedonia that would give Serbia access to liquefied natural gas from Greece should start this year, he said.

An oil pipeline linking Serbia and neighboring Romania is expected to be completed in 2027.

"This is a big diversification," Vucic said.

Serbia fosters historic cultural and religious ties with Russia.

Moscow supports Belgrade in its opposition to the independence of Kosovo, a former, predominantly Albanian, southern province. Vucic has sought to balance relations with the Kremlin and Serbia's EU membership bid.

That line has become increasingly difficult to walk since Russia's 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Serbia's Russian-owned NIS oil company was placed under U.S. sanctions, forcing its expected sale to Hungary's MOL.

Meanwhile, Vucic said he is committed to joining the EU. He said the economy had improved, as had living standards and debt levels.

"No doubt, since I am president, Serbia will be on its EU path," he said.

The EU has long demanded that Serbia must boost the rule of law, media freedoms and root out organised crime and corruption if it wants to join.

Critics say recent reforms to the judicial system would reduce its independence, complicating Serbia's route to EU.

Vucic said authorities are ready to "scrutinise" the disputed set of judicial laws with European bodies.

Vucic, a populist, suffered a political blow when a railway station roof collapsed in Novi Sad in 2024, killing 16 people. The disaster triggered countrywide protests , calling for an end to corruption and early elections.

Vucic acknowledged that graft is a problem in Serbia and is "dissatisfied" with efforts to eradicate it. "It is about corruption in our state institutions... including politicians."

Still he dismissed the demonstrations as a plot by international security agencies - including those from neighbouring Croatia, Albania and Kosovo - to overthrow the government, without providing proof.

Officials from those countries have denied such accusations.

Vucic's second and final term expires in 2027. Amid street protests, he has said he will call snap elections this year.

He said he was not sure what he would do next, but did not rule out returning to party politics or seeking to become prime minister.

"I would like to be less engaged in politics or not at all, but taking care of my legacy might require some sort of engagement, we'll see."</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 18:09:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/DUM525DA5VNNLAOEBVBUDXTH24.jpg?auth=fcd1480da39cc855d1cc6d54943c51cf4de520c44974ecf6df95f95df4bddcd2&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Pope Leo likely to visit Peru in November, bishop says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/pope-leo-likely-visit-peru-november-bishop-says-2026-02-04/</link><description>LIMA, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Pope Leo will likely travel to Peru in November, the president of the nation's Catholic bishops said on Wednesday, for a visit expected to draw large crowds to see a pontiff who was a missionary in the South American country for decades.

Bishop Carlos Garcia Camader told a press conference in Lima it was "very probable" that Leo would visit in November or the first week of December. Garcia, who recently visited with the pope at the Vatican, put the chances of a visit at 80%.

Leo, the former U.S. Cardinal Robert Prevost, spent decades in Peru . He was first ordained a bishop for the diocese of Chiclayo, in the country's northwest, and became a Peruvian citizen in 2015.

Garcia joked at the press conference that while the likelihood of a visit to Peru was 80%, the likelihood that Leo would visit Chiclayo during any visit to the country was 100%.

Garcia and most of the Peruvian bishops were in Rome last week for a series of meetings with Vatican officials, undertaken by Catholic bishops normally every five years.

Durov said in a message to Telegram users that the proposal to block children would force social media platforms to gather the data of all users and measures to curb hate speech would prompt platforms to strip content to avoid prosecution.

The proposal by Sanchez to criminalise the use of algorithms deemed as amplifying harmful content would allow governments to control what users see, said Durov, who is based in Dubai.

"These aren't safeguards; they're steps toward total control. We've seen this playbook before - governments weaponizing "safety" to censor critics," he wrote on Telegram.

Spain's government defended its plans in a lengthy statement saying Durov's criticism sent to all Spanish users of Telegram was unprecedented and unwarranted and underlined the urgent need to regulate social media and messaging apps to protect its citizens from "propaganda".

Sanchez said in Dubai on Tuesday that his plans were in line with a "Coalition of the Digitally Willing" of likeminded European countries wanting to clean up social media.

The politician, one of a dwindling band of leftist leaders in Europe, has been criticising technology platforms since early last year when he proposed ending anonymity on social media and linking users' data to a common EU identity wallet .

His wider campaign against disinformation began earlier and was instigated by what he described as a right-wing smear campaign against his family over the investigation of his wife Begona Gomez for influence peddling. She denies the charges and the case is ongoing .

Spain joins countries such as Britain, Greece and France in considering tougher stances on social media, after Australia in December became the first nation to prohibit access to such platforms for children younger than 16.

Russian-born Durov was detained in Paris in August 2024 over alleged criminal activities on the messaging app. In March last year he denied any wrongdoing .

His message about the Spanish plans was forwarded from an account in his name to a channel that normally advises Telegram users about security and account issues.

Musk, the owner of X, has also condemned Sanchez's proposed measures, describing him in an X post on Monday as "a tyrant and a traitor to the people of Spain".

The 2010 New START treaty , which limits the size of the Russian and U.S. strategic nuclear arsenals, expires at the end of Wednesday, and the two sides have not held any talks on a replacement.

Security experts have voiced concern that the treaty's lapse could pave the way for a new arms race in which China would also be a major player.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 19:23:54 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4MMOBNIVVRKJHBMRLCM4YX7NVQ.jpg?auth=a84e728f4b20fafbff0e340c3a05038343ef6eec3447653e5f564b573bd264b0&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>French president's top diplomat held talks in Moscow on Tuesday, sources say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/french-presidents-top-diplomat-held-talks-moscow-tuesday-sources-say-2026-02-04/</link><description>PARIS, Feb 4 (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron's most senior diplomat was in Moscow on Tuesday to hold talks with Russian officials, said a source who was aware of the meeting and two diplomatic sources.

The first source said Emmanuel Bonne, who has been at the helm of Macron's diplomatic cell since 2019, had met officials at the Kremlin.

He did not give more details beyond saying the aim was to have dialogue on key issues, most importantly Ukraine .

The French presidency neither confirmed nor denied the talks, but said: "As the President said during his doorstep yesterday, discussions exist at a technical level in full transparency and in consultation with President Zelenskiy and with the main European colleagues."

The two diplomatic sources said allies had been made aware of the initiative and that Bonne had held talks with Yuri Ushakov, a senior aide to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Macron said in December that Europeans would have to re-engage in direct talks with Putin if the latest U.S.-led efforts to broker a Ukraine peace deal founder.

European leaders wary of Putin's military ambitions have smarted at their exclusion from peace talks led by U.S. President Donald Trump's administration, compelled instead to shore up Ukraine's negotiating positions from the sidelines.

Macron told reporters on Tuesday that efforts were under way to restart dialogue with Putin.

"It's being prepared and so there are discussions that are being held at a technical level," he said, adding that it was being done in consultation with Ukraine.

"It's important that the Europeans restore their own channels of discussion."</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 19:24:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/FCEZYKMY7RIG5MNMMXWDSGP2GI.jpg?auth=cbe1d50512c1e65d1d4a7cebe680d6286ab938b2fff8863ba59c9d778d082668&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Tunisian police arrest member of parliament who mocked president, two lawmakers say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/tunisian-police-arrest-member-parliament-who-mocked-president-two-lawmakers-say-2026-02-04/</link><description>TUNIS, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Tunisian police arrested lawmaker Ahmed Saidani on Wednesday, two of his colleagues said, in what appeared to be part of an escalating crackdown on critics of President Kais Saied.

Negotiations at the COP30 event in Brazil in November on how to address climate change were dealt a geopolitical blow earlier in the year when U.S. President Donald Trump pulled the world's biggest economy out of the talks.

The summit ended with a deal to triple finance for poorer nations to adapt to climate change, but no new global commitments to reduce fossil fuel use or cut planet-heating emissions faster - terms that had prompted EU countries to consider walking out in the final hours of the talks.

The 27-country EU is now assessing how to strengthen its strategy for future negotiations by using its trade, finance and development leverage in climate talks, the document showed. EU climate ministers will discuss the ideas at a meeting in Cyprus on Friday.

"The EU encountered increasing difficulty in lining up international support for translating its high level of ambition into concrete negotiation outcomes," the document said, referring to the EU's attempts to secure a stronger deal on cutting emissions.

It said changing geopolitical dynamics had contributed to "a feeling that (the EU) was largely isolated in the final phases of negotiations" at COP30.

The EU, alongside climate-vulnerable island states and some Latin American countries, had pushed to address fossil fuels in the COP30 deal - a proposal blocked by countries including top oil exporter Saudi Arabia.

But the EU had also faced criticism from poorer nations for resisting an increase in climate funding until late in the negotiations.

Andre Correa do Lago, Brazil's president of COP30, said countries' assessments of how successful the summit had been reflected different priorities in how they tackle climate change.

"The word 'ambition' doesn't belong to a vocabulary that only exists in the EU. When you say 'ambition' in the EU, it's mitigation. When you say 'ambition' in India, it's finance. When you say ambition in other countries, it's technology," he told Reuters.

The EU paper suggested a failure to leverage its trade and development tools had "limited the EU's ability to reinforce its positions and to shape incentives in the negotiating rooms and beyond".

A spokesperson for Cyprus, which holds the EU's rotating presidency and drafted the document, confirmed the discussions on the bloc's role in international climate negotiations.

"Our aim is to keep the momentum and continue reflecting on this important matter, with a view to strengthening the effectiveness of the COP31 negotiations," the spokesperson said.

Many of the EU's trade deals include incentives on climate and low-carbon energy. An EU-India trade deal last month included 500 million euros ($590.90 million) in support to help India reduce emissions.

"We're in a new era which is more transactional," one EU diplomat said, adding that some governments also wanted a clearer EU line on when to reject future COP deals that it deems too weak.

The EU is struggling to maintain support for ambitious climate action among its own member countries, and last year agreed a new climate target just days before COP30 began, owing to disagreements between governments over how ambitious it should be.

Talks between the countries amid fears of a military confrontation have been planned for Friday, with Iran pushing to restrict the negotiations to discussion of its long-running nuclear dispute with Western countries.

"If the Iranians want to meet, we're ready," Rubio told reporters.

"They've expressed an interest in meeting and talking. If they change their mind, we're fine with that too," he said.

"In order for talks to actually lead to something meaningful, they will have to include certain things, and that includes the range of their ballistic missiles, that includes their sponsorship of terrorist organisations across the region, that includes their nuclear programme and that includes the treatment of their own people," Rubio said.

A senior Iranian official, however, said the talks would only be about Iran's nuclear programme, and that its missile programme was "off the table".

The meeting was originally planned for Turkey, but a Gulf official, another regional official and Iranian state-affiliated media said ​the talks were expected to take place in Oman.

But US ​officials decided to reject ​Iran's ‍request ​to change ​the location for talks planned for Friday, ‍US news site Axios ​reported on Wednesday, citing ‌two US officials.

Earlier Wednesday, Rubio said US envoy Steve Witkoff was prepared for the talks but that the location was "still being worked ​through" after Iran had previously agreed to a particular format.

Iran wanted the meeting to take place in Oman as a continuation of previous rounds of talks held in the Gulf Arab country on its nuclear programme and asked for a change of location from Turkey, the regional official said.

This was to avoid any expansion of the discussions to issues such as Tehran's ballistic missiles, the regional official said.

Plans for the talks, to be mediated by several countries, were still being finalised, the Gulf official said, adding that the discussions would start on the nuclear issue and then move to other topics on a step-by-step basis.

The diplomatic efforts come after US President Donald Trump 's threats of military action against Iran during its bloody crackdown on protesters last month and the deployment of more naval power to the Gulf.

After Israel and the United States bombed the Islamic Republic last summer, renewed friction has kindled fears among regional states of a major conflagration ‍that could rebound on them or cause long-term chaos in Iran.

Trump has continued to weigh the option of strikes on Iran, sources say. Oil prices have risen on the tension.

Trump has warned that "bad things" would probably happen if a deal could not be reached, ​ratcheting up pressure on the Islamic Republic in a standoff that has led to mutual threats of air strikes.

Iran’s leadership is increasingly worried a US strike could break its grip on power by driving an already enraged public back onto the streets, according to six current and former Iranian officials.

Trump, who stopped short of carrying out threats to intervene during last month's crackdown, has since demanded nuclear ‌concessions from Iran, sending a flotilla to its coast.

Iran also hopes for an agreement that could help lift Western sanctions over its nuclear programme that have ravaged its economy – a major driver of last month's unrest.

Ministers from several other countries in the region including Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates had been ‍expected to attend Friday's talks, but a regional source told Reuters that Tehran wanted only bilateral talks with the US.

Iranian sources told Reuters last week that Trump had demanded three conditions for the resumption of talks: zero enrichment of uranium in Iran, limits on Tehran's ballistic missile programme and an end to its support for regional proxies.

Iran has long said all three demands are unacceptable infringements of its sovereignty, but two Iranian officials told Reuters its clerical rulers saw the ballistic missile programme, rather than uranium enrichment, as the bigger obstacle.

An Iranian official said there should not be preconditions for talks and that Iran was ready to show flexibility on uranium enrichment, which it says is for peaceful, not military purposes.

Since the US strikes in June, Tehran has said its uranium enrichment work has stopped.

In June, the United States struck Iranian nuclear targets, joining in at the close of a 12-day Israeli bombing campaign and Iran struck back ‍at Israel with missiles and drones.

Iran said it replenished its missile stockpile after the war with Israel last year, warning it will unleash its missiles if its security is under threat.

Adding to tensions, on Tuesday the US military shot down an Iranian ‌drone that "aggressively" approached the Abraham Lincoln aircraft ​carrier in the Arabian Sea, the US military said.

In another incident in the Strait of Hormuz , the US Central Command said Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps forces had approached a US-flagged tanker at speed and threatened to board and seize it.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 19:26:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/9e084b5a-dd3e-11f0-8ca7-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2025-12-19T192110Z-409487497-RC2TJIAOB005-RTRMADP-3-SUDAN-POLITICS-USA-RUBIO-1.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Italy probes 80-year-old over alleged Sarajevo 'sniper tourism'</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/italy-probes-80-year-old-over-alleged-sarajevo-sniper-tourism-2026-02-04/</link><description>MILAN, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Milan prosecutors have placed an elderly Italian man under investigation as part of an investigation into alleged "sniper tourism" in Sarajevo in the 1990s, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said on Wednesday.

The sources said the man, the first individual to be identified in the inquiry that began last year, is an 80-year-old former truck driver who lives near the northern Italian town of Pordenone.

The prosecutors are investigating allegations that foreigners were paid to shoot at civilians during the siege of Sarajevo, Bosnia's capital, during the war in the former Yugoslav republic three decades ago.

The man, who was not named, faces charges of several counts of premeditated murder, aggravated by base motives, the sources said.

They did not say whether he is suspected of directly carrying out killings or of helping with transport and logistics for clients.

He remains at liberty and has been summoned by prosecutors for questioning on February 9, the sources added.

About 11,000 civilians were killed by shelling and sniper fire from Bosnian Serb army positions on hills around the besieged city during the 1992-95 war that followed Bosnia's declaration of independence from Yugoslavia.

Milan prosecutors opened their investigation after local journalist and novelist Ezio Gavazzeni filed a legal complaint over allegations that Italians and other foreigners had paid members of Bosnian Serb forces to let them take part in shooting excursions, which some referred to as "sniper tourism".

Gavazzeni said he was inspired to look into the allegations after watching the 2022 documentary "Sarajevo Safari" by Slovenian director Miran Zupanic.

Gavazzeni said wealthy foreigners paid large sums of money to take part. He said the Italians used to meet in the city of Trieste before travelling to Belgrade, where Bosnian Serb soldiers escorted them to hills overlooking Sarajevo.

The launch of the Italian investigation in November 2025 raised survivors' hopes that those responsible would be brought to justice.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 19:59:26 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ISH5DGE6VFMCTE2CNCSRXSKKTI.jpg?auth=49ba82a104972af7e895b71e53621bc4835853ce717a8a0c23975f4ae74ebacd&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuelan official Saab, formerly held in US, arrested again-Colombian media</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/venezuelan-official-saab-formerly-held-us-arrested-again-colombian-media-2026-02-04/</link><description>Feb 4 (Reuters) - Venezuelan official Alex Saab, a Colombian-Venezuelan former businessman once held in the U.S., was arrested in Venezuela on Wednesday, several Colombian media outlets said.

Saab, a close ally of President Nicolas Maduro, now in U.S. custody, was cinematically detained in Cape Verde in 2020 and held for more than three years in a bribery scheme, before he was granted clemency in exchange for the release of Americans held in Venezuela.

He returned with fanfare to Venezuela, where Maduro, detained in a U.S. raid on Caracas last month, lauded his loyalty to the country's socialist revolution and feted him as a national hero.

Maduro later made Saab industry minister , a position he held until last month, when he was removed by interim president Delcy Rodriguez.

Colombian television station Caracol reported Saab had been detained by the domestic intelligence service SEBIN. Caracol added that he could be extradited to the U.S., while Blu Radio said the operation was conducted in tandem with the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation.

Caracol Radio, a separate entity to the television station, said the arrest took place in the first hours of Wednesday morning and that businessman Raul Gorrin was also being held.

The Venezuelan communications ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment and it was not immediately possible to ascertain whether Saab or Gorrin have legal representation.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 19:59:52 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HUKKRHADMZMHVJOTILOXNONJW4.jpg?auth=4c0635b383c6f9d4ef53326cfcb690774d58cf408ca42243e91da9c4f0ec7ae5&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran-U.S. talks to take place in Oman on Friday, U.S. official confirms</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-us-talks-take-place-oman-friday-us-official-confirms-2026-02-04/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Feb 4 (Reuters) - U.S. talks with Iran will take place on Friday in Oman, a U.S. official confirmed on Wednesday, after Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said that nuclear talks with the U.S. are set to be held in the Omani capital Muscat at around 10 a.m. on Friday.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 21:34:03 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4TNLFG3EIBLJFN4HB2RXOJ3CWU.jpg?auth=fefc35bde85eb161e55c0ca8cdcbd2580fabc846c93fd3b9646856a09a8aec7d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>55,000 Ukrainian soldiers killed on battlefield, Zelenskiy tells French TV</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/55000-ukrainian-soldiers-killed-battlefield-zelenskiy-tells-french-tv-2026-02-04/</link><description>PARIS, Feb 4 (Reuters) - The number of Ukrainian soldiers killed on the battlefield as a result of the country's war with Russia is estimated at 55,000, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy told France 2 TV on Wednesday.

The New START agreement will end Thursday, formally releasing both Moscow and Washington from a raft of restrictions on their nuclear arsenals.

Campaigners have warned the treaty's demise could unleash a new arms race between the world's top nuclear powers, and encourage China to expand its arsenal.

"We assume that the parties to the New START treaty are no longer bound by any obligations or symmetrical declarations within the context of the treaty," Russia's foreign ministry said in a statement.

"The Russian Federation intends to act responsibly and prudently," it added, but warned it was ready to take "decisive" countermeasures if its national security was threatened.

Russian President Vladimir Putin offered in September to keep abiding by the warhead limits in the treaty for a year, but he received no formal response from Washington, the Kremlin says.

US President Donald Trump said at the time it sounded "like a good idea" but there were no subsequent negotiations.

A Kremlin aide said earlier that Moscow was "open" to dialogue on the issue.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio , asked about the end of New START, appeared in no hurry to extend it, saying only that Trump would address the issue later.

"The president's been clear in the past that in order to have true arms control in the 21st century, it's impossible to do something that doesn't include China, because of their vast and rapidly growing stockpile," Rubio said.

China's nuclear arsenal is growing quickly but is still well below the levels of Russia and the United States.

Trump in his first term also looked ready to let New START lapse as he insisted on including China.

Joe Biden agreed with Russia to extend New START for five years after he defeated Trump in the 2020 election, but tensions between the two countries later deteriorated over Moscow's offensive in Ukraine.

The treaty, signed in 2010 by then-Russian president Dmitry Medvedev and his US counterpart Barack Obama , limited each side's nuclear arsenal to 1,550 deployed strategic warheads, a reduction of nearly 30 percent from the previous limit set in 2002.

It also allowed each side to carry out on-site inspections of the other's nuclear arsenal, although these were suspended during the Covid-19 pandemic and have not resumed since.

Russia froze its participation in the agreement in 2023, but said it was continuing to voluntarily adhere to the warhead limits.

Pope Leo XIV said Wednesday that each side needed to do "everything possible" to avert a new arms race.

"I urge you not to abandon this instrument without seeking to ensure that it is followed up in a concrete and effective manner," the American-born pope said at his weekly general audience.

The International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons called on Russia and the United States to commit to honour the New START limits while a new agreement was negotiated.

"Without New START, there is a real danger the new arms race will accelerate between the US and Russia – more warheads, more delivery systems, more exercises – and other nuclear-armed states will feel pressure to keep up," said Melissa Parke, executive director of the Nobel Peace Prize-winning group.

The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists last month set its flagship "Doomsday Clock" closer than ever to midnight amid fears the agreement's expiry could start an arms race.

Russia and the United States together control more than 80 percent of the world's nuclear warheads but arms agreements have been withering away.

In 2019, the two countries withdrew from the landmark Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty, which limited the use of medium-range missiles.

In 2023, Putin signed a law revoking Russia's ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, although Moscow said it would stick to the moratorium on atomic testing.

Trump in October ordered the Pentagon to start nuclear weapons testing to equal China and Russia, although he has not followed through.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 21:35:19 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/1be1bb6e-01df-11f1-a484-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/8c79f0e75776ece9374c2b738f17ba3551e52cce.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Melania Trump says talks with Putin team continue to free Ukrainian kids</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/melania-trump-says-talks-with-putin-team-continue-free-ukrainian-kids-2026-02-04/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Feb 4 (Reuters) - U.S. first lady Melania Trump said on Wednesday she remains in contact with Russian President Vladimir Putin's team in an effort to secure the return of more Ukrainian children from Russia.

"I'm working on it, and we are in the process," she told reporters at the White House. "I hope we have success very soon."

She did not share details about talks between her representatives and Putin's team.

An East Wing spokesman said the lines of communication had continued after Melania Trump wrote a letter to Putin -- hand-delivered by her husband, President Donald Trump, last August -- about abducted Ukrainian children.

Fifteen children have been returned to Ukraine since the first lady started her advocacy, including seven children in December.

Ukraine has accused Russia of abducting at least 19,000 of its children and taking them to Russia or Russian-occupied territory without the consent of family or guardians since it invaded Ukraine in February 2022. Russia has repeatedly denied abducting Ukrainian children, saying it acted to keep them safe from the fighting.

On Wednesday, Russian and Ukrainian officials said they had " productive " talks in U.S.-led negotiations aimed at ending the four-year-old war, although Russia earlier this week attacked Ukraine with hundreds of drones and a record number of ballistic missiles.

Melania Trump, who has kept a low profile during her husband's second term, met at the White House on Wednesday with two freed Israeli American hostages, Keith and Aviva Siegel.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 22:28:58 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/S5WZV3L6PRP2HLZXQZPZWTTSOA.jpg?auth=36aef8e3bd86f2df82d0285acc8ee5786aa2a017f9f92e4bd6cb2e92b88ab4a0&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Nearly two dozen more prisoners freed in Venezuela, legal rights group says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/nearly-two-dozen-more-prisoners-freed-venezuela-legal-rights-group-says-2026-02-04/</link><description>Feb 4 (Reuters) - Twenty-two more prisoners have been released in Venezuela, the country's top legal rights group said on Wednesday, as liberations promised by the interim government slowly continue.

Legal rights organization Foro Penal said earlier in the day that 350 people who it classes as political prisoners had been freed since Jan. 8, when the government announced the effort. In the afternoon, Foro Penal said that it had confirmed 22 more releases, including of the journalist Rory Branker.

Government officials - who deny holding political prisoners and say those jailed have committed crimes - have given a much higher figure of releases, of nearly 900, but have not been clear about the timeline and appear to be including releases from previous years in their count. The government has never provided an official list of how many prisoners will be released nor who they are.

Families of prisoners say the releases have progressed too slowly, and Foro Penal says nearly 700 political prisoners remain jailed, an updated count including prisoners whose fearful families had not previously reported their detentions.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 22:55:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/XCQ6WAPVS5JWNB5ZSBJ2OCO3PU.jpg?auth=545e4164b5d1e43ad7e59c4b341cbef3a84c1cd70f593722d61b0d9653e96c1d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Washington Post announces major job cuts amid financial strain</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260204-washington-post-announces-major-job-cuts</link><description>The Washington Post , owned by billionaire Amazon founder Jeff Bezos , announced major job cuts on Wednesday, saying that “painful” restructuring was needed at the storied newspaper.

The Post, which gained legendary status when its reporting helped bring down President Richard Nixon in the Watergate scandal, will see “substantial” reductions in its newsroom, executive editor Matt Murray said.

The shrinking of the Post comes as major traditional media outlets in the United States face intense pressure from President Donald Trump , who routinely denigrates journalists as “fake news” and has launched multiple lawsuits over coverage of his presidency.

Bezos, one of the world’s richest people, has become close to Trump in the Republican’s second term. His Amazon behemoth controversially paid Trump’s wife, First Lady Melania Trump , a reported $40 million for a documentary this year, along with another $35 million for marketing.

Murray said the changes at the Post reflect the radically shifting economy for news media.

“This will help to secure our future … and provide us stability moving forward,” Murray said in a note to employees.

He cited changes to the news ecosystem, from individuals who “generate impact at low cost” to AI-generated content , as well as financial challenges that have already produced rounds of cost-cutting and buyouts at the Post.

“The company’s structure is too rooted in a different era, when we were a dominant, local print product,” he said. “And even as we produce much excellent work, we too often wrote from one perspective, for one slice of the audience.”

On Facebook, Marty Baron, the Post’s executive editor until 2021, said: “This ranks among the darkest days in the history of one of the world’s greatest news organisations.”

The Post did not disclose the number of job cuts, but The New York Times reported that approximately 300 of its 800 journalists were laid off.

Most of the paper’s journalists overseas were let go, including its entire Middle East roster and its Kyiv-based Ukraine correspondent.

Sports, graphics and local news departments were sharply scaled back, and the paper’s daily podcast, Post Reports , was suspended, local media reported.

Murray said the Post would now focus on politics, national security, technology, investigations and business, among other topics.

But a reporter who covered Amazon – currently valued at $2.6 trillion – was let go.

“These lay-offs are not inevitable. A newsroom cannot be hollowed out without consequences for its credibility, its reach and its future,” the labour union representing many Post journalists said in a statement.

It called on supporters of the paper, acquired by Bezos in 2013, to rally outside its Washington headquarters at noon on Thursday.

The White House ’s communications director, Steven Cheung, issued a typically scornful message.

“Just a reminder that printing fake news is not a profitable business model,” he posted on X.

Baron, the Post’s former executive editor, said owner Bezos had resisted “brutal pressure” from Trump in the past, but that the paper was battered by “ill-conceived decisions that came from the very top”.

Bezos reined in a liberal-leaning editorial page and blocked an endorsement of Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris days before the 2024 election – breaking the so-called firewall of editorial independence and seen as bowing to Trump.

In response, loyal readers “fled the Post. In truth, they were driven away,” Baron said.

The Wall Street Journal reported last month that 250,000 digital subscribers left the Post after it refrained from endorsing Harris, and that the paper lost around $100 million in 2024 as advertising and subscription revenues fell.

In May 2024, Post publisher Will Lewis told staff the paper lost $77 million over the preceding year and had lost half of its audience since 2020.

In stark contrast, The New York Times announced on Wednesday that it gained more than one million digital subscribers in 2025, bringing its total to nearly 13 million and confirming its dominant position in the US media market.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 22:55:56 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/bb50849a-0208-11f1-96f8-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/9e5617cb3f07c66c526f2fddd10ffd031133f4ba.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US charges suspect with terrorism in killing of two Israeli diplomats</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-charges-suspect-with-terrorism-killing-two-israeli-diplomats-2026-02-04/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Feb 4 (Reuters) - A man accused of killing two Israeli diplomats in Washington, D.C., last year was indicted on four additional counts of terrorism, in a new indictment that was unsealed on Wednesday.

The new indictment includes nine charges , including hate crimes, filed earlier. Several of the charges carry a maximum penalty of death or life imprisonment, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia said.

"These additional terrorism-related charges carry a mandatory life sentence under D.C. Code, while also reflecting the reality that this act was in fact an act of terror," U.S. Attorney Jeanine Ferris Pirro said in a statement.

Prosecutors accuse Elias Rodriguez, 31, of opening fire on people leaving an event for young professionals and diplomats hosted by the American Jewish Committee, an advocacy group that fights antisemitism and supports Israel.

He fired approximately 20 shots from a semi-automatic handgun, and called out "Free Palestine," according to prosecutors.

Lawyers for Rodriguez did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Yaron Lischinsky, 30, and Sarah Lynn Milgrim, 26, who both worked for Israel's Embassy in Washington, were killed.

Darren B. Cox, the FBI assistant director in charge of the Washington Field Office, said Rodriguez wrote and published a manifesto as an attempt to "morally justify his actions" and inspire others to commit political violence.

The shooting, which was condemned by leaders worldwide, came amid polarization, including student protests , in the United States over the war in Gaza .

The war was Israel's response to Hamas' October 2023 attack that left at least 1,665 Israelis and foreign nationals dead. More than 67,000 Palestinians were killed in Gaza between October 7, 2023 and October 7, 2025, according to Gaza health authorities.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 23:30:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ZVDAQD6M2ZJ25NKFFPL5TBMIN4.jpg?auth=33c5503be274e2c1c4263391aebb04666deed248cf32f84d83077b445fecded1&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Exclusive: US spy chief's office investigated voting machines in Puerto Rico</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/us-spy-chiefs-office-investigated-voting-machines-puerto-rico-2026-02-04/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Feb 4 (Reuters) - A team working for President Donald Trump's spy chief, Tulsi Gabbard, last spring led an investigation into Puerto Rico's voting machines, said Gabbard's office and three sources familiar with the previously unreported events.

The sources said the goal was to work with the FBI to investigate claims that Venezuela had hacked voting machines in Puerto Rico, but added the probe did not produce any clear evidence of Venezuelan interference in the U.S. territory's elections.

Gabbard's office, in a statement to Reuters, confirmed the May investigation but denied a link to Venezuela, saying its focus was on vulnerabilities in the island's electronic voting systems. Her team took an unspecified number of Puerto Rico's voting machines and additional copies of data from the machines as part of its investigation, a spokesperson for Gabbard's Office of the Director of National Intelligence said.

Her office said the taking of voting machines and data was "standard practice in forensics analysis."

Noting similar voting infrastructure elsewhere in the United States, it added: "ODNI found extremely concerning cyber security and operational deployment practices that pose a significant risk to U.S. elections."

Venezuela's government did not respond to a request for comment.

ODNI said that some security gaps in voting machines used in Puerto Rico stemmed from their use of vulnerable cellular technology and that software flaws existed that could give hackers access deep into vital electoral systems.

The Puerto Rico operation appeared to be part of an effort by Trump administration officials to pursue unproven allegations of voting fraud, the sources said. The preoccupation with voter fraud dates to Trump's reelection loss in 2020 and has not abated, said the sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss non-public operations.

Gabbard's appearance at an FBI raid of an election facility in Fulton County, Georgia , last week highlights her direct involvement in these issues. Last week's FBI raid in Georgia prompted alarm among some national security experts worried that Gabbard and the ODNI have overstepped their authority in investigating a sensitive domestic matter.

Gabbard was not physically present during the operation in Puerto Rico, her office said, even though her agency took on a coordinating role in the investigation.

U.S. officials involved in the Georgia investigation sought records related to the 2020 presidential election that Republican Trump has falsely claimed he lost against Democrat Joe Biden because of widespread fraud.

Domestic election security matters are typically handled by law enforcement agencies, say current and former U.S. officials, not the nation’s intelligence services.

Gabbard's office said it had the authority to carry out the investigation.

"Given ODNI's broad statutory authority to coordinate, integrate, and analyze intelligence related to election security and our known work on understanding vulnerabilities to foreign and other malign interference, ODNI conducted an examination of electronic voting systems used in Puerto Rico’s elections," the spokesperson said.

Reuters sources said it was the unproven allegation of Venezuelan involvement in voting irregularities in the U.S. territory's elections that had raised questions about possible foreign interference – something Gabbard had the legal authority to investigate.

The Caribbean island's residents are U.S. citizens but do not have voting representation in Congress and cannot vote in presidential general elections.

Challenging the denials of Gabbard's office about Venezuela's role, the three sources told Reuters that the FBI team involved in the Puerto Rico operation was probing the theory that Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro's government had hacked U.S. voting, an allegation that has strong support among some Trump supporters but for which no evidence has surfaced publicly.

The operation in Puerto Rico involved the FBI field office in southern Florida whose agents were coordinating with a group overseen by Gabbard investigating threats to election security, said two of the sources familiar with the operation.

This group included U.S. national security officials, law enforcement agents and government contractors, the sources said.

Gabbard's office said the United States Attorney in Puerto Rico, his team of homeland security investigations agents, and an FBI supervisory special agent "facilitated the voluntary turnover of electronic voting hardware and software to ODNI for analysis."

The U.S. military seized Maduro in Caracas in January, removing him from power, and brought him to New York to face drug trafficking charges, which he denies. Puerto Rico’s elections have had irregularities but no credible evidence has emerged to support allegations of Venezuelan attacks to influence voting there.

"We have had widely reported problems in election administration. But they are all attributable to incompetence and corruption, not foreign interference," said Pablo Jose Hernandez Rivera, a Democrat elected in 2024 to represent Puerto Rico in the U.S. House of Representatives in a non-voting capacity.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 23:53:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/67OWS5RF7RPTRCFITTGAFNXJA4.jpg?auth=27a88c54acfc2ea8d5f0e84a8348dc0589dcb48e03087ea1c1e7fd4693709fdd&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Australia charges teenager over alleged death threats to Israeli President Herzog</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/australia-charges-teenager-over-alleged-death-threats-israeli-president-herzog-2026-02-04/</link><description>SYDNEY, Feb 5 (Reuters) - An Australian teenager has been charged for allegedly making online death threats against Israeli President Isaac Herzog, ahead of his upcoming visit to Australia.

The 19-year-old man allegedly made the threats on a social media platform last month "towards a foreign head of state and internationally protected person", the Australian Federal Police said in a statement.

The offence carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in jail.

Police did not name the intended target of the alleged threats, but Australian media widely reported they were directed at Herzog. The Sydney Morning Herald newspaper also reported the teenager allegedly made threats against U.S. President Donald Trump.

He was refused police bail and will appear before a court in Sydney on Thursday. Police said a mobile phone and equipment for making or using drugs were seized during a search at a home in Sydney on Wednesday.

President Herzog is due to arrive in Australia on Sunday for a five-day visit, following an invitation by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese in the aftermath of the deadly shooting at Bondi Beach in December.

He is expected to meet survivors and the families of the victims of the shooting at Sydney's Bondi beach on December 14 at a Jewish Hanukkah celebration, which killed 15 people.

Herzog's visit has drawn opposition from pro-Palestine groups, with protests planned in major Australian cities.

Police in the state of New South Wales, home to Sydney, on Tuesday extended restrictions on protests in parts of the city ahead of Herzog's visit, citing "significant animosity" from some groups.

The Palestine Action Group has called on supporters to attend a rally in Sydney on Monday, urging people to march to the New South Wales state parliament in what is described as a "mass, peaceful gathering."

Deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles said Herzog would receive standard security arrangements given to all visiting foreign leaders.

"He will be a welcomed and honoured guest," Marles told ABC News on Thursday.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 23:55:08 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/GNB3YKRMKBLX3LRIGATJ2CJCBQ.jpg?auth=cf0e7e1d946450f3dfaa18f1906bac91094c5532b3025fd1b4c7ea3ed797afe6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Relations with US 'rock solid,' Taiwan president says after Trump-Xi call</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/relations-with-us-rock-solid-taiwan-president-says-after-trump-xi-call-2026-02-05/</link><description>TAIPEI, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Relations between Taiwan and the U.S. are "rock-solid" and cooperation programmes will continue and not change, Taiwan President Lai Ching-te said on Thursday after Chinese President Xi Jinping discussed the democratically governed island with President Donald Trump.

In the Wednesday call , Xi told Trump that the U.S. should "carefully" handle arms sales to the island that Beijing views as its own territory.

Speaking to reporters in central Taiwan, Lai said Taiwan and the U.S. have strong channels of communication.

"Taiwan–U.S. relations are rock-solid; all cooperation programmes will continue and will not change," Lai said, adding that the U.S. commitments to Taiwan also remain unchanged.

The fact that Taiwan is not part of the People's Republic of China also remains unchanged, he added.

The U.S., like most countries, has no formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan but is the island's most important international backer and is bound by law to provide it with the means to defend itself.

In December, the Trump administration announced $11.1 billion in arms sales to Taiwan , the largest ever U.S. weapons package for the island.

China refuses to speak to Lai and calls him a "separatist." Lai says only Taiwan's people can decide their future.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 02:06:08 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5N45RQ44KBO6TJOQDBAFPG3L6I.jpg?auth=11faa96a7a27dd953bbca4ffdcc93d5c1819a873f1b8cdfe8b481c405e3768f0&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China open to more practical cooperation, strategic coordination with Laos</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-open-more-practical-cooperation-strategic-coordination-with-laos-2026-02-05/</link><description>BEIJING, Feb 5 (Reuters) - China is willing to deepen practical cooperation and strengthen strategic coordination with Laos, President Xi Jinping said to Laos President Thongloun Sisoulith in a message, state news agency Xinhua reported on Thursday.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 02:06:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/GRQTU73SHZKJVH6XY5QW6KZZBQ.jpg?auth=39286963f62fbbc35cdab6fffc314002684faaa34b9800b115f1734c39dd5eff&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump backs MAGA prosecutor in race to fill Marjorie Taylor Greene's seat</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-backs-maga-prosecutor-race-fill-marjorie-taylor-greenes-seat-2026-02-05/</link><description>Feb 4 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Wednesday endorsed a conservative local prosecutor in a Georgia special election to replace Marjorie Taylor Greene, who resigned from the U.S. House of Representatives amid an acrimonious split with the president.

Trump said that he was throwing his support behind Clay Fuller, the district attorney for four counties in northwest Georgia, describing him as an "America First Patriot" and a proponent of the president's Make America Great Again movement.

"He is strongly supported by the most Highly Respected MAGA Warriors in Georgia," Trump said on his Truth Social platform.

The endorsement is expected to boost Fuller's chances in the March 10 election to replace Greene, who had been one of the most prominent voices in the MAGA movement before breaking with Trump late last year.

The split was driven primarily by Greene's aggressive push to have the Department of Justice release files related to the late Jeffrey Epstein , a convicted sex offender, as well as her criticism of Israel's war in Gaza and U.S. aid to the country.

Angered by her stances, Trump called her a "traitor" and withdrew his support for her. Greene's resignation from her seat representing Georgia's 14th district in the House of Representatives became effective in January.

In addition to Fuller, former Georgia state Senator Colton Moore - a staunchly conservative and pro-Trump Republican -- has been seen as a front-runner in a crowded race of 16 Republicans.

Democrat Shawn Harris, a cattle farmer and retired brigadier general who lost to Greene in 2024, is running again in the conservative district. Harris got 35.6% of the vote in 2024, compared to Greene's 64.4% of the vote.

In announcing his candidacy, Fuller had characterized himself as an "America First prosecutor" in alignment with Trump.

"This is the honor of a lifetime. I will not let you or Georgia’s 14th District down," Fuller said in a statement following Trump's endorsement on Wednesday.

If no candidate wins a majority, the top two vote-getters will face off in an April 7 runoff.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 02:06:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/XTRLNFXVZ5IBJMOAPNU5DQV3G4.jpg?auth=a24d2867452d0a06589bf6008d6bb0b3cb3028aacf128e5d2571ac6986123015&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UN chief calls New START expiration 'grave moment'</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/un-chief-calls-new-start-expiration-grave-moment-2026-02-05/</link><description>Feb 4 (Reuters) - United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Wednesday called the expiration of the New START Treaty a grave moment for international peace and security and urged Russia and the United States to negotiate a new nuclear arms control framework without delay.

New START , which was due to run out at midnight on Wednesday, capped the number of strategic nuclear warheads that the United States and Russia can deploy, and the deployment of land- and submarine-based missiles and bombers to deliver them.

"For the first time in more than half a century, we face a world without any binding limits on the strategic nuclear arsenals of the Russian Federation and the United States of America – the two States that possess the overwhelming majority of the global stockpile of nuclear weapons," Guterres said in a statement.

He said the dissolution of decades of achievement in arms control "could not come at a worse time – the risk of a nuclear weapon being used is the highest in decades."

At the same time, Guterres said there was now an opportunity "to reset and create an arms control regime fit for a rapidly evolving context" and welcomed the appreciation by the leaders of both Russia and the United States of the need to prevent a return to a world of unchecked nuclear proliferation.

"The world now looks to the Russian Federation and the United States to translate words into action," Guterres said.

"I urge both states to return to the negotiating table without delay and to agree upon a successor framework that restores verifiable limits, reduces risks, and strengthens our common security."</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 02:06:17 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HERYES2LL5MKRDSGJQEGCQ4X54.jpg?auth=5358756b10d86275495b97e93b124dd6cc5ab527a5823f854e221d2f9a454145&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukraine energy minister warns of more power cuts, possible Russian attacks</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/ukraine-energy-minister-warns-more-power-cuts-possible-russian-attacks-2026-02-04/</link><description>Feb 5 (Reuters) - Ukraine's energy minister warned households on Wednesday that planned blackouts could worsen in coming days and Russian forces could launch a new air attack to further disable power and heating networks.

Denys Shmyhal said well over 200 emergency crews were at work in the capital restoring heating to apartment buildings after a series of mass Russian attacks in January. Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said on Tuesday that more than 1,100 buildings remained without heating.

"The situation with energy remains very difficult. There is a risk that timetables for power cuts could get worse," Shmyhal wrote on Telegram after a daily meeting of senior officials devoted to energy issues.

"This is linked to the last strike and the fact that the shortfalls in generation in the power system are still significant. And the Russians are preparing for new attacks on the energy sector in the coming week."

Shmyhal said that buildings where restoring heating is likely to take some time were to receive assurances that they will have electricity for 18 hours a day.

Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko, also writing after the daily meeting, said 217 Russian attacks on Ukraine's energy system had been recorded since the beginning of the year. She provided a list of assistance, including hundreds of generators, supplied by European countries and the U.N. Children's Fund.

President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, speaking in his nightly video address, said the situation in Kyiv was worse than in other cities and resources were being redirected to the capital, along with additional help to Ukraine's second-largest city, Kharkiv.

Zelenskiy on Tuesday said Russia had deployed hundreds of drones and a record number of ballistic missiles in its latest mass attack on Ukraine focusing on energy sites on the eve of three-sided peace talks with Russia and the United States.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 02:06:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/FQ7OV3AFQFJKFIAUNBISE2TNOE.jpg?auth=ae41b9c934f0378af22a83485e994d2e94a7cd245b1aeef6bd1fc7b25c6e47ae&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Armed Islamist extremists kill 162 in western Nigeria villages</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/africa/20260205-armed-islamist-extremists-kill-162-in-western-nigeria-villages</link><description>Armed extremists killed at least 162 people during attacks on two villages in western Nigeria, a lawmaker said Wednesday, in one of the deadliest assaults in recent months.

The attacks targeted the villages of Woro and Nuku, in the state of Kwara, on Tuesday evening, Mohammed Omar Bio, a member of parliament representing the area, told The Associated Press.

He said the attacks were carried out by the Lakurawa, an armed group affiliated with the Islamic State group. No one has claimed responsibility for the attacks.

Ayodeji Emmanuel Babaomo, the Red Cross secretary in Kwara state, said the organisation has been unable to reach the communities where “scores of people were killed” because they are in a remote area – about eight hours from the state capital and near Nigeria ’s border with Benin .

Footage from the scene on local television show bodies lying in blood on the ground, some with their hands tied, as well as burning houses.

State governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq described the attack as a “cowardly expression of frustration by terrorist cells” in response to ongoing military operations against armed extremists in the state.

Nigeria is in the grip of a complex security crisis, with an insurgency by Islamic militants in the northeast alongside a surge in kidnappings for ransom by gunmen across the northwest and north-central regions over recent months.

Separately on Tuesday, unknown gunmen killed at least 13 people in the village of Doma, in the northwestern state of Katsina, police spokesman Abubakar Sadiq Aliyu said. No one has claimed responsibility for the attack.

Boko Haram extremists in northeastern Nigeria killed at least 36 people last week during separate attacks on a construction site and on an army base.

The armed groups in Nigeria include at least two affiliated with IS, an offshoot of the Boko Haram extremist group known as the Islamic State West Africa Province in the northeast, and the lesser-known Islamic State Sahel Province (ISSP), known locally as Lakurawa, and prominent in the northwest.

The Nigerian military has said in the past that the Lakurawa has roots in neighbouring Niger and that it became more active in Nigeria’s border communities following a 2023 military coup.

James Barnett, a researcher at the Washington-based Hudson Institute, said the attack in Kwara state was most likely perpetrated by the Jama’atu Ahlis Sunna Lidda’awati wal-Jihad, or JAS, a Boko Haram faction that has been responsible for other recent massacres in the area.

On Tuesday, the head of US Africa Command said the United States had sent a small team of military officers to Nigeria, the latest step in its response to the security crisis. In December, US forces launched air strikes on IS-affiliated militants in Nigeria.

The first source said Emmanuel Bonne, who has been at the helm of Macron’s diplomatic cell since 2019, met officials at the Kremlin. He did not give further details beyond saying the aim was to hold dialogue on key issues, most importantly Ukraine.

The French presidency neither confirmed nor denied the talks, but said: “As the President said during his doorstep yesterday, discussions exist at a technical level, in full transparency and in consultation with President Volodymyr Zelensky and with the main European colleagues.”

The two diplomatic sources said allies had been made aware of the initiative and that Bonne had held talks with Yuri Ushakov, a senior aide to Russian President Vladimir Putin .

Macron said in December that Europeans would have to re-engage in direct talks with Putin if the latest US-led efforts to broker a Ukraine peace deal were to founder.

European leaders, wary of Putin’s military ambitions, have smarted at their exclusion from peace talks led by US President Donald Trump ’s administration, compelled instead to shore up Ukraine’s negotiating position from the sidelines.

Macron told reporters on Tuesday that efforts were under way to restart dialogue with Putin.

“It’s being prepared, and so there are discussions that are being held at a technical level,” he said, adding that this was being done in consultation with Ukraine.

“It’s important that the Europeans restore their own channels of discussion.”</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 02:06:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/839f5018-df07-11f0-b559-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/2025-12-02T131140Z-1094515744-RC2D8IAZ5M9E-RTRMADP-3-UKRAINE-CRISIS-PUTIN-WITKOFF.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Australia says attempted bombing of national day protest was act of terror</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/australia-says-attempted-bombing-national-day-protest-was-act-terror-2026-02-05/</link><description>SYDNEY, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Australian authorities said on Thursday they were treating as a terrorism incident an attempt to bomb a rally protesting against the country's national day on January 26, the first such charge in the state of Western Australia.

They arrested a 31-year-old man on accusations of hurling a homemade bomb into a crowd of several thousand people in the city of Perth. No one was injured because the bomb did not explode.

Police and state leader Roger Cook said the man held white supremacist views and the attack was an attempt to target Aboriginal people, one of Australia's two main Indigenous groups.

"This charge ... alleges the attack on Aboriginal people and other peaceful protesters was motivated by hateful, racist ideology," Cook told a news conference. If proved, it carries a maximum sentence of life in prison.

Australia Day, which commemorates Britain's colonisation of the country in 1788, is a public holiday marked by picnics, barbecues and ceremonies for new citizens but it has also attracted criticism from some including in the Indigenous community, with "Invasion Day" protest rallies nationwide.

The names and faces of sexual abuse victims. Bank account and Social Security numbers in full view.

All of these things appeared in the mountain of documents released Friday by the US Justice Department as part of its effort to comply with a law requiring it to open its investigative files on Jeffrey Epstein .

That law was intended to preserve important privacy protections for Epstein's victims. Their names were supposed to have been blacked out in documents. Their faces and bodies were supposed to be obscured in photos.

Mistakes, though, have been rampant. A review by The Associated Press and other news organisations has found countless examples of sloppy, inconsistent or nonexistent redactions that have revealed sensitive private information.

A photo of one girl who was underage when she was hired to give sexualised massages to Epstein in Florida appeared in a chart of his alleged victims. Police reports with the names of several of his victims, including some who have never stepped forward to identify themselves publicly, were released with no redactions at all.

Despite the Justice Department’s efforts to fix the oversights, a selfie taken by a nude woman in a bathroom and another by a topless woman remained on the site, their faces both in full view, as of Wednesday evening.

Some accusers and their lawyers called this week for the Justice Department to take down the site and appoint an independent monitor to prevent further errors.

A judge scheduled a hearing for Wednesday in New York on the matter, then cancelled it after one of the lawyers for victims cited progress in resolving the issues. But that lawyer, Brittany Henderson, said they were still weighing “all potential avenues of recourse” to address the “permanent and irreparable” harm caused to some women.

“The failure here is not merely technical,” she said in a statement Wednesday. “It is a failure to safeguard human beings who were promised protection by our government . Until every document is properly redacted, that failure is ongoing.”

Annie Farmer, who said she was 16 when she was sexually assaulted by Epstein and his confidant, Ghislaine Maxwell , said that while her name has previously been public, other details she'd rather be kept private, including her date of birth and phone number, were wrongly revealed in the documents.

“At this point, I’m feeling really most of all angry about the way that this unfolded,” she told NBC News. “The fact that it’s been done in such a beyond careless way, where people have been endangered because of it, is really horrifying.”

The Justice Department has blamed technical or human errors on the problems and said it has taken down many of the problematic materials and is working to republish properly redacted versions.

The task of reviewing and blacking out millions of pages of records took place in a compressed time frame. President Donald Trump signed the law requiring the disclosure of the documents on November 19. That law gave the Justice Department just 30 days to release the files . It missed that deadline, in part because it said it needed more time to comply with privacy protections.

Hundreds of lawyers were pulled from their regular duties, including overseeing criminal cases, to try and complete the document review – to the point where at least one judge in New York complained that it was holding up other matters.

The database, which is posted on the Justice Department website, represents the largest release of files to date in the yearslong investigations into Epstein, who killed himself in a New York jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges.

Associated Press reporters analysing the documents have so far found multiple examples of names and other personal information of potential victims revealed.

They have also found many cases of overzealous redactions.

In one news clipping included in the file, the Justice Department apparently blacked out the name “Joseph” from a photo caption describing a Nativity scene at a California church. “A Nativity scene depicting Jesus, Mary and (REDACTED),” it said.

In an email released in the files, a dog’s name appeared to have been redacted: “I spent an hour walking (REDACTED) and then another hour bathing her blow drying her and brushing her. I hope she smells better!!” the email said.

The Justice Department has said staff tasked with preparing the files for release were instructed to limit redactions only to information related to victims and their families, though in many documents the names of many other people were blacked out, including lawyers and public figures.

The Justice Department has said it intended to black out any portion of a photo showing nudity, and any photos of women that could potentially show a victim.

In some photos reviewed by The AP, those redactions did obscure women's faces, but left plenty of their bare skin exposed in a way that would likely embarrass the women anyway. Photos showed identifiable women trying on outfits in clothing store dressing rooms or lounging in bathing suits.

One set of more than 100 images of a young woman were nearly all blacked out, save for the very last image, which revealed her entire face.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 04:30:47 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/28718252-fe69-11f0-ae35-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26031020763767.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia will continue to supply oil to Cuba, RIA cites ambassador</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/russia-will-continue-supply-oil-cuba-ria-cites-ambassador-2026-02-05/</link><description>MOSCOW, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Russia has repeatedly supplied oil to Cuba in recent years, and will continue to do so, Russia's ambassador to Cuba Viktor Coronelli said in an interview with state news agency RIA.

In addition to claiming sovereignty over democratically governed Taiwan, Beijing views the narrow, highly strategic strait as Chinese territorial waters and has responded aggressively on occasion to foreign navies sailing there.

"We are careful to send these naval assets into international waters without any provocation," Franck Paris, director of the French Office in Taipei, told reporters.

They aimed to send a clear message that international law prevails in the waters and should remain so, added Paris, whose country is chairing the Group of Seven nations for the coming year.

U.S. warships traverse the strait every few months, enraging Beijing, and some U.S. allies, such as France, Australia, Britain and Canada, have also made occasional transits.

Paris said it had now become routine for G7 statements to include language on maintaining the status quo across the strait and opposing use of force or coercion.

"This is a clear message that we repeat all the time, and I think there is a good choreography between a number of G7 partners to send this message," he added, pointing to past naval trips by Canada and the Netherlands, among others.

The last publicly confirmed sailing by a French navy ship in the strait, a conduit for trade running into billions of dollars a year, was in 2024.

The government of Taiwan, which rejects Beijing's sovereignty claims, welcomes such transits as support for freedom of navigation. China's military routinely operates in the waterway in what Taipei views as a pressure campaign.

France, like most countries, has no formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan, but is viewed by Taipei as an important partner and fellow democracy.

Three decades ago it sold Mirage fighter jets and frigates to Taiwan, although the United States is the island's most important international source of arms.

"These assets are still used by the Taiwanese defence," Paris said, adding that French companies helped maintain them by providing necessary equipment.

"This is the framework that we are committed to and this framework has not been questioned for years."</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 07:02:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/DPLO2PVLF5I4ZF5F6YTKZPDIW4.jpg?auth=ee3848c612867327b64dffe1f4c7cf0b2230dc201541c1815349def0d5694f89&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>South Africa's trade minister heads to China, seeking duty-free export access</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/south-africas-trade-minister-heads-china-seeking-duty-free-export-access-2026-02-05/</link><description>JOHANNESBURG, Feb 5 (Reuters) - South Africa's trade minister Parks Tau will travel to China from Thursday to Saturday to sign the China–Africa Economic Partnership Agreement, which will see South African exports gain duty-free access to the Chinese market, Tau's office said.

Ukraine, Russia and the United States will start a second day of talks in Abu Dhabi on Thursday, seeking to end Moscow's nearly four-year invasion.

The US-mediated talks are the latest chapter in the so far unsuccessful diplomatic effort to halt the war triggered by Russia's full-scale offensive in February 2022.

A first day of trilateral talks in the Emirati capital on Wednesday concluded with Kyiv describing the negotiations as "substantive and productive", though there was no apparent breakthrough.

Balochistan, Pakistan's largest and poorest province, was brought to a virtual standstill on Saturday when the separatist Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) stormed schools, banks, markets and security installations across the region in one of their largest operations ever.

The military said 22 security personnel and 36 civilians were killed in the attacks.

The BLA's coordinated strikes in over a dozen locations began after the military launched its "intelligence driven" Radd Al-Fitna 1 (countering chaos) operation, which the army said began on January 29.

"Through meticulous planning, actionable intelligence, and seamless joint execution Pakistan’s security forces and law enforcement agencies with support of intelligence agencies under Operation Radd-ul-Fitna-1 responded with precision and resolve," the military said in a statement, adding that 216 militants had been killed in all of Balochistan since the operation began.

Security officials and witnesses said the insurgents seized government buildings and police stations in several locations, including taking over the desert town of Nushki for three days before they were pushed out.

Helicopters and drones were deployed to Nushki to end the siege, security officials said.

Mineral-rich Balochistan borders Iran and Afghanistan and is home to Beijing's investment in the Gwadar deepwater port and other projects.

It has grappled with a decades-long insurgency led by ethnic Baloch separatists seeking greater autonomy and a larger share of its natural resources.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 07:55:19 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CIKFALOSTFJNPLSML53K4BBYDQ.jpg?auth=8a3f23a9734b9fa697c400e022851c6798fdb0d707879ae38086b556c3b1d99a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukraine, Russia start second day of peace talks in Abu Dhabi</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/ukraine-russia-start-second-day-peace-talks-abu-dhabi-2026-02-05/</link><description>KYIV, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Ukraine and Russia on Thursday started a second day of U.S.-brokered talks in Abu Dhabi to discuss how to end their four-year-old war, top Ukrainian negotiator Rustem Umerov said.

Opinion polls consistently show the progressive People's Party is Thailand's most popular party. With its ambitious reform agenda and mastery of social media, it has huge appeal among young and urban Thais and will be a force to reckon with.

Its predecessor Move Forward won the 2023 election , taking all but one of the 33 seats in the capital Bangkok and making inroads into conservative strongholds. But it lacked parliamentary support to form a government, despite a pact with the second-placed Pheu Thai party .

Surveys indicate People's Party has lost none of its momentum. It was backed by 36% of respondents in a January 16-28 poll of 26,661 people by Suan Dusit University, with the former ruling party Pheu Thai on 22.1% and Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul's Bhumjaithai third on 18.9%.

A January 23-27 survey of 2,500 people by the National Institute for Development Administration showed 34.2% support for People's Party, with Bhumjaithai at 22.6% and Pheu Thai on 16.2%.

At the last election in 2023, People's Party's forerunner won 151 of the 500 seats at stake, Pheu Thai took 141 and Bhumjaithai won 71.

An outright majority for any of the three main parties is unlikely so an alliance is almost certain to be required to form a government.

But this could be tricky given bad blood and ideological differences between the parties , with bitter histories of betrayal and big fallouts within the past six months. Pacts with some of the dozens of smaller parties running could be decisive in breaking any deadlock and the party that wins most seats in the election may not prevail.

People's Party's advantage will be its strength at the ballot box but forming a coalition could be difficult. Bhumjaithai's politically savvy leader Anutin is an accomplished dealmaker willing to work with any party and his efforts would likely be backed by influential conservatives outside of politics.

The once-dominant Pheu Thai, controlled by the billionaire Shinawatra family , has a big war chest at its disposal, though it has been hit by defections to Bhumjaithai and declining popularity. Some analysts believe Pheu Thai is most likely to partner with Bhumjaithai to form a government, as it has previously.

People's Party looks to have the upper hand, but its liberal, anti-establishment agenda and long-term quest for institutional reform could stand in its way, even if it has moderated its stance of late.

Its popularity and policies that have included tackling monopolies and reforms to the military and judiciary could upend Thailand's decades-old status quo and threaten interests of business groups, powerful elites and royalist generals. It has very influential enemies.

Its first incarnation Future Forward was dissolved by a court in 2020 for a campaign finance violation, triggering street protests. It returned as Move Forward and won most votes in the 2023 election but was blocked from forming a government by army-appointed senators and dissolved by a court for campaigning to amend a law that protects the monarchy from criticism.

It regrouped again as People's Party, the English name commonly used by the Khana Ratsadon, which launched a 1932 revolution that ended Thailand's absolute monarchy.

People's Party is braced for more legal action, with the National Anti-Corruption Commission, which has a broad remit, now investigating 44 former Move Forward lawmakers for ethics breaches for attempting to change the royal insult law in 2021, a plan it has now dropped.

Among them are 15 People's Party members, including two of its three prime ministerial candidates, leader Natthaphong Ruengpanyawut and deputy leader Sirikanya Tansakun. If referred to the Supreme Court, they could face some kind of political ban.

Anutin, 59, is a political pragmatist with a party big enough to negotiate key ministerial posts and a place in numerous coalition governments.

A staunch royalist who has positioned himself strategically between rival political clans, Anutin's rise to the premiership last September demonstrated his ability to outfox opponents, moving quickly after a court sacked then Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra and lobbying parties to abandon her coalition and back him instead.

Anutin needs to drum up more support and expand on Bhumjaithai's 71 seats in the last election and leverage his ties in the country's establishment to help form an alliance capable of keeping People's Party at bay.

Parties contesting the election have submitted up to three prime ministerial candidates . Any party with at least 25 seats can nominate a candidate to be put to a parliamentary vote.

Support of more than half of the lower house's 500 members is required to become prime minister. If a candidate fails, the house must convene again and the process is repeated for other candidates until a premier is chosen, with no time limit on this process.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 07:57:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/J4UQCRRWZNP2RP3F2FDNU2HAGQ.jpg?auth=c895b1cf0f3e80004468cacf8aa01046868bd99e0ee01ea027813be0823faf5c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>French navy seizes more than 4 tonnes of cocaine from ship in South Pacific</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260205-french-navy-seizes-more-than-4-tonnes-of-cocaine-ship-south-pacific</link><description>France 's navy has seized 4.25 tonnes of cocaine from a ship in the south Pacific, officials said Wednesday.

The vessel, from Central America and believed bound for South Africa , was intercepted in French Polynesia , the country's high commission in the island territory said.

Its cargo was destroyed at sea, away from the Polynesian economic zone and marine protected area, officials said.

The prosecutor's office did not bring charges so as not to burden the local court with a case of drug trafficking not destined for French Polynesia itself.

The high commission said the vessel and its crew were freed under international law.

The navy seized almost five tonnes of cocaine, believed headed for Australia , from a fishing vessel near French Polynesia last month.

The United Nations has said in recent years that organised crime groups trafficking cocaine and methamphetamine have expanded their presence in the Pacific.

Large amounts of drugs are transported from North and South America for Australian and New Zealand markets, according to the UN.

French Polynesia lies along these maritime routes and is itself affected by significant methamphetamine use.

Its small population of 280,000, however, spares it from being a prime target for large-scale drug trafficking .</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 07:57:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/577e5c96-0265-11f1-8deb-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/000-967Z29E.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Empress's crown dropped by Louvre heist thieves to be fully restored</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260205-empress-crown-dropped-louvre-heist-thieves-fully-restored</link><description>The crown of French Empress Eugenie, which was abandoned by fleeing thieves who staged a brazen robbery at the Louvre last year, is nearly intact and will be fully restored, the museum said Wednesday.

The thieves who robbed the famed Paris museum last October made off with an estimated €88 million ($104 million) in jewels, but dropped the empress's diamond- and emerald-studded crown as they escaped, leaving it crushed and broken.

Investigators have yet to locate the other jewels , but recovered the dropped crown.

The Louvre said in a statement the piece had been "badly deformed", but remained "nearly intact" and would be restored to its original state, "without the need for reconstruction".

The museum said the crown was damaged when the thieves tried to remove it through a narrow hole they had sawed in the glass case where it was displayed.

The Louvre said the crown still had all its pieces, except for one of the eight golden eagles that adorned it.

It retains all 56 of its emeralds and all but 10 of its 1,354 diamonds, the museum said.

It said an expert committee led by the museum's president, Laurence des Cars, had been selected to supervise the restoration, which would be carried out by a qualified expert chosen in a competitive selection process.

Authorities have arrested all four alleged members of the heist crew, but have not found the mastermind – or the remaining jewels.

The thieves made off with eight other items of jewellery, including a diamond-studded tiara that belonged to Eugenie, wife of Napoleon III.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 07:57:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/88e41da4-025e-11f1-8273-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/000-96797CQ.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>French Navy intercepts boat with cocaine in Caribbean</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/french-navy-intercepts-boat-with-cocaine-caribbean-2026-02-05/</link><description>PARIS, Feb 5 (Reuters) - The French Navy has intercepted a boat that was carrying cocaine and handed it over to the Barbadian authorities, France's Armed Forces Minister said on Thursday, as the United States and other countries step up their fight against drug trafficking .

Catherine Vautrin wrote on X that around 678 kilogrammes of cocaine had been seized.

France, which has overseas territories in the Caribbean and Latin American regions, has been pushing a more aggressive policy in recent months on drug trafficking.

The French Monitoring Center for Drugs and Drug Addiction published a report in December saying that cocaine had overtaken cannabis as the leading illegal drug in France.

Gang-related drug crime is on the rise in France, and during a visit to Colombia, the world's largest cocaine producer, France's Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot launched a multi-pronged plan to fight an explosion of drug trafficking in Latin America, the Caribbean and increasingly Europe.

Hun Manet wrote to French President Emmanuel Macron asking for access to any historical and technical documents that France might have that relate to the border, and also welcomed France's expertise and advisory support, the foreign ministry said in a statement dated February 4.

The 817-km (508-mile) border was first mapped by France in 1907, when Cambodia was its colony, and was based on the natural watershed dividing the country from Thailand.

Disputed territories include several renowned historical sites, including the 11th century Hindu temple Preah Vihear, known to Thais as the Khao Phra Viharn.

France's Embassy in Cambodia and the Thai foreign ministry did not immediately respond to separate requests for comment.

Cambodia also welcomed France's "constructive engagement" in efforts to resolve the long-standing dispute, the prime minister said, according to the statement.

Hun Manet had said Macron indicated a willingness to help in previous meetings.

Fighting between the two southeast Asian neighbours broke out in July last year after weeks of tensions sparked by the death of a Cambodian soldier in a skirmish in late May.

After five days of clashes that killed 43 people, the conflict ended in a fragile ceasefire brokered in Malaysia after an intervention by U.S. President Donald Trump.

Hostilities resumed in December and lasted more than three weeks, with both sides accusing the other of violating the terms of the ceasefire.

As many as 101 people were killed and more than half a million displaced on both sides before a new truce was declared on December 27.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 08:44:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/NC5TWCLQJNKQVFWIQEUIBOGQW4.jpg?auth=0ac5e588986d9c862bb2793e897192ba49fc55d06dd8e382a7d15b9dee162fcb&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>For Serbia's Muslim students, protest brings sense of belonging</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/serbias-muslim-students-protest-brings-sense-belonging-2026-02-05/</link><description>By Marko Djurica

When Merima Avdic crossed a bridge over the Danube River to reach the city of Novi Sad in November, a Serbian flag in her hand, fireworks lit the sky and tens of thousands of protesting students cheered to welcome her and her peers.

She had walked more than 400 km (249 miles) from the University of Novi Pazar in the Muslim-majority Sandzak region of southwest Serbia, to join one of the largest and longest protests in the country in decades, triggered by the collapse of a railway station roof a year earlier.

Sixteen people were killed, leading to calls for the government to step down amid accusations of corruption and a lack of accountability that many blame for the disaster in Novi Sad.

Government officials have denied allegations of state graft that led to poor construction standards.

Joining the thousands in Novi Sad was a huge moment for Avdic, a student from Serbia’s small Bosniak Muslim minority, wearing her hijab.

On her arrival in Novi Sad she felt, finally, like she belonged in Serbia, she said.

“During the walk, I was stunned to see so many people who supported us and who came out to tell us that we are not alone,” Merima said. “A gentleman from Kosjeric gave us his flag because we didn’t have one. With it we marched into Novi Sad.”

Muslims account for 4 percent of Serbia’s population, and more than half live in the Sandzak region, where Avdic was born. They have lived there for generations, including through the decades of war, Serb nationalism and ethnic conflict that tore the former Yugoslavia apart.

Protests that have swept across Serbia over the last year have been led by students and have united Serbians of all ethnicities and age groups bound by a common drive for reform and an end to corruption in the Balkan country.

In few places has the new sense of unity in protest been more apparent than at the State University of Novi Pazar, where a community that once faced prejudice and state oppression now feels accepted in a broader movement for change.

Founded in 2007, the university, the first in the region, gave the Bosniak minority access to local state-funded higher education for the first time. But national acceptance of their community took longer.

Merima felt the national shift on the journey to Novi Sad. The students even spent a night in the medieval Orthodox monastery of Studenica where they were served a halal breakfast - something unimaginable 25 years ago.

Located between Bosnia, Montenegro and Serbia, the region’s Muslim population, which observes Islam less strictly with few women wearing hijabs, has long felt marginalised. In 1991, 99% of voters in Sandzak called for autonomy from Serbia in a non-binding referendum.

“In the past 30 years Novi Pazar was sidelined, people lived in fear, and never stood up,” Avdic said. “I am proud of myself and my colleagues and how we destroyed prejudice and showed that we want to live in this country.”

A photo at one protest in Kraljevo, in central Serbia, captured Nadija Delimedjac, a student from Novi Pazar wearing a hijab, with Sava Nikolic from Cuprija with a traditional Serbian hat. It went viral on social media and became a symbol of the changes made by the students.

A year-long blockade of Novi Pazar University by the students, which had stopped lectures taking place, ended little over a week ago, after the replacement of the university's rector and the reversal of a ban on 200 students, who had been expelled for their anti-government activism.

Their protest outlasted those at most other universities in Serbia, and saw students occupy the buildings even after authorities had cut the heating.

“I am stunned by the sacrifice they have made,” said Delimedjac’s father Muamer, referring to the march to Novi Sad. “Diversity is our fortune.”

Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022 after eight years of fighting in the east, triggering the deadliest war in Europe since World War Two and biggest confrontation between Moscow and the West since the depths of the Cold War.

Dmitriev, Putin's envoy on investment who has played a central role in U.S.-mediated negotiations on Ukraine, said that "warmongers" from Europe and Britain were "constantly trying to interfere with this process, constantly trying to meddle in it".

"And the more such attempts there are, the more we see that progress is definitely being made," he told reporters ahead of the talks. "There is positive movement forward."

He said active work was underway on restoring relations with the United States, including within the framework of a U.S.-Russia working group on economy.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent took part in the previous meeting of the working group in Miami on January 31 along with Dmitriev, U.S. President Donald Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 08:45:58 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7EGWMDHLNZND3OWQLNFYV6CUIU.jpg?auth=c582d8ca52eff1c8b1ced791396e3c3d183de49d1e06cb1186dedbcc41a1435f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Nigeria deploys troops after 170 killed in deadly Kwara village attack</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/nigeria-deploys-troops-after-170-killed-deadly-kwara-village-attack-2026-02-05/</link><description>ABUJA, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Nigeria's President Bola Tinubu has deployed an army battalion to Kaiama district in the central Kwara state after suspected jihadist fighters killed 170 people in an overnight attack, his office said on Thursday.

Tuesday's assault on Woro village was the deadliest this year in the state bordering Niger, a hotspot where Islamic State West Africa Province and other armed groups have stepped up village attacks and mass kidnappings.

The violence highlights fears that jihadist factions from the north are pushing south along the Niger-Kwara axis toward the Kainji forest, which security analysts warn could become their next stronghold.

Nigeria has come under scrutiny after U.S. President Donald Trump accused it last year of failing to protect Christians amid Islamist attacks and mass kidnappings. U.S. forces struck what they described as terrorist targets on December 25.

Abuja says it is working with Washington to improve security and denies any systematic persecution of Christians.

Tinubu said the new military unit would stem further attacks and protect remote communities. He condemned the attack as "cowardly and barbaric," saying the gunmen targeted villagers who had rejected attempts to impose extremist rule.

"It is commendable that community members, even though Muslims, refused to be conscripted into a belief that promotes violence over peace," Tinubu said in a statement.

Residents told Reuters the attackers were jihadists who had long preached in the village, urging locals to abandon the Nigerian state and adopt Sharia rule. When villagers refused, the militants opened fire.

About 38 houses were destroyed, said Saidu Baba Ahmed, a lawmaker representing the district at the state assembly.

In a separate attack in northern Katsina state on Tuesday, gunmen killed at least 21 people, moving from house to house to shoot their victims, residents and local police said.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 09:45:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/QY6R6HFL5BIALOE6JJ2DS3RCGE.jpg?auth=771576236ffa81ab34671e138c251268e363300fda284f9ac1195f52edff2363&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>One dead, a girl missing as Storm Leonardo batters Portugal and Spain</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/one-dead-girl-missing-storm-leonardo-batters-portugal-spain-2026-02-05/</link><description>MADRID, Feb 5 (Reuters) - One man died in Portugal after flood waters engulfed his car and in Spain, a girl was dragged away by a river after trying to rescue her dog, as Storm Leonardo lashed the Iberian peninsula with heavy rains and strong winds on Thursday.

Leonardo is the latest in a wave of half a dozen winter storms that have swept across Portugal and Spain this year, killing several people, ripping roofs off homes and flooding towns.

A man of around 70 died on Wednesday in Portugal's southern Alentejo region after his car was swept away on a flooded road near a dam, Portuguese authorities said.

In southern Spain's Malaga province, a girl went missing after she was dragged away by the Turvilla river while trying to rescue her dog.

"We spent the whole afternoon and night yesterday searching in the river from the place where the girl fell in until the very end of the river. We found the dog, but not her," Malaga fire chief Manuel Marmolejo said on Spanish television.

Storm Marta, the next weather front in the so-called "storm train", is expected to hit the region over the weekend, according to state weather agency Aemet.

Reconstruction costs in Portugal after last week's Storm Kristin alone could total over 4 billion euros ($4.7 billion), Economy Minister Manuel Castro Almeida said.

People waded waist-deep through Alcacer do Sal in southern Portugal after successive storms caused the river Sado to breach its banks. Restaurant terraces were completely underwater, with sandbags stacked in front of doors to protect homes and shops.

"I've never seen anything like this. It's surreal," said resident Maria Cadacha. "There are a lot of people here, very good people, many shopkeepers, homes with damage. I wouldn't want to be in their shoes."

Andalusia's emergency services had attended to more than a million incidents by midnight on Wednesday, they said on X.

Fourteen rivers and 10 dams were at "extreme" risk of overflowing, according to Antonio Sanz, head of the regional government's interior department.

Portugal's National Civil Protection said it had registered at least 70 incidents as of early Thursday.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 09:46:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7WXRYZLTZFON7GCBJZPW4L53MY.jpg?auth=f165d2efc550b893708a3bc88fdd140ecf08ee4ef27e8b24c18872ac0e71bce9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UN rights chief appeals for $400 million as crises mount and funding shrinks</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/un-rights-chief-appeals-400-million-crises-mount-funding-shrinks-2026-02-05/</link><description>GENEVA, Feb 5 (Reuters) - U.N. human rights chief Volker Turk appealed for $400 million on Thursday to address mounting human rights needs in countries such as Sudan and Myanmar, after donor funding cuts drastically reduced the work of his office and left it in "survival mode".

The U.N. office is appealing for $100 million less than last year, after a significant scale back of its work in some areas due to a fall in contributions from countries including the U.S. and Europe.

"We are currently in survival mode, delivering under strain," Turk told delegates in a speech in Geneva, urging countries to step up support.

In the last year, Turk's office raised alarm about human rights violations in Gaza , Sudan , the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ukraine , and Myanmar, among others.

However, due to slashes in funding, Turk's office undertook less than half the number of human rights monitoring missions compared to 2024, and reduced its presence in 17 countries, he said. Last year it received $90 million less in funding than it needed, which resulted in 300 job cuts , directly impacting the office's work, Turk said in December.

"We cannot afford a human rights system in crisis," he stated.

Turk listed examples of the impacts of cuts, noting the Myanmar programme was cut by more than 60% in the last year, limiting its ability to gather evidence.

A U.N. probe into possible war crimes in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is also struggling to become fully operational due to limited funding, while work to prevent gender-based violence and protect the rights of LGBTIQ+ people globally has been cut up to 75%, the office said.

"This means more hate speech and attacks, and fewer laws to stop them," Turk stated.

The U.N. human rights office is responsible for investigating rights violations. Its work contributes to U.N. Security Council deliberations and is widely used by international courts, according to the office.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 09:46:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/GTZYQU7WDRMYDFT4BFBRBCR5QQ.jpg?auth=256f72a2751208b37c309c8da80d7ee4bc80cf9e89f08a0e2e095d3dc8eea685&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>India to sign trade deal with United States in March, minister says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/india/india-us-trade-deal-be-signed-march-indian-trade-minister-says-2026-02-05/</link><description>NEW DELHI, Feb 5 (Reuters) - India and the United States expect to sign a long-awaited formal trade deal in March, after which New Delhi will reduce tariffs on U.S. goods, Trade Minister Piyush Goyal said on Thursday.

They will issue a joint statement in four or five days, prompting Washington to cut duties on Indian exports to 18% from 50%, he added, laying out the first official timeline for the adoption of the deal since it was unveiled on Monday.

President Donald Trump announced the surprise trade deal with India, which slashes U.S. tariffs on Indian goods in exchange for India putting a halt to Russian oil purchases and lowering trade barriers.

Goyal said India will import at least $500 billion worth of energy, aircraft and chips, among other purchases from the United States over the next five years.

Its orders from companies such as planemaker Boeing (BA.N) , opens new tab could amount to $70 billion to $80 billion, he added.

US Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio are expected at the event ​in the San Siro stadium.

There are concerns spectators could boo them or ‍the American team, with the presence of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Border Patrol agents a source of anger ​in Italy .

ICE's Homeland Security Investigations division will back up the US State ​Department's Diplomatic Security Service at the February 6-22 Milano Cortina Olympics.

ICE and Border Patrol agents have come under heavy criticism in the US over their enforcement of President Donald Trump 's immigration crackdown, and recent news ICE would be operating at the Games caused anger in Italy and led to protests.

"I hope that the opening ceremony is seen by everyone as an opportunity to be respectful of each other," ‍IOC President Kirsty Coventry told a press conference on Wednesday when asked if she had any concerns that American athletes ​or officials could be booed.

Italian politicians have strongly criticised the presence of ICE agents in the country, despite assurances that there is nothing unusual about the deployment, highlighting how ‌the image of the US has been tarnished in recent months.

"When we went to the (Olympic) village that is the best reminder of how we ‍should be," Coventry said. "You see athletes from every walk of life. No one is asking what country they come from or what religion. They are all just hanging out.

"It was a real opportunity to put into perspective how we could be and so, for me, I hope that the opening ceremony will do that and will be a reminder for everyone how we could be," said ‍Coventry, who took over at the IOC last year.

Vance will be joined by his wife, Usha, the second ‌lady of the ​United States, for the ceremony. The delegation will also include Rubio, US Ambassador to Italy Tilman Fertitta and several former Olympic champions.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 09:48:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/4cbaa124-0275-11f1-94e2-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26035652977979.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Kremlin dismisses Western claims that Epstein was Russian intelligence asset</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/kremlin-dismisses-western-claims-that-epstein-was-russian-intelligence-asset-2026-02-05/</link><description>MOSCOW, Feb 5 (Reuters) - The Kremlin said on Thursday it did not want to waste time answering questions about unproven suggestions in Western media and by Poland's premier that late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein may have been some sort of Russian intelligence asset.

Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said on Tuesday that Warsaw would launch an investigation into what it said were possible links between Epstein and Russia's intelligence services, and into any potential impact on Poland.

Tusk gave no evidence for his assertions, though Western media have questioned over recent days whether or not Epstein was a Russian agent collecting compromising material about the rich and powerful.

Asked by Reuters about Tusk's remarks and about Western media reports, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: "I would like to joke about such versions, but let's not waste our time."

Russian officials say that claims of a link between Epstein and Russian intelligence are clearly being thrust into the public sphere to distract from a scandal they say has laid bare the hypocrisy of powerful men across the U.S. and Europe.

In the files on Epstein released by the U.S. Department of Justice, Russia is mentioned thousands of times.

They also indicate that some of the young women Epstein was in contact with were from Russia, including a 26-year-old woman he sought to introduce to Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor , the younger brother of Britain's King Charles.

Various media organisations and bloggers have also speculated that Epstein was spying for Israel's Mossad foreign intelligence service or the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency.

No definitive proof has yet been published by a major news organisation that he was working for any intelligence service.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 10:41:17 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5GQFO6MDVVNR3CZELBL5URKB7Y.jpg?auth=ee8161e638b23d2772b403e16adc72499cdea7ba42aa34e96a60ed888b38612d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia expels German diplomat in tit-for-tat move</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/russia-expels-german-diplomat-tit-for-tat-move-2026-02-05/</link><description>MOSCOW, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Russia's foreign ministry said on Thursday that it had expelled a German diplomat in response to what it said was Berlin's unfounded expulsion of a Russian diplomat accused of espionage in January.

Current DA leader John Steenhuisen announced on Wednesday that he would not seek re-election at a party leadership contest in April, prompting speculation about who will take over.

Political analysts consider Hill-Lewis, who has served as mayor of Cape Town since 2021, a favourite for the post.

"After John Steenhuisen's announcement yesterday, I have been approached by many party members to stand for the position of Federal Leader," Hill-Lewis wrote in a statement posted on X.

Hill-Lewis said he would only confirm whether he would run for the DA leadership later this month, in line with internal party rules on when public campaigning can start.

Whatever his decision, he said he would seek a second term as Cape Town mayor in local government elections expected to happen late this year.

The coalition government was formed in June 2024 after the biggest party, the African National Congress, lost its parliamentary majority for the first time since the end of white minority rule in 1994.

The DA has 22% of seats in the lower house of parliament and the ANC 41%.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 10:42:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Large blaze breaks out at major German research centre</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/large-blaze-breaks-out-german-research-centre-2026-02-05/</link><description>BERLIN, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Firefighters are responding to a large blaze that broke out at a leading accelerator facility for research purposes in the south-western German city of Darmstadt on Thursday morning, according to police.

The fire has been brought under control but extinguishing work is expected to continue until the evening, police told Reuters.

A spokesperson added that the fire brigade was working to ascertain whether any hazardous substances had been released.

The fire brigade was not immediately available for comment.

According to the Hessenschau news outlet, the fire broke out in the area where the institute's particle accelerator is located.

There were no reported injuries, police said.

It is unclear how the fire began, a spokesperson added.

Pictures of the GSI Helmhotz Centre in Darmstadt showed huge, billowing clouds of smoke pouring out of the building.

The centre was not immediately reachable for comment.

It operates an accelerator facility for heavy ions, which are ions of especially heavy atoms such as gold or lead. Ions are atoms that have lost part of their shell of electrons.

They have a positive electrical charge and can be concentrated into beams and accelerated to extremely high velocities in electric and magnetic fields for experiments in various fields of research.

Nearby residents were warned to keep their doors and windows closed and to turn off their ventilation systems if possible.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 10:42:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US, Ukraine, Russia delegations agree to exchange 314 prisoners, Witkoff says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/us-ukraine-russia-delegations-agree-exchange-314-prisoners-witkoff-says-2026-02-05/</link><description>Feb 5 (Reuters) - Delegations from the United States, Ukraine and Russia have agreed to exchange 314 prisoners, U.S. President Donald Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff said in a post on X on Thursday.

Starmer said he had not known about the strength of the relationship between Mandelson and Epstein when he appointed him to the role in December, 2024.

Starmer has previously said he will release the vetting advice he was given when he selected Mandelson for the Washington role, but on Thursday he said he also needed to abide by a police request not to release anything that could prejudice an investigation.

"It had been publicly known for some time that Mandelson knew Epstein, but none of us knew the depth and the darkness of that relationship," he told reporters.

"I want to say this (to the victims): I am sorry.

Among Group of Seven countries, Canada recorded the highest rate of food inflation in December, according to government data. Food prices rose by 6.2% in December, double the rate in the U.S., and more than three times the rates in France and Germany.

Carney leads a minority government in Canada and relies on support from other parties to pass legislation and stay in power. While Canadians have consistently rated Carney as the best leader to deal with threats from U.S. President Donald Trump, voter sentiment could change quickly if concerns about American aggression lessen - and cost-of-living issues become more urgent, as they have in Britain, the U.S. and elsewhere.

A statement from the Bank of Canada this week noted that grocery prices jumped by 22% in the last three years, compared to 13% for other consumer prices. The central bank said last year's food inflation was mostly driven by imported foods, supply shortages caused by extreme weather and the significant depreciation of the Canadian dollar in 2024.

Carney announced last week that the country’s poorest 12 million people will get a tax credit for the next five years, “to make sure Canadians have the support they need now.” The government is also taking other measures, like setting aside C$500 million to help businesses deal with supply chain disruptions and allowing producers to write off greenhouse expenses.

But the measures do little to lower food prices in Canada, which is now the biggest driver of inflation, according to Jeremy Kronick, director of the Centre on Financial and Monetary Policy at the C.D. Howe Institute think tank in Toronto.

“This will mostly provide relief to people who are choosing between paying rent or buying food, but it is not going to bring food prices down,” said Michael von Massow, a professor at the University of Guelph who specializes in food economics.

John Fragos, press secretary for Canada's Finance Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne, said the new government initiatives were only a first step towards curbing food costs.

"We've bridged the food inflation gap as it exists now and we're taking aim at structural issues that will, over the medium and long term, bring down the price of groceries," said Fragos.

In late 2024, ex-Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also announced a two-month suspension of a sales tax on selected goods "to give Canadians more money in their pockets." It had mixed results, with some sectors like restaurants reporting increased sales while other businesses did not see an impact.

Academics point to entrenched issues including the dominance of just five companies in the grocery sector, a shorter growing season for produce in Canada, and a reliance on the U.S. that has resulted in higher prices via supply chain disruptions.

“There are some uniquely Canadian problems that make the cost of food here so very expensive,” said Michael Widener, who studies food systems at the University of Toronto.

"Labour and transportation costs are higher, and geographically, we are not close to many other markets,” he said, adding that the dependence on produce from the U.S. and Mexico made Canada extremely vulnerable.

Sylvain Charlebois, an expert in food distribution at Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia, said the government should focus on efforts like eliminating high transportation costs between provinces, addressing the high internal costs of production due to labour laws and the industrial carbon tax among other constraints, and increasing competition within the grocery sector. Canada is a major producer of canola, wheat, dairy and meat but is almost entirely dependent on imports of fresh produce during the winter.

Fresh fruit and vegetables routinely cost at least twice as much in Canada as they do in Britain and elsewhere in Europe; a two-pound bag of carrots in Canada costs $2.21, compared to $0.95 in Britain and $1.18 in Germany, according to online retailers.

Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre has long railed against the high cost of food for Canadians, but that has not translated into increased support. He still trails Carney by double digits in opinion polls -- and Carney's approval has risen since his widely praised Davos speech that openly called out the world's superpowers for using "economic integration as weapons," according to several polls.

A poll by Nanos on January 30 showed 54% of Canadians approved of Carney but also noted that 11.4% said inflation was their biggest concern, up from 9.3% a month earlier.

The Conservatives' co-deputy leader Melissa Lantsman told reporters on Monday that "no amount of tax rebates" will solve the problem of food inflation, adding that more than 2 million Canadians, or about 5% of the population, now rely on food banks, the highest-ever recorded number.

Shachi Kurl, president of the non-profit pollster Angus Reid, said despite food costs consistently ranking among Canadians’ top concerns, Trump's repeated threats to annex the country have translated into a bigger issue for voters.

“For the time being, food prices are not a voting issue,” Kurl said. “But if Canadians think that is something they can hold their leader accountable for, it may yet become one.”

Ashton Arsenault, who was an aide to a Conservative minister under previous leader Stephen Harper, said exorbitant food costs should present an opportunity for Conservatives to win more public support, but that a steady rise in prices over the years have largely left most Canadians resigned to the inflation.

“Even when things get really bad, we are still very Canadian and polite about it and don’t take to the streets to protest,” he said. “This is a very tough problem to fix and it will take political courage to do it.”</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 11:37:17 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7644VDDEZZKGVF55ARK7KTEM6M.jpg?auth=fde2be166f1df5f32881f30b8d1f4ae2f50662ea76494d936e9e8914f8c0b5d8&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Latvia launches human trafficking investigation after Epstein file release</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/latvia-launches-human-trafficking-investigation-after-epstein-file-release-2026-02-05/</link><description>VILNIUS, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Latvia has launched a criminal investigation into potential human trafficking after the release of documents related to late U.S. sex offender Jeffrey Epstein that included references to Latvian model agencies and models, police in the Baltic nation said on Thursday.

The investigation, which also involves Latvia's prosecutors and its Organised Crime Bureau, will centre on "the possible recruitment of Latvian nationals for sexual exploitation in the United States", police said in a statement.

It has asked potential victims to come forward.

Latvian President Edgars Rinkevics called for the investigation after the public broadcaster reported the Epstein documents included passport data and travel details for several Latvian women.

Eriks Neisans, head of the Natalie modelling agency mentioned in the documents, denied any knowledge of wrongdoing to the public broadcaster.

The U.S. Justice Department's recent release of millions of internal documents related to Epstein has revealed the late financier and sex offender's ties to many prominent people in politics, finance, academia and business - both before and after he pleaded guilty in 2008 to prostitution charges.

Latvia's neighbour Lithuania has launched its own investigation into human trafficking earlier this week.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 11:38:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/F743D6VTAZJNLFOWNHL44QVU74.jpg?auth=917037009e9494d251a239e33f15422eaa5f3e5fb018db3d1ace2f1bb7999f5c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran detains two vessels in the Gulf carrying smuggled fuel, state media says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-detains-two-vessels-gulf-carrying-smuggled-fuel-state-media-says-2026-02-05/</link><description>DUBAI, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Iran's revolutionary guards have detained two vessels in the Gulf carrying over 1 million liters of smuggled fuel, state media reported on Thursday, adding that the vessels' crews comprising 15 foreigners were referred to judicial authorities.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 11:38:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/J2OT46IMSVO2LHG3HHCW3T5WGM.jpg?auth=1bb42dc711388997fd45b2f1aac58ca16ebd233c55b315fd77faa5f6343d7aff&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Germany's Merz shares concerns over Iran escalation on Gulf trip</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/germanys-merz-shares-concerns-over-iran-escalation-gulf-trip-2026-02-05/</link><description>DOHA, Feb 5 (Reuters) - German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said on Thursday that concerns about a further escalation in the conflict with Iran have characterised his talks during a trip to the Gulf region.

The UK leader was set to release documents linked to the appointment of the former peer Mandelson, 72, one of numerous prominent figures embarrassed by revelations of ties to the late US financier.

"He's betrayed our country, he's lied repeatedly, he's responsible for a litany of deceit, but this moment demands not just anger, but action," Starmer told parliament.

Starmer accused the former minister and EU trade commissioner of failing "time and time again" to reveal the full extent of his relationship with Epstein during vetting for the Washington role last year.

Starmer's government agreed to submit to the parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee all documents in connection to the appointment, following growing anger from the opposition and some members of Starmer's own Labour party.

The prime minister's judgement is under scrutiny following new allegations that Mandelson had passed confidential and potentially market-sensitive information to Epstein nearly two decades ago.

"He lied repeatedly to my team when asked about his relationship with Epstein before and during his tenure as ambassador," Starmer told MPs during a parliamentary grilling.

"I regret appointing him. If I knew then what I know now, he would never have been anywhere near government."

UK police have announced they are probing the claims, which emerged from email exchanges between Mandelson and Epstein that revealed their warm relations and financial dealings, as well as private photos.

Around that time, Epstein was serving an 18-month jail term in 2008-2009 for soliciting a minor in Florida, while Mandelson was a UK government minister.

The mails were part of a vast trove of files about Epstein published by the US Justice Department.

Epstein was facing charges of alleged sex trafficking when he killed himself in jail in 2019.

Mandelson, for decades a pivotal and divisive figure in British politics, has had a chequered career and has twice resigned from government for alleged misconduct.

Starmer sacked him as ambassador in September after only seven months in the post following an earlier release of files about Epstein.

On Tuesday, Mandelson resigned from the upper house of parliament – the unelected House of Lords – after the latest release of files.

Other emails in the latest tranche appear to show Mandelson celebrating the American financier's release from prison in July 2009 as "Liberation Day!"

A day later, Mandelson asked Epstein: "How is freedom feeling?" Epstein replied: "She feels fresh, firm, and creamy."

Mandelson then replied: "Naughty boy."

The lewd comments were slammed by UK MPs, who heaped pressure on Starmer to explain his decision to hand Mandelson the ambassador's job in February 2025.

"Did he think at all about Epstein's victims?" asked Liberal Democrats leader Ed Davey.

Pledging to release the vetting documents, Starmer said he wanted MPs to see how "Mandelson completely misrepresented the extent of his relationship with Epstein".

London's Metropolitan Police confirmed on Tuesday it had launched an investigation into Mandelson on suspicion of misconduct in public office.

If any charges were brought and he were convicted, he could potentially face imprisonment.

The latest batch of US documents showed Mandelson had in 2009 forwarded an economic briefing to Epstein intended for then Prime Minister Gordon Brown .

The latest release also showed Epstein appeared to have transferred a total of $75,000 in three payments to accounts linked to the British politician between 2003 and 2004.

Mandelson has told the BBC he had no memory of the money transfers and did not know whether the documents were authentic.

The EU is also investigating whether Mandelson breached any of its rules during his time as trade commissioner from 2004-2008.

The former minister, who is gay, had previously claimed to have been excluded from Epstein's sexual activities.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 11:39:17 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/3696809e-f513-11f0-86e3-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26014418430745.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>These Venezuela political prisoners got out of jail, but they still aren’t free</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260205-venezuela-political-prisoners-got-out-of-jail-but-they-still-are-not-free</link><description>EDITOR’S NOTE : This article is a translation of an article originally published in French on February 2. Since that date, journalist Carlos Julio Rojas has decided to speak out publicly on the television network NTN 24 , breaking the ban on public comments that was imposed on him as a condition of his release.

On January 8, the president of Venezuela’s National Assembly, Jorge Rodríguez, declared that the government had decided to release a "significant number" of people. This announcement – made only five days after US Army special forces captured president Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores – was met with hope and expectation by the families of political prisoners . Many went to the detention centres to call for their release.

Four weeks after this announcement, 350 political prisoners have been released , according to Venezuelan NGO Foro Penal, whose name translates to "Penal Forum".

To display this content from X (Twitter), you must enable advertisement tracking and audience measurement.

However, hundreds of political prisoners are still behind bars. One of them is Perkins Rocha, the lawyer of opposition figure María Corina Machado , who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2025.

Rocha represented the opposition in the National Electoral Council during the contested presidential election in July 2024. A month later, he was arrested. One UN expert said that his arrest and detention "could be in retaliation for helping opposition candidates during Venezuela’s last election".

Rocha is being held at El Helicoide, a prison in Caracas that the opposition and human rights activists say is a torture centre.

Our team spoke to Rocha’s wife, María Costanza Cipriani. She says that she wasn’t able to visit him in prison until October 2025, more than a year after his arrest.

I don’t understand why he hasn’t been released yet because a lot of people with similar backgrounds have already been able to leave prison. Even if I am very happy for those who have been released, because they are all innocent, it’s really a difficult moment for me. I keep asking myself, "When will they call me to tell me that my husband will be released?"

Edward Ocariz is a member of the Comité por la Libertad de los Presos Políticos (Committee for the Liberation of Political Prisoners), a Venezuelan NGO.

Though many political prisoners have been released from prisons recently, largely because of pressure from the international community, we expected a much higher number.

More and more families are daring to speak out about the fact that their loved ones are incarcerated, something that they weren’t doing before, because they were so terrified. So we’ve discovered more than 200 new cases of political prisoners in January alone. There are still around 1,200 people imprisoned for political reasons, according to our estimates. And there are surely more.

The NGO Foro Penal reported in late January that, by their count, 711 political prisoners remained in prison. They also said that new cases had been reported to them in recent weeks.

Ocariz says that, in Venezuela, some citizens have been imprisoned simply because they were "denounced" by those with close links to the regime.

María Costanza Cipriani, the wife of lawyer Perkins Rocha, explains:

If my husband is freed, I would like him to be freed completely, meaning that he would be at liberty to give interviews, describe what he experienced, leave the country to visit his children, participate in the reconstruction of the country, etc. I say that because the people who have been freed thus far still have not regained their liberty: they may no longer be in prison, which is already an important step, but they were released under strict conditions.

Carlos Julio Rojas is one person facing the situation that Cipriani described. Rojas is a journalist and coordinator of an association for the residents of north Caracas . He was arrested on April 15, 2024 and was also imprisoned in El Helicoide. He was finally able to leave prison on January 14, but has not regained total liberty – a situation denounced by Amnesty International .

Rojas is not allowed to speak publicly. So our team spoke to his wife, Francy Fernández Terán, on January 28. Her husband sat next to her during the interview, remaining silent.

His release document state s that he is not allowed to leave the country and that he has to report to court every 30 days. Then, the court also stipulated that he is not allowed to speak out or make statements. So he feels gagged.

We want his complete freedom and the end of censorship so that Carlos Julio and other journalists can speak, write, document what happened and speak about what they experienced in prison.

Francy Fernández Terán explains:

Carlos Julio was imprisoned solely because he was defending the rights of the residents of central Caracas when they didn’t have access to water or electricity and because he became a leader who was respected and listened to.

During his detention, he spent four months in solitary confinement. During this period, I had no news from him and I wasn’t allowed to bring him food, clothes or medicine. And his case received media attention. Without that, I think it could have been much worse.

He wasn’t allowed to write in prison and, one day, he said to me, "I’m afraid that when I go home, I won’t know how to write anymore." But he’s already written one article since getting out of prison – a very good article – though, of course, it can’t be published.

Edward Ocariz, from Comité por la Libertad de los Presos Políticos, confirms the restrictions imposed on political prisoners who have been released from prison.

They have all been released under judicial supervision measures . When they are released, they are given a document that says, for example, that they can’t go to protests or meetings and that they have to appear before a judge every month, etc. This violates some of their rights but it is legal: our country’s Code of Penal Procedure clearly lists measures like this. Requiring people to report to court once a month is a way to continue to control them.

However, there is also an illegal element to what the authorities are doing. When the prisoners go before a judge, they are often told that they are not allowed to speak out, that they can’t ask for help from NGOs… They even told some of them that they weren’t allowed to have cell phones. It is a form of intimidation, so that they remain silent.

As a result, it is very hard for us NGOs to record their accounts of what happened, even though it is necessary to document what they experienced in prison so that we can call for justice.

'The main effects are psychological'

The political prisoners who have been released all came out thinner. Many – including young, active people – have health problems that they didn’t have before like cardiopathy [a heart disease] or arterial hypertension. However, the main effects are psychological. Some of them are afraid to leave their homes, out of fear. Others wake up every time they hear a sound and sometimes wake up crying. Some of them are distant with their loved ones. Some feel abandoned because their children left the country while they were in prison.

On January 30, Venezuela’s interim president, Delcy Rodriguez, announced that a law of general amnesty, "covering the entire period of political violence between 1999 and today", would be presented to the National Assembly. During the same speech, she announced that El Helicoide would be shut down.

These announcements represent a glimmer of hope for the political prisoners still behind bars and for those who recently left prison but are still not free.

However, NGOs are viewing the announcement of this law with caution. Foro Penal said that any amnesty must not "favour or include those who committed human rights violations or crimes against humanity" and that it was important to ensure that these violations would not be repeated.

"Amnesty implies ‘erasing’ the crimes that were committed," María Costanza Cipriani, Perkins Rocha’s wife, says. "In the case of my husband, the crimes were invented. That said, if this law allows my husband to come home, then I would obviously be very happy."</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 11:39:19 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/8409783a-0068-11f1-a5e9-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/Venezuela-8.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Stepson of Norway's crown prince denies drugging alleged rape victim</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/stepson-norways-crown-prince-denies-drugging-alleged-rape-victim-2026-02-05/</link><description>OSLO, Feb 5 (Reuters) - The son of Norway's crown princess denied in court on Thursday that he ever drugged the alleged victim of one of the rapes he is charged with, on his second day of testimony in a trial that has transfixed Norway.

Marius Borg Hoiby, 29, who joined the royal family when his mother Mette-Marit married Crown Prince Haakon in 2001, is charged with 38 counts. He faces years in prison if convicted.

On Tuesday , he pleaded not guilty to four counts of rape and one of domestic violence. He pleaded guilty to offensive sexual behaviour, driving too fast and driving without a valid license.

Hoiby also said he was partially guilty - a plea allowed under Norwegian law - of aggravated assault and reckless behaviour.

On Wednesday , he denied that videos on his phone showed acts of rape and broke down as he recalled a childhood in the public eye.

The trial comes with his mother facing scrutiny over fresh revelations about her ties to the late U.S. sex offender Jeffrey Epstein , which has damaged the popularity of the royal family though most Norwegians still want a monarchy.

On Thursday, Hoiby answered questions about the search history on his phone, including for words such as "rape".

"Is this something you are interested in?" asked prosecutor Sturla Henriksboe.

"I have looked at a lot of weird stuff," Hoiby answered wearing jeans and a marine blue jumper over a white T-shirt, sometimes fiddling with a beaded bracelet between his fingers.

On Wednesday, the trial focused on the count of rape alleged to have taken place in 2018 in the basement of the Crown Prince family's residence on the outskirts of Oslo. The alleged victim said she was certain she had been drugged.

"Did you dope her down?" Henriksboe asked on Thursday.

"Never," replied Hoiby.

Henriksboe then asked Hoiby whether he knew of drugs that could "dope down", such as ketamine, and whether he could have access to them. Hoiby said he knew of such drugs and could probably have access to them.

John Christian Elder, the lawyer representing the alleged victim, asked Hoiby his thoughts about the fact that he is charged with counts of rape occurring when the alleged victims were sleeping or unconscious.

"I don't remember that episode so I don't know whether there was consent or not," said Hoiby, referring to the alleged rape in 2018.

Outside the courtroom, polls conducted this week showed the monarchy's popularity is taking a hit, though a majority of Norwegians still prefer it over a republic.

Crown Princess Mette-Marit is seen as unfit to become queen for 44% of Norwegians polled, with 35% uncertain and 22% saying she is suitable, according to a Norstat survey of 1,025 Norwegians for public broadcaster NRK and daily Dagbladet published on Wednesday.

Meanwhile, 54% Norwegians said Norway should remain a monarchy while 33% said it should become a republic, according to a poll for daily Aftenposten conducted February 2-3 among 1,024 respondents.

Parliament, in a long-planned vote, overwhelmingly endorsed the monarchy on Tuesday.

As Hoiby's trial has proceeded, King Harald and Crown Prince Haakon have continued with their official duties, with Harald visiting a hospital late on Wednesday. He did not speak to journalists who attended that visit.

He and Queen Sonja are due to attend the 2026 Winter Olympics in Italy at the weekend.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 13:03:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LS6L76JTQ5IGFCVQX7SMNTT2JQ.jpg?auth=71a7f12ddc147bde2f521a6680a1f8250f13cf1808259e903eb772561e05664f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Starlink used by Russian forces deactivated on battlefield, Ukraine says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/starlink-used-by-russian-forces-deactivated-battlefield-ukraine-says-2026-02-05/</link><description>KYIV, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Starlink internet terminals used by the Russian military on the battlefield in Ukraine have been deactivated, Ukraine said on Thursday, in what one official described as a "disaster" for Moscow that had disrupted its assault operations in many areas.

Ukrainian officials have said that Russia used thousands of Starlink terminals on the battlefield, something that military analysts say made their communications mobile and hard to disrupt. Reuters was not immediately able to determine the scale of the deactivation.

Ukraine said last week it was working with Elon Musk's SpaceX to block the use of Starlink terminals in Russian attack drones and was trying to compile a "white list" of all Ukraine's terminals so that Russian ones could be deactivated.

"Starlinks included in the 'white list' are working — Russian terminals have already been blocked," Defence Minister Mykhailo Fedorov, who took office last month, said on the Telegram app, noting that the process of verification was ongoing.

SpaceX did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Musk said on Sunday that moves by SpaceX to stop the unauthorized use by Russia of Starlink seemed to have worked .

Serhiy Beskrestnov, an adviser to Fedorov, said the impact of the deactivations was already significant.

"The enemy doesn't even have a problem on the fronts, the enemy has a disaster," he said. "All command of the troops has collapsed. Assault operations have been stopped in many areas."

Kyiv's military relies on tens of thousands of satellite-based Starlink internet connections for battlefield communication and for piloting some drone missions.

It said this week it had found Starlink terminals on long-range drones used in Russian attacks.

A source in the Ukrainian army on the eastern front told Reuters that Russian troops are experiencing significant problems with communication, with almost all connection via Starlink being off.

Reuters was not able immediately to verify that information independently.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 13:03:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BVTUECWLC5K7DLZFB7A4Q2YNTU.jpg?auth=a5eb03c3d22d35b430dbf9e0973e3d110b976c17285f69d900a9eec3871798b6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Spain's Sanchez: we won't be swayed by tech oligarchs on social media ban</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/technology/spains-sanchez-we-wont-be-swayed-by-tech-oligarchs-social-media-ban-2026-02-05/</link><description>MADRID, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Tech companies will not sway the will of the Spanish government as it intends to ban young people from social media platforms, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said on Thursday, accusing " tech oligarchs " of spreading lies about Spain.

Telegram founder Pavel Durov on Wednesday joined Elon Musk in criticising plans by Sanchez to ban social media access for under-16s and to prosecute executives for hate speech on their platforms.

Spain joins countries such as Britain, Greece and France in considering tougher stances on social media , after Australia in December became the first nation to prohibit access to such platforms for children younger than 16.

"Democracy will obviously not be swayed by the tech oligarchs of the algorithm," Sanchez told an event in Madrid. "Just yesterday they addressed millions of people via their platforms to spread lies."

Durov said in a Telegram message that Spain's proposed legislation would force social media platforms to gather data on all users and allow governments to control what users see. The day before, Musk posted on his X profile that Sanchez was "a tyrant and a traitor to the people of Spain".

The Spanish government said Durov's message to all Spanish users of Telegram showed the urgent need to regulate social media and messaging apps to protect citizens from misleading information.

Sanchez, one of a dwindling band of leftist leaders in Europe, has been criticising technology platforms since early last year, when he proposed ending anonymity on social media and linking users' data to a common EU identity wallet.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 13:03:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/K24OXYOIWNPSJNRZ5SRW2UTZ2Y.jpg?auth=67e9abe3873b1569e42a826f338fe325f35be58375b349276db607824f8b395e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Estonia releases vessel held on suspicion of smuggling after inspection</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/estonia-releases-vessel-held-suspicion-of-smuggling-after-inspection-2026-02-05/</link><description>STOCKHOLM, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Estonia's Tax and Customs Board said on Thursday it had allowed the seized Baltic Spirit cargo vessel to leave the port of Muuga after an inspection had not confirmed suspicions it carried contraband.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 13:03:42 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/J2OT46IMSVO2LHG3HHCW3T5WGM.jpg?auth=1bb42dc711388997fd45b2f1aac58ca16ebd233c55b315fd77faa5f6343d7aff&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Machado says Venezuelan elections could happen this year, Politico reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/machado-says-venezuelan-elections-could-happen-this-year-politico-reports-2026-02-05/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado said she believed elections could be held in her country later this year, speaking to Politico in an interview released on Thursday.

"We believe that a real transferring process with manual voting … could be done in nine to 10 months," Machado said. "But, well, that depends when you start."

Machado, whose party said it won 70% of the vote in Venezuela's 2024 election, met with President Donald Trump and spoke with his top diplomat and U.S. lawmakers last month following the U.S. capture of the country's longtime leader Nicolas Maduro.

"We have a legitimate leadership with huge popular support and our armed forces are also supportive of a transition to democracy," she told Politico.

Trump in January said he was considering getting Machado " involved some way " even as he has backed Venezuela's interim President Delcy Rodriguez.

Machado told Politico that she had not yet spoken to Trump about the election process.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio told U.S. lawmakers at a Jan. 28 hearing that Venezuela's new leaders were moving toward closer ties with Washington before meeting with Machado later that day.

U.S. intelligence reports have questioned whether Rodriguez is fully on board with the strategy for her country and if she intends to formally cut ties with U.S. adversaries, Reuters reported last month.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 13:03:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/JYZGF26DE5OW7AZF5IJ6XD325U.jpg?auth=00376171ed00eaa9792137d356a704ea007927c210373a6f1a57691ec2276d1f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Irish attorney general raises concerns on sanctioning services in Israeli settlements</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/irish-attorney-general-raises-concerns-sanctioning-services-israeli-settlements-2026-02-05/</link><description>DUBLIN, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Ireland's top government lawyer has raised several "significant" legal and practical issues in long-awaited advice on whether planned curbs on trade with Israeli settlements should be extended to services, a junior minister said on Thursday.

Ireland has been preparing a law to curb trade with settlements in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, facing pressure at home to widen the scope of the ban from goods to services, while Israel and the United States want the bill scrapped.

Ireland has been one of the European Union's most outspoken critics of Israel's assault in Gaza. But sources told Reuters last October that the bill was set to be limited to goods after lobbying by U.S. businesses based in the country.

"The advice, which is detailed and extensive, identifies a number of significant legal and practical issues with the regulation by a member state of trade in services with a country or territory outside the EU," Neale Richmond, a junior minister at the department of foreign affairs, told parliament.

"Following detailed consideration by officials in the department, clarification has been sought from the Attorney General on a number of legal issues... Any legislation must be legally robust (and) able to withstand challenge."

Dublin first committed to introducing legislation in October 2024. Ministers have for months blamed delays in progressing the bill on the need to await the attorney general's advice on the inclusion of services.

Limiting the bill to goods only would catch just a handful of products imported from Israeli-occupied territories such as fruit that are worth just 200,000 euros ($234,660) a year.

Adding services could entangle multinational companies in technology and other industries in Ireland doing business in Israel. Richmond reiterated concerns by other ministers that including services would be "considerably more complex".

Within the EU, Slovenia, Spain, the Netherlands and Belgium all followed Ireland in either committing to or introducing bans on trade with Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 13:03:48 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/D5BLXMGD35PMRI4TDR24HOFXC4.jpg?auth=72c11106c8aa8fba3ea9d9e8a80c7b4c40919a814f2a08377d88b9b585cc4887&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Azerbaijan hands long prison terms to former Karabakh officials</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/azerbaijan-hands-long-prison-terms-former-karabakh-officials-2026-02-05/</link><description>BAKU, Feb 5 (Reuters) - An Azerbaijani military court issued long prison sentences on Thursday to 13 former officials of Nagorno-Karabakh, where ethnic Armenians maintained an unrecognised breakaway statelet for three decades until Baku restored military control in 2023.

Five defendants, including former Karabakh leader Arayik Harutyunyan, were sentenced to life imprisonment. Eight others received prison terms ranging from 15 to 20 years.

They were convicted on charges including crimes against peace and humanity, war crimes, preparation and conduct of an aggressive war, genocide, violations of the laws and customs of war, terrorism and the violent seizure of power.

Human rights groups have raised concerns about the fairness of the trial, which began in January 2025.

Ethnic Armenians in Karabakh, an internationally recognised part of Azerbaijan, broke away from Baku's control as the Soviet Union fell apart in 1991.

Azerbaijan and Armenia fought two wars over the mountainous territory before Baku took it back in 2023 and its entire Armenian population of around 100,000 people fled to Armenia.

Harutyunyan's lawyer Javid Rzazade told Reuters that his client had expected the verdict.

"Arayik Harutyunyan was prepared for this court decision. We knew the court could issue a life sentence. Naturally, we do not agree with either the indictment or the verdict," Rzazade said, adding it was too early to decide on a possible appeal.

A verdict has yet to be passed on Ruben Vardanyan , a former billionaire banker who served as the number two official in Karabakh, and for whom prosecutors have demanded a life sentence.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 13:03:54 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Deaths were avoidable in Channel's worst migrant boat disaster, UK inquiry finds</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/deaths-were-avoidable-channels-worst-migrant-boat-disaster-uk-inquiry-finds-2026-02-05/</link><description>LONDON, Feb 5 (Reuters) - The deaths of more than 30 migrants who drowned attempting to travel from France to Britain in a small boat were avoidable, an inquiry into the worst disaster of its kind found on Thursday.

The inquiry said 27 men, women and children died when their dinghy deflated as they crossed the Channel in November 2021, while the bodies of four others have never been found.

Just two people survived, and one of them told the inquiry that more people were on board. The incident was the worst on record involving migrants in the narrow seaway separating France and Britain.

Inquiry chair Ross Cranston said in his report the deaths were avoidable, attributing responsibility primarily to the people smugglers who crowded at least 33 people on to "an unsuitable craft (with) inadequate safety equipment".

Cranston also said a French naval vessel had failed to respond to a call for help from the British coastguard, which in turn made "a number of flawed decisions", including a decision to end a search for survivors too early.

He added, however, that the British coastguard had been "placed in an intolerable position because of chronic staff shortages ... and other deficiencies" at the time.

Cranston said the issue of small boats carrying migrants from France, which has become a focal point for British voters and has helped propel Nigel Farage's anti-immigration Reform UK into an opinion poll lead, was not a matter for his inquiry.

"However, ultimately the practice of small boat crossings must end," he said. "Quite apart from other reasons, this is imperative to prevent any further deaths of people travelling on board small boats."

A British government spokesperson said there had been improvements made to Channel responses since 2021, "including closer working ties with France" and additional officers for search and rescue operations.

Imran Hussain, from Britain's Refugee Council, said the report showed "why it is so vital to have safe and legal routes to allow people to get to the UK".</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 13:03:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/S5ZDQ3JGIRMTNH4EBKCYW2X2WA.jpg?auth=624356f16168ef758ca18e7cd66719dcf4cdbf0b5fba8f53595f496a1e39c7bd&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Greece arrests member of military for espionage</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/greece-arrests-member-military-espionage-2026-02-05/</link><description>ATHENS, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Greek defence authorities have arrested a member of the Greek defence forces who was leaking "secret information" to "third parties", the Greek National Defence General Staff (GEETHA) said on Thursday.

Jean-Noël Barrot is on the first stop of a regional tour as France reassesses how to tackle jihadists after Kurdish allies in Syria , who were guarding detained IS group militants, were forced to disband under pressure from Damascus.

Barrot will move on to Iraq on Thursday afternoon before heading to Lebanon on Friday, according to the French foreign ministry.

In the Syrian capital, he met his counterpart Asaad al-Shaibani, with the pair discussing how to prevent a resurgence of IS group fighters after the Kurdish forces' withdrawal from swathes of northern Syria.

"For 10 years, France has fought relentlessly and mercilessly against the terrorists of Daesh in Iraq as well as in Syria," said Barrot, using an Arabic acronym for the IS group.

"I have come to reaffirm this absolute priority of France here in Syria."

Until now, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) had been the main partner on the ground of a western anti-jihadist coalition, but under military pressure from Damascus they are to integrate into the Syrian army.

"This tour stems from the convergence of two crises," a French diplomatic source said, referring to Barrot's trip.

"One that erupted very recently in northeastern Syria, with clashes between the Syrian authorities in Damascus and the Kurdish-dominated SDF, and the ever-present threat of a military escalation between the United States and Iran."

Western powers must now work with Syria's government to contain the IS group, the source said, but "there is not the same history, the same reflexes developed together, or the same bonds of trust", alluding to Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa 's past as a jihadist.

Sharaa, who overthrew former Syrian president Bashar al-Assad in December 2024, has been seeking to impose his authority over all the country including Kurdish-controlled areas.

Other issues on Barrot's agenda will be the question of integrating Syria's myriad minorities into its new political landscape.

France has positioned itself as an advocate of Kurdish rights and will be pushing Damascus to comply with an agreement announced last week aimed at integrating Kurdish institutions and forces into the Syrian state.

The agreement dashed the Kurds ' hopes of retaining an autonomous zone they had established in northern and northeastern Syria during a civil war that ravaged Syria between 2011 and 2024.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 14:26:12 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/36fb7634-0297-11f1-ac54-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/000-969J9PN.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Morocco evacuates 143,000 people in northwest as flood precaution, interior ministry says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/morocco-evacuates-143000-people-northwest-flood-precaution-interior-ministry-2026-02-05/</link><description>RABAT, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Moroccan authorities have evacuated more than 143,000 people in the flood-prone northwestern plains, the interior ministry said on Thursday, amid rising threats of inundation from heavy rain, swollen rivers and the release of more water from full dams.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 15:10:43 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/TWE53TWT7JIBLE4RJUHELYNVQY.jpg?auth=fb6abeee370041ef4030269ad07f73e4ff40ed757f1f64863644cb4376def6fe&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US, Russia close in on deal to continue New START nuclear arms treaty, Axios reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us-russia-close-deal-extend-new-start-nuclear-arms-treaty-axios-reports-2026-02-05/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Feb 5 (Reuters) - The United States and Russia are closing in on a deal to observe the New START nuclear arms control treaty beyond its expiration on Thursday, Axios reported, citing three sources familiar with the talks.

The , which set limits on each side's missiles, launchers and strategic warheads, is the last in a series of nuclear agreements dating back more than half a century to the Cold War.

Negotiations had been taking place over the past 24 hours in Abu Dhabi but an agreement had not been reached, Axios said, citing an additional source.

The White House had no immediate comment on the report, which followed a series of other developments in relations between the world's two biggest nuclear powers.

The U.S. military's European Command said on Thursday the U.S. and Russia had agreed in Abu Dhabi to resume a high-level military-to-military dialogue.

Also, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said peace talks with Russia, backed by the U.S., would continue in the near future after negotiators ended a second round of discussions in Abu Dhabi.

The Axios report on New START said it was unclear whether the agreement to observe the treaty's terms for an additional period of time, possibly six months, would be enshrined in any formal way.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday Russia was still ready to engage in dialogue with the U.S. if Washington responded constructively to a proposal by Moscow to keep abiding by the limits of the expiring New START nuclear treaty.

"Listen, if there are any constructive replies, of course we will conduct a dialogue," Peskov told reporters.

The New START treaty signed in 2010 allowed one single extension, which was agreed by former President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin for five years. Any new extension would require an executive decision to voluntarily extend the limits of the treaty.

U.S. President Donald Trump, who spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Wednesday, wants China brought into a nuclear reduction deal.

Beijing has so far declined negotiations with Moscow and Washington as it has a fraction of their warhead numbers - an estimated 600, compared to around 4,000 each for Russia and the U.S.

The White House said this week that Trump would decide the way forward on nuclear arms control, which he would "clarify on his own timeline" but gave no further details.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 15:11:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/OFAY5CZN6ZLNHOXMILDSSHL3CY.jpg?auth=a0ed58f9b8aefefeae42c51db83f9b5afe21074b44d70b1fc9cf78f4727a5213&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Slovenia prepares legislation to ban social media for under-15s</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/slovenia-preparing-law-ban-access-social-media-minors-under-15-2026-02-05/</link><description>Feb 5 (Reuters) - Slovenia is preparing draft legislation to ban social media access for children under 15, Deputy Prime Minister Matej Arcon told a news conference on Thursday.

Slovenia, with a population of around 2 million, is following Spain and Greece , which earlier this week proposed bans on social media use by teenagers in a sign of hardening attitudes in Europe towards the technology that some say is designed to be addictive.

Arcon said the Education Ministry had initiated the move, based on the experience of other countries, and that experts in education and digital technologies would also be involved in drafting the law that aims to protect children and adolescents.

"This has been a hot topic around the world and in Europe in recent weeks and months, and with this, we as a government are showing that we care about our children," Arcon said after the government session.

He said the government wants to regulate social networks where content is shared, mentioning TikTok, Snapchat and Instagram, among others.

While Spain wants to prohibit social media for under-16s, Greece is close to announcing a similar ban for children under 15, according to a senior government source.

Other countries, such as Britain and France, are also considering tougher stances on social media, after Australia in December became the first country to prohibit access to such platforms for children younger than 16.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 15:12:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/TOGRB4KN35IR5FBTH3H6XN32B4.jpg?auth=9287b2d7d311bb673b553568c4c7aa54011dc67828590c2c45f89e3ec0091cb6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US, Russia to reestablish military-to-military talks</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-russia-reestablish-high-level-military-to-military-dialogue-us-military-says-2026-02-05/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Feb 5 (Reuters) - The U.S. military said that Washington and Moscow on Thursday agreed to reestablish high level military-to-military dialogue, following talks in Abu Dhabi, a move which could signal a move towards normalizing some ties between the United States and Russia.

The United States halted military-to-military communication with Moscow just before Russia invaded Ukraine. The conflict, which began in 2022, is the deadliest war in Europe since World War Two and the biggest confrontation between Moscow and the West since the depths of the Cold War.

In a statement, the U.S. military said the aim of reestablishing the mechanism was to avoid miscalculation and escalation by either side.

"Maintaining dialogue between militaries is an important factor in global stability and peace, which can only be achieved through strength, and provides a means for increased transparency and de-escalation," the statement added.

The reestablishment comes after the commander of U.S. European Command, General Alexus Grynkewich, held talks with senior Russian and Ukrainian military officials in Abu Dhabi.

Even after high-level military talks were halted between the United States and Russia, they maintained an emergency deconfliction line.

Just over a year later, that choice has created the biggest threat yet for Starmer, with his lawmakers questioning his judgment and leadership after emails illustrated not only the extent of Mandelson's ties to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein but his alleged willingness to leak government business.

While Starmer does not appear in any immediate danger of falling over the scandal, six Labour lawmakers said on condition of anonymity it had further weakened a prime minister challenged by an increasingly restive Labour Party.

Now even those most loyal to him suggest it is a question of when, not if, he is removed from power, with several pointing to the May local elections as a pressure point.

One Labour activist said the situation for Starmer was now like the children's game Buckaroo, where players stack cowboy gear onto a mule until it buckles.

"You know it's all going to collapse for Starmer at some point," the activist said.

A Labour lawmaker said that after months of policy U-turns and missteps over donations, the Mandelson scandal "feels like something has shattered and that will be impossible to recover".

The Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy, put the probability of Starmer's removal this year at 80%, up from 65% previously, saying it had dealt "irreparable damage".

All six Labour lawmakers from different wings of the party said the appointment of Mandelson, dubbed the 'prince of darkness' by British media for his behind-the-scenes manoeuvring, had irreversibly tarnished a prime minister who came to power with a pledge to clean up politics.

It was never meant to be this way.

When Mandelson, 72, a minister when Labour was last in power more than 15 years ago, was appointed in late 2024, Starmer said the veteran brought "unrivalled experience to the role".

His work as a former aide and minister to former prime ministers, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, and as the EU's trade commissioner was touted by the government as being "crucial" to deepen Britain's relationship with the United States.

And Mandelson, the first political appointee to the position in almost half a century, was praised for helping to secure the first deal with the U.S. to lower some of Trump's tariffs on sectors such as cars.

But for the man who was known to have been an acquaintance of Epstein and of other wealthy individuals such as businessman Oleg Deripaska, who is now under sanctions over Russia's war in Ukraine, the post was always risky.

Mandelson denied granting favours to the Russian businessman while he was European trade commissioner.

Files released by the U.S. Justice Department last week included emails suggesting Mandelson had leaked discussions on possible UK asset sales and tax changes to Epstein during the financial crash, and that Epstein had recorded payments to Mandelson or his then-partner, now husband.

Mandelson has said he does not recall having received payments. He has not commented publicly on allegations he leaked documents, and did not respond to messages seeking comment.

He was sacked as ambassador in September 2025 and is now under police investigation for alleged misconduct in office.

Starmer has defended his own actions, accusing Mandelson of creating a "litany of deceit" about his Epstein ties and promising to release documents on how he was appointed.

"I share the anger that people feel when powerful individuals appear to escape scrutiny," Starmer said.

Starmer's attempts to move on from the scandal have proven futile - at a press conference on Thursday, almost every question was about how he failed to see the jeopardy of Mandelson's appointment, even though he was forced out of government twice under Blair over earlier allegations of misconduct.

"It had been publicly known for some time that Mandelson knew Epstein, but none of us knew the depth and the darkness of that relationship," he said.

That defence has done little to quell anger in Labour, which after winning a large majority in the July 2024 national election, has seen its grip on power falter after major policy U-turns.

British borrowing costs have also risen, suggesting investors think Starmer may be forced out.

The anger of several Labour lawmakers was focused on Starmer's closest adviser, Morgan McSweeney, defended by Starmer as being "an essential part of my team".

He has been blamed for presiding over a Downing Street operation which, they say, has failed to provide a firm narrative about how the government wants to change Britain.

Another Labour lawmaker said they thought Starmer would last until the May local elections, but would be vulnerable after.

"Either way he and Morgan are both now very badly damaged."</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 16:07:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WSQNJPTDG5NVZBSXGOPCGJF5RI.jpg?auth=9fd65e084f32af4d25f21ca07926eff3dfda92447a7d0ebf91a1512cbc464d11&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Activists plan new, bigger flotilla to try to bring aid to Gaza</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/activists-plan-new-bigger-flotilla-try-bring-aid-gaza-2026-02-05/</link><description>JOHANNESBURG, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Activists behind a flotilla intercepted at sea last year by Israel while trying to bring aid to Gaza will try again this year, expecting more than twice as many boats carrying up to 1,000 medics, they said on Thursday.

The Israeli military halted the roughly 40 boats in the Global Sumud Flotilla last October as they attempted to reach blockaded Gaza, arresting Swedish activist Greta Thunberg and more than 450 other participants.

Organisers, who gathered on Wednesday at the foundation of late South African leader Nelson Mandela in Johannesburg, said they hope to bring 100 boats for their next attempt.

"It is a cause ... for those that want to rise and stand for justice and dignity for all," Mandela's grandson Mandla Mandela, who was among activists detained last time, told the gathering. "We want to mobilise the ... global community to join forces with us."

Israeli officials repeatedly denounced last year's mission, and previous smaller-scale attempts to reach Gaza by sea, as publicity stunts.

Israel, which controls all access to the Gaza Strip, denies withholding supplies for its more than 2 million residents. Palestinians and international aid bodies say supplies reaching the territory are still insufficient, despite a ceasefire reached in October which included guarantees of increased aid.

Following the ceasefire, Israeli forces now control more than 53% of the Gaza Strip where they have ordered residents out. Nearly the entire population is crowded into a narrow strip along the coast, mostly living in makeshift tents and damaged buildings.

If the flotilla is blocked again, the activists said it would still be worth it to highlight Gaza's plight.

"We may not have reached Gaza physically (but) we have reached ... the people in Gaza," said one of the activists, Susan Abdallah. "They know that we care, that we will not stop at anything until we actually break the siege."</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 16:09:03 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/AEJDDR3KWVNWPGUNTQNLWDQ7AQ.jpg?auth=21b72173b61ca9b20aa48b86856d592760c13a6b57695fc23577b4a650ed0a0c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Brazil's Lula likely to visit Washington in early March</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/brazils-lula-likely-visit-washington-early-march-2026-02-05/</link><description>SAO PAULO, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said on Thursday he is likely to travel to Washington in the first week of March for a meeting with his U.S. counterpart Donald Trump.

Ambassador Tom Rose's furious response to Parliament Speaker Wlodzimierz Czarzasty underlined the precarious balancing act politicians from Poland's pro-European coalition government face in keeping their most important ally onside while Trump is pursuing "America First" policies many of them find unnerving.

Czarzasty said on Monday he would not support an initiative put forward by U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson and Israeli Knesset Speaker Amir Ohana to rally heads of parliaments to nominate Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize in 2026 for his efforts to bring peace to the Middle East .

"In my opinion, President Trump is destabilising the situation in these (international) organisations by representing the politics of force and using force to pursue a transactional policy," Czarzasty, leader of The Left, the junior coalition partner in the government, told journalists.

"All of this means that I will not support President Trump's Nobel Prize nomination because he doesn't deserve it."

Rose lashed out at Czarzasty on Thursday, saying Washington will have no further "dealings, contacts, or communications" with him, effective immediately.

"(Czarzasty's) outrageous and unprovoked insults directed against President Trump has made himself a serious impediment to our excellent relations with Prime Minister Tusk and his government," he wrote on social media platform X on Thursday.

"We will not permit anyone to harm U.S.–Polish relations, nor disrespect (Trump) who has done so much for Poland and the Polish people."

In response, Czarzasty wrote on X that he regretted the ambassador's reaction but would not change his position on fundamental issues.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 16:09:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/6JO46CDXENJIRFPBQTZALUGCJU.jpg?auth=e830d3a0c1bc014f13a7a4ab7fa05bf43733b67a35cf59accf99111f2c9e460b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Sixteen people killed in blast at illegal mine in northeastern India</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/india/sixteen-people-killed-blast-illegal-mine-northeastern-india-2026-02-05/</link><description>Feb 5 (Reuters) - At least 16 people were killed and more were feared trapped after an explosion at an unauthorised coal mine in India's northeastern state of Meghalaya, an official said, the latest in a series of similar incidents in the region in recent years.

The blast took place at around 10 a.m. local time (0430 GMT) in a 'rat-hole' mine - named because their tunnels are just big enough for workers to get through - in the East Jaintia Hills district, the district's deputy commissioner Manish Kumar told Reuters.

Rat-hole mines were once used extensively in India's northeastern states, but were banned in 2014 because of the large number of fatalities and the damage caused to the environment.

Local police were on the scene and have been conducting rescue operations, but attempts to reach the miners have been suspended due to a lack of equipment, the deputy commissioner said. Eight people were also injured in the incident, he added.

Rescue work was hampered because of the remote location of the mine, Kumar said, adding that it would take several hours of driving off-road for state and federal rescue workers to reach the spot and resume search and rescue operations.

"The Government of Meghalaya has ordered a comprehensive inquiry into the incident. Accountability will be fixed, and those responsible will face strict legal action," the state's Chief Minister Conrad Sangma said in a post on X.

A total of 63 people have died during illegal rat-hole mining in the north-eastern states of Assam and Meghalaya since 2012, according to a federal government estimate.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 16:10:12 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Missiles, uranium, stockpiles: thorny issues on the Iran talks table</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260205-missiles-uranium-stockpiles-thorny-issues-on-the-iran-talks-table</link><description>Iran and the United States are holding talks on Friday in Oman, with Tehran pushing to focus squarely on its nuclear programme, while Washington's demands go beyond that.

The two foes had held several rounds of Oman-mediated nuclear talks in 2025, but the Iran-Israel war, which saw the United States conduct strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, derailed diplomacy days before a meeting was due.

US President Donald Trump has threatened renewed military action against Iran following its deadly crackdown on mass anti-government protests, but has also said he thinks Tehran is open to a deal.

The United States has said talks must cover Tehran's missile programme and its support for militant groups in the region.

Here are some of the thorny issues on the table:

The main dispute between Iran and the US concerns uranium enrichment.

Western countries and Israel, thought to be the Middle East's only country with nuclear weapons , say Iran is seeking to acquire a bomb, which the Islamic republic denies.

During the Iran-Israel war last June, the United States bombed three nuclear sites in Iran (Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan), with Trump later claiming the strikes "obliterated" the nuclear programme, although the extent of the damage remains unknown.

Experts say uranium enriched above 20 percent can have potential military applications but that enrichment must reach 90 percent to make a bomb.

Before the war, Iran was enriching uranium to 60 percent, according to the UN's International Atomic Energy Agency, far exceeding a 3.67 percent cap allowed under a now-defunct nuclear agreement that Iran reached with world powers in 2015.

Watch Iran-US talks will go ahead in Oman

The United States withdrew from that deal in 2018 and Iran subsequently abandoned its commitments under the agreement in retaliation.

Trump has repeatedly called for a complete end to enrichment, a condition much stricter than the 2015 deal.

Iran, which says it has a right to civilian nuclear power, deems this demand a "red line" and contrary to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty to which it and 190 other nations are signatories.

The location of Iran's reserves of more than 400 kilogrammes of highly enriched uranium is unclear after the US bombings last year. The stocks were last seen by IAEA inspectors on June 10.

"The materials are under the rubble (of bombed nuclear sites) and we have made no attempt to extract them... because it is dangerous," Ali Shamkhani, an adviser to Iran's supreme leader, told Lebanese media this week.

"We are discussing this issue with the IAEA in order to find a solution while ensuring safety," he added.

Iran suspended all cooperation with the UN nuclear watchdog at the end of September, justifying its decision as retaliation after UN sanctions were reinstated over its nuclear programme.

Several countries, including Russia, have offered to house Tehran's stockpile of enriched uranium as a safeguard, but Iran has refused.

"There is no reason to move the materials abroad when we can eliminate the sources of concern" about their end use, Shamkhani insisted.

"We have no plan to militarise our nuclear programme" and "we can therefore dilute the material from 60 to, say, 20 percent", he added.

"But in exchange, something must be paid," Shamkhani said, alluding to Iran's demand that sanctions be lifted.

Tehran is adamant that the talks be strictly limited to the nuclear issue and the lifting of sanctions, and considers this demand non-negotiable.

But Washington and its ally Israel are pushing for other grievances against the Islamic republic to be included.

In 2018, the United States' withdrawal from the previous nuclear deal was partly motivated by the absence of curbs in the agreement on Iran's ballistic missile programme, perceived as a threat to Israel.

According to media reports, Israel is now pushing to put this issue on the negotiating table, along with Iran's policy of financing militant groups across the Middle East, including Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas in Gaza and the Houthis in Yemen.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 16:11:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/a18fd72a-0291-11f1-b11c-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/829887171fea1281b31cd797609525c8f40f14df.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UAE plans compound for Palestinians in Israeli-held south Gaza, map shows</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/uae-plans-compound-palestinians-israeli-held-south-gaza-map-shows-2026-02-05/</link><description>JERUSALEM, Feb 5 (Reuters) - The United Arab Emirates has drafted plans to build a compound to house thousands of displaced Palestinians in a part of south Gaza under Israeli military control, according to a map seen by Reuters and people briefed on the plans.

The planning map shows where the "UAE Temporary Emirates Housing Complex" would be constructed near Rafah, once a city of a quarter million people but now almost completely destroyed and depopulated by Israeli forces.

Rafah, near the Egypt border, is where reconstruction of Gaza is expected to start under U.S. President Donald Trump's plan for a durable peace in the densely populated coastal enclave after two years of devastating war.

Donors have been reluctant to commit funds to the plan, worried that disagreements over disarming Hamas militants could lead the parties back to full-scale conflict.

However there are doubts about the political viability of the Emirati project, as most Palestinians could balk at being housed in an Israeli-controlled zone while the vast majority of civilians live in Hamas-run areas of Gaza, diplomats said.

Trump's plan saw the establishment of a U.S.-led, multinational mission for Gaza based in southern Israel, where Emirati officials have shared details of their plans to build temporary housing and provide basic services in Rafah, four diplomats briefed on the initiative said.

The map shows that the UAE housing would sit near the "yellow line" agreed under an October ceasefire to demarcate Israeli- and Hamas-controlled areas.

In response to questions for this story, an Emirati official said the Gulf country "remains committed to scaling up its humanitarian efforts to support Palestinians in Gaza", without confirming or denying plans to build the temporary housing site.

One of the diplomats said the Israeli military had cleared a large area leading from the Mediterranean coast toward Rafah for temporary housing projects like the one the UAE was planning.

The diplomats said the Emirati initiative resembled a U.S. proposal to build temporary housing for Palestinians in areas of Gaza that are still controlled by Israel. U.S. officials initially described their plan as "Alternative Safe Communities" and more recently as "Planned Communities", the diplomats said.

American officials had hoped that building housing in the Israeli-controlled areas could generate momentum toward Hamas' disarmament, encouraging Gazans to leave Hamas-controlled zones and depriving the Islamist group of a civilian population.

Kenneth Katzman, a Middle East expert at The Soufan Center, a U.S.-based, security-focused think tank, said the "Alternative Safe Communities" were designed as a way of gradually "choking Hamas off", but for it to be effective, it would have to be built at scale, housing hundreds of thousands of Palestinians.

"Only a couple of housing projects is not going to defeat Hamas. You need to do a lot ... to have an effect," he said.

The UAE, which established diplomatic relations with Israel in 2020 under a Trump-brokered accord, sees Hamas and other political Islamist groups as threats to Middle East stability.

The four diplomats doubted whether Palestinians would move in large numbers to areas under Israeli control and questioned whether the proposals risked a permanent division of Gaza .

But unlike the U.S. initiative, the Emiratis had identified a site where no homes previously existed, the diplomats said.

The Israeli military controls about 53% of Gaza, including its southernmost area that encompasses the ruined city of Rafah. Hamas controls the rest of the territory, where nearly all of Gaza's two million Palestinians are living in crowded tent camps and amid the rubble of destroyed neighbourhoods.

Foreign diplomats and aid workers say that humanitarian aid and shelter should be directed to areas where there are many people. About 20,000 Palestinians are thought to be inhabiting areas of Gaza under Israeli military control, diplomats say.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 17:26:49 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/74456BJTOJNB3CSYVWT4HHFDEE.jpg?auth=121c22dff096495c25fb9110b53f6e314b5b4d01387651906dfde9d9bfabede9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Taiwan risks becoming numb to China drills, but threat is urgent, defence minister says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/taiwan-risks-becoming-numb-china-drills-threat-is-urgent-defence-minister-says-2026-02-05/</link><description>TAIPEI, Feb 6 (Reuters) - Taiwanese people are at risk of becoming "numb" to China's daily military and other pressure tactics to wear down the island, but the threat is real and greater readiness is needed, Defence Minister Wellington Koo said.

China, which views democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory, sends its warplanes and warships into the skies and waters around the island on a daily basis. It held its latest war games near Taiwan in late December.

Speaking to reporters this week, in comments that were embargoed until Friday, Koo said over the past year, China has used military pressure, cyberattacks and psychological warfare against Taiwan through more "complex and precise actions."

The number of detected Chinese military aircraft, including fighters and drones, rose 23% in 2025 from a year earlier, as China tries to push the narrative that the Taiwan Strait is an "internal" Chinese waterway, he added.

"When such actions are repeated over and over, we worry that it can easily numb the public," Koo said. "But in fact, this kind of enemy threat exists urgently and realistically."

Taiwan's government rejects Beijing's sovereignty claims, saying only the island's people can decide their future.

While Taiwan will neither escalate nor provoke, its military is strengthening its preparedness by carrying out combat-oriented exercises, increasing the effectiveness of its reserve forces and boosting purchases of new weapons, he added.

The ministry is also looking at how to use emerging technologies like artificial intelligence for military purposes with its new defence innovation team, Koo said.

Mentioning an ongoing issue with delayed deliveries of U.S. weapons due to supply chain and capacity problems, Koo said production has "gradually returned to normal," while the U.S. is making the administrative process for purchases easier and quicker.

But Taiwan's opposition, which has a majority in Parliament, has stalled President Lai Ching-te's proposed $40 billion in extra defence spending , and has instead advanced its own proposal which is much smaller and does not fund all the U.S. arms purchases.

Koo said that investing in defence is investing in peace and that senior military officers, including Strategic Planning Director Huang Wen-chi, have been meeting with members of the media and talking to lawmakers to explain the government's spending plans.

"Facing today's rapidly changing international situation and increasingly complex security environment, we firmly believe that only by helping ourselves can others help us; national security must be held in our own hands," he said.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 17:26:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CRZJRM6FLFKD5FKNWO4INDLJ64.jpg?auth=878087d831188a0b8d85895b4bfedd06dde7f8769c186a3824c1ba73c23ad42b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>France places two Chinese nationals under investigation for spying</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260205-france-places-two-chinese-nationals-under-investigation-for-spying</link><description>French authorities on Thursday charged four people, including two Chinese nationals, on suspicion of having intercepted sensitive military data for Beijing, the Paris prosecutor's office said.

The move comes after police arrested the four individuals at the weekend in the southwestern Gironde region where the two Chinese suspects allegedly rented an Airbnb as part of a plan to capture sensitive information, including military intelligence.

The Paris prosecutor's office said two individuals have been remanded into custody and two others placed under judicial supervision, without offering details on their identities.

The probe focuses on the "delivery of information to a foreign power" likely to harm key national interests. This is punishable by up to 15 years behind bars.

The case was triggered after residents on January 30 spotted the installation of a satellite dish approximately two metres (around six-and-a-half feet) in diameter, which coincided with a local internet outage.

A search conducted the following day led to the discovery of "a system of computers connected to satellite dishes enabling the capture of satellite data", according to the prosecutor's office.

The set-up made it possible to intercept "exchanges between military entities", it said.

The two Chinese nationals had allegedly travelled to France with the intent to capture data from the Starlink satellite internet system and other "entities of vital importance" and transmit it back to China .

Their visa applications stated that they worked as engineers for a research and development company specialising in wireless communication equipment.

The two other suspects were arrested over allegations they illegally imported the equipment, the prosecutor's office said, without adding details of their identities.

In a separate case, a French applied mathematics professor was in December charged with allowing a Chinese delegation to visit sensitive sites in a case of suspected espionage . The engineering institute where he works has been partially designated as a "restricted area" since 2019.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 17:27:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/ada71500-02aa-11f1-925c-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/000-84QB4DA.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Saudi Arabia deploys cash and clout in Yemen after ousting UAE</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/saudi-arabia-deploys-cash-clout-yemen-after-ousting-uae-2026-02-05/</link><description>MUKALLA, Yemen/RIYADH - After pushing the United Arab Emirates out of Yemen late last year, Saudi Arabia is deploying political capital and billions of dollars in a bid to bring its southern neighbor more firmly under its control, a sign of Riyadh reasserting itself regionally after years of prioritizing a domestic agenda, six officials told Reuters.

It’s a formidable challenge. The wealthy Gulf kingdom is trying to bring together fractious armed groups and tribes while also propping up a collapsed state through major cash injections, with an unresolved conflict with Houthi rebels in north Yemen held at bay by a fragile truce - just as Riyadh faces a budget crunch at home.

The kingdom is budgeting nearly $3 billion this year to cover salaries for Yemeni forces and civil servants, according to four Yemeni and two Western officials, who said it included roughly $1 billion earmarked for salaries for southern fighters once paid by Abu Dhabi.

"Saudi Arabia has cooperated with us and expressed its readiness to pay all salaries in full," Yemeni Information Minister Muammar Eryani told Reuters in an interview, without providing a total figure. Eryani said the Saudi support would allow Yemen to reorganise the armed factions and bring them under state authority.

Riyadh wants a success story in the parts of Yemen controlled by the internationally recognized government that it backs, which is in exile from the Houthi-controlled capital Sanaa, the officials said.

It hopes that will pile pressure on the Iran-aligned Houthis, who control roughly a third of the country, to come to the table for talks, while building up Yemen’s government forces in case a military confrontation is necessary, all the sources said.

The kingdom has also dangled political carrots, telling Yemeni secessionists that their long-held dream of a separatist state could become reality - once the conflict with the Houthis is resolved, three of the officials said.

Saudi’s overall financial package for Yemen and the openness it has signaled to a separatist state have not been previously reported. Most of the seven officials Reuters spoke to in the Yemeni port city of Mukalla and in the Saudi capital requested anonymity to discuss policies that have not been publicly announced.

The Saudi government media office, as well as the Yemeni government, did not respond to requests for comment, including about the financial numbers or conversations about a pathway to a new state. Reuters could not independently verify what Saudi officials told their Yemeni counterparts about these policies.

In response to Reuters questions sent to the UAE government media office, an official said the UAE had dedicated "signficant resources" over more than a decade to improving security and humanitarian conditions in Yemen. After withdrawing its forces from Yemen last year, the UAE "is no longer involved in the Yemeni file in any aspect," the official said.

As well as the new stance in Yemen, Riyadh is playing a more active role in post-Assad Syria and in Sudan , another arena for its rivalry with the UAE, a shift from years dedicated to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's Vision 2030 domestic drive to modernise the Kingdom.

Although Saudi finances are already stretched – with low oil prices slowing down massive gigaprojects – it cannot afford a security risk next door, said Farea al-Muslimi, research fellow at Chatham House's Middle East and North Africa Program.

Instability in Yemen, with whom the Kingdom shares a 1,800km (1,000 mile) border, could derail its plans to attract foreign visitors and investment at home, Muslimi said. Houthi attacks on Saudi energy infrastructure in 2022 were quickly followed by the ceasefire.

Yasmine Farouk, Gulf project director at the International Crisis Group think-tank, said Saudi Arabia would prioritize the allocation of resources to Yemen because "it is now the sole owner of this problem.”

Saudi Arabia first intervened in Yemen in 2015, leading a loose coalition of Sunni states including the UAE against the Shi’ite Houthis, who had seized the capital the previous year.

Riyadh and Abu Dhabi both supported Yemen’s internationally-recognized government, as well as factions divided over whether their country should splinter into the northern and southern states that existed before a 1990 unification.

After years of fighting that triggered one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises , the 2022 truce has held, despite regional escalation tied to the Israel-Gaza war that saw the Houthis fire on Red Sea shipping.

In December, Emirati-backed separatists launched a surprise assault against Saudi-backed forces - a rare public display of an intensifying rivalry between the two Sunni powerhouses.

In response, Riyadh bombed an Emirati military shipment in Yemen, ordered Emirati forces to leave the country and supported a counter-attack against the UAE-backed separatist Southern Transitional Council.

Riyadh then shifted to a charm offensive, inviting STC figures to Riyadh for talks in early January. At first, Saudi officers confiscated their phones and questioned them for two days about the attack, according to three people familiar with the events.

But in the weeks since, Riyadh moved the separatists into five-star hotels in Saudi Arabia, paying their expenses and offering to fly in some of their families, the three people said.

"It's good to be on the winning side, even if you were the loser," one separatist official told Reuters.

The Saudi government did not answer Reuters questions about the sources' accounts of these events.

The Kingdom already paid Saudi-aligned fighters. It recently began funding hundreds of thousands of state workers and tens of thousands of STC fighters, the same men who attacked Saudi-backed forces in December and were paid by Abu Dhabi, according to the six officials.

Saudi's total bill for salaries, other development projects and energy support to Yemen could exceed $4 billion this year alone, two of the officials said.

"There is now one captain for this ship instead of multiple. That should mean it is less likely to sink," said one of the Western officials, who is familiar with the developments.

The official said Riyadh was now “buying loyalty and stability, but everyone is wondering whether they will sustain it.”

POLITICAL CARROTS - AND STICKS

The Kingdom wants to unify southern Yemen’s divided factions into a single Saudi-led military structure to prevent state fracture . It would also serve to build pressure on the Houthis, the six officials said.

"Saudi Arabia is seeking a better internal ordering within the anti-Houthi coalition—an ordering that would allow the Kingdom to present a stronger front in negotiations with the Houthis. This is why the stakes are so high," said Farouk, the analyst.

To incentivize support, Saudi Arabia has told secessionists that they can have their own state so long as other Yemenis agree - likely via a referendum - and they deal with the Houthi problem first, two of the Yemeni officials and one of the Western officials said.

A Yemeni separatist official said Riyadh told them the south’s fate was up to them. “But nothing can happen till the Houthis are dealt with," that official said.

Riyadh hosted a January conference of southerners where they flew the separatist flag, according to a Reuters reporter at the event. The move was seen as a magnanimous gesture by Saudi designed to draw the cause away from Abu Dhabi, Yemeni officials in attendance told Reuters.

Saudi Arabia has also used sticks.

It found Yemeni Defense Minister's Mohsen al-Daeri's perceived lack of opposition to the STC's offensive as tantamount to betrayal, according to three people briefed on Saudi's view of him. Daeri was dismissed and Saudi authorities detained him in Riyadh for weeks in January, two of those people said. He has since been moved to a hotel and has been welcoming some visitors, they said.

The Yemeni government, and the Saudi government’s media office did not respond to requests for comment about the allegations made by the sources. Reuters could not immediately reach Daeri for comment.

Riyadh has told some interlocutors it hopes to see the conflict in Yemen resolved by the end of this year, according to two Yemeni officials. Information Minister Eryani told Reuters he hoped military operations would cease by the end of 2026.

But Muslimi, the Chatham House expert, sees the deadline as ambitious and aimed at applying pressure on Yemeni forces to get their house in order.

Yemenis remain divided over visions of a single or divided state, and there is resistance among various separatist factions to Saudi plans to create a unified military command.

Muslimi said it could take up to five years for parties to negotiate and hold a referendum on the south’s fate.

Dismantling an entrenched, decade-old war economy in one of the world’s poorest countries could take even longer.

For a decade, Yemeni teacher Mohammad Al-Akbari has watched co-workers and students alike leave school to join armed groups backed by either Abu Dhabi or Riyadh.

Akbari’s monthly salary remains about $30. An 18-year-old fighter still earns at least $250.

"When we teach the kids, they say, what am I supposed to do with this education?" he told Reuters in the Yemeni port city of Mukalla.

"The most dangerous thing facing Yemen today is the impossibility to imagine a peaceful life outside of militarism and war and fighting," Muslimi said.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 18:11:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Slovak prosecutor ends probe over fighter jets, air defence systems donated to Ukraine</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/slovak-prosecutor-ends-probe-over-fighter-jets-air-defence-systems-donated-2026-02-05/</link><description>PRAGUE, Feb 5 (Reuters) - A Slovak prosecutor on Thursday shut down investigations initiated by Prime Minister Robert Fico's government claiming that donations of fighter jets and air defence systems by the previous administration to Ukraine were a crime .

Bratislava regional prosecutor Rastislav Remeta said that the dozen Soviet-era MiG-29 jets and the S-300 and KUB air defence systems donated to Ukraine were outdated, not fully operational and lacked missiles as well as pilots. He said their donation was no crime, as alleged by Fico and his aides.

"In the context of the time, value, report by (national auditors), information available, it was not proven that the government had violated fiduciary duties," Remeta told a televised news conference.

The previous government led by Eduard Heger and including Defence Minister Jaroslav Nad aided Ukraine in its defence against Russia's invasion , donating equipment in return for a pledge of compensation from NATO allies.

When the Moscow-friendly, leftist-nationalist Fico returned to power in late 2023, he halted government military aid for Ukraine, although he allowed growing commercial sales to continue.

A senior defence official in Fico's party said last year he suspected the donations by Nad were "the crime of sabotage, or treason, abuse of power and fiduciary duties". Fico said the donation compromised Slovakia's own air defence abilities.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 18:12:56 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ZDERENYGWJKWLP2WAKVV7RT3PQ.jpg?auth=11130e6d6c0b09686b27e967389bc85d419380dce6af9e99d2b446d6ba876204&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>No credible threats to Milano Cortina Games, U.S. security official says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sports/no-credible-threats-milano-cortina-games-us-security-official-says-2026-02-05/</link><description>MILAN, Feb 5 (Reuters) - There are no credible security threats to the Milano Cortina Games, a top U.S. security official told Reuters in Milan on the eve of the opening ceremony for the Winter Olympics.

"Right now we are not tracking any credible threats," Tim Ayers, director of the U.S. State Department's Diplomatic Security Service (DSS) Major Events Coordination Division, said in an interview on Thursday.

Ayers said the number one concern when securing a large event like the Olympics was a "lone wolf attack."

"That's something where some actor decides to do something one day. There's no prior planning, they just decide to do something. That's always a concern," he said.

"Fortunately the plan the Italians have put forward as far as concentric rings of security, shutting down streets, valid checks at all the places - that pretty much holds back on that concern."

Drones , especially for a Games that is taking place across such a large geographical area, are another concern, but he said Italy's airspace was well controlled by central and local governments.

"Although drones are always a concern everywhere, I think the plan the Italians have put forth is pretty strong to hold back drones," he said.

Cyber attacks also rank high on the list of potential security risks.

"Cyber attacks are always a concern. Every network, whether it's MiCo26, the Italian government, whatever it might be, they are probably seeing up to 1,000 DDoS - distributed denial-of-service attacks - each day," he said.

"But once again I believe the Italians are pretty much up to task in stopping those attacks."

Several political and environmental protests are scheduled to take place in the coming days and Ayers said that he was confident in DSS's ability to safeguard American athletes and tourists in Italy for the Games.

"With the protests we try to find out that information as early as possible," he said.

"Ninety five percent of the protests that happen in Italy have to be registered with the government, so they are either registered or people are talking about them on social media, so we find out about them."

DSS will first try to navigate American athletes away from the area where the protests are taking place but if that's not possible, he said Italian security forces and police have plenty of experience in dealing with those situations.

"The Italians are steady hands when it comes to protests. They've seen them before and they'll see them again. They know exactly what to do," he said.

"There have been several protests in the past year right here outside the U.S. Consulate in Milan. The Italians every time have held back the protest and channeled them into where they are supposed to be and controlled it.

"We have no reason to believe they won't do the same thing here."

Opening Ceremony for the Games will be held on Friday at Milan's San Siro stadium.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 18:13:17 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/FX5KIJ2VOZN6NGJ7CSH5MNQDVE.jpg?auth=9bd26ad151fd88f8645a93b64ea033864063fa42dc8b4d0748d0e5a831a0cb07&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump defends Noem, Gabbard and Bondi at National Prayer Breakfast</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-defends-noem-gabbard-bondi-national-prayer-breakfast-2026-02-05/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Feb 5 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump defended three members of his cabinet whose actions have drawn scrutiny and touted U.S. military strength in a free-wheeling speech on Thursday at the annual National Prayer Breakfast in Washington.

Trump frequently strayed off the teleprompter in remarks to religious leaders and lawmakers, pushing themes of law and order and American might abroad in a speech that he could easily have given at one of his ubiquitous political rallies.

He warned Hamas fighters in Gaza to disarm or face consequences, promoted first lady Melania Trump's new documentary and praised El Salvador President Nayib Bukele, who has championed a mega-prison called CEGOT where the United States has sent hundreds of mostly Venezuelan migrants.

In one of his few religious references, he quoted the biblical verse "blessed are the pure in heart" and wondered if he would qualify. "I'm not sure that applies to me necessarily," he said. "Does that apply to me? I try."

He also mused about his chances of going to heaven, saying "I really think I probably should make it" while noting he was "not a perfect candidate."

Trump rejected calls to fire Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who drew criticism after federal officers shot and killed two Americans protesting Trump's tough migrant deportation policies in Minnesota.

"Why would I do that?" he said, touting Noem's enforcement of the U.S. southern border and crime-fighting efforts.

The backlash from the killings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti in Minneapolis prompted Trump to put White House border czar Tom Homan in charge of operations in Minnesota in place of Noem. Trump told NBC News on Wednesday that a "softer touch" was needed there.

Trump also defended his director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, who was present for an FBI raid on an election facility in Georgia as part of Trump's ongoing quest to raise doubts about the vote in the 2020 presidential election that he lost to Democrat Joe Biden.

Claims of voting fraud in the 2020 presidential election have been rejected by courts, state governments and members of Trump's own former administration.

Gabbard, whose position typically concerns threats from abroad, wrote in a letter to lawmakers dated Monday that she observed FBI personnel executing a search warrant in Atlanta's Fulton County and was present there for a "brief period of time."

"She's doing a great job," Trump said of Gabbard and hinted of a Russian role in election tampering.

He also praised Attorney General Pam Bondi, who he said had sent Gabbard to Atlanta.

"Pam wanted her to do it," he said.

Trump expressed happiness with events in Venezuela after the U.S. military abducted and arrested President Nicolas Maduro in Caracas last month and seized control of that country's oil.

He said he is now working with acting president Delcy Rodriguez and said he is "getting along fantastically" with Venezuela.

Trump, who has assembled a large military force in the Middle East and could unleash it against Iran, extolled the strength of the U.S. military.

"We have a military where they all look like Tom Cruise, only bigger," he said.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 18:13:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/H6AT3TJRJRPCVAJADPR6BIWEVY.jpg?auth=65941047ce61ef4f44f29a552aeab65a1e710e509aa439bc5893cbdc522df7c6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>World Economic Forum investigates its CEO over Epstein links</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/world-economic-forum-investigates-its-ceo-over-epstein-links-2026-02-05/</link><description>ZURICH, Feb 5 (Reuters) - The World Economic Forum has launched an independent investigation into its CEO Borge Brende to clarify his relationship with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, the organisation said on Thursday.

The Geneva-based organiser of the Davos summit said it was looking into disclosures from the U.S. Justice Department that showed Brende had had three business dinners with Epstein and had also communicated with the disgraced financier via email and text message.

"In light of these interactions, the Governing Board requested the Audit and Risk Committee to look into the matter, which subsequently decided to initiate an independent review," the WEF said in a statement.

"This decision underscores the Forum's commitment to transparency and maintaining its integrity," it added.

The WEF said Brende, a former Norwegian foreign minister who has been CEO since 2017, fully supported the review, which he had requested himself.

Brende said in a statement he met Epstein in 2018 at a dinner in New York that he had been invited to by former Norwegian Deputy Prime Minister Terje Rod-Larsen.

Brende said he attended two similar dinners in 2019 with Epstein along with diplomats and business leaders, but these events, along with "a few emails and SMS messages" were the full extent of their interaction.

"I was completely unaware of Epstein's past and criminal activities," Brende said in the statement, adding the he regretted not conducting a more thorough investigation into Epstein before meeting him.

"Had I known about his background, I would have declined the initial invitation to join Rod-Larsen and any subsequent dinner invitations or other communications," Brende added.

He will continue his duties as CEO while outside counsel carry out the investigation, the WEF said.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 18:13:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/J5Y6YUUFBNLFZGHBJ6DJ3QKA4Y.jpg?auth=d9ff820ff57ffc687c55af1fe9e5696984bfb4aa80b239398e65802cedb2b45e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israel charges brother of Shin Bet’s chief for smuggling goods into Gaza</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260205-israel-charges-brother-of-shin-bet-chief-for-smuggling-goods-into-gaza</link><description>Prosecutors on Thursday filed charges against the brother of the head of Israel 's domestic intelligence agency for offences including "assisting the enemy in wartime", over the alleged smuggling of cigarettes into besieged Gaza.

Israel controls the entry of all goods and people into the Palestinian territory, where humanitarian conditions remain dire despite a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas which came into effect on October 10.

Bezalel Zini, the brother of Shin Bet chief David Zini, is charged along with other defendants with "assisting the enemy in wartime, performing transactions in property for terrorist purposes, obtaining something by fraud under aggravated circumstances, and taking bribes", the justice ministry said.

"A central category of prohibited goods smuggled into the Strip was tobacco and cigarettes, which have put a total of hundreds of millions of shekels into Hamas's coffers since the start of the war," the ministry added in a statement.

Bezalel Zini, a reservist in the Israeli military, is suspected of smuggling approximately 14 cartons of cigarettes into Gaza on three occasions, for which he received 365,000 shekels (around $117,400).

Two other defendants were indicted along with Zini on Thursday.

The smuggling was carried out "by misleading soldiers at the crossings into the Strip, and by presenting a false situation as if the defendants were entering as part of their military service for security purposes", the statement added.

It forms part of a wider smuggling network which the justice ministry described as a "serious case of organised, systematic, and sophisticated smuggling of various goods into the Gaza Strip for profit", which began in the summer of 2025, when war was still raging in Gaza.

Prosecutors on Wednesday filed charges against 12 individuals and a company in connection with the case.

A justice ministry statement on Wednesday said the smuggled goods were worth millions of shekels and included cartons of cigarettes, iPhones, batteries, car parts and more.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 18:14:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/38674562-02b4-11f1-aa79-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/000-34KR7ZZ.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran's foreign minister heads to Muscat for nuclear talks with US</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/irans-foreign-minister-heads-muscat-nuclear-talks-with-us-2026-02-05/</link><description>Feb 5 (Reuters) - Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi has departed for the Omani capital Muscat at the head of a diplomatic delegation for nuclear talks with the U.S. due to be held on Friday, the Iranian Foreign Ministry's spokesperson said.

Iran will engage in the talks "with authority and with the aim of reaching a fair, mutually acceptable and dignified understanding on the nuclear issue," the spokesperson Esmail Baghaei said on Thursday.

"We hope the American side will also participate in this process with responsibility, realism and seriousness," Baghaei added.

The case exposed the dangers firms face when operating in Mexico, particularly in the tourist and industrial hub that props up a multi-billion-dollar sector but is also plagued by cartel violence.

Authorities said Mayor Diego Rivera was detained during federal raids alongside the town's security director and the heads of public works and the land registry. The group led a corruption ring that targeted beer and tequila producers in the municipality, Security Minister Omar Garcia Harfuch said.

The world's largest tequila producer, Becle (CUERVO.MX) , opens new tab , was targeted by their scheme, investigators said in December. The Jose Cuervo producer filed a complaint accusing the mayor's administration of imposing an exorbitant property tax up to 20 times the legal rate and a fine of more than 60 million pesos ($3.45 million) while withholding permits and attempting to shutter one of its plants.

State authorities intervened, with the Jalisco governor saying at least 10 companies had filed complaints against the local administration.

Becle did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Tequila Regulatory Council said it did not have a position on the matter.

Officials allege Rivera's network was not only extorting businesses but also diverting public funds and collaborating with the CJNG, one of Mexico's most powerful and violent criminal organizations.

Rivera had previously drawn scrutiny after a local concert featured projected images of the cartel's fugitive leader, Nemesio Oseguera "El Mencho."

Tensions in relations between the United States and European allies , and uncertainty over how transatlantic ties will look in coming months and years, made some countries hesitant to sign joint agreements, several attendees and delegates said.

The pledge underscores growing concern among some governments that rapid advances in artificial intelligence could outpace rules around its military use, raising the risk of accidents, miscalculation or unintended escalation.

Governments are facing a "prisoner's dilemma", caught between putting responsible restrictions in place and not wanting to limit themselves in comparison with adversaries, said Dutch Defence Minister Ruben Brekelmans.

"Russia and China are moving very fast. That creates urgency to make progress in developing AI. But seeing it going fast also increases the urgency to keep working on its responsible use. The two go hand-in-hand," he said in comments to Reuters.

Only 35 countries out of 85 attending the Responsible AI in the Military Domain (REAIM) summit in A Coruna, Spain, on signed a commitment to 20 principles on AI on Thursday.

These included affirming human responsibility over AI-powered weapons, encouraging clear chains of command and control, and sharing information on national oversight arrangements "where consistent with national security".

The document also outlined the importance of risk assessments, robust testing and training and education for personnel operating military AI capabilities.

At two prior military AI summits in The Hague and Seoul in 2023 and 2024 respectively, around 60 nations, excluding China but including the United States, endorsed a modest "blueprint for action" without legal commitment.

While this year's document was also non-binding, some were still uncomfortable with the idea of endorsing more concrete policies, said Yasmin Afina, a researcher at the U.N. Institute for Disarmament Research, an adviser on the process.

Major signatories on Thursday included Canada, Germany, France, Britain, the Netherlands, South Korea and Ukraine.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 19:15:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/3XL5ES32YFP7LK4DINFJBT5ZCU.jpg?auth=fad5799e602d50c813d060b801340de8b358b0f8b90d15f767021c3d9e7e6f96&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Carney scraps Canada EV sales mandate, but earmarks funds to aid transition</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260205-carney-scraps-canada-ev-sales-mandate-but-earmarks-funds-to-aid-transition</link><description>Prime Minister Mark Carney on Thursday cancelled a mandate for all vehicles sold in Canada to be electric by 2035, while announcing a multi-billion-dollar plan to support EV production.

The announcement marked another departure from policies backed by his climate-focused predecessor Justin Trudeau , but Carney said he wanted to incentivize EV production while bolstering a Canadian auto industry hammered by US tariffs .

Since replacing Trudeau last year, Carney has also scrapped the former leader's carbon tax on individual households and advanced plans to build a new oil pipeline from Alberta to the Pacific coast – infuriating environmental groups.

Asked Thursday if he still considered Canada a leader in the fight against climate change , Carney said: "Absolutely."

He stressed his climate policies would be focused on "results and solutions".

Watch Donald Trump threatens 100% tariff on Ottawa

Trudeau had passed legislation mandating that 20 percent of vehicles sold this year be electric, with a 60 percent target by 2030 – benchmarks that faced criticism from automakers.

While he pivoted away from those mandates, Carney stressed that the future strength of Canada's auto industry required a transition to EVs.

"We know where the auto industry is headed. We're going to support that transition," he told reporters.

Carney said his goal was 75 percent EV sales by 2035, and a 90 percent target by 2040.

To get there, he has earmarked CAN$3 billion ($2.2 billion) "to help the auto industry adapt, grow and diversify to new markets", his office said in a statement.

Carney said his goal is to position "Canada to become a global leader in electric vehicle (EV) production".

Underlying the strategy was the need to prepare the Canadian sector for a future where the highly integrated North American auto sector is transformed by US tariffs, Carney said.

"There's no greater symbol of how closely the Canadian and American economies have been intertwined than automobiles," the prime minister said.

"The average car is built from parts that travel across our border up to eight times before landing on the showroom floor," he added, while warning: "That trade relationship that once was a great strength has now become a serious vulnerability."</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 19:15:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/6a561a76-02b9-11f1-b1e1-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/000-1B869X.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuela amnesty law would grant clemency to jailed protesters, draft shows</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/venezuela-amnesty-law-would-cover-political-protesters-return-assets-draft-shows-2026-02-05/</link><description>Feb 5 (Reuters) - An amnesty law being considered in Venezuela's legislature would grant immediate clemency to people jailed for participating in political protests or critiquing public figures, a draft of the law seen by Reuters on Thursday showed.

The bill would also return assets of those detained and cancel Interpol and other international measures previously issued by the government, allowing opposition figures in exile to return home.

Venezuela's opposition and human rights groups have said for years that the government has used detentions to stamp out dissent by politicians, members of the security services, journalists and activists, charging them arbitrarily with crimes like terrorism and treason. The government has always denied holding political prisoners.

The amnesty law , announced last week by interim president Delcy Rodriguez, would lead to hundreds of people being released if it were to be passed in its current form and would likely please the Trump administration, which has hailed prisoner releases.

Rodriguez, who took office after the U.S. captured and deposed President Nicolas Maduro last month, has been complying with U.S. demands on oil deals . The government has also been slowly releasing people classified as political prisoners by human rights groups and the country's opposition.

The bill is set to next be debated at the National Assembly, which is controlled by the socialist ruling party. Delcy Rodriguez's brother Jorge Rodriguez, the head of the assembly, is expected to read the bill's introduction at a Thursday session. It must be approved in two votes in order to pass.

The assembly has repeatedly passed laws in recent years that the government has said are meant to curb foreign influence and "fascism" in the country, including restrictions on the activities of NGOs and a ban from public office of people found to have promoted U.S. sanctions .

According to the draft, the amnesty will cover crimes committed between January 1, 1999, and the date that the law comes into force, and will be applied immediately to people who acted peacefully or who have health concerns. It would not provide amnesty for those convicted of human rights violations, war crimes, murder, corruption or drug trafficking.

Other alleged crimes, including instigation of illegal activity, resistance to authorities, property damage, rebellion, treason, and illegal carrying of weapons will all be covered by the amnesty if they were committed in the context of political protests, the draft said, specifying that it would include mass protests that rocked the country and led to deaths in 2007, 2014, 2017, 2019 and 2024.

Those latest marches, in 2024, took place after a contested election that Venezuela's opposition and international observers say the opposition roundly won. The government and judicial authorities backed Maduro, swearing him in for a third term.

The bill would also cover those accused of defamation if the act took place in the context of criticizing authorities.

The law would lift Interpol red notices and movement restrictions against people who have committed crimes covered by the amnesty, the draft said, "guaranteeing the safe and persecution-free return of Venezuelan citizens who are abroad."

Many members of the opposition and dissident former officials live in other countries to escape arrest warrants they say are politically motivated.

Also revoked by the law would be public office bans for political reasons and sanctions against media outlets.

Rights group Foro Penal says it has verified that 383 political prisoners have been freed since the government announced a new series of releases on January 8. It says more than 680 remain jailed, an updated count including prisoners whose fearful families had not previously reported their detentions.

The government has always denied holding political prisoners and says those jailed have committed crimes. Government officials have said the number of releases is nearly 900, but have not been clear about the timeline and appear to be including those freed in previous years.

Among the long-time advocates of releases and amnesty is Nobel Peace Prize winner and opposition leader Maria Corina Machado , who has several close allies imprisoned, including opposition politician Juan Pablo Guanipa and lawyer Perkins Rocha.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 19:58:08 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/2D5UZDB2TFMLTOFGDU3UTJHXYI.jpg?auth=fe398ce18d7a67d1752a43069219237a54242aaeb2d9fcfa1e547b74e67b39e3&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Italian police to get new arrest powers after Turin riot</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/italian-police-get-new-arrest-powers-after-turin-riot-2026-02-05/</link><description>ROME, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Italian police will be able to detain suspected troublemakers temporarily before street rallies to prevent them from spreading unrest under a new law-and-order decree adopted on Thursday by Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's rightist government.

The bill was drafted after a rally over the weekend by the hard-left in Turin in which more than 100 police officers were injured and nearly 30 protesters arrested, according to an interior ministry tally.

It was adopted on the eve of the opening ceremony for the February 6-22 Milano Cortina Winter Olympics . Officials have said they will be tightening security and preparing to deal with any protests against the presence of U.S. security officers .

"With the measures approved today we are strengthening the tools to prevent and combat widespread crime," Meloni said on X.

In Turin, some demonstrators threw bottles, stones and fireworks at police. Video footage showed an officer being attacked with sticks and a hammer.

Under the decree, which will come into force in the coming days, police will be able to hold suspected troublemakers in custody for up to 12 hours, to keep them away from protests.

The bill also includes measures against pickpockets, youth gangs, a ban on the sales of knives to minors, and greater self-defence guarantees for police officers and private citizens who respond to assaults.

The leader of the Green Left Alliance opposition party, Angelo Bonelli, said the bill was repressive and it would have been more effective to give the police more funds to fight crime.

He called preventive arrests "a serious violation of the constitutional right to demonstrate".

Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi rejected criticism of the new arrest powers, saying similar provisions existed in other European countries.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 19:59:04 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/URCAWODKFJJ5VNL4HR2A6UH4WM.jpg?auth=a6304f3830306a591e9f50234f0dae8b9fcc2c4bfbcaac7693d9c5c701da8ec9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>How a Jewish family’s Baghdad home became France’s rent-free embassy</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260205-how-jewish-family-baghdad-home-became-france-rent-free-embassy-iraq</link><description>Along the banks of the Tigris River, behind a gated compound, stands the French embassy in Baghdad , built in the 1930s for a seemingly very different purpose. It features columns, fountains, a swimming pool and enough bedrooms to accommodate more than a dozen people.

The house once belonged to the Lawees, a Jewish family who rented the property to France after fleeing anti-Semitism in Iraq. But for around 50 years, France has occupied the villa without paying rent – a situation recently upheld by a Paris court.

Brothers Ezra and Khedouri Lawee built the sprawling property – known within the family as Beit Lawee – in 1935, at a time when Iraq’s Jewish community numbered about 130,000. They lived there for about twenty years, eating fresh dates from the garden, playing tennis on the court next door, sleeping on the roof during sweltering summer nights.

“It was full of life,” said Philip Khassam, the 66-year-old grandson of one of the original owners. “There were parties, cousins everywhere.”

That world collapsed as regional tensions skyrocketed following the creation of the state of Israel in 1948. A couple of years later, in March 1950, the Iraqi government gave Jews one year to leave the country on condition they renounce their nationality. Nearly the entire Jewish population registered to depart, prompting a massive airlift known as Operation Ezra and Nehemiah .

The Lawee brothers moved to Canada , settling in Montreal, where they rebuilt their lives and became citizens. But the 3,800 m² residence in Baghdad, along with its 1,150 m² plot of land, remained part of their estate.

For about a decade, the property stood empty, watched over by a caretaker, before being rented in 1964 to the French government, which was seeking a new embassy site. To avoid political sensitivities, rent was paid partly in Iraqi dinars and partly in French francs.

The arrangement unravelled after the 1967 Six-Day War , which saw Israel rout the armies of its Arab neighbours. Iraq informed the French embassy that rent payments should be made to the Iraqi government instead, as it asserted state control over Jewish-owned properties.

France initially redirected only the dinar portion of the rent to Iraqi authorities while continuing to pay the family in francs, a move the family says implicitly acknowledged their ownership. In 1974, however, the French government stopped paying the Lawees altogether, amid a shift toward a more pro-Arab foreign policy .

The decision also proved financially advantageous, as court documents showed France paid Iraq only around 10 percent of the property’s market rent.

“For more than 50 years, France has saved roughly 90 percent of the market rent,” Khassam noted. “There is a legal term for that: unjust enrichment. ”

Even after the fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003, the family said France continued to occupy the property without compensation, despite requests to resume rent payments or allow the sale of the house.

The case resurfaced in recent years after Khassam began researching the property’s value, making cold calls around Baghdad and speaking to local real estate agents. He discovered that land scarcity in the Iraqi capital could place it in the millions of dollars.

In 2021, the family hired prominent French lawyers Jean-Pierre Mignard and Imrane Ghermi to pursue the claim.

“Property rights are a fundamental right in any democratic society,” Mignard told FRANCE 24. “And here, that right was denied for one simple reason: these people were Jewish and belonged to a religious community repudiated by today’s political Iraq.”

Earlier, a Paris court rejected the family’s $22 million lawsuit accusing France of unjustly profiting from discriminatory Iraqi policies that stripped Jews of their property. In a written ruling published on Monday, the court said the embassy’s contract “is not governed by French law and that it therefore does not have jurisdiction to settle the matter”, suggesting that Iraq would be the appropriate forum to resolve the dispute.

For Mignard, the ruling was both illogical and dangerous.

“I don’t even see how our clients could be authorised to enter Iraqi territory,” he said. “I don’t know what we could possibly argue before a court in Baghdad. This contract was governed by French law.”

He also pointed out to France’s own dark history. During the German occupation, the Nazi occupiers and the Vichy regime requisitioned what were called “Jewish properties”: apartments, hotels and artworks were seized after their owners were expelled.

Around 100,000 works of art were taken from France alone, according to the ministry of culture. In 2022, the French government passed a law to facilitate their restitution.

“That France could lose its memory to this extent and behave so poorly, simply because this Jewish property is located thousands of kilometres away, is frankly disgraceful,” Mignard said.

Khassam insisted the issue is neither political nor geopolitical.

“This has nothing to do with regional politics,” he said. “This is private property. Property rights are human rights.”

He also rejected the idea that ordinary Iraqis are hostile to the claim. “The people are not the problem,” Khassam said. “I’ve spoken to Iraqis in Baghdad. Jews were part of the fabric of that city. The issue is with governments, not people.”

The French foreign ministry, who did not respond to a request for comment, acknowledged in court filings that Iraqi legislation deprived Jewish owners of their real estate – yet relied on those very laws to justify continuing to occupy the house without paying the family.

“France is using an Iraqi law passed specifically to punish Jews in order to justify not paying Jewish owners,” Khassam said. “That is shameless.”

French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot visited Baghdad on Thursday and stayed overnight at the French embassy, according to the foreign ministry.

In a statement obtained by FRANCE 24, lawyers for the Lawee family said the French government “cannot hide behind a legal dispute that will take years in order to deny the rights of individuals excluded from their property for the sole reason that they were Jewish”.

The statement made a pointed reference to Barrot’s stay at the embassy, asking whether he felt that “the ground beneath the French Embassy in Baghdad is burning”.

The family plans to appeal the ruling.

“This is not a setback, it’s the beginning,” Khassam said. “If we fail, then France has failed in the eyes of the world, because it has trampled on its own laws and its own human-rights principles.”</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 19:59:58 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/c69991ee-02bb-11f1-a8c7-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/17-3.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump administration to end job protections for up to 50,000 federal workers</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-expand-his-control-over-federal-workers-2026-02-05/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Feb 5 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump will have more power to hire and fire up to 50,000 career federal employees in an overhaul of the government's civil service system announced by his administration on Thursday.

The overhaul, released by the Office of Personnel Management, fulfills Trump's campaign pledge to strip job protections from federal workers deemed by the president's team to be "influencing" government policy.

It is the biggest change to the rules governing the civil service in more than a century and targets employees that the administration sees as undermining the president's priorities. Trump called the overhaul "Schedule F" during his first administration.

"You can't run an organization if people are refusing to actually carry out the lawful objectives and orders of the administration," said OPM Director Scott Kupor, the administration's top HR official.

The rule will be scrutinized by a federal judge.

Federal worker unions and their allies sued in January to stop the policy before it was fully developed. Federal judges paused the litigation while the Trump administration finalized changes. A court challenge will resume in the coming days, said Skye Perryman of Democracy Forward, one of the groups behind the lawsuit.

"We will return to court to stop this unlawful rule and will use every legal tool available to hold this administration accountable," she said in a statement.

Trump will have the power to select which government positions will lose their job protections, according to the policy , opens new tab the Trump administration released on Thursday.

The Trump administration is also changing how long-standing legal protections that prohibit U.S. government agencies from retaliating against whistleblowers will be enforced, the OPM statement said.

Federal agencies will be in charge of setting up job protections for their own employees who accuse them of wrongdoing, such as violating the law or wasting money. That would be a change from the past, when an independent office known as the Office of the Special Counsel was charged with protecting whistleblowers from reprisal.

The Trump administration will require agency officials be "unbiased" when investigating accusations from whistleblowers that their employer retaliated against them, an OPM official told reporters on Thursday morning.

Reuters previously reported that the Trump administration was close to making this change.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 20:40:19 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/RGLJLBXRNNOCTABQA6UX3EX6UY.jpg?auth=d922a5c35ca84b9aa4a041a98df6d3168b14f04cc65acbaeee12f47fbb175386&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US watchdog to review high failure rate in FAA air traffic control training</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/us-watchdog-review-high-failure-rate-faa-air-traffic-control-training-2026-02-05/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Feb 5 (Reuters) - The U.S. Transportation Department Office of Inspector General said on Thursday it will open a probe into high failure rates among air traffic control trainees amid a long-standing shortage of controllers to manage U.S. air traffic.
