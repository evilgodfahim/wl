Rasmussen said Trump's insistence that Greenland - a semi-autonomous Danish territory - should become part of the United States represented the biggest challenge to NATO since its establishment in 1949.

"It's really the future of NATO that is at stake," said Rasmussen, who offers a unique perspective on the crisis as a former leader of both Denmark - from 2001 to 2009 - and NATO, where he served as secretary general from 2009 to 2014.

"The time for flattering is over. It doesn't work. The fact is Trump only respects force and strength. And unity. That's exactly what Europe should demonstrate right now," he told Reuters from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.

Rasmussen said he was not criticising leaders such as current NATO boss Mark Rutte, who has lavished praise on Trump. But he said it was time for a new approach from Europe.

He said the EU's Anti-Coercion Instrument - the so-called "bazooka" that confers broad powers to retaliate against economic pressure - should be on the table after Trump threatened tariffs on eight European nations until the U.S. is allowed to buy Greenland.

Trump says U.S. ownership of Greenland is vital for national security .

He told Norway's prime minister on Sunday, in an exchange of text messages , he had "done more for NATO than any other person since its founding, and now, NATO should do something for the United States".

Rasmussen proposed a three-point plan to defuse the crisis. It includes an update of a 1951 agreement between the United States and Denmark that allows U.S. forces and military bases on Greenland to include a strengthened NATO presence there.

It also includes an investment pact to help U.S. and European firms extract minerals in Greenland and "a stabilisation and resilience compact" to prevent Chinese and Russian investments in critical sectors there, he said.

Rasmussen said he had not presented the plan to Danish or other government officials but would discuss it with delegates in Davos.

"I hope that an infusion of something concrete could bring this whole discussion into a more constructive phase," he said.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 14:32:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/L2QKUTAUFZJYZNTX4R6E4X6VVQ.jpg?auth=51be4347a993c7ec60376486b118952fcec2482dbad925dba39bc1fe9caac489&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Supreme Court weighs Trump's firing of the Fed's Lisa Cook by social media</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/supreme-court-weighs-trumps-firing-feds-lisa-cook-by-social-media-2026-01-20/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 20 (Reuters) - In the battle over President Donald Trump 's effort to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook that is set to go before the U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday, the justices may focus on the president's use of social media to carry out this unprecedented action.

The justices are due to hear arguments over Trump's request to lift a lower court judge's decision barring ​him from firing Cook while her legal challenge to the removal continues. The justices in October agreed to hear the dispute, a decision , opens new tab that left Cook in her role for the time being.

Trump's prolific use ‌of social media is well-established. The Republican president long has used social media not only to voice opinions but also to announce major decisions and official government policies.

Here too, just after 8 p.m. last August 25, Trump posted to his Truth Social account a letter addressed to Cook informing her that "you are hereby removed" from the role of Fed governor. No president since the central bank's founding in 1913 has ousted a Fed governor.

That action, Cook and her lawyers argue, violated her rights under the U.S. Constitution's Fifth Amendment, which provides that no person may be "deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law."

The case, which could imperil the independence of the world's most important central bank, prominently tests whether Trump had adequate "cause" under federal law to remove Cook. But it also is a ‌fight over whether the way Trump sought to oust Cook was fair. Lower courts agreed with Cook that Trump's action likely was not.

The president has based his bid to ​fire Cook on allegations by Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte, a Trump appointee, that she committed mortgage fraud. Cook, who was appointed in 2022 by Democratic former President Joe Biden as the first Black woman to serve in the post, has denied the allegations.

Cook's lawyers contend that the allegations are a pretext to fire her based on her monetary policy stance. Trump has repeatedly demanded lower interest rates, also frequently lashing out at Fed Chair Jerome Powell for not doing so more quickly.

The Trump administration ‍this month opened a criminal investigation into Powell over remarks he made to Congress last year about a Fed building project, a move the central bank chair similarly called a pretext aimed at gaining more influence over interest rates.

In creating the Fed, Congress passed a law called the Federal Reserve Act that included provisions to shield the central bank from political interference, setting out that governors could be removed by a president only "for cause" - though the law does not define the term or establish procedures for removal.

Cook's case raises thorny questions concerning the scope of presidential power, the ⁠validity of Trump's decisions that impact the central bank, and the authority of the judiciary to second-guess the president.

But the case also offers the court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority and has backed Trump in numerous decisions since he returned to ‍the presidency last year, a way of deciding the case on procedural grounds that could leave some of those contentious, substantive questions to another day.

Cook's lawyers have said that Trump's letter on social media purporting to fire her without either notice in advance or an ‌opportunity to respond ‌to the allegations did not satisfy the constitutional requirements of due process.

"One way for the court to side with Cook would be to say that the process she received - generally characterized in such cases as notice and an opportunity to be heard - was insufficient," said Jane Manners, a professor at Fordham Law School in New York who has studied the history of laws governing officer removal.

Although it is not entirely clear what kind of hearing would be required, Manners said legal precedents in this area show that removals need to follow a "judicial-type hearing involving the presentation of evidence and testimony, including from the officeholder."

Trump's Justice Department urged the Supreme Court to reject Cook's argument, contending that a government officer's position is not a form of property protected ⁠by the Constitution's due process provision.

"Officers exercise significant government power, ⁠and no individual has a property right to such ​power," the administration said in its written filing.

Even if the due process provision does protect someone in Cook's position, the administration said Trump gave her the required notice when on August 20 he referenced on social media Pulte's referral of the mortgage allegations to the Justice Department for criminal investigation, writing, "Cook must resign, now!!!"

Trump also gave her an opportunity to respond given that he did not post his letter firing her until five days later, the administration added.

"Cook had an opportunity to explain why no misconduct occurred, and she spurned it," the filing ‍stated.

Cook sued Trump in August after the president announced he would remove her.

U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb in September temporarily blocked Trump from carrying out his directive, ruling that he likely violated Cook's due process rights and that the mortgage allegations likely were not a legally sufficient cause to remove her under the Federal Reserve Act as they relate to conduct that occurred before she was confirmed to the post by the Senate.

The Washington-based judge called it "doubtful that Cook should have been required to piece together the evidentiary basis for a 'for cause' removal from a scattered assortment of social media ​posts and news articles."

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit refused Trump's bid to put Cobb's order on hold, prompting ‍the administration to seek the Supreme Court's intervention.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 14:33:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CHCF2OEAL5OTHKNAHBXKWATQFQ.jpg?auth=758c4cb558a63307c437636db9150be3cb3093ec46ab755f2867731757e261e5&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UAE becomes early supporter of Trump’s ‘Board of Peace’ with formal acceptance</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/uae-becomes-early-supporter-trumps-board-peace-with-formal-acceptance-2026-01-20/</link><description>DUBAI, Jan 20 (Reuters) - The United Arab Emirates (UAE) accepted an invitation to join U.S. President Donald Trump's newly proposed “Board of Peace,” the UAE foreign ministry said on Tuesday, placing Abu Dhabi among the first governments to publicly endorse the initiative.

The ministry said the UAE stood ready to “contribute actively to the mission of the Board of Peace, supporting greater cooperation, stability, and prosperity for all,” marking Abu Dhabi's formal alignment with Washington’s new conflict‑resolution effort.

Abu Dhabi's acceptance comes as governments worldwide react cautiously to Trump’s plan, which aims to begin with the Gaza conflict before widening to tackle other conflicts, according to a copy of the letter and draft charter seen by Reuters.

Some leaders offered ambiguous responses. Italy’s Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said her country was “ready to do our part,” while Canada’s Prime Minister Mark Carney said Ottawa had agreed “in principle” pending further details.

The inclusion of a 'charter' in the invitation letter triggered concerns among some European governments that it could undermine the work of the United Nations, which Trump has accused of not supporting his efforts to end conflicts around the world.

The board would be chaired for life by Trump. Member states would be limited to three-year terms unless they pay $1 billion each to fund the board's activities and earn permanent membership, the letter states.

"This simply offers permanent membership to partner countries who demonstrate deep commitment to peace, security, and prosperity," the White House said in a post on X.

Hungary has also issued an unequivocal acceptance, while most governments have refrained from public comment, voicing concerns privately about the plan’s implications for the U.N.’s authority.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 14:34:33 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/FESITBFK6NKS7COIIJJRREJRDU.jpg?auth=58c129a3ee3d321a351bd0013d08dfd1414d7c4a8716add7a91f58bee46c55a3&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UK's China embassy gamble shows changing calculations in divided West</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uks-china-embassy-gamble-shows-changing-calculations-divided-west-2026-01-20/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 20 (Reuters) - By approving China's plans for a mega-embassy in London , British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has gambled on winning closer trade ties and investment from China at the risk ​of angering politicians in Britain and the United States.

Beijing's desire to build China's biggest embassy in Europe in the heart of historic London had become a flashpoint in relations, testing ‌Britain's ability to navigate the security risks and trade potential of a relationship with China.

The government ignored warnings from British and U.S. politicians, local residents and British-based Hong Kong pro-democracy campaigners who said the new building could be used as a base for espionage and to intimidate Chinese dissidents.

Since taking office in 2024, Starmer has made reviving Britain's economy his priority and wants closer relations with China to boost foreign investment and deliver on an election pledge to improve living standards.

Some U.S. politicians objected to the new embassy location, near sensitive underground communication cables, questioning whether there would be security implications for one of Washington's partners in the Five ‌Eyes alliance with Canada, Australia and New Zealand.

"This will be seen for what it is, which is a base for hostile activity inside the United ​Kingdom," Tom Tugendhat, security minister in Britain's last Conservative government, told Reuters. "This is, I am afraid, further indication that this British government has no idea of the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) it is dealing with."

China has 146 registered diplomats in Britain, second to the United States, British government records show.

Opponents of China's plans to build a much bigger embassy say it will mean more ‍diplomatic staff and therefore more spies, with the new site serving as a symbol of China's power and as a warning.

Local residents said they would seek a legal challenge, saying Tuesday's decision would be unlawful if British officials privately gave China assurances the project would be approved before the planning process had been completed.

Six current and former British officials told Reuters most of the espionage fears were exaggerated or could be managed. They said the consolidation of ⁠China's existing diplomatic premises, spread across London, could make it easier to track suspected spies.

Two of the former officials said security services could typically look for the unexpected loss of signals within the ‍cables to see whether they were being tapped, other cables could be re-rerouted and sensitive information encrypted.

They said much of Beijing's spying activity was conducted from China, such as cyberattacks, and many of its spies work in business, ‌think tanks or ‌academia rather than at the embassy, where officials are easier to track.

China's embassy in London has accused British officials of exaggerating fears about Chinese spies and cyberattacks.

The embassy decision shows the trade-offs Britain faces navigating relations with China, a powerful adversary but possible source of economic help at a time when the U.S. - Britain's biggest single trading partner - has threatened to impose new tariffs as it tries to acquire Greenland.

Starmer is expected to travel to China this month, alongside a business delegation, after Beijing made clear the trip was conditional on approval for the new embassy, British and ⁠Chinese officials said.

Approval of the new embassy could ⁠leave Starmer vulnerable to criticism in Britain and ​alienate London's most powerful ally when opinion polls suggest he is Britain's least popular prime minister.

In a parliamentary debate last week, 30 members of the chamber spoke out against the embassy expansion plans. None spoke in favour.

Julian Lewis, a former chair of parliament's intelligence committee, said that in almost three decades in parliament he had never seen such an occasion "where every question asked on both sides of the House was deeply hostile".

Mike Johnson, Speaker ‍of the U.S. House of Representatives, is among U.S. politicians who have raised concerns about the embassy expansion.

Nicholas Eftimiades, a former U.S. intelligence officer and specialist on Chinese intelligence, said British security services might be underestimating the risks.

"The U.S. has intelligence capabilities several orders of magnitude larger than the UK and yet is unable to effectively counter China's intelligence collection," he said.

Hong Kong pro-democracy campaigners who fled the former British colony are among vocal opponents of expanding the embassy.

Chloe ​Cheung, who received a special British visa to move from Hong Kong and has a bounty on her head from ‍China on charges of incitement to secession, subversion and collusion with foreign forces that she denies, said she felt betrayed.

She said the new embassy with its Regency-style columned facade and huge flags would look like a little Chinese "castle" and send the message ​that "the Chinese government is very powerful", intimidating Chinese dissidents.

"I thought the UK would be a safe haven," she said.

The red caps resemble the "Make America Great Again" caps of Trump's supporters but feature slogans like "Make America Go Away" and "Already Great".

Store co-owner Michael said the caps had languished unsold for months before swiftly gaining popularity. "We only made one hundred to begin with," said Michael, who declined to give his surname. "When it went viral it was very, very popular."

Principal owner Jesper Rabe Tonnesen devised one of the caps' slogans, "Nu det NUUK" - a Danish pun that sounds like "Nu det nok," meaning "Now is enough," but substitutes the "nok" with "Nuuk," the capital of Greenland.

"I thought, 'How can you communicate in an easy way while putting your foot down?'," Tonnesen told Reuters, adding that he had distributed 300 caps by cargo bike at a protest held in Copenhagen on Saturday.

Tens of thousands of people rallied in Copenhagen and Nuuk at the weekend chanting "Greenland is not for sale" and marching to U.S. diplomatic posts, many of them wearing the protest caps.

Trump says Greenland is vital to U.S. security because of its strategic location and mineral deposits, and he has not ruled out using force to take control of the island. His threats have triggered a diplomatic crisis between the NATO allies.

"People have an urge to get out there with a message. We've just had enough and we're fed up, sad and tired," Tonnesen said.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 14:35:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ENYOGUYAQJK45LUTPW535PHLIQ.jpg?auth=fbd863de9fa374e6bb5da3924b24217c14c4381064605e6639b757459f683cc6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukraine to share wartime combat data with allies to help train AI</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/ukraine-share-wartime-combat-data-with-allies-help-train-ai-2026-01-20/</link><description>KYIV, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Ukraine will establish a system allowing its allies to train their artificial intelligence models on Kyiv's valuable combat data collected throughout the nearly four-year war with Russia, newly appointed Defence Minister Mykhailo Fedorov has said.

Fedorov - a former digitalisation minister who last week took up the post to drive reforms across Ukraine's vast defence ministry and armed forces - has described Kyiv's wartime data trove as one of its "cards" in negotiations with other nations.

Since Russia's invasion in February 2022, Ukraine has gathered extensive battlefield information, including systematically logged combat statistics and millions of hours of drone footage captured from above.

Such data is important for training AI models, which require large volumes of real-world information to identify patterns and predict how people or objects might act in various situations.

"Today, frontline data has extraordinary value," Fedorov told reporters in comments cleared for release on Tuesday, adding that there was demand for this data from allies. "We will build a system on which they can train their software products using our data."

Fedorov has previously said Ukraine was using AI technology from U.S. data analytics firm Palantir for both military and civilian applications.

Outlining his plans for the wartime defence ministry after his appointment, he said he wanted to "more actively" integrate allies into projects.

He said his team was receiving advice from the Center for Strategic and International Studies and RAND in the U.S., as well as Britain's Royal United Services Institute.

Fedorov also said Ukraine would test its homegrown replacement for China's DJI Mavic drone this month, which is widely used for aerial reconnaissance on the front lines by both sides. He did not disclose the manufacturer.

Ukraine has previously raised concerns about reliance on Beijing for drones and components, given China's deepening diplomatic ties with Russia.

"We will have our own Mavic analogue: the same camera, but with a longer flight range," Fedorov said.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 15:32:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/JS2HTGYCR5L33JOT6QF36LQCKE.jpg?auth=4895884458f75e5b711dbec60a76231180a2163944864053d6459368813ab62c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US Supreme Court does not issue ruling on Trump's tariffs</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us-supreme-court-does-not-issue-ruling-trumps-tariffs-2026-01-20/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 20 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court issued three decisions on Tuesday but did not decide the closely watched dispute over the legality of President Donald Trump 's global tariffs.

Fernando Grande-Marlaska told Reuters external processing centres, such as Italy’s plan to detain migrants in Albania , were "no magic solution" as they posed significant legal challenges and could strain relationships with third countries.

Meanwhile, Spain's strategy of working with transit nations before arrivals occur was proving effective, he said.

In contrast to many EU states tightening their immigration policies amid the rise of the far right, Spain's leftist government has been an outlier by treating migration as an economic asset, promoting legal immigration pathways , while simultaneously reducing irregular migration.

Irregular arrivals to Spain fell 42% last year - to around 36,000 compared to Italy’s little-changed 66,000.

"I believe that our figures and migration policy overall doubtlessly ... greatly strengthen Spain's role in defining migratory policy within the European Union," Grande-Marlaska said.

Denmark said last month that a majority of EU countries supported the processing of asylum requests "in safe third countries" to deter arrivals. The European Parliament is expected to restrict migration rules this year.

To bolster its strategy, Spain has increased its presence in West African nations Mauritania, Senegal and the Gambia— deploying nearly 100 police officers and various surveillance assets.

Rights groups, however, have said Spain's and the EU's support to West African countries to prevent migrants from boarding precarious boats to Spain's Canary Islands has led to abuses, notably in Mauritania where Spanish police were allegedly present during abusive detention of migrants, according to Human Rights Watch.

Grande-Marlaska said Spain had "not seen any illegal action or action against refugees' fundamental rights" and said Spain was working on beefing up its teams in Mauritania and Senegal and delivering more drones and vehicles to local forces.

Migrant arrivals to the Canaries fell 62% last year from record-breaking 2024 levels, Spanish data shows.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 15:34:10 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/SRM4P4J5ZFMRLDXYNWUVA6L34M.jpg?auth=925c134ab7b9adc9f19787f14abb8fdb0d1d2d83bccc45618f86195bca6a3765&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Norway won't take part in Trump's "Board of Peace", deputy foreign minister tells Aftenposten</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/norway-wont-take-part-trumps-board-peace-deputy-foreign-minister-tells-2026-01-20/</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 15:34:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>China says it drove away Philippine aircraft over disputed shoal</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-says-it-drove-away-philippine-aircraft-over-disputed-shoal-2026-01-20/</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 15:34:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Syrian government forces advance in northeast as Kurds vow to resist</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260120-syrian-government-forces-advance-in-northeast-as-kurds-vow-to-resist</link><description>Syrian government troops thrust deeper into areas held by Kurdish forces in northeastern Syria on Tuesday, Syrian military sources said, pressing rapid gains against Kurdish fighters who vowed to defend their remaining enclaves.

Government forces have this week taken swathes of northern and eastern Syria long held by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), once the main US ally in Syria, advancing President Ahmed al-Sharaa 's effort to bring all the country under centralised authority.

The swift reversal for the SDF along one of Syria's main faultlines marks the biggest shift in territorial control in Syria since Islamist fighters led by Sharaa toppled President Bashar al-Assad in 2024.

Amid reported clashes, three Syrian sources said the US-led coalition against the Islamic State (IS) group was negotiating for the government to take over an SDF-guarded camp housing thousands of civilians linked to the jihadist group near the town of al-Hol, close to the Iraqi border. The Syrian military said it was advancing on al-Hol.

The US military's Central Command did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.

One of the sources, a Syrian official, said talks were focused on a smooth transition to avoid any security risks or detainees fleeing.

The SDF had established control of a quarter or more of Syria during the 2011-2024 civil war , while fighting with the support of US troops against Islamic State.

The Syrian military sources said government troops had advanced on Tuesday in eastern areas of Hasakah province - where al-Hol is located - and south of the town of Kobani, also known as Ain al-Arab, which lies on the border with Turkey .

A spokesperson for the Syrian Kurdish YPG, the dominant component of the SDF, said "enemy forces were trying to advance" near al-Hol camp but Kurdish forces were maintaining a defensive line in the area. The spokesperson did not respond to a question about the advances reported near Kobani.

The SDF said it had inflicted heavy losses on government forces trying to advance on the village of Tel Baroud in Hasakah. Neither side announced overall casualty figures.

Earlier on Tuesday, the SDF reported four attacks at dawn by " Damascus factions" in areas near Kobani, saying the attacks had been repelled. "Our forces ... confirm their complete readiness to confront any aggression," the SDF said in a statement.

Tensions between the SDF and Damascus spilled into open conflict this month, including in Aleppo , after months of deadlock over the fate of the SDF's fighters and territory, with the Kurdish force resisting government demands that it fully dissolve into the defence ministry.

After days of fighting, the SDF said on Sunday it would withdraw its forces from the Arab-majority provinces of Raqqa and Deir al-Zor. On Monday, government forces pushed into the SDF-controlled Hasakah province, saying they had seized control of one of several jails holding Islamic State prisoners.

Reports indicated that SDF commander Mazloum Abdi and Sharaa held a rocky meeting on Monday, after Abdi's signature appeared on a 14-point agreement with the government.

YPG spokesperson Farhad Shami said claims of an agreement being reached were "lies".

"I believe that when Mazloum Abdi went to Damascus, he knew that this government would try again to force our people to surrender," Shami said in an interview with Kurdish broadcaster Rudaw on Monday evening.

"We have decided that we will defend ourselves even if we are alone," he said.

The United States, which has since established close ties with Sharaa under President Donald Trump , has been closely involved in mediation between the sides.

The government and the SDF have traded blame over the escape of IS group prisoners from a prison in the town of Shaddadi on Monday, with each accusing the other of releasing them.

The Syrian Interior Ministry said on Tuesday that about 120 IS group detainees escaped, 81 of whom had been recaptured. The Syrian government has said that it is now in control of the prison in Shaddadi.

The SDF has previously said it was guarding some 10,000 IS group fighters.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 15:34:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/27be6718-f611-11f0-a781-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26020518687801.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'Greenland tipped the balance': Macron and Trump's shifting relationship</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/greenland-tipped-the-balance-macron-and-trump-s-shifting-relationship</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 15:34:22 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/ee939a62-f610-11f0-ac0e-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260120-152347-153126-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>French opposition parties expected to file votes of no-confidence</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/french-opposition-parties-expected-to-file-votes-of-no-confidence</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 15:34:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/a6b167c0-f60f-11f0-9ec0-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260120-153214-153553-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>French PM forces part of budget bill through lower house without vote</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/french-pm-forces-part-budget-bill-through-lower-house-without-vote-2026-01-20/</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 16:38:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Turkey probing flag burning at protests along Syrian border</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/turkey-probing-flag-burning-protests-along-syrian-border-2026-01-20/</link><description>NUSAYBIN, Turkey, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Turkey said on Tuesday it was investigating the burning of its flag during protests along its border with Syria by pro-Kurdish groups, coinciding with clashes there between the Damascus government army and Kurdish-led forces.

Syrian government forces pushed deeper into northeast Syria's Kurdish-held areas on Tuesday after taking swathes of territory long held by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) this week, advancing President Ahmed al-Sharaa's effort to bring all the entire country back under centralised authority.

Ankara, the main foreign supporter of Sharaa's government, deems the SDF a terrorist organisation linked with outlawed Kurdish PKK militants in Turkey, and has repeatedly said the SDF must integrate into Syria's state apparatus under a 2025 accord.

Turkish authorities have been engaged in a peace process with the PKK for months under which it says the group - and its extensions - must lay down weapons and disband to end a four-decade PKK insurgency in Turkey.

Footage from the protests showed participants, whom Ankara said supported Kurdish militants, trying to climb fenced walls along the Turkish-Syrian border in the Nusaybin-Qamishli region, while some burned or tore down Turkish flags in the area and chanted slogans.

Police used water cannon and pepper spray in attempts to disperse the crowds, amid scuffles with some protesters.

Justice Minister Yilmaz Tunc said on X that prosecutors had launched inquiries into the events, while the defence ministry said investigations were underway against PKK supporters trying to cross the border illegally at Nusaybin.

"With this attack in question, it is evident that dark forces aiming to sabotage the goal of a terror-free Turkey have once again come into play. These attempts will neither weaken the determination of our state nor harm the unity and solidarity of our nation," Burhanettin Duran, the Turkish presidency's communications director, said on X.

Omer Celik, spokesman for President Tayyip Erdogan's AK Party, vowed the "clearest and strongest response".

Turkey has since 2016 repeatedly sent forces into northern Syria to curb the gains of the SDF - which during Syria's 2011–24 civil war took control of more than a quarter of the country while fighting Islamic State with strong U.S. backing.

The SDF has said the peace process between the Turkish state and PKK does not apply to it.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 16:38:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/YKFIXWEQ6FMYRGZM4GEPARZXJ4.jpg?auth=fb1b7535e63559750f6863619795d0b4daecd02062c6820e011835d5e838c49c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Syrian defence ministry announces four-day ceasefire after new accord with Kurdish force</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/syrian-defence-ministry-announces-four-day-ceasefire-after-new-accord-with-2026-01-20/</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 16:39:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Italian ski resort Courmayeur bans indoor sparklers after deadly Swiss fire</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/italian-ski-resort-courmayeur-bans-indoor-sparklers-after-deadly-swiss-fire-2026-01-20/</link><description>MILAN, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Courmayeur, an exclusive Italian ski resort at the foot of Mont Blanc, has banned the use of sparklers and other naked flame items in closed spaces following the deadly blaze in a bar in Switzerland's Crans-Montana.

The Crans-Montana fire on New Year's Eve killed 40 people, most of them teenagers, including six Italians, and injured 116. Authorities believe it was caused by "fountain candle" sparklers carried too close to the ceiling.

Courmayeur's town hall said in a statement on Tuesday that the ban would apply to "open flames and pyrotechnic items in all enclosed spaces, in particular in public venues".

Italian local authorities have intensified inspections of nightclubs and other public venues since the Crans-Montana catastrophe, checking capacity limits, emergency exits and fire safety measures.

Several clubs and discotheques have been closed in Rome this month following safety inspections, including Piper, one of the capital's most popular and historic venues which rose to fame during the 1960s.

Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has said her government is considering introducing a nationwide ban on the use of sparklers indoors. Several Swiss cantons have banned the sparklers since the Crans-Montana disaster.

Courmayeur Mayor Roberto Rota said the resort's ban was "necessary and urgent" due to the widespread use of open flames in public venues during celebrations.

Francesco Lenzi, a 20-year-old ski enthusiast from Milan, said more cities should follow Courmayeur's example.

"I have often witnessed the use of flaming objects in bars and discos in Courmayeur and elsewhere," he told Reuters.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 16:39:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CLENXBE3OBJGDKWEZC5A4WBF5M.jpg?auth=8a83f56334dd0d64815236dfafa9b8f28221ce394f8866960b5540b10af90e44&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Peru's president embroiled in scandal over failure to disclose meetings with Chinese businessman</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/perus-president-embroiled-scandal-over-failure-disclose-meetings-with-chinese-2026-01-20/</link><description>LIMA, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Peruvian President Jose Jeri is facing a preliminary investigation by the country's prosecutor as Congress looks to begin impeachment proceedings, after his recent meetings with a Chinese businessman outside of his official agenda erupted into a fresh political scandal.

Jeri, who assumed power in October after the expulsion of former President Dina Boluarte, said on Monday night he would make himself available to the prosecutor's office and the congressional oversight committee to "provide statements and clarifications" on the matter, according to the president's press office.

Jeri's meetings with businessman Zhihua Yang, who owns commercial stores and a concession for an energy project, and his failure to publicly disclose them as part of his agenda, prompted criticism over a lack of transparency and potential corruption. In Peru, the president's meetings are traditionally included in the official agenda.

Jeri met with Zhihua Yang on December 26 and January 6, according to local media.

Opposition lawmakers have said they will present a motion to impeach or censure Jeri, 39, whose popularity remains high despite dipping to 44% in January, according to the local polling firm CPI.

Jeri issued a public apology for the initial meeting, a dinner at a Chinese restaurant in Lima, via a recorded message on Sunday. He said he went to coordinate the celebration of another anniversary of Peruvian-Chinese friendship and denied having received an "irregular request" to meet.

"I admit my mistake," he said. "And I publicly apologize for entering the meeting with the businessman the way I did, hidden, and for that, giving rise to suspicions and doubts about my behavior," Jeri said.

Hours after Jeri's apology, a second meeting with Zhihua Yang, whose business has been suspended by Lima's authorities for selling unauthorized products, was made public.

An attorney representing Zhihua Yang told radio station RPP on Monday night that the encounters were a "friendly meeting in which President Jeri broke some protocols."

Although a censure of Jeri requires fewer votes than impeachment (87 out of 130), his removal is unlikely, political experts have said. Two-thirds of Peru's lawmakers are seeking reelection and will likely opt for stability before the April general elections, analysts said.

Peru has been reeling from an ongoing political crisis, with a revolving door of seven presidents since 2018 due to resignations or dismissals.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 16:41:02 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ZKFKQZ66DVKYJEYT7JT34R35RE.jpg?auth=67df6820c9a04d87cb3bf7371068367a57ae371657ef1be2324d8a7c73a0f9b8&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Carney tells Davos Canada 'strongly opposes' tariffs over Greenland</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/carney-tells-davos-canada-strongly-opposes-tariffs-over-greenland-2026-01-20/</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 16:41:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Peru's president embroiled in scandal over failure to disclose meetings with Chinese businessman</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/perus-president-embroiled-scandal-over-failure-disclose-meetings-with-chinese-2026-01-20/</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 16:41:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Carney tells Davos Canada 'strongly opposes' tariffs over Greenland</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/carney-tells-davos-canada-strongly-opposes-tariffs-over-greenland-2026-01-20/</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 16:41:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>French PM Lecornu forces 2026 budget through parliament without a vote</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260120-french-pm-lecornu-forces-2026-budget-through-parliament-without-a-vote</link><description>France 's Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu made use of a special constitutional power on Tuesday to force part of his 2026 budget ​bill through the deeply divided lower house of parliament ‍without a vote.

Lecornu invoked Article 49.3 of the Constitution on the income side of the ​legislation to get it through the lower house, where it had ​become deadlocked after three months of discussions.

In response, opposition parties the hard-left France Unbowed (LFI) and far-right National Rally (RN) were expected to file no-confidence motions against the government.

Lecornu and his government, however, appear to have won enough political backing, notably from the Socialists, to survive the no-confidence votes, which are likely to take ‍place on Friday.

The legislation is due to head to the Senate next before returning to the ​lower house. Lecornu will also need to force the spending side of the budget bill through the lower house before a final push ‌on the overall package.

Lecornu's minority government expects the budget to be definitively passed in the first half of ‍February, one official has said. He had previously promised to abstain from forcing the budget bill through parliament without a vote but was forced to do so after failing to win over enough lawmakers to pass the legislation with a vote, despite offering a series of concessions.

Lecornu's move nevertheless brings France closer to ‍a conclusion to getting a 2026 budget through parliament that keeps the fiscal deficit ‌to a maximum ​of 5% of its projected economic output for the year.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 16:41:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/07d05bae-f61c-11f0-9f32-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-20T160933Z-924940248-RC245JA1ZX0W-RTRMADP-3-FRANCE-POLITICS-BUDGET.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Crypto investments and conflicts of interest: Trump's very profitable year in office</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260120-crypto-investments-and-conflicts-of-interest-trump-s-very-profitable-year-in-office</link><description>In his second inaugural address , US President Donald Trump promised a “golden age of America” was about to begin.

One year later, many Americans still find themselves in the grip of price hikes , but Trump’s personal fortune has flourished, according to estimates from US media and monitors.

The US president has increased his wealth by $3 billion in the past 12 months – up to a total of $7.3 billion, according to Forbes. The New Yorker meanwhile estimates his fortune shot up $3.4 billion in the first six months of his second term alone, largely from “pocketing off the presidency”.

Almost $2 billion-worth of cash and gifts have boosted the Trump family fortune according to the Trump's Take tracker , run by the Center for American Progress (CAP) policy institute.

No one knows exactly how much Donald Trump is worth. Since he first took office in 2017, he has refused to comply with the decades-old tradition of US presidents releasing their tax returns. He has also been accused by a US court of lying about his net worth to make himself look richer.

Historically Trump’s fortune came from the Trump Organisation family conglomerate focused on real estate and tourism, but much of his new wealth is thought to come from crypto ventures that have boosted his fortunes by billions of dollars in just a few months.

The sums are unprecedented for a president in office. “There is no historical parallel for this. Nothing comes close,” said Will Ragland, vice president of research at CAP.

While former presidents have gone to great lengths to avoid conflicts of interest, such as Jimmy Carter putting his peanut farm into a blind trust, Trump seems to embrace the grey area.

Trump is “a president who appears to actively use his businesses as a vehicle for blatant conflict of interest for personal gain,” said Ragland.

During Trump’s first term, the infamous dealmaker lost money. According to Forbes, Trump was worth $3.5 billion when he was first inaugurated. By 2021, the figure had slumped to $2.4 billion .

The loss was largely due to the impact of the Covid pandemic on his commercial real-estate interests, including hotels, resorts and office blocks , as well as devaluations in his fleet of planes and golf courses.

By the time Trump was poised to run for a second presidential term in 2024, his portfolio of investments had diversified.

The vast majority of his new wealth has come from crypto investment projects run by the Trump family including World Liberty Financial, stablecoin USD1, meme coin tokens and NFTs (non-fungible tokens).

Although many of these are run by Trump’s sons, Forbes estimates that Trump himself has made $2.4 billion from cryptocurrencies since 2024 while Trump’s Take estimates the total value of the Trump family’s crypto assets has grown by $7.4 billion since his returned to the White House .

This, despite Trump's claim back in 2019 that he was “not a fan” of cryptocurrencies as their value was “highly volatile and based on thin air” and that they could also facilitate “illegal activity”.

Six years later, the mercurial nature of crypto has played to his advantage.

Meme coins, for example, are cryptocurrencies that generally emerge from internet jokes and are often bought as a novel way to engage with online trends, rather than as a serious investment.

When Trump launched his $TRUMP meme coin days before his second inauguration, buying in was a way for his supporters to ride a wave of excitement – but it was also a money spinner. By March, Trump had made $350 million off the coin, according to the Financial Times.

Next to launch was the $MELANIA meme coin, named after the first lady, which quickly earned $65 million in sales and trading fees – with particular benefits for a few early investors.

In the minutes before it’s official launch, 24 unidentified wallets bought up $2.6 million of the $MELANIA coin and within days flipped them for $100 million , the Financial Times reported.

Trump’s other crypto ventures have benefitted from similar boosts since he became president.

Since 2025, World Liberty Financial – a platform for borrowing, lending and trading cryptocurrencies – has sold more than $1 billion of its own tokens, Trump NFT’s have netted him around $13 million and the USD1 stablecoin is now worth an estimated $235 million .

The advantage of an association with the White House is especially clear for Trump's stablecoin.

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that aim to maintain a stable value through links to specific assets – in USD1’s case it comes with a presidential guarantee that it is backed by short-term US government treasuries and dollar deposits.

The safeguard has encouraged foreign investment. In May 2025, the UAE’s ruling family bought up $2 billion of USD1.

Weeks later the White House gave the UAE access to thousands of the world’s most advanced and scarce computer chips .

Although the two incidents are not explicitly linked, there are indications – some more blatant than others – that those who invest in Trump’s crypto ventures are being given preferential treatment.

In April 2025, it was announced that the top 25 $TRUMP coin holders would be invited to a reception and VIP tour of the White House, a clear opportunity to pay for access to the President.

Among those on the guest list was China-born crypto billionaire Justin Sun, who is thought to own hundreds of millions of Trump’s meme coins, and is also the second-largest known investor in World Liberty Financial.

He was also the subject of a 2023 investigation by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which charged him with finding illicit ways of trading in the US including enlisting celebrities to endorse his cryptocurrency.

The Trump administration has since ended nearly all regulation against crypto traders and, in 2026, the SEC put its charges against Sun on hold.

Such deals are not necessarily illegal, but they “certainly transgress the ways in which things have been done in the past,” said Emma Long, associate professor in American history and politics, at the University of East Anglia.

It is not unusual for US presidents to use their profile for lucrative ends: most do this after they leave office, via book deals and speaking fees worth tens of millions of dollars.

But while in office, “presidents usually divest themselves of any financial arrangements that might be a conflict of interest or that might be seen as trading on their official position”, Long added.

While crypto ventures are the main source of Trump’s rapidly increasing fortune, there are other ventures that operate in this grey area.

On the 2024 campaign trail, Trump became the only presidential candidate to run an online merchandise store redirecting funds – that supporters may have believed were going to his campaign – into his own pocket.

Since his re-election, there have been claims that Trump’s hotels and resorts have benefitted from their association with the White House and from Trump holding official events there. Membership fees for Trump’s most famous resort, Mar-a-Lago in Florida, have now risen to $1million .

Then there are a host of other eyebrow-raising deals, such as a $40 million agreement signed with Amazon giving the corporation access to film a documentary with Melania Trump .

There's also the $400 million luxury jet that Trump accepted from Qatari government, which he has been allowed to keep even though it “appears to violate the spirit if not the letter of the Constitution, which essentially prohibits accepting profits or gifts from foreign countries without congressional approval”, said Ragland.

US Congress has so far failed to take action against the exceptionally expensive gift, making it part of a wider cash grab that indicates the country's “ethical guardrails are no longer functional,” said Ragland.

“We aren't just looking at one man’s fortune; we’re looking at a systemic failure that leaves the American public completely vulnerable to industrial-scale corruption,” he added.

French President Emmanuel Macron said the European Union should not bend to "the law of the strongest", adding that it was "crazy" that the bloc was having to contemplate using its "anti-coercion instrument" against the United States.

"We do believe that we need more growth, we need more stability in this world, but we do prefer respect to bullies," Macron told the World Economic Forum's annual meeting, the day before Trump's arrival in Switzerland.

Without referring directly to Trump, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen highlighted a need to respond to seismic shifts in the world and said the speed and scale of change had driven a consensus in Europe on independence.

"It is time to seize this opportunity and build a new independent Europe," she said in a speech.

Belgium's Prime Minister Bart De Wever said the 27-member bloc was "at a crossroads" where it must decide on how to get out of a "very bad position" after trying to appease Trump to get his support for the Ukraine war .

"So we should unite and we should say to Donald Trump ... 'You're crossing red lines here.' We either stand together or we will stand divided," De Wever said on a panel discussion.

Trump announced tariffs on Saturday on imports from European allies that oppose the U.S. acquiring Greenland, an autonomous part of Denmark.

European governments, which are facing growing challenges from populist, nationalist parties, have been at odds over how to respond to the tariff threat while maintaining U.S. support for Ukraine.

Macron said Europe should not accept a world where might was right and called for bold moves to defend European industries.

"Let's not be shy. Let's not be divided. Let's not accept a global order, which will be divided by those who claim to have the bigger voice," Macron said.

Macron also appeared to see an opportunity for Europe in Trump's chaotic policies.

"We have a place where the rule of law and predictability is still the rule of the game, and my guess is that it is under-priced by the market," he said in his speech.

However, some senior bankers and executives in Davos, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they saw the response from European leaders to Trump's moves as emotional rather than pragmatic. Two suggested the continent needed to look beyond the way the U.S. president delivers his message and have a negotiation.

"But they won't even want to have that conversation, because they're so offended by the style. And so what you have in Europe is a very, very, delicate balance of a continent that cannot move together," one senior banker told Reuters.

European countries say Trump's threat of new tariffs would violate a trade deal reached with the U.S. last year, and EU leaders are set to discuss possible retaliation at an emergency summit in Brussels on Thursday.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, however, voiced confidence that the United States and European countries would find a solution and avoid what some have warned could become a prolonged trade war.

"Why are we jumping there? Why are you taking it to the worst case? ... Calm down the hysteria. Take a deep breath," he said.

Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Tuesday that he was ready to join other global leaders in Davos, but only if the U.S. was ready to sign documents on security guarantees for Ukraine and a post-war prosperity plan.

"Ukraine is ready for meetings ... if those meetings are actually effective," he wrote on X.

His comments came as CEOs, including finance industry executives, are expected to meet on Wednesday to discuss post-war reconstruction, a source familiar with the matter said.

But any decisions were unlikely, the source told Reuters, adding: "You need peace in order to reconstruct the place."

Zelenskiy urged the U.S. to pile more pressure on Russia after its latest massive air attack on Ukraine cut heating to half of the capital and affected substations the United Nations' atomic watchdog said are vital for nuclear safety.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 17:30:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4EPO2RX5PRONTC3RDIJCXBQ6CM.jpg?auth=8e9543263e090b354d7cb131edfbf0b54f18bd0a6627113bd8fd899c6a6f94dc&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>ICE crackdown creates double-edged campaign issue for Republicans and Democrats</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/ice-crackdown-creates-double-edged-campaign-issue-republicans-democrats-2026-01-20/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 20 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown is fast becoming a double-edged campaign issue in November's hotly contested midterm congressional elections because of mounting public unease over aggressive tactics by federal immigration officers.

After an ICE officer shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Good in Minneapolis on January 7, sparking protests , opinion polls showed most Americans disapprove of the conduct of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, including a Reuters/Ipsos survey that pointed to a Republican split over whether federal immigration agents should try harder to avoid hurting people.

Criticism about ICE's use of force appears to have diminished the ability of Republican candidates to pivot away from economic pessimism among voters by stressing the party's traditionally strong standing on crime and security. Democrats could benefit, despite the party's historic weakness on border security issues, if voters decide Trump has moved beyond what they elected him to do, said Nathan Gonzales, editor of analysis firm Inside Elections.

The polling data has raised Republican concerns that souring public views of ICE operations could cloud Trump's success at securing the U.S.-Mexico border. Record numbers of migrants flowed into the U.S. under former President Joe Biden, a topic Republicans view as a key campaign asset.

But with some Democratic candidates calling for ICE's abolition, Democratic groups are concerned that voters worried about immigration and security could turn against them come November.

Republicans control both the Senate and the House of Representatives but face voter frustration over high prices and the economy in an election cycle that often punishes the ruling party as voters cast ballots for all 435 House seats and 35 of the 100 Senate seats.

"This is kind of a fluid situation that we're in right now that reminds me a bit of where we were after George Floyd, where public opinion moved pretty dramatically," said Amy Walter, editor-in-chief of the Cook Political Report.

The 2020 police killing of Floyd in Minneapolis spurred nationwide anger that brought about reforms in many U.S. states but also proved to be a political liability for both Republicans and Democrats.

Members of the public have expressed outrage over immigration enforcement tactics such as ICE agents wearing masks, zip-tying children and arresting and injuring or killing U.S. citizens. Over the weekend in Minneapolis, a naturalized U.S. citizen said immigration agents with guns drawn broke down his door and dragged him into the snow wearing shorts and . ChongLy Thao, 56, who goes by the name Scott, said he was returned home later without explanation or apology.

The Department of Homeland Security has said ICE officers, whom it oversees, have also faced violence .

DEMOCRATS COULD RETAKE HOUSE: ANALYSTS

Analysts say Democrats are in a strong position to gain control of the House and could cut into the 53-47-seat Republican Senate majority, if not seize the chamber outright. Losing either chamber would hinder Trump's ability to enact his agenda and also would enable congressional investigations into administration policies and actions.

"Is (ICE) an issue that people care enough to vote on? I don't know," Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters last week.

The Trump administration is poised to ramp up immigration enforcement this year with funds Congress gave ICE to hire thousands of agents, detain more than 100,000 migrants at any given time and expand surveillance to track down possible immigration offenders. The push is expected to include more enforcement against employers, a move that could pressure businesses in sectors known to hire workers who are in the U.S. illegally.

In the coming months, ICE's aggressive tactics could undermine Republican support among Latino voters and influence toss-up Senate races in Democratic-leaning states such as Maine and Michigan, Walter said.

Senator Susan Collins of Maine, the most vulnerable of this year's Republican incumbents, criticized what she considered "excessive" ICE tactics, including wearing masks and targeting immigrants without criminal records, which she said have been ordered by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.

"It's not the ICE officers' fault," Collins told Reuters. "Some of the tactics that the secretary has had ICE use in cities are not where the focus should be."

Some Senate Democrats hope to use government funding legislation to impose new curbs on ICE's actions. But Collins, who oversees funding issues as chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said she instead favored oversight hearings with Noem.

In response, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said, "President Trump and Secretary Noem are delivering on the American people's mandate to deport illegal aliens."

McLaughlin's statement to Reuters cited opinion polls released months before Good's shooting that showed most Americans favoring deportation of people in the country illegally, though one New York Times survey also said most voters thought Trump had gone too far on immigration enforcement.

The statement asserted that 70% of those arrested by ICE have been charged with or convicted of crimes, a claim that has been disputed by independent researchers, advocacy groups and journalists.

Democrats could find themselves debating whether to reform ICE or abolish the agency altogether, a question some fear could backfire on the party.

"The task ahead is not to eliminate enforcement, but to reclaim it from those who are abusing it for political gain," the Democratic centrist think tank Third Way warned in a public memo.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 17:30:47 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BM5MVL4CQRKSVC4QCUD5QPSAZY.jpg?auth=6bb5a87ae36812fb5427ff2cf3668f8460b856017688a5f101ff9c3826d48680&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Six-year-old girl who went to see Lion King is family's sole survivor of Spanish train crash</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/six-year-old-girl-who-went-see-lion-king-is-familys-sole-survivor-spanish-train-2026-01-20/</link><description>MADRID, Jan 20 (Reuters) - A six-year-old girl was found walking alone along the tracks on Sunday night after her parents, brother and cousin all died in the high-speed crash between two trains in southern Spain. She had been on a family outing to see the Lion King musical in Madrid.

The girl, who has not been officially named, suffered only a minor head wound. The family had been returning to their home in Aljaraque, on the Atlantic coast near Huelva, according to Spanish media.

The trip to the musical had been a present for the feast of Epiphany, which Spain celebrates along with Christmas. The family also visited Real Madrid's Bernabeu Stadium, according to regional broadcaster Canal Sur.

The girl's survival was described by the mayor of Aljaraque as "a miracle".

"The town is broken by grief and with hardly any words of comfort," Adrian Cano said.

The girl was cared for overnight by a police officer before being reunited with her grandmother in Cordoba, authorities said.

Hers is among a series of stories told by grieving family members or worried relatives on social media or to local broadcasters about those missing or killed in one of Europe's deadliest train crashes .

Alberto Garcia told Antena 3 his daughter, who is five months pregnant, is in intensive care because of serious injuries sustained in the crash. Doctors have placed her under sedation and on a ventilator, he said, keeping watch over the unborn child, which still has a heartbeat.

Firefighters pulled her unconscious from the twisted wreck of the carriage, relatives told El Pais, after passengers smashed windows to escape from the train. Her sister , Ana, who was travelling with her and their dog, suffered lighter injuries. Relatives say the dog, named Boro, is still missing.

Ana said she believes her sister may have been injured while trying to protect the animal. "If I can’t do anything for her, at least I hope I can find Boro," she told local newspaper El Mundo.

Spain's government has declared three days of national mourning and high-speed rail services between Madrid and cities in Andalusia are suspended while tracks are cleared and combed over by investigators and rail safety experts.

Julio Rodriguez, 16, was among the first residents of Adamuz, where the trains crashed, to help with rescue efforts after passing the site on his return from a fishing trip.

"I arrived here and my body became someone else’s. All I could think about was helping. I walked the 800 metres back and forth six or eight times. I didn’t stop to think about tiredness," he told reporters after King Felipe thanked him and others during a visit to the crash site on Tuesday.

Many are still searching for their relatives. Families have filed a total of 47 missing reports but so far only 10 of the victims have been identified, official data says.

Relatives and colleagues were appealing online for news of Jesus Saldana, a cardiologist who has not been found among the injured or dead in any hospital or official lists, his sister told Cadena Ser radio. While they have recovered his mobile phone, they still have no news of him, she added.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 17:31:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LPSTZL76VFKBHC2BI6UBQWSAUQ.jpg?auth=3cd24f5eff914f9aff629856e5ac35bcf4263d2544912cdf9f83f6ef68c39d9e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Lukashenko joins Trump's 'Board of Peace' as US eases his isolation</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/lukashenko-joins-trumps-board-peace-us-eases-his-isolation-2026-01-20/</link><description>MOSCOW, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko signed an agreement on Tuesday to join U.S. President Donald Trump's Board of Peace, the latest step in a rapprochement with Washington after years of international isolation.

A presidential Telegram channel published video of Lukashenko signing the document, and quoted him as saying he hoped to contribute towards peace in Ukraine.

Lukashenko, in power since 1994, was long shunned by the West because of his poor human rights record and backing for Russian President Vladimir Putin in the war in Ukraine .

But Trump last year began easing sanctions on Belarus in return for the release of political prisoners. He has called Lukashenko a "highly respected" leader - a description that jars with the exiled Belarus opposition, which sees him as a dictator.

The invitation to join the Board of Peace marked a further stage in the U.S. rehabilitation of Lukashenko as it continues to negotiate with him on further prisoner releases and a normalisation of ties.

Trump originally proposed establishing the Board when he announced his plan last September to end the war in Gaza. But an invitation sent to world leaders last week outlines a broad role for the body in ending conflicts globally.

A draft charter sent to about 60 countries by the U.S. administration calls for members to contribute $1 billion in cash if they want their membership to last more than three years, according to the document seen by Reuters.

On Monday Trump said he had invited Russian President Vladimir Putin to be a member of the Board.

On Tuesday, Armenia said it would also join. Trump has claimed credit for ending a long-running conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan, which have fought two wars since the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 17:32:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/RIVW7ZNXNNJ6FMEB5JV77OKBB4.jpg?auth=09173f074c3aa17e76e3b2d7eb90a3fa9d61afca36009b84b6fd26653b9a4e8d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Portuguese police arrest 37 suspected ultra-right militants</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/portuguese-police-arrest-37-suspected-ultra-right-militants-2026-01-20/</link><description>LISBON, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Portuguese police on Tuesday arrested 37 people suspected of belonging to an ultra-right group responsible for hate crimes, with links to similar international groups, in a large operation that involved around 300 officers.

"Those detained ... promoted Nazi ideology, inherent to the national-socialist culture and the radical and violent extreme right, acting out of racist and xenophobic motives with the aim of intimidating, persecuting and assaulting ethnic minorities, namely immigrants," the Judicial Police said in a statement.

Searches found weapons of different kinds and neo-Nazi propaganda materials.

Police sources said the group in question was "1143", named after the year Portugal became a kingdom. The group's leader, Mario Machado, is serving a prison sentence after being convicted of racial discrimination, hate speech and related violence.

In June, police arrested several suspected neo-Nazis believed to be seeking to create an illegal armed militia , and seized firearms and explosives.

Human rights groups have long raised concerns about increasing hate speech and attacks against immigrants in Portugal, where the far-right, anti-immigration party Chega last year became the second-largest parliamentary group - 50 years after the country overthrew its fascist dictatorship.

On Sunday, Chega leader Andre Ventura came in second in the first round of a presidential election, proceeding to a runoff against Socialist candidate Antonio Jose Seguro.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 17:33:27 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UK approves new Chinese ‘mega embassy’ in London despite security concerns</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260120-uk-approves-new-chinese-mega-embassy-in-london-despite-security-concerns</link><description>Britain’s government on Tuesday approved a huge new Chinese embassy in central London, despite strong criticism from lawmakers across the political spectrum that it could become a base for espionage and intimidation of opponents.

Local Government Secretary Steve Reed formally signed off on plans for the building near the Tower of London , after years of delays and legal challenges.

Critics have long expressed concerns that the supersized embassy, set to be the biggest Chinese embassy in Europe, will heighten risks of Chinese intelligence-gathering as well as amplify the threat of surveillance and intimidation of Chinese dissidents in exile.

The heads of two UK spy agencies said that while it's not realistic to eliminate all risk, appropriate “security mitigations” were in place.

Plans for the embassy have been plagued by objections and protests since 2018, when China’s government bought the site at Royal Mint Court, where Britain's money was once made, for 225 million pounds (around $300 million.)

Opponents say the huge site sits too close to underground fiber optic cables carrying sensitive financial information between London’s two main financial districts. British media have reported that the 20,000 square-meter (around 215,000 square-foot) complex would include 208 secret basement rooms close to the data cables.

Dissidents have been among those who have protested the plans, saying a mega embassy housing large numbers of officials would further China’s repression of activists abroad.

Kemi Badenoch, the leader of the opposition Conservative Party, joined hundreds of protesters  who chanted “no China mega embassy” at the site Sunday.

Critics argue that approving the embassy was a mistake that went beyond security at the building — they say it sends a signal that Britain bows to pressure from Beijing to avoid economic repercussions.

“The government has capitulated to Chinese demands," Conservative security spokesman Chris Philp said.

Security Minister Dan Jarvis insisted: "We don’t trade off security for economic access.”

Helena Kennedy, a human rights lawyer and Labour Party member of the House of Lords, the upper house of the British Parliament, said that the decision was a dangerous step.

“We cannot reinforce the dangerous notion that Britain will continue to make concessions — such as granting a mega embassy — without reciprocity or regard for the rule of law,” she said.

Local residents said they were “determined to keep fighting today’s decision” and planned to challenge the approval in the courts.

Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s government has repeatedly postponed its decision in recent months after multiple cases of alleged Chinese spying and political interference underlined concerns about the proposed embassy.

In November, the domestic intelligence agency MI5 issued an alert to lawmakers warning that Chinese agents were making “targeted and widespread” efforts to recruit and cultivate them using LinkedIn or cover companies.

Beijing has strongly denied those claims, calling them “pure fabrication and malicious slander.”

The UK government also has faced questions about whether it interfered in the trial of two men accused of spying on Parliament for Beijing, and whose prosecution collapsed last year.

The heads of the domestic security service MI5 and the electronic intelligence agency GCHQ said in a letter to ministers that “as with any foreign embassy on UK soil, it is not realistic to expect to be able wholly to eliminate each and every potential risk.”

“However, the collective work across UK intelligence agencies and (government) departments to formulate a package of national security mitigations for the site has been, in our view, expert, professional and proportionate,” MI5 chief Ken McCallum and GCHQ director Anne Keast-Butler said.

They said there were “clear security advantages” to consolidating China’s current seven diplomatic premises in London onto one site.

The government said that “no bodies with responsibility for national security ... have raised concerns or objected to the proposal on the basis of the proximity of the cables or other underground infrastructure.”

Starmer has stressed that while protecting national security is nonnegotiable, Britain needs to keep up diplomatic dialogue and cooperation with the Asian superpower.

The approval is widely expected to pave the way for a long-anticipated trip by Starmer to China, and an expansion of the UK Embassy in Beijing. The closely watched visit would be the first made by a British prime minister since 2018.

China has complained about the seven-year delay in approving the project, saying the UK was “constantly complicating and politicising the matter.”</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 17:34:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/5485ef58-f2ee-11f0-aa22-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26014481909047.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>France's PM invokes Article 49.3 to force through budget bill</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france-s-pm-invokes-article-49-3-to-force-through-budget-bill</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 17:34:39 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/71cbda3c-f61d-11f0-bf3d-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260120-171443-171641-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Mass kidnapping at Kaduna churches adds to pressure on Nigeria</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/mass-kidnapping-kaduna-churches-adds-pressure-nigeria-2026-01-20/</link><description>KADUNA, Nigeria, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Afiniki Moses thought her ordeal was over when armed abductors released her on January 15 after her family paid a ransom in a village in northern Kaduna state. She was wrong.

The armed gang returned to Kurmin Wali village on Sunday and seized more than 170 people during a church service from two churches, including her husband and two children.

The children later escaped, she said, but her husband is among 163 people that the Christian Association of Nigeria says are still missing.

"They kidnapped a large number of people in the community and my husband happened to be among them. As you can see me now, I am not feeling fine," she said.

The attack on the churches is the latest in a series of abductions in the West African country, adding to pressure on the government.

It is under scrutiny from U.S. President Donald Trump who over what he says is persecution of Christians before launching an airstrike on Christmas Day. The Nigerian government has denied there is any systematic persecution of Christians.

It says it is working hard to tackle Islamists and other violent groups that have attacked both Muslim and Christian civilians often for ransom.

It has also hired a Washington-based consulting firm to help communicate its effort to protect Christians.

Kidnappings have spread over the years mostly in remote parts of northern Nigeria and are carried out by armed gangs who ride into villages on motorcycles and seize villagers.

Inside one of the churches targeted in Kurmin Wali, named the Evangelical Church Winning All, a Reuters reporter saw signs of disturbance, with some plastic chairs on the floor. A Bible lay on one chair, and musical instruments that appeared to have been used in a lively church service.

Idris Madami said he was outside Albarika Cherubin and Seraphin Movement Church nearby when the gunmen arrived with guns.

He managed to escape but said about 20 of his family members who were attending service were taken away and he has not heard from them.

"I have two wives (and) three children among those kidnapped," he told Reuters.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 17:58:26 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5OGNMYLOQFLSTPEOUFTAD6KMEQ.jpg?auth=5229cdc9829389c40978a479ab6bcb17b605bbd3718dac991901abee08468457&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Lithuania president says joint security deal could end Greenland row</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/lithuania-president-says-joint-security-deal-could-end-greenland-row-2026-01-20/</link><description>DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 20 (Reuters) - An agreement on sharing responsibility for the security of the Arctic and the North Atlantic could provide a way out of the stand-off between the United States and Europe over Greenland, Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda said on Tuesday.

Nauseda told Reuters an interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum's annual meeting that the Greenland row was overshadowing the war in Ukraine and playing into Russia's hands, and urged Washington to de-escalate tensions.

"The best outcome would be just to agree on common responsibility on the security of the Arctic region and North Atlantic region. Is it possible to achieve? We should do our best to go this way, because this is the best way," he said.

U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday there was "no going back" on his aim of acquiring Greenland, refusing to rule out taking the Arctic island by force and rounding on allies.

Trump's ambition to wrest sovereignty over Greenland from fellow NATO member Denmark has threatened to blow apart the alliance that has underpinned Western security for decades.

EU leaders are due to discuss their options at an emergency summit on Thursday which Nauseda said would show whether Europe can present a united front over Greenland. He said the next two weeks would probably show how the dispute is resolved.

Nauseda said he hoped countries that can be sceptical about supporting Ukraine would understand that Europe has reached a critical juncture, arguing NATO's future is at stake.

Trump is due to speak in Davos on Wednesday, and Nauseda said his hope was that the U.S. President would send out some signals towards de-escalating tensions over Greenland.

Describing upholding territorial integrity as an "untouchable principle," Nauseda said there was always room to de-escalate.

"But of course the precondition is that both sides want this de-escalation, and now I'm not sure. Europe is obviously willing to de-escalate. I hope that the United States will be too."

The Lithuanian president said the Greenland dispute had diverted attention away from Russia's invasion of Ukraine, posing additional challenges for Europe's eastern flank.

Ongoing support from Washington was vital while Europe set about taking on responsibility for its own security, he said.

"Europe needs time in order to implement this strategic autonomy, not only on paper, but in reality," Nauseda said.

"We need 10 to 15 years' time," he added.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 18:41:19 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/NQMHK3BRP5MEJGEFBQNZRU4DN4.jpg?auth=ff643bb005ad4794fc7230bd6cb7a3226ba9c4151c0abb17ee0a9103f3a3f9ad&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuela calls for 'symbolic' social media action after Trump post</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/venezuela-calls-symbolic-social-media-action-after-trump-post-2026-01-20/</link><description>Jan 20 (Reuters) - Venezuela's government on Tuesday called on citizens to post its official map on social media as a "symbolic action" after U.S. President Donald Trump posted an altered image showing U.S. flags over Venezuela, as well as Canada and Greenland.

The image, posted on Trump's Truth Social just before 1 a.m. Eastern Time (0600 GMT), shows an altered version of an August 2025 photo of European leaders in the Oval Office with Trump, with the original map replaced with one showing U.S. flags over Venezuela and much of North America.

The photo includes images of Britain's Keir Starmer, Italy's Giorgia Meloni, France's Emmanuel Macron and EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen - even as Trump himself and other world leaders traveled to Davos for the World Economic Forum.

"In light of this situation, the Venezuelan State calls on all citizens to take symbolic action in unity, with the aim of defending territorial integrity and countering misinformation," Venezuela's government said in a statement.

It urged its population to post on social media its official map of Venezuela, which includes Esequibo - some two-thirds of neighboring Guyana that is claimed by Venezuela, though this is not recognized by any major country or by the U.N.

Since the U.S. attack on Caracas on January 3, when it captured President Nicolas Maduro, the Trump administration has said it plans to "run" Venezuela and that it is cooperating with Maduro's vice-president and interim successor, Delcy Rodriguez.

While decrying the attack at home, which Venezuelan authorities say killed 100 people, Rodriguez has said she plans to pursue diplomatic channels with the U.S. She also agreed to a deal under which Venezuelan oil revenues are channeled to U.S.-controlled bank accounts .

Canada's prime minister's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Speaking in Copenhagen on Tuesday, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said she would not abandon Greenland and as Trump has not ruled out use of the military, she would not rule it out either .</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 18:43:16 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LEIWZDL2Z5M2POSKYLQKGRC7LE.jpg?auth=b433f221b75941af91b10b6fe761fd074a8717a2288ffee623c562ec8fbbf56f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Looming water supply 'bankruptcy' puts billions at risk, UN report warns</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/looming-water-supply-bankruptcy-puts-billions-risk-un-report-warns-2026-01-20/</link><description>Jan 20 (Reuters) - The world is facing irreversible water "bankruptcy", with billions of people struggling to cope with the consequences of decades of overuse as well as shrinking supplies from lakes, rivers, glaciers and wetlands, U.N. researchers said on Tuesday.

Nearly three-quarters of the global population live in countries classified as "water insecure" or "critically water insecure", and 4 billion people face severe water scarcity at least one month per year, the United Nations University Institute for Water, Environment and Health warned in a report , opens new tab .

"Many regions are living beyond their hydrological means, and many critical water systems are already bankrupt," said Kaveh Madani, lead author and director of the institute.

"By acknowledging the reality of water bankruptcy, we can finally make the hard choices that will protect people, economies and ecosystems," he said.

The report said water supplies are "already in a post-crisis state of failure" after decades of unsustainable extraction rates that have drawn down water "savings" contained in aquifers, glaciers, soils, wetlands and river ecosystems, with supplies also degraded by pollution.

More than 170 million hectares of irrigated cropland - an area larger than Iran - are under "high" or "very high" water stress, and economic damage from land degradation, groundwater depletion and climate change amounts to more than $300 billion a year worldwide, the report said.

Three billion people and more than half of global food production are concentrated in areas already facing unstable or declining water storage levels, while salinisation has also degraded more than 100 million hectares of cropland, it said.

The researchers wrote that the current approach to solving water problems was no longer fit for purpose, and the priority was not "returning to normal" but a new " global water agenda " designed to minimise damage.

However, Jonathan Paul, geoscience professor at Royal Holloway, University of London, said the report did not address one major factor behind the crisis.

"The elephant in the room, which is mentioned explicitly only once, is the role of massive and uneven population growth in driving so many of the manifestations of water bankruptcy," he said.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 18:43:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/EIBL34MG7VPQPFZZFGJX5K3HVU.jpg?auth=3d66a5330100edbf1e3ab153c28bd2b2754593f94a5130d47c8cc45ec7805b31&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>French far-right leader Le Pen takes the stand, denies party had ‘system’ to embezzle EU funds</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260120-french-far-right-leader-le-pen-takes-the-stand-denies-party-had-system-to-embezzle-eu-funds</link><description>French far-right leader Marine Le Pen at an appeals trial on Tuesday rejected her party having had any "system" to embezzle European Parliament funds, as she seeks to save her 2027 run for president.

A French court last year barred Le Pen, a three-time presidential candidate from the far-right National Rally (RN), from running for office for five years over a fake jobs scam at the European institution.

It found her, along with 24 former European Parliament lawmakers, assistants and accountants as well as the party itself, guilty of operating a "system" from 2004 to 2016 using European Parliament funds to employ RN staff in France.

Le Pen, 11 others and the party are appealing.

"The term 'system' bothers me because it gives the impression of manipulation," Le Pen said in the dock on Tuesday.

"The parliamentary assistant cases must be examined one by one, because it seems to me they reflect very different realities," she added.

The appeal hearings are to last until mid-February, with a decision expected this summer.

If the court upholds the first ruling, Le Pen will be prevented from running in the 2027 election, widely seen as her best chance to win the country's top job.

She made it to the second round in the 2017 and 2022 presidential polls, before losing to Emmanuel Macron . But he cannot run this time after two consecutive terms in office.

Le Pen was also handed a four-year prison sentence, with two years suspended, and fined 100,000 euros ($116,000) in the initial trial.

She now again risks the maximum sentence of 10 years in prison and a one-million-euro ($1.16 million) fine if the appeal fails.

Le Pen is hoping to be acquitted -- or at least a shorter election ban and no time under house arrest.

As the appeals trial opened last week, Le Pen said her party had "no sense" they were committing any offence, and sought to shift the blame on the European Parliament.

"If indeed any wrongdoing was committed, the European Parliament did not play the warning role it should have," she said on Tuesday last week.

On Thursday, EU Parliament official Didier Klethi said the legislature's rules were clear.

EU lawmakers could employ assistants with the monthly staffing stipend the parliament gave them -- which was 21,379 euros in 2024, he said.

Assistants could also engage in political activism, he added, but this was forbidden "during working hours".</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 18:43:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/d31dc68c-f628-11f0-884f-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26020371867428.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump considers role in Venezuela for Machado</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/trump-considers-role-venezuela-machado-2026-01-20/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 20 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Tuesday he was considering involving Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado in some capacity in her country, but did not say what role she could play.

“We're talking to her and maybe we can get her involved some way. I'd love to be able to do that; Maria, maybe we can do that,” Trump told reporters at the White House, referring to Machado, who met Trump last week and gave him her Nobel Peace Prize.

Trump’s comments marked a tone change for the president, who previously questioned Machado's popularity and ability to lead in Venezuela after the United States captured President Nicolas Maduro in a raid earlier this month. In 2024, Machado's party said it had won 70% of the vote in the presidential election.

"I felt so strongly against Venezuela, now I'm loving Venezuela. They've been working with us so well. It's been so nice," Trump told reporters, referring to his administration working with Venezuela’s interim president, Delcy Rodriguez.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 20:13:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/2V4XERJNKZIJVN34OOOOTP4ECA.jpg?auth=f8b68f6b3cf162d497ce7a7f76353d277e2ca0c7b73396ff1397bb1faae85b85&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump and Putin envoys say Davos meting on Ukraine was 'very positive' and 'constructive'</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/davos/trump-putin-envoys-say-davos-meting-ukraine-was-very-positive-constructive-2026-01-20/</link><description>DAVOS, Jan 20 - Envoys for U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Tuesday that their meeting in Davos on a possible future peace deal to end the Ukraine war had been "very positive" and "constructive".

The United States has held talks with Russia, and separately with Kyiv and European leaders, on for ending the war in Ukraine , but no deal has yet been reached despite Trump's repeated promises to clinch one.

Ukraine's European allies, currently arguing in public about Trump's threats against Greenland, are concerned the United States could demand Ukrainian accept territorial concessions.

"Dialogue is constructive and more and more people understand the fairness of Russian position," Putin envoy Kirill Dmitriev said after talks with Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump's son in law Jared Kushner in the "USA House" at Davos.

Witkoff said: "We had a very positive meeting," Russia's RIA news agency reported.

The meeting lasted for two hours, a source who spoke on condition of anonymity said.

At stake is how to end the deadliest war in Europe since World War Two, the future of Ukraine, the extent to which European powers are sidelined and whether or not a peace deal brokered by the United States will endure.

Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022 after eight years of fighting in eastern Ukraine, triggering the biggest confrontation between Moscow and the West since the depths of the Cold War.

Russia controls about 19% of Ukraine, including the Crimea peninsula which it annexed in 2014, as well as most of the eastern Donbas region, much of the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions, and slivers of four other regions.

Russia says Crimea, Donbas, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia are now parts of Russia. Ukraine says it will never accept that, and almost all countries consider the regions to be part of Ukraine.

Ukraine and European leaders say that Russia cannot be allowed to achieve its aims after what they cast as an imperial-style land grab. If Russia wins, European powers say, then it will one day attack NATO. Moscow says such claims are ridiculous and that it has no intention of attacking a NATO member.

Russia says that European leaders are intent on scuttling the peace talks by introducing conditions that they know will be unacceptable to Russia, which took 12 to 17 square km (4.6-6.6 square miles) of Ukrainian territory per day in 2025.

Putin casts the war as a watershed moment in relations with the West, which he says humiliated Russia after the Soviet Union fell in 1991 by enlarging NATO and encroaching on what he considers Moscow's sphere of influence.

He has repeatedly said he is open to peace but one based on the realities of the battlefield.

The United States says a total of a million Russian and Ukrainian men have been killed or injured in the war. Russia and Ukraine do not publish losses.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 20:13:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KXAY5AGSHNLCPOFJJUQ5VCGTAU.jpg?auth=a4e70ec0d7262c880e63a06706ffe17ce759616ec6bec774e96f77dd84ef9393&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US will soon target drugs coming in by land, Trump says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-will-soon-target-drugs-coming-by-land-trump-says-2026-01-20/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 20 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday said his administration would "very shortly" start targeting drugs coming into the United States by land, after he claimed strikes by U.S. forces on suspected drug boats in the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean have reduced the amount of drugs coming into the U.S. by water.

The South American country recorded 9,216 murders last year, a sharp rise from 7,063 in 2024, ministry data showed. The increase reversed a positive trend from the previous year, when murders had fallen by 15%.

The government has attributed the spiraling violence to turf wars between splintered gangs vying for control following the capture or death of their leaders.

Police said they captured 20 "high-value" targets in 2025. The bulk of the violence was concentrated in the coastal province of Guayas, home to the major port city of Guayaquil.

Noboa, who has declared several states of emergency, recently mobilized over 10,000 soldiers to the country's three most violent provinces in response to the crisis.

Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Tuesday, Noboa told attendees that Ecuador was fighting a "complete war against evil and narco-terrorism."</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 20:16:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>EU vows 'unflinching' response to Trump's Greenland gambit</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/eu-vows-unflinching-response-to-trump-s-greenland-gambit</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 20:16:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/013b9692-f639-11f0-9625-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260120-203249-203437-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Almost half of Kyiv without heat, power, after Russian attack</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/almost-half-of-kyiv-without-heat-power-after-russian-attack</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 20:16:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/54cc4bf4-f638-11f0-8228-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260120-203452-203642-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>After Trump salvo, Macron says: we don't give in to bullies</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/after-trump-salvo-macron-says-we-don-t-give-in-to-bullies</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 20:16:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/f8a678d2-f636-11f0-9bd8-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260120-202619-202806-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>State Department approves potential sale of aircraft, torpedoes to Singapore for $2.3 billion, Pentagon says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/state-department-approves-potential-sale-aircraft-torpedoes-singapore-23-billion-2026-01-20/</link><description>Jan 20 (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department has approved the potential sale of maritime patrol and reconnaissance aircraft and lightweight torpedoes and related equipment to Singapore in a deal valued at an estimated $2.3 billion, the Pentagon said on Tuesday.

The players and coaches brandished their trophy from an open-top bus which inched its way through immense crowds across the capital, winding towards the country's presidential palace.

As the players travelled the final stretch of their journey along the city's oceanside highway, the Corniche, fans walked and sometimes ran alongside the bus, with throngs of people lining the sidewalks.

Downtown was overcome by a fever pitch of almost deafening noise -- revving engines, horns, vuvuzelas and shouting -- as the players neared the palace, where they will be officially received.

In the morning, thousands had gathered at the parade's starting point in Patte d'Oie, a working-class neighbourhood across town, wearing team jerseys, chanting, whistling and blowing vuvuzelas.

All along the route old and young, men and women turned out decked in the country's green, yellow and red colours, sometimes watching on from buildings and bridges, or even climbing on top of cars and billboards.

Security forces were also present in large numbers, including anti-riot police.

The Senegal team made its way across the capital after arriving on a special flight from Morocco shortly before midnight on Monday, where they were greeted by President Bassirou Diomaye Faye , Prime Minister Ousmane Sonko and other members of the government.Senegal won the Africa Cup of Nations when they beat hosts Morocco 1-0 in a chaotic final in Rabat on Sunday that saw the eventual champions storm off the pitch late in the game.

"I wouldn't have missed this moment for the world," 26-year-old fan Doudou Thiam told AFP from the parade's sidelines in the Bourguiba neighbourhood, wearing a Senegal jersey.

"The Lions are our pride and they deserve all the honours. Even if it meant staying here all day, I would have done it", he said.

A ruckus of whistles and horns has been almost constant since Senegal's victory on Sunday night, when fans flooded the streets, filling the air with honking, fireworks and the deafening roar of vuvuzelas.

The win marked Senegal's second title, after their 2022 victory over Egypt in Cameroon . It was the team's third final in just the last four editions.

Hortense Kenny brought her five-year-old child to Patte d'Oie to watch the parade.

"The Lions made an entire nation proud, beating the host country in those circumstances," she told AFP, referring to the end of the match.

"Now, all that's left is to win the World Cup. With Sadio Mane, anything is possible," she said, referencing the team's biggest star.

His role as peacemaker during the final -- he was the one who stayed on the pitch and persuaded his teammates to return -- has been widely praised.

Nearby Abdulai Sy, a 49-year-old, told AFP he felt personally touched by the victory which gave him a "big sense of pride to also be Senegalese".

Tuesday's crowd seemed unphased by a cloud of controversy surrounding their team's decision to storm off the pitch late in normal time in protest at a penalty awarded to Morocco.

Prompted by Mane, they returned to the pitch and an attempted 'Panenka' penalty from Morocco's Brahim Diaz was easily saved by Senegal's goalkeeper before Pape Gueye won the game with a superb shot in extra time that stunned the Moroccan crowd.

The Moroccan FA said it had referred the incidents, including protests from Senegal players and fans, to the Confederation of African Football and FIFA .

Far from Morocco, football's lucrative business side had trickled down even to the streets of Dakar on Tuesday.

Amath Ndiaye, a 36-year-old street vendor who usually sells tissues, told AFP he has switched to hawking jerseys, flags, vuvuzelas and whistles for the duration of AFCON and the celebratory aftermath.

On Tuesday, he was basking in the wisdom of his decision.

"I'm doing well," he told AFP from Patte d'Oie, near the joyous crowd decked out in patriotic Senegalese gear and waving flags.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 20:55:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/f1055096-f620-11f0-a539-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-20T163356Z-1425771790-UP1EM1K1A0IXA-RTRMADP-3-SOCCER-NATIONS-SEN-MAR-PARADE.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>How has Trump's one year in office weighed on the war in Ukraine?</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/how-has-trump-s-one-year-in-office-weighed-on-the-war-in-ukraine</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 20:55:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/9a061e5e-f63b-11f0-a67c-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260120-203845-204040-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Standoff with Iran over inspections cannot go on forever, IAEA chief says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/standoff-with-iran-over-inspections-cannot-go-forever-iaea-chief-says-2026-01-20/</link><description>DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 20 (Reuters) - The standoff with Iran over accounting for its stock of highly enriched uranium and inspecting nuclear facilities bombed by the United States and Israel cannot go on forever, U.N. nuclear watchdog chief Rafael Grossi said on Tuesday.

The International Atomic Energy Agency has inspected all 13 declared nuclear facilities in Iran that were not bombed, but has been unable to inspect any of the three key sites that were bombed in June - Natanz, Fordow or Isfahan - Grossi told Reuters in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos.

Iran must first file a report to the IAEA on what happened to those sites and material, including an estimated 440.9 kg of uranium enriched to up to 60% purity, close to the roughly 90% weapons-grade level. That is enough material, if enriched further, for 10 nuclear bombs, according to an IAEA yardstick.

Iran has not submitted that special report to the IAEA.

"This cannot go on forever because at some point, I will have to say, 'Well, I don't have any idea where this material is,'" which would mean there was no guarantee the material had not been diverted or hidden, Grossi said.

"I do not have that conviction or conclusion at the moment, but what we are saying to Iran is that they need to engage."

Iran says it is fully cooperating with the IAEA. Its government could not immediately be reached for comment.

It is now at least seven months since the IAEA last verified Iran's stock of highly enriched uranium. Its own guidance is that it should be done monthly.

Grossi said he was exercising "diplomatic prudence," but that Iran had to meet its obligations as a party to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.

"This cannot go on like this for a long time without me, unfortunately, having to declare them in non-compliance," he said, noting that parties to the NPT do not have an "a la carte" option where they can pick and choose what to comply with.

Asked if the issue could be resolved this spring, he said: "That is a reasonable time frame."

One of the "real world" realities Grossi said he must face is the influence of diplomatic efforts aimed at reaching a broader agreement between Iran and the United States that have been spearheaded by U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff.

"I cannot ignore it, and I wish it well so that there can be an understanding without the looming threat of new military activity over there or something of the sort," he said.

The IAEA said in November it had inspected most of Iran's nuclear facilities that were not struck in the U.S. and Israeli attacks. It has since carried out further inspections until late December, Grossi said.

It was not possible, however, to carry out inspections during civil unrest, he said, referring to recent protests that prompted a severe crackdown by the Islamic Republic. Iranian officials have indicated the unrest has stopped, he said.

"They said that things are calm and they are in control, etc.," Grossi said. "If this is the situation, shouldn't we resume (inspections)?"

Grossi said he would meet Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi in "a matter of days, weeks."</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 21:21:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/FOYYCWIJ2JLDZDLJL6YNE25GVI.jpg?auth=d1fc1a25c77395ff400f33e85718307c027cd305df93252ec659d70cb3628f2f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump on Greenland: we'll work out something to make US and NATO 'very happy'</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-greenland-well-work-out-something-make-us-nato-very-happy-2026-01-20/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 20 (Reuters) - The United States and NATO will come to an agreement on the future of Greenland that will satisfy both sides, U.S. President Donald Trump told a press conference on Tuesday.

Governments around the world have reacted cautiously to Trump's invitation to join that initiative that the U.S. president says aims to resolve conflicts globally, a plan that diplomats said could harm the work of the United Nations.

"Might," Trump said when asked by a reporter if he wanted the "Board of Peace to replace the U.N."

"The U.N. just hasn't been very helpful. I am a big fan of the U.N. potential but it has never lived up to its potential," Trump said in a briefing.

"I believe you got to let the U.N. continue because the potential is so great," he added.

The White House on Friday named some individuals who will sit on the board, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff, former British prime minister Tony Blair and Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner.

A U.N. Security Council resolution , adopted in mid-November, authorized the so-called "Board of Peace" and countries working with it to establish an international stabilization force in Gaza, where a fragile ceasefire began in October under a Trump plan on which Israel and Palestinian militant group Hamas had signed off.

Under Trump's Gaza plan, the board was meant to supervise Gaza's temporary governance. Trump thereafter said the board would be expanded to tackle conflicts around the world.

Observers say such a board could undermine the United Nations. Many rights experts and advocates have also said that Trump overseeing a board to supervise a foreign territory's affairs resembled a colonial structure, while Blair's involvement has been criticized due to his role in the Iraq war and the history of British imperialism in the Middle East.

The ceasefire in Gaza reached under Trump's plan has also been fragile. Over 460 Palestinians, including more than 100 children, and three Israeli soldiers have been reported killed since the truce began in October.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 21:45:10 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/DM24MFBS6RIHTACGKYFGKIXFKQ.jpg?auth=47d55ff1369bc8e5a515ad46e04478ad7c06d89bb4aa112f8ae37a4a81b65020&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuela has received $300 mln in funds from oil sales, acting president says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/venezuelas-top-lawmaker-says-oil-reform-will-add-partnership-model-2026-01-20/</link><description>Jan 20 (Reuters) - Venezuela's interim president Delcy Rodriguez said on Tuesday that the country has received $300 million from oil sales, the first proceeds from U.S. President Donald Trump's announced 50-million-barrel oil supply deal with Caracas, following the capture of President Nicolas Maduro earlier this month.

Trump said separately on Tuesday his country had taken the 50 million barrels out of Venezuela, and was selling some of it in the open market, though shipping records show that volume has not yet been exported.

Reuters reported last week that four Venezuelan banks had been notified by the country's government that they would split $300 million of oil revenues deposited in an account in Qatar, enabling them to sell dollars to Venezuelan companies that need foreign exchange to pay for materials.

"We should inform you that we have gotten funds, from the sale of oil, and we have gotten, of the first $500 million, $300 million," Rodriguez said at an event in Caracas. "These first funds will be used through the exchange market in Venezuela, by national banks and the central bank, to consolidate and stabilize the market and protect the incomes and purchasing power of our workers."

Elsewhere on Tuesday, Rodriguez's brother, lawmaker Jorge Rodriguez, said a reform of the country's main oil law expected to be debated for the first time this week will be based on a partnership structure first introduced during President Nicolas Maduro's administration, though he provided no details.

Interim president Rodriguez told lawmakers last week that the government supported changes to the hydrocarbons law to boost foreign investment. The law has a single contract model of joint ventures controlled by state company PDVSA, but the country has been introducing so-called 'productive participation contracts' for new partnerships in recent years, whose terms have not been fully disclosed.

Those contracts are "a fundamental element to be expressed in the law's reform," Jorge Rodriguez told journalists.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 21:45:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/3J5QIJA4TVNQHHWTPTALVVAGRE.jpg?auth=3e0cc6398f3b967a12178a3a8eb8c0132a330c05b5af45d6422d8dc0f80fcba1&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US subpoenas Minnesota leaders in criminal grand jury probe over opposition to immigration crackdown</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-subpoenas-minnesota-leaders-criminal-grand-jury-probe-over-opposition-2026-01-20/</link><description>Jan 20 (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Justice served grand jury subpoenas to the offices of Minnesota's governor and attorney general, and the mayor of Minneapolis, as it weighs whether their public opposition to President Donald Trump's surge in immigration enforcement amounts to a crime.

One of the subpoenas, shared by Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, orders his office's custodian of records to produce documents since the beginning of 2025 related to "cooperation or lack of cooperation with federal immigration authorities." Six offices were served with subpoenas, according to a Justice Department official, including those of Governor Tim Walz and Attorney General Keith Ellison.

Trump, a Republican, has sent thousands of immigration agents into the Minneapolis area in recent weeks in a highly visible, sometimes violent surge that has little modern precedent. The agents have carried guns through the city's snowy streets, dressed in military-style camouflage gear and masks, drawing loud protests from residents. Trump administration officials have blamed Walz and Frey for the protests, accusations they deny.

The hostility by many residents has only deepened after one agent fatally shot an American woman, Renee Good, in her car nearly two weeks ago. Federal agents have used tear gas and other chemical irritants on protesters, and have drawn outrage for questioning or arresting Black, Latino or Asian U.S. citizens, including a man who was wrongly arrested and pulled out of his home on Sunday dressed in underpants and sandals.

The subpoenas arrived a few days after it became public that the U.S. Justice Department was investigating Walz, Frey and other Democrats and outspoken critics of Trump.

Democratic politicians in Minnesota have called for calm, but have also been sharply critical of what they see as a politically motivated crackdown by Trump, and have sued his administration, asking a judge last week to order an end to what they call the unconstitutional excesses of his enforcement surge.

Walz called the federal investigation "a partisan distraction" that "does not seek justice."

"Minnesotans are more concerned with safety and peace rather than with baseless legal tactics aimed at intimidating public servants standing shoulder to shoulder with their community," his statement said.

Frey said in a statement that the federal government was trying "to intimidate local leaders for doing their jobs" and that "every American should be concerned."
"We shouldn't live in a country where federal law enforcement is used to play politics or crack down on local voices they disagree with," he said.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 21:45:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/3GJDFWQTCBJLRC5CZT7HXF42NA.jpg?auth=2a2a7dc66bf3325f621193e797c9f7f19f21888156e5f6b9b3395ad7d01694d0&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Japan court to rule in trial of man charged with killing ex-PM Abe</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/japan-court-rule-trial-man-charged-with-killing-ex-pm-abe-2026-01-20/</link><description>TOKYO, Jan 21 (Reuters) - A Japanese court will on Wednesday deliver its verdict on a man accused of fatally shooting former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, three and a half years after the assassination of the country's longest-serving premier stunned the nation.

Tetsuya Yamagami, now 45, was arrested on the spot in July 2022 after fatally firing at Abe with a homemade gun while the former prime minister was delivering a campaign speech in the western city of Nara. Abe was 67.

Although he was no longer Japan's leader at the time, Abe remained a powerful and binding force within the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. His absence has left a vacuum within the party, which has since seen two leadership races and by extension, a revolving door of prime ministers.

Abe himself served as prime minister for a total of 3,188 days over two separate terms, stepping down in September 2020 citing health reasons.

His protegee Sanae Takaichi now leads Japan and the LDP, but the party's grip on power has considerably diminished.

Abe's killing also brought to light a deep link between his party and the Unification Church, an organisation many consider a cult. An in-party investigation found that more than a hundred lawmakers had dealings with the group, leading many voters to shun the LDP, which has ruled Japan for most of the post-war period.

Media have quoted Yamagami as telling the court that he held a grudge against the Unification Church after his mother's large donation to it caused financial hardship for their family, and that he took out his anger on Abe because the former prime minister had once sent a video message to an event held by a group affiliated with the church.

Founded in South Korea in 1954, the Unification Church is famous for its mass weddings and counts Japanese followers as a key source of income.

A guilty verdict is all but certain after Yamagami admitted to killing Abe in the first court hearing at the Nara District Court in October, and attention is on the severity of the sentence.

Prosecutors sought a life sentence last month, calling the act an "extremely grave incident that is unprecedented in post-war history".

Yamagami's lawyers, meanwhile, argued that the family's misfortune caused by the donation to the Unification Church should be taken into consideration and limit his prison term to 20 years at most.

While Abe was a divisive figure domestically, he was among the few global leaders to have a strong rapport with U.S. President Donald Trump.

Abe was the first foreign leader to meet Trump after his 2016 election victory and the two went on to forge a close bond over rounds of golf in the United States and Japan. Prime Minister Takaichi has repeatedly referenced their friendship in her own dealings with Trump.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 22:23:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/M2LJFLYKQRJQTFWINFD4INZK6U.jpg?auth=29e19204b93ca8621c4de77775ef7fd4731257e46566db026b00039170e92d3f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US military seizes another Venezuela-linked tanker in the Caribbean</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/us-military-seizes-another-venezuela-linked-tanker-caribbean-2026-01-20/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 20 (Reuters) - The U.S. military said it seized a Venezuela-linked tanker on Tuesday in the Caribbean, marking the seventh such apprehension since the start of U.S. President Donald Trump's month-long campaign to control Venezuela's oil flows.

As part of the move, which the Trump administration has communicated to some European capitals, the U.S. will eliminate roughly 200 positions from the NATO entities that oversee and plan the alliance's military and intelligence operations, said the sources, who requested anonymity to discuss private diplomatic conversations.

Among the bodies that will be affected, said the sources, are the UK-based NATO Intelligence Fusion Centre and the Allied Special Operations Forces Command in Brussels. Portugal-based STRIKFORNATO, which oversees some maritime operations, will also be cut, as will several other similar NATO entities, the sources said.

The sources did not specify why the U.S. had decided to cut the number of staff dedicated to the NATO roles, but the moves broadly align with the Trump administration's stated intention to shift more resources toward the Western Hemisphere.

The Washington Post first reported the decision.

The changes are small relative to the size of the U.S. military force stationed in Europe and do not necessarily signal a broader U.S. shift away from the continent. Around 80,000 military personnel are stationed in Europe, almost half of them in Germany.

But the moves are nonetheless likely to stoke European anxiety about the future of the alliance, which is already running high given U.S. President Donald Trump's stepped-up campaign to wrest Greenland away from Denmark, raising the unprecedented prospect of territorial aggression within NATO.

On Tuesday morning, the U.S. president, who is scheduled to fly to the World Economic Forum in Switzerland in the evening, shared another user's post on social media that identified NATO as a threat to the United States. The post described China and Russia as merely "boogeymen."

Asked for comment, a NATO official said changes to U.S. staffing are not unusual and that the U.S. presence in Europe is larger than it has been in years.

"NATO and U.S. authorities are in close contact about our overall posture – to ensure NATO retains our robust capacity to deter and defend," the NATO official said.

The White House and the Pentagon did not respond to requests for comment.

Reuters could not obtain a full list of NATO entities that will be affected by the new policy. About 400 U.S. personnel are stationed within the entities that will see cuts, one of the sources said, meaning the total number of Americans at the affected NATO bodies will be reduced by roughly half.

Rather than recalling servicemembers from their current posts, the U.S. will for the most part decline to backfill them as they move on from their positions, the sources said.

The drawdown comes as the alliance traverses one of the most diplomatically fraught moments in its 77-year history.

Trump famously threatened to withdraw from NATO during his first presidential term and said on the campaign trail that he would encourage Russian President Vladimir Putin to attack NATO members that did not pay their fair share on defense.

But he appeared to warm to NATO over the first half of 2025, effusively praising NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte and other European leaders after they agreed to boost defense spending at a June summit.

In recent weeks, however, his administration has again provoked alarm across Europe.

In early December, Pentagon officials told diplomats that the U.S. wants Europe to take over the majority of NATO's conventional defense capabilities, from intelligence to missiles, by 2027, a deadline that struck European officials as unrealistic.

A key U.S. national security document released shortly after called for the U.S. to dedicate more of its military resources to the Western Hemisphere, calling into question whether Europe will continue to be a priority theater for the U.S.

In the first weeks of 2026, Trump has revived his longstanding campaign to acquire Greenland, an overseas territory of Denmark, enraging officials in Copenhagen and throughout Europe, many of whom believe any territorial aggression within the alliance would mark the end of NATO.

Over the weekend, Trump said he would slap several NATO countries with tariffs starting February 1 due to their support for Denmark's sovereignty over the island. That has caused European Union officials to mull retaliatory tariffs of their own.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 22:25:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HS2QET6Y6JNCRDHJOGC2WDFL44.jpg?auth=d9fe88693e715a4f63c1d3504eb8f8daab7c382ec2a87c438692ca4bb6ecd1c9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump has a 'unique, sometimes strange affinity' with Vladimir Putin</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/trump-has-a-unique-sometimes-strange-affinity-with-vladimir-putin</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 22:26:39 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/eb8e9b02-f64a-11f0-a200-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260120-223119-224318-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Spain’s train crash death toll rises to 42, casts a shadow on world-class rail system</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260120-spain-s-train-crash-death-toll-rises-to-42-casts-a-shadow-on-world-class-rail-system</link><description>The deadly train wreck in southern Spain has cast a pall over one of the nation’s symbols of success.

Sunday's collision killed at least 42 people and injured dozens more, according to officials on Tuesday.

“It is undoubtably a hard blow, and I have to work so it doesn’t affect the credibility and strength of the network,” Spanish Transport Minister Oscar Puente told Spanish national radio RNE when asked about the knock to the reputation of the rail system.

On Tuesday night, a Barcelona commuter train crashed after a retaining wall fell onto the tracks, Spanish emergency services reported. Officials said 15 people were affected, but did not specify if they were injured. The incident happened just two days after the deadly collision in southern Spain.

Here's a look at the history of a rail network that became a crown jewel of contemporary Spain, by the numbers.

The time since Spain inaugurated its first high-speed AVE, which means “bird” in Spanish.

Both before and after that milestone, successive Spanish governments devoted tax revenues and European Union development aid to its high-speed rail network that quickly caught up with and surpassed high-speed pioneers Japan and France .

The first high-speed train to speed across Spain preceded the opening of the 1992 Summer Olympic Games in Barcelona by two months.

Both marked high points in Spain’s recent history after it emerged from the economic doldrums and cultural and political isolation of the 20th-century dictatorship of Gen. Francisco Franco .

The length, equal to 2,400 miles, of high-speed rail that Spain has laid over the past three-plus decades for its 49 million residents.

Only China — with 45,000 kilometers (28,000 miles) for its 1.4 billion people — has more high-speed track, according to the International Union of Railways.

Spain's commitment to high-speed rail, which the railway union defines as rails for trains going 250 kph (155 mph), has helped Spain shed its reputation of often being behind the industrial curve compared to other leading economies.

Spain’s train builders have been able to capitalize on its domestic expansion. A Spanish consortium built Saudi Arabia’s high-speed line connecting the holy cities of Mecca and Medina that opened service in 2018.

The approximate time a train trip took between Madrid and Barcelona before and after the 2008 adoption of high-speed rail.

On an old, slow train, the 600-kilometer (385-mile) journey between Spain’s biggest cities used to take around seven hours, meaning many business travelers opted to take a plane.

Now that trip can be done in 2½ hours, and Spain announced plans in November to modernize the Madrid-Barcelona line to allow trains to reach 350 kph (218 mph), matching the fastest Chinese trains. That would bring the transit time down to less than two hours.

The AVE has helped unite a country whose main population centers other than Madrid are located on its coasts, separated by some of the most sparsely populated areas in Europe.

Every region and provincial capital has pushed hard for its own high-speed line. Some critics say the administrations may have spent too much on questionable lines to the detriment of investing in local commuter lines, which suffer many more delays than high-speed rail does.

Missing out on an AVE line and stop has become synonymous with economic decline for a provincial city.

“The high-speed train has proven to be a catalyst for the nation’s society and economy,” Zacarias Grande, professor of civil engineering of the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya told The Associated Press.

“It has tightened links between Spain’s different regions over its three decades, significantly boosting business relations and their cultural, technological and professional development.”

The move away from air travel to rail also remains a key plank of Spain’s green energy and electrification plan to fight climate change .

The number of deadly crashes on a stretch of high-speed rail tracks in Spain’s history. One official described Sunday’s collision as transforming a train into a “mass of twisted metal.”

Spanish officials say they are still at a loss to understand what went wrong Sunday night when one high-speed train jumped the track and collided with another fast train going in the other direction.

Álvaro Fernández, the president of public train company Renfe, told Spanish public radio station RNE that both trains were traveling well under the speed limit and “human error could be ruled out.”

One of the two trains was operated by Renfe and another by a private company.

Spain’s worst train crash this century occurred in 2013, when 80 people died after a train derailed in the country’s northwest on a track that wasn't designed for high speeds. While the train itself was capable of high-speed travel, an investigation concluded that it was going 179 kph (111 mph) on a stretch with an 80 kph (50 mph) speed limit when it left the tracks.

The number of operators with high-speed trains in Spain.

Only recently did Spain open its rail network to private companies to compete against Renfe.

The first private company to get into Spain's high-speed rail market was the French-owned Ouigo in 2021. The Italian-owned Iryo followed in 2022.

It was an Iryo train that first derailed on Sunday, knocking the Renfe train off its track. Iryo has said that it's working with officials to determine the causes of the crash.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 22:26:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/f3b3b384-f646-11f0-b309-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26020623207379.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>How has Trump reshaped the White House?</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/how-has-trump-reshaped-the-white-house</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 22:26:44 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/d73e55ec-f641-11f0-8494-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260120-210313-211456-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'A lot of rosy rhetoric, but the jobs numbers are just not there for Trump'</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/a-lot-of-rosy-rhetoric-but-the-jobs-numbers-are-just-not-there-for-trump</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 22:26:47 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/bb6dd3c6-f63f-11f0-93c6-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260120-211851-212652-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Thousands protest against Trump immigration policies</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/thousands-protest-against-trump-immigration-policies-2026-01-20/</link><description>Jan 20 (Reuters) - Thousands of U.S. workers and students marched through cities and university campuses on Tuesday in opposition to the immigration policies of President Donald Trump.

On the first anniversary of Trump's second term, protests sprang up across the country against his aggressive immigration crackdown that prompted outrage after federal agents dragged a U.S. citizen from her car and shot dead activist Renee Good in Minneapolis in past weeks.

Hundreds of protesters gathered in Washington and smaller cities like Asheville, North Carolina, where demonstrators marched through the downtown shouting "No ICE, no KKK, no fascist USA," according to online videos.

The Trump administration says it has a mandate from voters to deport millions of immigrants in the country illegally. Recent polls show most Americans disapprove of the use of force by officers with Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other federal agencies.

University students demonstrated in Cleveland, Ohio, chanting "No hate, no fear, refugees are welcome here" while high schoolers in Santa Fe, New Mexico, left class to attend a "Stop ICE Terror" rally at the state capitol, according to protest organizers and school officials.

The actions were organized by left-leaning groups such as Indivisible and 50501, as well as labor unions and grassroots organizations opposed to immigrant detention camps, like one in El Paso, Texas, where three detainees have died in the last six weeks, according to federal authorities.

The demonstrations were set to roll west to cities such as San Francisco and Seattle, where afternoon and evening protests were planned.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 22:46:58 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/DD6WW5YG6ZIWLL4KIY3APILJ5Y.jpg?auth=6d6cbb910a2b326c2444c9e22c4de0e7d3745be4188ab18e8f8967ac68fdb32e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Severe weather in New Zealand's North Island prompts evacuations</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/severe-weather-new-zealands-north-island-prompts-evacuations-2026-01-20/</link><description>WELLINGTON, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Authorities urged evacuations in some low-lying areas of New Zealand's North Island on Wednesday and police searched for a missing man who was swept away in a river after continued heavy rain and strong winds triggered flooding, swollen rivers and landslides.

Local councils across the north asked residents in flood-prone areas to move to higher ground and others to prepare to evacuate if needed. Several roads were closed because of slips and flooding, the New Zealand Transport Agency said.

Images shared on news sites showed flooded farmland and surface water across roads.

Police said a man was missing after he was washed away with his vehicle during a river crossing near Warkworth earlier on Wednesday.

Emergency Management and Recovery Minister Mark Mitchell told Radio New Zealand he was most concerned about the Northland region, including the town of Oakura and surrounding areas.

"They're basically fully saturated in terms of the ground ... and we've got more coming," Mitchell said.

National forecaster MetService issued warnings for much of the top half of the North Island, saying there was a threat to life from dangerous river conditions, significant flooding and landslides, with travel disruption likely and some communities potentially isolated.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 23:23:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US military seizes seventh Venezuela-linked tanker amid Trump oil crackdown</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260120-us-military-venezuela-trump-oil</link><description>US military forces boarded and took control of a seventh oil tanker connected with Venezuela on Tuesday as part of the Trump administration's broader efforts to take control of the South American country's oil.

US Southern Command said in a social media post that US forces apprehended the Motor Vessel Sagitta “without incident” and that the tanker was operating in defiance of President Donald Trump ’s "established quarantine of sanctioned vessels in the Caribbean.”

The military command did not say whether the US Coast Guard took control of the tanker as has been the case in prior seizures. The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for more details. Southern Command said it had nothing to add to its post.

The Sagitta is a Liberian-flagged tanker and its registration says it is owned and managed by a company in Hong Kong. The ship last transmitted its location more than two months ago when exiting the Baltic Sea in northern Europe.

The tanker was sanctioned by the US Treasury Department under an executive order related to Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

The post from US Southern Command indicated the ship had taken oil from Venezuela. It said the capture of the tanker “demonstrates our resolve to ensure that the only oil leaving Venezuela will be oil that is coordinated properly and lawfully.”

The military command posted what appeared to be aerial footage of the Sagitta sailing on the ocean, but unlike in prior videos the clip did not show US forces flying toward it in helicopters or landing on the deck of the ship.

Since the US ouster of Venezuela President Nicolás Maduro in a surprise nighttime raid on Jan. 3, the Trump administration has set out to control the production, refining and global distribution of Venezuela’s oil products.

Officials in Trump’s Republican administration have made it clear they see seizing the tankers as a way to generate cash as they seek to rebuild Venezuela’s battered oil industry and restore its economy.

Trump met with executives from oil companies nearly two weeks ago to discuss his goal of investing $100 billion in Venezuela to repair and upgrade its oil production and distribution. He said at the time that the US expected to sell at least 30 million to 50 million barrels of Venezuelan oil.

Trump told reporters on Tuesday that the US already has taken 50 million barrels of oil out of Venezuela.

“We’ve got millions of barrels of oil left,” he said at the White House. “We’re selling it on the open market. We’re bringing down oil prices incredibly.”

The first tanker was seized off the coast of Venezuela on Dec. 10. Most of the other tankers also have been captured in the waters near Venezuela, with the exception of the Bella 1, which was captured in the North Atlantic.

The Bella 1 had been cruising across the Atlantic and nearing the Caribbean when on Dec. 15 it abruptly turned and headed north, toward Europe. The ship was ultimately captured on Jan. 8.

Speaking at the White House briefing room podium, Trump repeatedly veered off message. He mused about the Nile River being in Egypt, joked about renaming the Gulf of Mexico the Gulf of Trump, made demeaning comments about Somali Americans, complained about not getting enough credit for his record and professed admiration for the controversial Hells Angels motorcycle club. "They voted for me," Trump said.

The surprise appearance shortly before he was due to fly to Switzerland to join other world leaders at the World Economic Forum was meant to focus on Trump's achievements during his first year back in office.

But in an 81-minute opening monologue full of superlatives, he veered between self-congratulatory and defensive, and his core message was often lost. He then took questions from reporters for 24 minutes, for a total time behind the podium of one hour and 45 minutes.

Immigration and crime dominated Trump's remarks. He described U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, especially those currently involved in an immigration crackdown in Minnesota, as patriots and decried people protesting against them as paid agitators. A federal agent shot and killed a U.S. citizen there this month.

Trump this year has deployed the National Guard to Democratic-run cities, and he has threatened to deploy the regular military to Minnesota, moves that have drawn opposition from local officials. "To me a town, it looks better when you have military people," Trump said.

Without providing data, he also said Washington had less crime since National Guard troops arrived in the U.S. capital last summer. "Your lover's not going to be killed" walking through the city, Trump said.

In remarks that echoed a 2024 campaign speech, Trump repeated many talking points from the last election. He castigated his predecessor, Democrat Joe Biden, and again falsely claimed the 2020 presidential election was stolen from him.

Trump paged through a thick wad of printouts entitled "365 Wins in 365 Days," a compilation of what the administration cited as daily achievements since his second inauguration on January 20, 2025.

It pointed to accomplishments from drastically reducing the number of immigrants entering the country illegally to improving consumer choice for shower heads and toilets.

At one point, Trump took a large binder clip off the sheaf of papers and joked it could have taken his finger off, saying it had probably been meant to hurt him. "I wouldn't have shown the pain," he said.

He spent the first 15 minutes displaying mugshots of Minnesota residents who he said were in the country illegally and had been arrested for serious crimes. After he finished, he tossed the pictures onto the floor next to him.

Trump demonized Somali immigrants, calling them "very low IQ people" and repeated his false assertion that Somalia was not even a country. Trump has justified his Minnesota immigration crackdown partly as a response to fraud involving federal hunger programs by charities and organizations linked to the Somali community there.

Trump also reiterated his exaggerated claim that he has helped end eight foreign wars. He has repeatedly said that he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize, which he did not win in December, and has cited that omission as one reason for his push to acquire the Danish territory of Greenland.

He added on Tuesday he did not believe the Norwegian government's statement that it does not control the Nobel Foundation, which awards the prize.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 23:45:03 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4AG5SJULMJJHZF7BGVC2ZTKL5M.jpg?auth=f3b12cdfe5a775ce4c6f325af497a41521f6810a6e11b2fe3eb72bd7c353514b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Mexico sends 37 more cartel suspects to US amid rising tensions</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/mexico-sends-37-more-cartel-suspects-us-amid-rising-tensions-2026-01-20/</link><description>MEXICO CITY, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Mexico has sent another 37 alleged members of criminal organizations to the United States, Mexico's security minister said on Tuesday.

The handover of alleged cartel members is the third major transfer in the past year and brings the total number of transferred inmates to 92.

The latest swap occurred amid growing tension with Washington over cartel activity and repeated threats by U.S. President Donald Trump to attack cartels with or without Mexican involvement.

The recent set of prisoners was sought by the U.S. for their links with criminal organizations and because they presented public safety risks, Mexico's military authorities said in a statement.

"With this transfer, 92 high-impact criminals have now been sent to the U.S. during this administration, preventing them from generating violence in our country," Mexican Security Minister Omar Garcia Harfuch said on social media.

The inmates were flown to Washington, Houston, New York, Pennsylvania, San Antonio, and San Diego aboard seven Mexican Armed Forces aircraft.

Among them was Pedro Inzunza Noriega, the father of the second-in-command of the powerful Beltran Leyva cartel, who was arrested in December 2025 after the U.S. named him in its first terrorism indictment against a Mexican drug trafficker.

Mexican lawmakers and legal experts have disputed the political and legal grounds for the prisoner transfers.

They are occurring as Trump has increased pressure on Mexico over the cartels and the violence they cause, including his demands to deploy U.S. military forces against cartels within Mexican territory.

Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has ruled out U.S. military intervention to combat drug cartels, following what she called a good conversation with Trump on January 12.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio also spoke with Mexican Foreign Minister Juan Ramon de la Fuente in early January about the need for stronger cooperation to dismantle Mexico's violent narco-terrorist networks and stop fentanyl and weapons trafficking.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 23:46:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Chile’s Kast names future cabinet, taps Jorge Quiroz as finance minister</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/chiles-kast-names-future-cabinet-taps-jorge-quiroz-finance-minister-2026-01-21/</link><description>SANTIAGO, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Chile's President-elect Jose Antonio Kast on Tuesday appointed Jorge Quiroz as Finance Minister and named other members of his cabinet ahead of taking office on March 11.

Kast also named Daniel Mas as head of the mining ministry. Chile is the world's largest copper producer and second-largest lithium producer.

The incoming president had previously informed business leaders of his plans to appoint Quiroz.

Quiroz, who holds a doctorate from Duke University in the United States, was the principal advisor for Kast's economic program. Quiroz has said Chile's economy is facing a "decline" from which it can recover by addressing issues such as security, deregulation, reducing the corporate tax rate, and implementing fiscal adjustments—the latter being a point of contention during the presidential campaign.

Mas, a businessman and current vice president of the country's Confederation of Production and Commerce, has had a long career in the private sector, working in construction, real estate, and the financial services industries. He will simultaneously serve as Chile's minister of economic development.

Kast also appointed two attorneys who had previously defended Augusto Pinochet, the dictator who ruled Chile with an iron fist from 1973 to 1990.

Human rights groups and family members of people killed during the dictatorship criticized the nomination of Fernando Rabat when rumors of his appointment leaked. Rabat, who defended Pinochet in an illicit funds case, will now lead the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights, which is still overseeing cases linked to the dictatorship.

Defense minister Fernando Barros was also a vocal defender of Pinochet after he was detained in London in 1998, working to free the former dictator.

Kast also appointed Francisco Perez Mackenna as Minister of Foreign Affairs. For nearly three decades, Perez Mackenna led the business holdings of the billionaire Luksic family, one of Chile's richest families. Daniel Mas was named as head of the ministry responsible for economic development.

Trinidad Steinert, a chief prosecutor in the northern region of Tarapaca, will lead the Ministry of Public Security, a central role in fulfilling Kast's campaign promise to crack down on crime.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 01:50:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WU44OHJFCJKY7GAF34KN6LFH6Y.jpg?auth=9aa576d2a0ea9ebc5c68e22f917df9c032883032a78f38525907e57840f20435&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US troops could disobey questionable orders, Catholic archbishop says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us-troops-could-disobey-questionable-orders-catholic-archbishop-says-2026-01-20/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 20 (Reuters) - The Catholic archbishop overseeing the church's work with members of the U.S. military said it would be "morally acceptable" for troops to disobey orders that went against their consciences.

Archbishop Timothy Broglio said he was worried some members of the military could be put into situations where they are ordered to do something considered "morally questionable."

Broglio, who also heads the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, told BBC News on Sunday that "it would be morally acceptable to disobey that order but that's perhaps putting that individual in an untenable situation and that's my concern."

Broglio did not indicate what he considered a morally questionable order.

His comments come as President Donald Trump has sought to deploy troops onto the streets of U.S. cities and threatens possible military action to take control of Greenland.

The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Earlier this month, Trump told The New York Times he is constrained only by his "own morality."

The archbishop expressed concern over Trump's comments, suggesting that international law and one's own moral principles should go hand in hand.

He said it does not seem reasonable for the U.S. to attack and occupy Greenland, which is governed by Denmark, a NATO ally.

"It'd be one thing if the people of Greenland wanted to, wanted to be annexed, that would be one situation," Broglio said. "But taking it by force when we already have treaties there that allow for a military installation in Greenland? It doesn't seem necessary."

Broglio is the latest leader of the Catholic Church to raise concerns about Trump's demands. On Monday, three fellow archbishops decried the direction of U.S. foreign policy. Church leaders have also pushed back on the Trump administration's immigration agenda .

Six Democratic members of the U.S. Congress in a video last year reminded members of the military that it was their duty to reject unlawful orders, drawing reproach from the Trump administration, including a Pentagon decision to demote Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona from his rank of retired Navy captain.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 01:50:33 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4YYF2OEDLNLPFO3TRZRDHJUDRQ.jpg?auth=0a0059a15eb4f718e1f646eac530076279e56cb0efce2bfadef1fea4ecce2c61&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>New Zealand to hold general election on November 7</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/new-zealand-hold-general-election-november-7-2026-01-20/</link><description>WELLINGTON, Jan 21 (Reuters) - New Zealand’s prime minister Christopher Luxon said on Wednesday the country’s parliamentary elections will be held on Saturday November 7.

The conservative government, a coalition between the major centre-right National party and minority parties New Zealand First and ACT, has been in power since the 2023 election.

"Kiwis will have to weigh up who is best placed to provide stable and strong government in a very volatile and uncertain world, a strong economy with responsible spending, lower taxes and more opportunity for you and your family," Luxon told a press conference announcing the date.

Luxon, a former airline executive turned prime minister, has seen his popularity fall over the past year amid a weakening economy.

Current opinion polls indicate a tight contest with neither the ruling coalition nor the centre-left Labour Party led by former prime minister Chris Hipkins appearing to command majority support.

New Zealand has used a mixed-member proportional (MMP) system since 1996, and this has made coalitions the norm.

New Zealand's parliament has a three-year term and the last legal date that the next general election can be held is 19 December 2026.

For many voters, the economy remains their key concern with growth over the past two years soft, houses prices remaining well below their 2021 peak and unemployment sitting above 5%. The government will be banking on the economy continuing to improved this year following on from a 1.1% rise in the third quarter to reassure voters.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 01:50:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/2JHCCI5NLJIEXI3QTOKX7RRFDY.jpg?auth=719cc6fb97b3dc2441f64f6ea4b0c449aff4c435ae843242fd91395b4254532a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>South Korea's Lee plays down proposed US chip tariffs, warns of higher prices</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/south-koreas-lee-plays-down-proposed-us-chip-tariffs-warns-higher-prices-2026-01-21/</link><description>SEOUL, Jan 21 (Reuters) - South Korean President Lee Jae Myung said on Wednesday if Washington introduced higher U.S. tariffs on semiconductor imports, it would likely boost U.S. prices, playing down concerns about the proposed 100% duty.

U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has said that South Korean and Taiwanese chipmakers may face tariffs of up to 100% unless they commit to increased production on American soil.

Lee said that given South Korean and Taiwanese chipmakers' dominance of the market, a 100% U.S. import duty would likely sharply raise prices for chip products in the United States.

"They have a monopoly of 80 to 90% ... so most of it is likely to be passed on to U.S. prices," Lee told a news conference.

South Korea already has safeguards in place under a trade agreement with the U.S. to ensure its chipmakers would not be left at a disadvantage to Taiwanese or any other global competitors, Lee said.

South Korea’s exports hit a record high of $709.4 billion in 2025, up 3.8% from a year earlier, as semiconductor shipments jumped 22% on strong demand for artificial intelligence investments.

Chip exports to the U.S. accounted for 8% of the total $173.4 billion semiconductor exports, while China remained the biggest market, followed by Taiwan and Vietnam.

Lee also touched on the slumping won in his remarks, citing expectations by South Korean authorities that the currency would strengthen to around the 1,400 per dollar level in a month or two.

The president noted, however, that domestic policies alone would not be sufficient to stabilise foreign exchange markets, as it was somewhat correlated with weakness in the Japanese yen , adding that the won was faring comparably better.

Lee said he was pursuing diplomatic efforts to enable North Korea and the U.S. to resume dialogue and that a pragmatic approach was needed to deal with Pyongyang, which was continuing to stockpile nuclear arms.

"There is a benefit to making the North stop making nuclear materials and not export nukes and stop developing ICBMs," he said, referring to intercontinental ballistic missiles, adding it would be hard to imagine the North would actually give up its nuclear weapons programme.

North Korea has so far snubbed outreach by Lee and U.S. President Donald Trump to resume dialogue. The talks have stalled since Trump met the North's leader Kim Jong Un in 2019, amid disagreement over lifting sanctions against Pyongyang and nuclear dismantlement.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 03:44:43 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CP63YJFHCVMPVDD4JCWHVNOJWQ.jpg?auth=0870d2be13c0ad3e1d3acacfc5e72f98ba783f46920c4f0347ef7343f58ebdd7&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump says he had a 'very good call' with Turkish President Erdogan</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-says-he-had-very-good-call-with-turkish-president-erdogan-2026-01-21/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 20 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday he had a "very good call" with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, without elaborating.

On the first anniversary of Trump's second term, protests sprang up across the country against his aggressive immigration crackdown that prompted outrage after federal agents dragged a US citizen from her car and shot dead 37-year-old mother Renee Good in Minneapolis in past weeks.

Hundreds of New Yorkers braved the numbing cold and gathered outside Trump Tower in Manhattan shouting slogans like “We won’t stand for fascism” and singing the Woody Guthrie ballad “This Land Is Your Land.”

There were also protests in Washington and smaller cities like Asheville, North Carolina, where demonstrators marched through the downtown shouting "No ICE, no KKK, no fascist USA," according to online videos.

The Trump administration says it has a mandate from voters to deport millions of immigrants in the country illegally.

Recent polls show most Americans disapprove of the use of force by officers with Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other federal agencies.

University students demonstrated in Cleveland, Ohio, chanting "No hate, no fear, refugees are welcome here" while high schoolers in Santa Fe, New Mexico, left class to attend a "Stop ICE Terror" rally at the state capitol, according to protest organisers and school officials.

The actions were organized by left-leaning groups such as Indivisible and 50501, as well as labor unions and grassroots organisations opposed to immigrant detention camps, like one in El Paso, Texas, where three detainees have died in the last six weeks, according to federal authorities.

The demonstrations were set to roll west to cities such as San Francisco and Seattle, where afternoon and evening protests were planned.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 03:45:12 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/f8e33916-f672-11f0-b67c-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26020831615203.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuela to use US-brokered oil sale to boost battered currency</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260121-venezuela-us-oil-sale-currency</link><description>Venezuela said Tuesday it would start using revenues from a US-brokered oil sale to shore up its battered currency, as families waited in anguish for more prisoners to be released.

Interim president Delcy Rodriguez confirmed that her country had received $300 million from Washington's sale of Venezuelan crude and said she would use it to prop up the bolivar against the dollar.

The dollar is Venezuela's de facto currency, legalised by ousted leader Nicolas Maduro in 2019 to fight hyper inflation .

A six-year-old US embargo on Venezuelan oil has led to a shortage of greenbacks, however, causing the dollar's value to rocket.

On the black market, dollars have traded recently for up to 100 percent more than the official rate.

Rodriguez, who succeeded Maduro after his capture by US forces in a bombing raid on Caracas on January 3, said the new oil revenues would be used to "stabilise" the foreign exchange market.

She added that doing so would help "protect the income and purchasing power of our workers."

US President Donald Trump backed Maduro's former deputy Rodriguez to lead the country, provided she gives US oil majors access to Venezuela's rich oil reserves.

Rodriguez has been trying to appease him without alienating pro-Maduro hardliners in her administration.

On Monday, parliament, which is controlled by her brother Jorge Rodriguez, announced plans to reform 29 laws, including on foreign investment in the oil sector.

Currently, foreign companies are only allowed to operate in joint ventures with state-owned oil firm PDVSA, which insists on holding a majority.

"Foreign investment needs to be protected and profitable," Jorge Rodriguez argued.

In a signal of the government's intent to work with US oil companies, Delcy Rodriguez on Monday appointed a US-educated banker to head the country's main investment agency.

Calixto Ortega, a former head of the country's central bank, was previously posted as a diplomat to Houston, the city at the center of the US oil refining industry.

Ortega replaced Alex Saab , a Colombian-born Venezuelan seen as a frontman for Maduro, who was sacked as industry minister last week.

Trump claims that Washington effectively runs Venezuela since Maduro was snatched from his hideout on a Caracas military base and whisked to a New York jail.

He picked Rodriguez over popular opposition leader, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Maria Corina Machado, to lead the country's transition.

On Tuesday, the Republican leader said he was still in talks with Machado, who presented him with her Nobel medal -- which he openly coveted -- at the White House last week.

"Maybe we can get her involved in some way. I'd love to be able to do that," he told reporters in Washington.

Machado, who is still touring the US capital, insisted Tuesday there could be no real change in Venezuela until all political prisoners are released.

Rodriguez has begun to slowly release some of the estimated 800 political prisoners languishing in the country's penitentiaries.

Several key Maduro opponents still remain behind bars, however.

On Tuesday, the families of 200 prisoners demonstrated outside the prosecutor's office in Caracas to demand proof of life of their loved ones.

Nancy Quinones told AFP she had gone without news of her son, serving a 24-year sentence for his alleged role in a coup attempt, for five months and 18 days.

"Where are they?" one of the placards waved by the demonstrators read.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 03:45:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/77e71f94-ed6c-11f0-9830-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26008705848391.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Live: Trump heads for Davos maelstrom over Greenland</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260121-live-trump-heads-for-davos-maelstrom-over-greenland</link><description>US President Donald Trump descends on Davos for a showdown with European leaders Wednesday as his bid to seize Greenland threatens to tear the transatlantic alliance apart.

Abe, one of Japan’s most influential politicians, was serving as a regular lawmaker after leaving the prime minister's job when he was killed in 2022 while campaigning in the western city of Nara. It shocked a nation with strict gun control.

Tetsuya Yamagami, 45, pleaded guilty to murder in the trial that started in October, and Wednesday’s ruling will determine how long he'll spend in prison.

Yamagami said he killed Abe after seeing a video message the former leader sent to a group affiliated with the Unification Church. He added that his goal was to hurt the church, which he hated, and expose its ties with Abe.

Prosecutors have demanded life imprisonment for Yamagami, while his lawyers have sought a sentence of no more than 20 years, speaking of his troubles as the child of a church adherent.

The revelation of close ties between the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and the church caused the party to pull back from the church. It also prompted investigations that ended with the church's Japanese branch being stripped of its tax-exempt religious status and ordered dissolved.

The killing has also led to officials working to increase police protection of dignitaries.

Abe was shot on July 8, 2022, while giving a speech outside a train station in Nara. In footage captured by television cameras, two gunshots ring out as the politician raises his fist. He collapses holding his chest, his shirt smeared with blood. Officials say Abe died almost instantly.

Yamagami was captured on the spot. He said he initially planned to kill the leader of the Unification Church, but switched targets to Abe because of the difficulty of getting close to the leader.

Yamagami’s case has also brought attention to the children of Unification Church adherents in Japan, and influenced a law meant to restrict malicious donation solicitations by religious and other groups.

Thousands of people have signed a petition requesting leniency for Yamagami, and others have sent care packages to his relatives and the detention center where he's being housed.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 04:48:42 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/b62f178c-9399-11ed-8787-005056a90321/w:1280/p:16x9/AP23013080896870.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>How an Islamist party is gaining ground in Bangladesh, worrying moderates</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/how-an-islamist-party-is-gaining-ground-bangladesh-worrying-moderates-2026-01-21/</link><description>DHAKA, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Long vilified for opposing independence and barred from electoral politics for over a decade, Bangladesh's biggest Islamist party is reinventing itself and attracting new support ahead of parliamentary polls next month, unsettling moderates and minority communities.

Jamaat-e-Islami began its overhaul soon after a youth-led uprising in the Muslim-majority nation of 175 million people toppled Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in August 2024. With Hasina’s Awami League banned , Jamaat is betting on its anti-corruption image, welfare outreach, and what analysts describe as a more inclusive public stance to deliver the party's best-ever performance.

A December opinion poll by the U.S.-based International Republican Institute ranked Jamaat as the most "liked" party and projected a tight race with the Bangladesh Nationalist Party for the top spot in the February 12 election.

"We started welfare politics, not reactionary politics," Jamaat chief Shafiqur Rahman told Reuters, citing its medical camp initiatives, flood relief and aid for families of those killed in the uprising. The UN says as many as 1,400 people lost their lives in the protests.

"The constructive politics, which Jamaat and its associates ... are doing now, people will put their trust and belief in Jamaat-e-Islami," Rahman said.

The party has its origins in the pan-Islamist Jamaat-e-Islami movement, which emerged in India in the early 1940s and called for a society governed by Islamic principles. Jamaat opposed Bangladesh's independence, and during Hasina's rule many of its leaders were executed or jailed in a war crimes tribunal that was criticised by international human rights groups. In 2013, it was barred from elections after a court ruled its charter was in conflict with Bangladesh's secular constitution.

The electoral ban was lifted last year and Jamaat's student wing swept the Dhaka University polls, beating the Gen-Z National Citizen Party formed by leaders of the anti-Hasina movement.

Months later it formed an electoral alliance with the NCP, which some analysts say could help soften Jamaat’s image.

"We want something new and the new option is Jamaat," said Mohammad Jalal, 40, who sells coconut water from a mobile van in a crowded Dhaka market. "They have a clean image and work for the country."

Political analyst and theologian Shafi Md. Mostafa said the party’s shift from a “stigmatised force with limited space” to a “rehabilitated, pragmatic contender” had been helped by public anger over abuses during Hasina's rule.

"The authoritarian tendencies of the Awami League have created widespread frustration, allowing Jamaat to revive its rallying cry of ‘Islam as a solution’ and present itself as a moral alternative,” Mostafa said.

For the first time, Jamaat has nominated a Hindu candidate, and spoken out against recent attacks on minorities. On its website, the party says it wants Bangladesh to be a democracy guided by Islamic principles.

Party leaders have also publicly assured women of equal rights though Jamaat has not named any women as candidates for the 300 parliamentary seats. Rahman said women could gain representation through the 50 seats to be allocated by proportional representation after the election.

Shireen Huq of women's activist organisation Naripokkho said the promises were “an electoral ploy.”

“No matter what they say now, they will return to their dogma, which includes restrictions on women in every sphere,” she said.

Umama Fatema, a 26-year-old student activist who was at the forefront of the uprising, is also sceptical.

“One day they talk about women empowerment, but the next the party will talk about five-hour workdays for women,” she said, referring to the Jamaat chief's suggestion that women work only five hours a day so they can look after their families.

Since Hasina’s exit, Islamist groups have become increasingly emboldened. Hindu and Sufi shrines have been attacked , while events deemed un-Islamic have been targeted, from performances by spiritual folk musicians to women’s football matches.

The interim government has condemned the incidents, pledging “zero tolerance” from law enforcement and promising to protect minorities.

Hindus are the largest minority in Bangladesh, making up about 8% of the population, followed by much smaller numbers of Buddhists and Christians.

"Minorities have never had real protection under any government, but the fear and insecurity we now face is unprecedented," said a minority community leader, requesting anonymity for fear of reprisals.

"If a Jamaat-led coalition comes to power, there is a real risk that Bangladesh will move towards a full-fledged Islamic republic. Today, I fear for my life, and I fear that minorities in Bangladesh may not have a secure future," he added.

Jamaat spokesperson Ahsanul Mahboob Zubair said the party had "never been involved in, nor has it ever supported, any acts of violence or intolerance in the name of religion", and called for an investigation.

Jamaat, which was a junior coalition partner in the BNP-led government from 2001 to 2006, has formed electoral alliances with most of the country’s other Islamist parties, some more conservative.

It began shortlisting election candidates early last year, hiring an international agency to assess voter sentiment.

Last week, Jamaat said it would contest 179 seats, with 74 distributed among the NCP and other allies. A further 47 seats are still to be shared after one party pulled out of the alliance.

"Jamaat approached me in April,” said Mir Ahmad bin Quasem, the son of a Jamaat leader who was hanged for war crimes during Hasina's rule and who spent eight years in secret detention before his release in August 2024.

“They showed me data suggesting people across the country were fed up with the old parties and wanted change. They believed there was a real opportunity — and I joined."

Some say a Jamaat government might also move closer to Pakistan, marking a departure from Hasina’s era when India was the country’s most important bilateral partner. Rahman said that the party was not inclined towards any country.

“We maintain relations in a balanced way with all. We are never interested in leaning towards any one country. Rather, we respect all and want balanced relations among nations," he said.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:54:22 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LLTTBAPX5ZPW7JS6VPDG66OY4E.jpg?auth=1b7e31b43f5b3e0db356f5180c52cc4c96037a9da68b6afd2dd0e34a8aa509b2&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Surging in polls, Thailand's reformist opposition tests new election playbook</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/surging-polls-thailands-reformist-opposition-tests-new-election-playbook-2026-01-21/</link><description>BANGKOK, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Three years ago, a party of reform-minded progressives swept Thailand's election in the wake of mass anti-establishment protests only to be blocked from taking power and forced to disband.

Now reborn as the People's Party, Thai voters are once again backing the progressives' promises of change, making the party the clear frontrunner for the February 8 polls , ahead of rivals that joined forces against its predecessor after the last election in 2023.

Two surveys released in mid-January showed the People's Party and its prime ministerial candidate as the overwhelming favourites, trouncing the ruling Bhumjaithai party and the populist Pheu Thai, which led a previous ruling coalition.

"We are at the best position we've ever been in," Deputy Leader Rangsiman Rome told Reuters, saying its detailed policy proposals were pulling in support alongside efforts to woo the undecided.

"For those that accused us of not being ready to run the country, we are showing them the opposite: that we have the team."

The People's Party will need to win at least 250 of the 500 seats in parliament in order to secure a clear majority.

It is currently at 30% to 34% in most opinion polls, so even if the momentum carries the party to victory, its ability to govern may still be stymied by its rivals.

A surge in nationalism following a fierce border conflict with Cambodia is providing ammunition to the campaigns of Thailand's conservatives, who are using the dispute to attack the People's Party agenda.

The party also faces potential legal action from an anti-graft agency that could suspend dozens of its members and ban them from politics for attempting to amend Thailand's royal insult law in 2021.

The groundwork for the People's Party popularity has been carefully engineered, particularly after the progressives' anti-establishment stance left its forerunner unable to form a government despite winning the last general election .

Move Forward picked up 151 seats in parliament in 2023 on a platform that included reforming the royalist military and breaking up business monopolies.

But a military-appointed Senate blocked its prime ministerial candidate in a parliamentary vote, opening the way for Pheu Thai to govern Southeast Asia's second-largest economy.

It was another round in the decades-long tussle between popular political movements and Thailand's conservative establishment, backed by the military, that has triggered bouts of instability, including violent protests and coups.

Around a year after the election, a Thai court ordered the dissolution of Move Forward, ruling that its campaign to amend a law that protects the monarchy from criticism risked undermining the democratic system.

Within hours of the ruling, its leaders announced they had formed the People's Party.

This time around the progressives appear to be moderating their position, including dropping their call to amend the royal insult law and softening their stance on the military.

Four People's Party members told Reuters that its campaign would double down on promoting detailed governance plans and a new team of experienced professionals.

"We think that it could help restore people's faith and trust in the People's Party," one of them said.

But the strategy of bringing in outside talent has caused upset within the grouping.

Kalyapat Rachitroj, a former lawmaker, resigned from the party earlier this month, arguing that the appointment of outsiders meant long-term members were overlooked.

"You can bring in hundreds more technocrats, professors, PhDs, and elites, but none of them are worth as much as a single idealist who has to leave," she wrote on social media.

The People's Party unveiled its team of experts on January 11, presenting them as potential cabinet ministers, alongside their slate of prime ministerial candidates including leader Natthaphong Ruengpanyawut and key economic strategist Sirikanya Tansakun.

Among the new inductees were former Thai envoy to the U.S. Pisan Manawapat, former law dean at Bangkok's Thammasat University Munin Pongsapan and Peangpanor Boonklum, a veteran corporate lawyer and former PTT (PTT.BK) , opens new tab executive.

"The move allows the party to present their own alternative to Bhumjaithai's team of technocrats, which could help the party pull wavering voters, especially middle-class urbanites," said independent analyst Mathis Lohatepanont.

Bhumjaithai, led by Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul, has named career diplomat and current Foreign Minister Sihasak Phuangketkeow as one of its prime ministerial candidates.

If it returns to power, the ruling party has said business executive Suphajee Suthumpun and former bureaucrat Ekniti Nitithanprapas will continue as commerce and finance ministers.

Although it is still too early to gauge the overall impact of the People's Party's new strategy, the softening of its position on contentious issues gives it more elbow room after the votes are counted, said Lohatepanont.

"This could be seen as both an election strategy to broaden the base and also as a way to ensure that their options are kept as open as possible in forming a government," he said.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:54:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/RCH3BDQD2FIHTHAA4HYJ2KMZGE.jpg?auth=30689fe55d212b51a387d635fc5c967af4418c15162c75c28a52b177843f0e75&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>South Korea court finds ex-PM Han Duck-soo guilty of key action of insurrection over martial law</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/south-korea-court-finds-ex-pm-han-duck-soo-guilty-key-action-insurrection-over-2026-01-21/</link><description>SEOUL, Jan 21 (Reuters) - A South Korean court on Wednesday found former Prime Minister Han Duck-soo guilty of engaging in a key action of insurrection concerning ex-President Yoon Suk Yeol's short-lived declaration of martial law in December 2024.

Campaigning begins on Thursday for Bangladesh's election, which has sparked protests and counter-protests . Ties between the South Asian neighbours soured after former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fled to India in 2024, following deadly protests.

India's withdrawal move was part of "internal readjustments", the official said, without elaborating. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, pointed to Indian media reports of New Delhi's decision.

It was not immediately clear when the families would return.

The foreign ministries of India and Bangladesh did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

In December, India summoned Bangladesh's high commissioner, or ambassador to voice its concern over what it called a deteriorating security situation there, particularly threats targeting the Indian mission in the capital, Dhaka.

The interim government led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus has repeatedly sought Hasina's extradition to Bangladesh, while rejecting New Delhi's concerns over violence targeting members of the minority Hindu community .</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:55:43 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/U7DJCAQO4BJTZLTI7PWC4RAFKE.jpg?auth=da6e3a3cfb88e4cba9df248517cd28f556f931c0ad67f672352ce4809aae84eb&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Thailand's election in numbers</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/thailands-election-numbers-2026-01-21/</link><description>BANGKOK, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Thailand will hold a general election on February 8 in a showdown between three big parties that could lead to its fourth prime minister in less than three years.

Trump, who marked the end of his turbulent first year in office on Tuesday, is expected to overshadow the annual gathering that global elites use to discuss economic trends in the snowy Alpine resort of Davos.

Trump told a news conference on Tuesday that he would have meetings about the Danish territory of Greenland in Davos and was optimistic that an agreement could eventually be made.

"I think we will work something out where NATO is going to be very happy and where we're going to be very happy. But we need it for security purposes. We need it for national security," he said.

Asked how far he is willing to go to acquire Greenland, Trump offered a cryptic response. "You'll find out," he said.

In the days leading up to his visit to Davos, Trump has been unrelenting in making his case that "we need Greenland" as an Arctic security guardpost against Russia and China, and he has threatened a trade war with Europeans who oppose him.

Emboldened by his ousting of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and seizing control of that country's oil, Trump has talked of acting against Cuba and Colombia as well as Iran. He has not ruled out the use of the U.S. military to snatch Greenland, which has an American military base.

Sources familiar with the situation have previously told Reuters that Trump's push on Greenland is related to a legacy-building desire to expand the territory of the United States in the biggest way since 1959. That was when two U.S. territories - Alaska and Hawaii - became the 49th and 50th U.S. states under Republican President Dwight Eisenhower.

NATO leaders have warned that Trump's Greenland strategy could upend the alliance. Trump has linked Greenland to his anger at not receiving a Nobel Peace Prize.

In a breach of diplomatic protocol, Trump released the text of a private message he received from French President Emmanuel Macron in which Macron urged Trump to join him and other G7 leaders in Paris after Davos, an idea Trump dismissed. "I do not understand what you are doing on Greenland," wrote Macron.

Leaders of Denmark and Greenland have offered a wide array of ways for a greater U.S. presence on the strategic island but this has not placated Trump, who posted on social media on Tuesday a doctored image showing him planting an American flag on the territory of 57,000 people.

Trump's original purpose for going to Davos was to talk up the strength of the U.S. economy.

He is giving a keynote address on Wednesday that he said he would use to discuss economic successes at home, despite opinion polls showing Americans are broadly unhappy with his handling of the economy. The White House said he would address the rising cost of housing with a plan to let Americans use money in their 401(k) retirement savings plans for down payments on homes.

"President Trump will unveil initiatives to drive down housing costs, tout his economic agenda that has propelled the United States to lead the world in economic growth, and emphasize that the United States and Europe must leave behind economic stagnation and the policies that caused it," a White House official said.

During his stay, Trump plans to have separate meetings with the leaders of Switzerland, Poland and Egypt, the White House said.

On Thursday, Trump is due to preside over a ceremony celebrating the Board of Peace, a group he formed that is aimed at redeveloping Gaza amid a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.

Trump has drawn some worries by saying the Board of Peace may work on global crises beyond Gaza, a role traditionally performed by the United Nations.

Trump told a news conference on Tuesday he likes the United Nations but it has "never lived up to its potential."

He returns to Washington late on Thursday.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 06:37:48 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/3F6HLJ6NFNL7VN6FRO636N5X2I.jpg?auth=2e9ee1995f2d438ba84efe502dfc99fcfb9ba6700a8b5d24ea99b57abd26d1dd&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Azerbaijan says it agreed to join Trump's 'Board of Peace'</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/azerbaijan-says-it-agreed-join-trumps-board-peace-2026-01-21/</link><description>MOSCOW, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Azerbaijan said on on Wednesday that it had accepted an invitation from U.S. President Donald Trump to join his "Board of Peace".

He also offered a solution: himself.

"Our democracy will not survive if we leave it to corrupt officials, conspirators and extremists," he said in a televised speech. "Your trust obliges me to protect the state, the institutions and our future."

Radev, a former air force commander, has waited years for this moment. Since a political crisis erupted in 2020, he has sat above the parliamentary mess, appointing caretaker governments when needed, and gradually amassing influence as the Balkan country's ceremonial head of state.

Now, with polls showing him to be Bulgaria's most popular politician, he is widely expected to form a new party and run in parliamentary elections this spring.

Radev has not announced his intention to run yet, but the timing appears to be in his favour.

Popular protests against corruption and a budget that proposed higher taxes ousted the last government in December, and voters are increasingly sick of a small elite of politicians who have dominated for years. These include former Prime Minister Boyko Borissov, who runs the leading GERB party, and oligarch Delyan Peevski, who is under U.S. and UK sanctions for corruption.

Still, he faces a massive challenge to turn around the fortunes of one of the European Union's poorest and most corrupt members, where prosecutors allege that hundreds of millions of euros in European funds have been diverted into the pockets of businessmen and officials, public tenders have been fixed, and people have become so disillusioned that most don't bother to vote.

Turnout dropped from nearly 50% in April 2021 to below 35% in a snap election in June 2024.

The challenge extends to Radev's own personal image. He will face questions about his pro-Kremlin stance on the war in Ukraine , his scepticism on the euro, and even an allegedly damaging energy deal signed by a government he appointed.

"Radev offers the possibility of change to Bulgarian society, but also predictability – this is a perfect recipe," said Parvan Simeonov, the founder of Myara, a Bulgarian polling agency. "However, there are issues and questions that should be answered."

Radev was voted in as president in 2016 after a military career and training in the United States. In his first term, he became a critic of then Prime Minister Borissov, who was under pressure from corruption allegations.

When police raided Radev's offices in 2020, Bulgarians saw the move as a hit job and it triggered the largest demonstrations since Bulgaria joined the EU in 2007. Months-long protests called for an end to graft, more accountability, and for the government to step down. Radev, meanwhile, was reelected for a second term in 2021.

The protests saw an end to Borissov's tenure, but what followed was a political crisis in which weak coalitions struggled to last just a few months. The elections this spring will be the eighth in four years.

Graft continues: last year alone, the European Public Prosecutor’s Office said it opened 97 investigations in Bulgaria with damages totalling nearly 500 million euros.

Critics say Radev is partly to blame for questionable dealings done by interim governments that he appointed. This includes a 2023 gas deal between Turkish state gas company Botas and Bulgaria's Bulgargaz that led to losses and an investigation .

Radev is popular but not enough to win an outright majority, analysts said.

Many point to a possible marriage with the reformist PP-DB party which has also been outspoken against corruption. Still, the party does not agree with Radev's soft stance towards Russia, or on his reluctance to join the eurozone, which Bulgaria did on January 1.

Radev will also have to clarify his stance on Ukraine after a series of Kremlin-friendly statements in recent years. He clashed with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy during a meeting in 2023 when he said that military aid to Kyiv would only prolong the conflict.

"God forbid such a tragedy happens (here) and you are in my place," Zelenskiy said on live TV. "Are you going to say "Putin, take over Bulgarian territories?""</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 07:30:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/RKH4X7OLEVLSBMYCA7473G5LRY.jpg?auth=9a08db481989bc5499214420cc06b3dbc3e746e84278e4f0e999a4f28d71031b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia says fire put out at Afipsky oil refinery after Ukrainian drone attack</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/russia-says-fire-put-out-afipsky-oil-refinery-after-ukrainian-drone-attack-2026-01-21/</link><description>MOSCOW, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Ukrainian drone fragments ignited a fire at the Afipsky oil refinery in Russia's southern Krasnodar region, but nobody was hurt, there was no damage, and the fire is now out, a local emergencies centre said early on Wednesday.

The refinery, which has been frequently attacked by Ukrainian drones in recent months as part of Kyiv's campaign to degrade Russia's vast energy infrastructure, is mostly focused on exports. It processed 7.2 million metric tons of crude oil (144,000 barrels per day) in 2024.

Moscow has stepped up its own winter campaign against Ukraine's battered energy system while continuing to grind forward on the battlefield.

Separately, Ukrainian drones struck various towns in southern Russia, injuring 11 people and prompting the evacuation of several residents, local officials said on Wednesday.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 07:30:39 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China says it has handled UK embassy planning in line with laws</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-says-it-has-handled-uk-embassy-planning-line-with-laws-2026-01-21/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 07:55:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>EU lawmakers to vote on whether to launch legal challenge to Mercosur trade deal</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/eu-lawmakers-vote-whether-launch-legal-challenge-mercosur-trade-deal-2026-01-21/</link><description>BRUSSELS, Jan 21 (Reuters) - EU lawmakers will vote on Wednesday on whether to challenge the European Union's contentious free trade agreement with South America in the bloc's top court, a move that could delay the deal by two years and potentially derail it.

The European Union signed its largest-ever trade pact with Mercosur members Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay on Saturday. The agreement now requires approval before it can take effect.

Opponents, led by France - the EU's largest agricultural producer - say the deal will sharply increase imports of cheap beef, sugar and poultry, undercutting domestic farmers who have staged repeated protests .

A group of 144 lawmakers has lodged a legal challenge asking the EU Court of Justice to rule on whether the agreement can be applied before full ratification by all member states and whether its provisions restrict the EU's ability to set environmental and consumer health policies. The court typically takes around two years to deliver such opinions.

If referred to the court, the EU could still apply the pact provisionally pending the ruling and parliamentary approval. But doing so could prove politically difficult given the likely backlash, and the European Parliament would retain the power to annul it later.

The vote in parliament is due to take place at 1130 GMT.

Supporters including Germany and Spain point to U.S. President Donald Trump's disruption of global trade. They argue the deal is essential to offset business lost to U.S. tariffs and to reduce reliance on China by securing access to critical minerals. They also warn that Mercosur governments are losing patience with the EU after years of negotiations.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 09:35:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WVA3FOZJIBLW3L44S3OQNOXK4Y.jpg?auth=35ddf49f15298f28a07f6d8e6781b6c2cc362ec2ccad44c5c55b66731d4112fc&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Hungary's Orban throws restaurants $304 mln lifeline ahead of election</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/hungarys-orban-throws-restaurants-304-mln-lifeline-ahead-election-2026-01-21/</link><description>BUDAPEST, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government announced on Wednesday a 100 billion forint ($304.42 million) package to shore up the restaurant industry as the veteran leader faces an uphill battle to revive the economy ahead of an April election.

Orban, whose right-wing Fidesz trails opposition challenger Tisza based on most fresh surveys, has also flagged a possible extension of energy price subsidies to help Hungarians cope with rising heating bills amid freezing temperatures.

An autumn Eurobarometer survey showed the rising cost of living topped Hungarians' domestic concerns - despite inflation retreating from highs above 25% in early 2023 to the central bank's 2% to 4% tolerance band in November.

Orban's government will provide liquidity support to restaurants, halve a tourism tax and waive a levy on entertainment spending for companies worth up to 1% of their annual turnover, financial news website portfolio.hu reported, citing Economy Minister Marton Nagy at a briefing.

Nearly 10,000 restaurants will also be allowed to treat up to a fifth of their revenue as a service fee, reducing their tax bill. The government hopes the measure will shore up the finances of restaurants, a sector strongly exposed to hikes in the minimum wage, which rose by 11% at the start of 2026.

Some analysts have warned that after strong wage growth in recent years, a weak economy and surging energy costs could make it harder for companies to finance the rise in the minimum wage.

Orban has also announced large-scale tax cuts for families, wage hikes, food vouchers for pensioners, a pension top-up to be paid in February and a subsidised housing loan programme to shore up his support.

His government is expected to decide on changes to energy price subsidies at a meeting later on Wednesday.

Fitch Ratings late last year cut Hungary's outlook to negative on Orban's pre-election spending initiatives.

U.S. President Donald Trump 's ambition to wrest sovereignty over Greenland from Denmark has rattled NATO members and prompted a rethink of Europe's traditional security dependence on the United States.

Asked if Beijing welcomed the "chaos" over Greenland, Guo Jiakun, a spokesperson of the Chinese foreign ministry, told a regular news briefing, "We have no intention of competing for influence with any country, nor would we ever do so."

Trump has also threatened to rain trade tariffs on Europe if it resists his demand to acquire the Arctic island.

The EU's foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, cautioned that transatlantic tariffs would play into the hands of China and Russia, both of which would benefit from "divisions among allies".

"We engage in friendly exchanges with all nations on the basis of mutual respect and equality, and remain committed to being a positive, stabilising and constructive force," Guo said.

Yet Chinese state media did not hold back comments this week, urging Europe to reassess its dependence on the United States for security.

Europe has grown excessively dependent on the United States while sidelining cooperation with partners such as China and Russia, the Global Times tabloid backed by the ruling Communist Party said in an editorial.

"The situation underscores the necessity for Europe to review the nature of transatlantic relations and reduce its reliance on the United States as a pillar of support for its security," an editorial in the state-run China Daily added.

The Greenland crisis is a call for Europe to bolster strategic autonomy and diversify partnerships, it said.

"By doing so, Europe can ensure that its future is not dictated by the diktats of a bully, but is instead shaped by its collective interests."</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 09:35:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7UJFVO6VCNPO3CVMNUCNIY7SX4.jpg?auth=1cad24c143ee683e80e640893c21e142e20dd2131ca838cac95ddaa93f8b7ad5&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>EU is at a crossroads towards more independence, von der Leyen says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/eu-is-crossroads-towards-more-independence-von-der-leyen-says-2026-01-21/</link><description>STRASBOURG, France, Jan 21 (Reuters) - The EU needs to speed up its push for independence to defend itself in a fast-changing world, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Wednesday.

"We are at a crossroads. Europe prefers dialogue and solutions – but we are fully prepared to act, if necessary, with unity, urgency and determination," von der Leyen said in a speech in European Parliament.

"In this increasingly lawless world, Europe needs its own levers of power," she said.

"We know them: A strong economy, a thriving single market and industrial base, a strong innovation and technology capacity, united societies and above a real capacity to defend ourselves."

Von der Leyen said it was "more important than ever" to keep focusing on Ukraine, while the EU would work with the US and other partners to strengthen security in the Arctic region.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 09:35:44 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LCQPRDCNFJP65EAVEQXL4IYHFI.jpg?auth=38351d3bf75f9768ae9acf0b0e268102d3acb2469f523739bccdc3851d4d4645&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Singapore's opposition will not nominate replacement for Leader of the Opposition role</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/singapores-workers-party-will-not-nominate-another-mp-be-leader-opposition-2026-01-21/</link><description>SINGAPORE, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Singapore's Workers' Party said on Wednesday it will not nominate another of its lawmakers to be Leader of the Opposition.

In a press statement, the opposition party said its view was that the leader of the opposition should be the leader of the largest opposition party in parliament.

Singapore Prime Minister Lawrence Wong last week stripped Workers' Party secretary-general Pritam Singh of the post, saying his position had become untenable after his lying conviction .

Wong asked the opposition party, which has 10 of the 97 seats , to nominate another lawmaker to take Singh's place.

The Worker's Party statement said: "In other Westminster systems, the title of the Leader of the Opposition is established by law and is not the prerogative or choice of the Government of the day or the Prime Minister. This approach expresses the authority and sanctity of the people’s vote."

In Singapore, the Leader of the Opposition role is designated by the head of government and not provided for in the constitution or parliament's standing orders.

The post comes with certain privileges and duties, such as staff support and an additional allowance, as well as access to confidential government briefings, especially in the event of a national crisis or emergency.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 09:35:52 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/J4P6SC5VQFKPDNXT6ELMMRILAM.jpg?auth=8f40725d099ac86e6b95a15bc26d0db05beffcf83941c1914c73acb4bf2578b0&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>EU stands ready to defend itself against coercion, Costa says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/eu-stands-ready-defend-itself-against-coercion-costa-says-2026-01-21/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 09:35:53 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Kosovo accepts invitation to join Trump's Board of Peace</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/kosovo-accepts-invitation-join-trumps-board-peace-2026-01-21/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 09:36:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>China distances itself from Greenland issue but warns against US dependence</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-distances-itself-greenland-issue-warns-against-us-dependence-2026-01-21/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 09:36:02 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>EU is at a crossroads towards more independence, von der Leyen says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/eu-is-crossroads-towards-more-independence-von-der-leyen-says-2026-01-21/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 09:36:03 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Singapore's opposition will not nominate replacement for Leader of the Opposition role</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/singapores-workers-party-will-not-nominate-another-mp-be-leader-opposition-2026-01-21/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 09:36:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>EU stands ready to defend itself against coercion, Costa says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/eu-stands-ready-defend-itself-against-coercion-costa-says-2026-01-21/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 09:36:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Syrian army takes control of Al-Hol camp housing IS group families</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260121-syria-army-enters-al-hol-camp-housing-islamic-state-group-is-isis-families-relatives-fighters</link><description>Syria’s army on Wednesday entered the country’s vast Al-Hol detention camp that houses relatives of suspected Islamic State ( IS ) group members, from which Kurdish forces withdrew the day before, according to an AFP journalist at the scene.

The correspondent saw a large number of soldiers open the camp’s metal gate and enter, while others guarded the entrance.

Al-Hol, located in a desert region of Hasakeh province, holds around 24,000 people, including 15,000 Syrians and about 6,300 foreign women and children of 42 nationalities.

Watch Life after al-Hol camp: Women of IS group try to reintegrate into Syrian society

Kurdish forces announced on Tuesday that they had been “compelled to withdraw” from the camp to defend cities in Syria’s north threatened by the army, before a ceasefire was announced.

The camp is the largest for suspected jihadists established by Kurdish forces, who spearheaded the fight against the IS group with help from an international coalition over the past decade before the group was defeated in Syria in 2019.

The Syrian defence ministry said Tuesday it was ready to take responsibility for Al-Hol camp “and all IS (group) prisoners”.

The announcement came as US envoy to Syria Tom Barrack said “the original purpose” of Kurdish forces as the primary anti-IS group force had “largely expired”.

The Syrian army deployed on Monday across vast parts of northern and northeastern Syria from which Kurdish forces had withdrawn.

An agreement between the two sides stipulates that the Syrian state becomes responsible for IS group prisoners and that the Kurdish administration be integrated into Syrian state institutions.

Syria’s interior ministry said it was taking necessary measures to maintain the security of Al-Hol.

Thousands of former jihadists, including many Westerners, are held in seven prisons, while tens of thousands of their family members live in two camps established by Kurdish forces in northern Syria, Al-Hol and Al-Roj.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 09:36:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/723fdaac-f6a6-11f0-afaf-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/000-93G38CY.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukraine endures its bitterest winter as Russia targets heating and power</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/ukraine-endures-its-bitterest-winter-russia-targets-heating-power-2026-01-21/</link><description>KYIV, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Collecting snow for water at home; sleeping in gloves, coats and hats; heating bricks on gas stoves for warmth; erecting tents indoors - Kyiv residents are doing everything they can to survive the coldest, darkest winter of the war.

"When there is no electricity, there is no heating: it means the apartment freezes," said Anton Rybikov, father of three-year-old David and two-year-old Matvii, speaking to Reuters in their home, where he and his wife Marina have stocked up on backup batteries and sleeping bags.

The 39-year-old military chaplain said one of his sons recently contracted pneumonia after temperatures in the apartment fell to 9 degrees Celsius (48 Fahrenheit) during a power blackout of more than 19 hours following Russian airstrikes.

"It's emotionally very difficult. There is constant worry," Rybikov added, as he prepared to heat water in a metal milk churn. "This winter is the hardest."

Russia has intensified its attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure in recent months, concentrating missile and drone strikes on the cities of Kyiv, Kharkiv and Dnipro.

British military intelligence estimated that Russia launched 55,000 unmanned aerial systems at Ukraine last year, around five times the number in 2024, according to one of its regular reports on the war posted on X.

Ukraine has called for more Western air defences to cope with the drone and missile barrages.

With temperatures plunging to minus 18 degrees Celsius across snow-covered Kyiv, the attacks mean hundreds of thousands of the capital's three million residents are struggling with lengthy interruptions to power and water supplies.

On Tuesday, after a major Russian strike overnight, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said more than a million households in the city had no power.

Simple routines like showering and cooking are now a challenge. For the first time since the full-scale Russian invasion nearly four years ago, the government last week declared a state of emergency related to the energy crisis.

Russia says its attacks on Ukraine are designed to degrade its military and denies targeting civilians.

Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko told Reuters that the strikes on the capital were meant to "break resistance, break the Ukrainians' spirit, to do everything for people to become depressed and pack their bags and vacate the territory."

"Kyiv has always been and remains the target for the aggressor," he said in an interview in his office.

Across the city, thousands of people now gather in schools and at makeshift street "invincibility points" where generators allow them to warm up, charge their phones and connect to the internet.

At a food distribution point in Kyiv run by World Central Kitchen, 66-year-old pensioner Valentyna Kiriiakova queued for hot food along with her granddaughter, Yeva Teplova.

"We don't complain," said Kiriiakova, whose high-rise apartment had no power, leaving her unable to cook. "We understand that there is a war going on and we have to endure. We have to survive."

Russia's onslaught on Ukraine's energy system has led to power and water outages in Kyiv that typically last three to four times longer than previous winters.

Economy Minister Oleksii Sobolev said that since October, Russia had damaged 8.5 gigawatts of Ukraine's generation capacity — nearly half of typical power consumption — forcing record electricity imports.

Russia has also struck Ukrainian gas production facilities, said energy company Naftogaz. The central bank governor said late last year that Ukraine lost about a half of its gas output, forcing it to spend more on imports.

"Ukraine's energy system is not broken, but it is operating in a mode of constant degradation," said Olena Lapenko, general director for safety and resilience at energy think-tank Dixi Group.

Schools and universities have extended their winter holidays, and many companies have moved to remote work or reduced their operating hours.

Dozens of repair teams hurry across Kyiv from site-to-site to patch up the damage caused by Russian strikes.

"There is a lot of work. The grids cannot withstand such pressure all at once," said Hennadii Barulin, 55, a digger operator, as his team worked to restore power to residents.

"This is a real winter. It is very difficult to break through the ground, through the asphalt, through everything."

Sobolev said Ukraine's stocks of energy equipment had been depleted and that urgent financial support of about $1 billion was required to deal with the current emergency.

Ukraine's Western partners rushed in hundreds of generators, powerful batteries and industrial boilers to help cover some gaps, according to the foreign ministry.

Newly appointed Energy Minister Denys Shmyhal said Ukraine has made some progress installing small, independent generation capacity to reduce reliance on the heavily centralised, Soviet-era system. He said 762 megawatts were installed in 2025, compared with 225 megawatts in 2024.

"Given the critical state of the energy sector, such pace is clearly insufficient."

Shmyhal also said Kyiv lagged behind other Ukrainian cities in installing independent generation capacity - criticism the mayor rejected.

With freezing temperatures forecast for several more weeks and further Russian strikes expected, energy experts say the situation is unlikely to improve soon.

Rybikov said he would consider sending his sons out of Kyiv if the blackouts worsen.

"We need the warmth so that the children do not freeze. The rest we will get through," he said. "If there is a blackout, I will send the children away."</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 10:30:07 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/P62RPLJPBFP5RAOGYT2TASNFWU.jpg?auth=8730c7dad92e8167b5127e098192c4341b63f1ea21a15e0d971d4dcec90a1c9e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>At appeal trial, France's Le Pen denies EU embezzlement charges</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/appeal-trial-frances-le-pen-denies-eu-embezzlement-charges-2026-01-21/</link><description>PARIS, Jan 21 (Reuters) - French far-right leader Marine Le Pen softened her tone while answering judges' questions during her appeal trial in Paris on Tuesday and Wednesday , but denied wrongdoing, after being barred from public office over a conviction for misusing EU funds.

Le Pen, the longtime leader of the far-right National Rally (RN), is facing a crucial appeal trial that will determine whether she can run in the 2027 presidential election, after she was given last year a five-year ban from running for public office, effective immediately.

Le Pen and others were found guilty of misappropriating more than 4 million euros ($4.7 million) of EU funds. Judges said that between 2004 and 2016, they had used funds earmarked for work at the European Parliament to pay staff who were actually working for the party.

Answering judge Michele Agi's questions, Le Pen stuck to addressing legal arguments, in contrast with her previous approach of challenging the legitimacy of the charges . But in substance, her defence appeared to remain the same, as she denied the existence of a system within the RN to misuse EU funds.

"I formally contest the idea that there was a kind of system," Le Pen told the court on Tuesday.

She also partly put the blame on her father, the late Jean-Marie Le Pen, saying that until 2014 he was the one really in charge. Known for his xenophobic, antisemitic and racist stance, the founder of the RN, formerly the Front National, died last year at 96.

"The way things were functioning wasn’t ideal -- I’m aware of that," she said. "But all those people were working."

The trial is expected to last until February 12.

A ruling is expected before the summer, meaning Le Pen's hopes of running in 2027 remain alive if her five-year ban is revoked or drastically curtailed.

If she cannot run, her protege, 30-year-old RN party president Jordan Bardella , is expected to step in.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 10:30:17 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/Q2QH24DSGRMNPJNUW4BTRLNM7Q.jpg?auth=764a701b286f4875f49c68a2c0919a70fcfb41450ff965f87bc0c30d40edf552&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>What are the military assets in the Arctic?</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/what-are-military-assets-arctic-2026-01-21/</link><description>OSLO, Jan 21 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump wants to buy Greenland as he says it is the only way for the United States to secure its defence. Denmark and Greenland, an autonomous territory, refuse and say any concerns Washington has can be addressed via their existing defence agreement.

Eight nations have territory in the Arctic: Russia, the United States, Canada, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland and Iceland. Here is an overview of their military assets:

Half of the landmass in the Arctic is Russian territory. Since 2005 Moscow has re-opened and modernised tens of Soviet-era military bases, both on its Arctic mainland and on the islands off its northern coast.

Russia maintains a high state of readiness at its nuclear testing site on Novaya Zemlya, an Arctic archipelago, although it has not conducted a test involving a nuclear explosion since 1990. Last October , it carried out a test launch of its nuclear-powered Burevestnik cruise missile from Novaya Zemlya.

In the European Arctic, the Kola Peninsula hosts about two-thirds of Russia's second-strike nuclear capabilities - its ability to answer a nuclear attack with its own - according to Mathieu Boulegue , opens new tab , a fellow at the Polar Institute at the Washington-based Wilson Center.

The area is also home to Russia's Northern Fleet, headquartered in Severomorsk, which operates six of the country's 12 nuclear-armed submarines, according to data from the International Institute for Strategic Studies. The other six are operated by the Pacific Fleet based in Vladivostok.

The only way for the Northern Fleet to access the North Atlantic is via the Barents Sea, between the Norwegian Svalbard archipelago and the northern coast of Europe. Keeping that access free is therefore essential to Moscow.

Since 1957, the U.S. and Canada have jointly defended against threats to their homeland, including from nuclear missiles, via the North American Aerospace Defense Command, known as NORAD.

They are modernising NORAD, according to the IISS: Canada is procuring two over-the-horizon radar systems covering the Arctic and polar approaches, with the first due to reach initial operating capability by 2028.

President Trump is keen to develop a new missile defence system, called Golden Dome, for which he says Greenland is crucial.

Washington has the Pituffik Space Base in northern Greenland under a defence agreement with Denmark. Otherwise, most of its Arctic forces are located across eight bases in Alaska and count approximately 22,000 military personnel, according to IISS and the U.S. Northern Command.

Canada has five Arctic bases, including Alert, a signals intelligence station on Ellesmere Island that is the world's northernmost permanently inhabited settlement.

South of the Arctic Circle, Canada operates a base at Yellowknife in the Northwest Territories, which hosts a ranger patrol group and an air base.

Canada is building a facility on Baffin Island to refuel offshore patrol ships - though the project has sustained numerous delays. The U.S., meanwhile, is expanding existing port facilities at Nome, Alaska, according to IISS.

Denmark's Joint Arctic Command , headquartered in Greenland's capital, Nuuk, counts around 150 military and civilian personnel.

JAC is also present at the Kangerlussuaq air base as well as four smaller military stations in eastern and north-eastern Greenland. JAC has one liaison officer at Pituffik.

Its Sirius dog sled patrol - derided by Trump - is a military unit that conducts long-range reconnaissance in the extreme conditions of northeastern Greenland.

Sweden has no bases north of the Arctic Circle, but has an air force base at Lulea, on the northern coast of the Gulf of Bothnia, and an army base with two regiments in Boden, some 40 km (25 miles) inland.

Finland has an air base in Rovaniemi, on the Arctic Circle, and a Jaeger Brigade base further north in Finnish Lapland.

Since joining NATO, the two countries have been integrating their militaries with the rest of the alliance.

Norway is NATO's monitor for a vast maritime area of some 2 million sq km (770,000 sq mi) of the North Atlantic, including the Arctic.

Many of its military installations are above the Arctic Circle. It has four air bases, including one for its new F-35 fighter jets, two navy bases, a string of army bases and a reception centre for NATO allies coming for reinforcement in case of attack.

There are no military installations on Svalbard, Norway's Arctic archipelago.

The North Atlantic island is a NATO member but has no military, only a coastguard service.

It hosts U.S. Navy P-8A Poseidon maritime-patrol aircraft in a rotational deployment, based at Keflavik air base, near Reykjavik.

NATO fighter jets periodically rotate at Keflavik to keep Icelandic airspace secure. The deployment usually lasts two to three weeks, three times a year.

Former army chief Muhammad Hafizuddiean Jantan will be charged under money laundering laws while former armed forces chief Mohd Nizam Jaafar will face charges related to abuse of power, criminal breach of trust, and for illegally accepting gifts, it said in a statement.

Hafizuddiean's wife will also be charged with money laundering, it said.

Muhammad Hafizuddiean and Mohd Nizam could not be immediately reached for comment.

The MACC has been investigating allegations of bribery linked to army procurement projects, raiding several firms and seizing bank accounts linked to a suspect and their family members.

Muhammad Hafizuddeain has been placed on leave since late December pending the investigation, while Mohd Nizam officially retired earlier this month.

The MACC said it was also completing a probe into two other senior military officers, with the investigation papers to be submitted to prosecutors soon for further action.

Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim last week announced that all procurement decisions by the Malaysian armed forces and the police that are linked to the corruption probe would be temporarily frozen until they fully comply with related rules.

Anwar said on Wednesday that the government would also review all other procurement decisions that have been approved or have not yet been concluded.

"They must undergo a more transparent process," he said at a defence ministry event.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 10:31:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LGUHF2TRFFNIBAX2I4RYTXBTAM.jpg?auth=afec7be4d5111e67284bf8d7ef3453c13047b7173152cf69ab3614e7eb2e24e2&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Europol breaks up Europe-wide drugs network based in Poland running 20 illegal labs</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/europol-breaks-up-europe-wide-drugs-network-based-poland-running-20-illegal-labs-2026-01-21/</link><description>WARSAW, Jan 21 (Reuters) - European investigators uncovered an international synthetic drugs network run from Poland and have seized more than 9.3 tonnes of narcotics and arrested over 100 suspects, Polish prosecutors said on Wednesday.

The operation targeted a criminal group accused of importing chemical precursors from China and India and manufacturing synthetic drugs in more than 20 illegal laboratories for distribution across the European Union.

Prosecutors said the group operated a complex international supply chain, legally importing large quantities of chemicals which were then repackaged and channelled to illegal drug laboratories in Poland and Western Europe. Poland served as the logistical hub.

Video released by Polish police showed raids on suspects' homes by armed officers and huge stockpiles of chemicals in plastic containers and distillation equipment.

Launched in 2022 by Polish anti-narcotics officers, the investigation expanded into a multi-country operation.

Authorities dismantled over 20 illegal laboratories and drug production lines in Poland, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and the Czech Republic and seized more than 9.3 tonnes of narcotics, vast quantities of chemical precursors and assets.

The prosecutor's office did not provide an estimate of the value of the seized drugs.

Europol, the EU's agency for fighting international and organised crime, enabled intelligence-sharing and synchronised police actions across borders, prosecutors said.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 10:32:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Italy won't take part in Trump's "Board of Peace", Corriere says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/italy-wont-take-part-trumps-board-peace-corriere-says-2026-01-21/</link><description>ROME, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Italy won't take part in U.S. President Donald Trump's "Board of Peace" initiative, daily Corriere della Sera reported on Wednesday, citing concern that joining such a group led by a single country's leader would violate Italy's constitution.

Trump's plan has so far drawn cautious reactions from Western allies, as diplomats say it could undermine the work of the United Nations.

On Thursday, Trump is due to preside over a ceremony celebrating the new group in Davos, Switzerland, site of the World Economic Forum.

A source told Reuters that Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, a rightwing leader who has had warm relations with Trump, was unlikely to go to Davos. The Italian government did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The proposed board would be chaired for life by Trump and start by addressing the Gaza conflict before expanding to other wars. Member countries would be required to pay a $1 billion fee each to earn permanent membership.

According to Italy's constitution, Italy may join international organisations that ensure "peace and justice among nations" only "on equal terms with other states", a condition incompatible with U.S. primacy on the new board, Corriere said.

The newspaper did not cite a source for its report.

Invitations to join the board have been addressed to some 60 nations but just a few, including Hungary and Israel , have so far accepted without reservations. Adding to concern among Western allies, the Kremlin said this week that Russian President Vladimir Putin had also been invited.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 10:32:52 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/3EYEM5EHFNNCPNO6CLSN4OL7Z4.jpg?auth=8243452ba4c73dddd483e1a4156525163e1ab8019efc685efca811e99def3417&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Rifaat al-Assad, uncle of ousted Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, dies, sources say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/rifaat-al-assad-uncle-ousted-syrian-president-bashar-al-assad-dies-sources-say-2026-01-21/</link><description>Jan 21 (Reuters) - Rifaat al-Assad, the uncle of deposed Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad accused of orchestrating mass killings during a 1982 uprising in Syria, has died, according to two people with direct knowledge of the matter.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 10:59:04 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/J2OT46IMSVO2LHG3HHCW3T5WGM.jpg?auth=1bb42dc711388997fd45b2f1aac58ca16ebd233c55b315fd77faa5f6343d7aff&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Nigerian troops free 62 hostages, kill two militants in northwest operations</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/nigerian-troops-free-62-hostages-kill-two-militants-northwest-operations-2026-01-21/</link><description>MADUGURI, Nigeria, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Nigerian troops have rescued 62 hostages and killed two militants in separate operations across Kebbi and Zamfara states as part of an ongoing offensive against armed groups in the northwest, the army said on Wednesday.

The northwest has been hit by a surge in mass kidnappings carried out by armed gangs operating from forest hideouts. These groups have attacked villages, schools and places of worship, including the January 18 abduction of more than 160 worshippers from two churches in Kaduna.

Army spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Olaniyi Osoba said troops stormed a known bandit hideout in Zamfara after receiving reports that captives were being held there.

The army said all 62 hostages were rescued and are in safe custody, with efforts underway to reunite them with their families.

In a separate operation, troops ambushed Lakurawa militants near the border between Kebbi’s Augie district and neighbouring Sokoto after receiving intelligence on the group’s movements, Osoba said.

Nigeria has come under scrutiny from U.S. President Donald Trump, who accused the country of failing to protect Christians from Islamist militants operating in the northwest.

U.S. forces launched strikes against Islamic State targets in northwest Nigeria on Christmas Day. The Nigerian government denies any systematic persecution of Christians, saying it is targeting Islamist fighters and other armed groups that attack both Christian and Muslim civilians.

The army added that the operations form part of broader efforts to dismantle armed networks responsible for widespread kidnappings and insecurity across the region.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan

visit</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/britain-china-revive-golden-era-business-dialogue-during-starmer-visit-2026-01-21/</link><description>BEIJING, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Britain and China will aim to revive a "golden era" business dialogue when Prime Minister Keir Starmer visits Beijing next week, three sources familiar with the initiative said, with top company executives from both sides invited to participate.

AstraZeneca (AZN.L) , opens new tab , BP (BP.L) , opens new tab , HSBC (HSBA.L) , opens new tab , Intercontinental Hotels Group (IHG.L) , opens new tab , Jaguar Land Rover, Rolls Royce (RR.L) , opens new tab , Schroders (SDR.L) , opens new tab and Standard Chartered (STAN.L) , opens new tab , are among the British firms set to join a revamped "UK-China CEO Council," said the sources, who are both Chinese and British.

The council was originally conceived by then-Prime Minister Theresa May and then-Premier Li Keqiang in 2018, during a period of ties both sides dubbed "a golden era".

The Chinese side should be represented by Bank of China (601988.SS) , opens new tab , China Construction Bank (601939.SS) , opens new tab , China Mobile (600941.SS) , opens new tab , Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (601398.SS) , opens new tab , China Railway Rolling Stock Corporation, China National Pharmaceutical Group and BYD (002594.SZ) , opens new tab , among other companies, the sources - a mixture of officials and businesspeople - added.

Negotiations have been under way for some time. But with Starmer's visit largely contingent on approval for China to build its largest embassy in Europe in London - a green light it received on Tuesday - talks have only just begun in earnest, they said.

Details such as the group's official English-language name still need to be settled, one person said, with the British government reluctant to include "CEO" in the title, while the Chinese side plans to keep the same Chinese translation used in 2018.

Premier Li Qiang, China's second-ranking official, should be Beijing's representative, if the talks go ahead, they added. The British side could announce the visit and Starmer's schedule as soon as Friday, that same person said.

All of the sources cautioned, however, that U.S. President Donald Trump's threats to acquire Greenland could derail Starmer's trip, adding that, with the embassy decision still so recent, other elements of the visit were still being finalised.

None of the people could confirm which CEOs would attend, with one businessperson noting their company's chief executive had declined, unable to be sure the visit would proceed.

Reuters contacted all of the companies expected to attend for comment, but none immediately responded.

A visit by Starmer would be the first by a British leader since 2018, with his administration aiming to reset ties with the world's second‑largest economy after successive Conservative governments shifted the UK from being one of Beijing's strongest backers in Europe to one of its fiercest critics.

In a speech late last year, the Labour prime minister accused previous Conservative governments of a "dereliction of duty" by allowing ties with Beijing to deteriorate, noting French President Emmanuel Macron had visited China twice since 2018 and German leaders four times.

Neither China nor Britain has officially announced Starmer's visit. The British embassy in Beijing said the prime minister's travel would be announced in the usual way. China's foreign ministry did not respond to a request for comment.

Commercial ties soured after the UK banned China's Huawei from its 5G networks in 2020, and in 2022 British lawmakers led a taxpayer-funded buyout of China General Nuclear Power Corporation's (CGN) stake in a nuclear plant being developed by France's EDF.

CGN was part of the original CEO council, but along with Huawei, is unlikely to join the revamped group, one of the sources said, citing political sensitivities in the UK over Chinese firms' role in the country's critical infrastructure.

At the council's first meeting in 2018, China's Li said its aim was to "fast-track two-way investment and expand bilateral trade in a healthier, more balanced direction," according to a readout published by the China International Contractors Association, one of the initiative's organisers.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 11:30:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5UX6443CTZPNBJCGPCLRNAAJTA.jpg?auth=1a10473bc6c1a8e995f2666dfb8a4bd2beadd269b1d66ce07af1bc6bc3bc620f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Targeted by Trump, Fed's Cook is a fighter with the scars to prove it</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/targeted-by-trump-feds-cook-is-fighter-with-scars-prove-it-2026-01-21/</link><description>Jan 21 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's contested firing of Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook has become a test case in his ​bid to assert control over the U.S. central bank and his ongoing efforts to push the limits of presidential power.

As the first sitting Fed policymaker ‌to be the target of an attempted presidential ouster, Cook is no stranger either to being first, or to being targeted.

The daughter of a nursing professor and hospital chaplain, Cook was among the initial Black students to desegregate the schools that she and her sisters attended in rural Milledgeville, Georgia. She has told interviewers she still has scars above her right eye and on her leg from beatings during that time.

After studying philosophy at Spelman College, Cook became the first graduate of that historically Black women's institution in Atlanta, Georgia, to ‌win a Marshall Scholarship, which funded a year's study at Oxford University.

Later, as she has recounted in many speeches, a British economist ​whose name she no longer recalls convinced her during a hiking trip up a Tanzanian mountain that she should become an economist. No record exists to verify whether she is the first to be converted by Kilimanjaro to the discipline of economics.

Cook received her PhD in economics from the University of California, Berkeley, where Barry ‍Eichengreen - who has written extensively about what is at stake when political leaders drive a central bank's policy decisions - was one of her dissertation advisers.

"I know Lisa to be careful and ethical," Eichengreen told fellow economist Paul Krugman in an interview last August, days after Trump said in a social media post that he was firing Cook for what he said were ⁠false statements on her mortgage application, or at the least "gross negligence" for faulty paperwork.

Cook has called the allegations baseless and sued to stop the dismissal. It ‍is Trump's effort to reverse a lower court's decision to block her removal that is currently under consideration by the U.S. Supreme Court . A hearing is scheduled for Wednesday.

"She's also one ‌of the ‌strongest people I know," Eichengreen told Krugman. "This is not someone that we should be making predictions about, but I think we have a very strong individual on the other side of this controversy."

Cook taught at Harvard University and was a research fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution before she was hired as an economics professor at Michigan State University in 2005. She wrote extensively about racial disparities, documenting the negative impact of anti-Black violence and ⁠gender inequality on innovation and economic growth.

She ⁠was an adviser on the transition ​teams for the Obama-Biden and Biden-Harris administrations, and a senior economist for the White House's Council of Economic Advisers from 2011 to 2012.

Nominated in 2022 to the Fed's Board of Governors by then-President Joe Biden, Cook's Senate confirmation was a drawn-out and contentious process that included her being subjected to what she called "anonymous and untrue attacks" on her work and accusations ‍from Republican lawmakers that she would be soft on inflation.

She became the first Black female U.S. central banker only after Vice President Kamala Harris cast a tie-breaking 51st vote in an evenly divided U.S. Senate.

Cook voted with her Fed colleagues to raise interest rates in 2022 and 2023 to fight a surge in inflation, but supported the central bank's three rate cuts last year to protect against a ​softening labor market . Trump has excoriated the Fed for not delivering the big rate cuts he seeks.

As a ‍Fed policymaker, Cook has focused many of her public remarks on the impact of artificial intelligence, which the Trump administration sees as key to economic prosperity.

She argues that AI could boost productivity and ease ​inflation, though the timing of those changes is uncertain, and the benefits could be unevenly distributed across the nation's workforce.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 11:30:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/E6NYDFPBJFNMXGY7OKUTDHIQ7I.jpg?auth=598e97ce616a7d6667ed03355815c1e56847423be743566985e08561e4b439d4&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US Supreme Court considers Trump's bid to fire Fed's Cook</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-supreme-court-considers-trumps-bid-fire-feds-lisa-cook-2026-01-21/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 21 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court is set on Wednesday to consider President Donald Trump 's unprecedented attempt to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook in a case that tests how far the justices may be willing to ​go to preserve the central bank's independence.

The case represents the latest dispute to come to the top U.S. judicial body involving Trump's expansive view ‌of presidential powers since returning to office 12 months ago. The arguments are scheduled for 10 a.m. (1500 GMT).

Trump's administration has asked the Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, to lift a judge's decision barring ​the Republican president from firing Cook while her legal challenge plays out. When the justices in October , opens new tab agreed to hear the case, they left Cook in her job for the time being.

In creating the Fed, Congress passed a law called the Federal Reserve Act that included provisions meant to insulate the central bank from political interference, requiring governors to be removed by a ‌president only "for cause," though the law does not define the term nor establish procedures for removal.

Trump's move against Cook is seen as ​the most consequential challenge to the Fed's independence since it was formed in 1913. Until now, no president had sought to oust a Fed official.

U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb in September ruled that Trump's attempt to remove Cook without notice or a hearing likely violated her right to due process under the U.S. Constitution's Fifth Amendment. Cobb also found that unproven ‍mortgage fraud allegations that Trump cited to fire Cook - which she has denied - likely were not a legally sufficient cause to remove a Fed governor under the law, noting that the alleged conduct occurred before she served in the Fed post.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit declined Trump's request to put Cobb's order on hold.

Cook has called the allegations against her a pretext to ⁠fire her over monetary policy differences as Trump heaps pressure on the central bank to cut interest rates and lashes out at Fed Chair Jerome Powell for not doing so more quickly.

As a Fed governor, Cook helps set U.S. monetary policy with the rest of the central bank's seven-member board and the heads of the 12 regional Fed banks. Her term in the job runs to ‌2038. Cook ‌was appointed in 2022 by Democratic former President Joe Biden as the first Black woman to serve in the post.

In prior cases, the Supreme Court chipped away at the independence of various federal agencies from presidential control, and could soon overrule a key precedent that has shielded the heads of independent agencies from removal since 1935.

But the court last year signaled it may view the central bank as an exception, noting in a May ruling that let Trump remove two Democratic members of federal labor boards that the Fed possesses a unique structure and ⁠historical tradition.

The Supreme Court has backed Trump ⁠in a series of emergency rulings since ​he returned to the presidency on immigration, mass federal layoffs, cutting foreign aid, dismantling the Education Department and other matters.

The Cook case has ramifications for the Fed's ability to set interest rates without regard to the wishes of politicians, widely seen as critical to any central bank's ability to carry out tasks such as keeping inflation under control.

The president sought to fire Cook on August 25 by ‍posting a termination letter on social media citing the mortgage fraud allegations disclosed by Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte, a Trump appointee.

The administration ‍this month opened a criminal investigation into Powell over remarks he made to Congress last year about a Fed building project, a move he similarly called a pretext aimed at gaining influence over monetary policy.

Powell plans to attend Wednesday's arguments, a source familiar with the situation told Reuters.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 11:31:02 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ICIM3JZT7ZNVTB4VG2EO6CWZQY.jpg?auth=9db72181976f27160843737b5f856074a41bbb21d2edc94efc89c1d973b680e5&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Spanish train drivers call for strike after deadly derailments</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/spanish-train-drivers-call-strike-after-deadly-derailments-2026-01-21/</link><description>MADRID, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Spain's biggest train drivers' union on Wednesday called for a nationwide strike to demand assurances for the profession's safety after one of Europe's biggest train crashes left at least 42 dead and a second derailment killed a driver.

A commuter train derailed on Tuesday after a retaining wall collapsed onto the track during heavy rains near Barcelona, killing the driver and seriously injuring four passengers. A third derailment of a train on Barcelona's regional network, which left no injuries, was caused by a rock falling on the line during the same storm, rail network operator Adif said.

"We are going to demand criminal liability from those responsible for ensuring safety in the railway infrastructure," the train drivers union SEMAF said in a statement.

Those accidents occurred just two days after the derailment of a high-speed train on Sunday near Adamuz in Cordoba province, about 360 km (223 miles) south of Madrid, which caused a collision with another train that killed 42, including the driver of the oncoming train.

SEMAF had warned Adif in a letter last August of severe wear and tear to the railway track where the two trains collided, according to a copy of the letter seen by Reuters, saying potholes, bumps, and imbalances in overhead power lines were causing frequent breakdowns and damaging the trains on several of the network's high-speed lines.

Rescuers at the site of the Adamuz crash were prising apart the second carriage of the train belonging to state operator Renfe, which contained its cafeteria, to see if any more bodies could be found, the Andalusian regional government said in a statement.

Overnight they had used cranes to remove one of the final carriages of the derailed train run by private consortium Iryo from the scene.

Adif said on Wednesday it had introduced a further speed limit on the Madrid-Barcelona line after a driver had reported poor conditions on the track in a 78-kilometre stretch.

On Tuesday, it had ordered drivers to limit their speed because of concerns about the state of the track. Its maintenance team had worked overnight to inspect the line and found four points that needed to be repaired, Adif said in a statement.

The accidents are causing chaos for commuters and travellers, who were scrambling for alternatives. Regional trains across Catalonia were suspended on Wednesday to allow for track inspections after the recent storms.

Renfe posted a photo of its President Alvaro Fernandez Heredia using a replacement bus service as he travelled back to Madrid from Adamuz.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 11:31:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/X6CJPD5V2JIOJKOMXZMWDZK56A.jpg?auth=808cf3b99de4862c3807208390c62ebd92dd2015d22e9c423d3c62614b952409&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Turkey's Erdogan says Kurdish forces in Syria must lay down arms and disband now</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/turkeys-erdogan-says-kurdish-forces-syria-must-lay-down-arms-disband-now-2026-01-21/</link><description>ANKARA, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said on Wednesday that Kurdish forces in northern Syria must lay down weapons and disband now to avoid further bloodshed, after Damascus struck a ceasefire with the group and gave them four days to agree on integrating into the central state.

Syria's Turkey-backed government forces seized swathes of territory from the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in northeast Syria this week, as part of President Ahmed al-Sharaa's efforts to bring all the country under central government authority.

The United States, the SDF's main ally, said its partnership with the group had changed in nature since the emergence of the new government in Damascus, and urged Kurdish fighters to integrate into Syria's state apparatus.

Turkey views the SDF as a terrorist organisation linked to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militant group. It has been engaged in a peace process with the PKK for months and says the group - and its extensions - must disband and disarm .

Speaking to members of his AK Party in parliament, Erdogan said Turkey welcomed Tuesday's ceasefire agreement between the SDF and Damascus, adding he hoped the group's "full integration" would herald a new era in Syria.

"Our hope is for this issue to be solved permanently without any more bloodshed, for the terrorist organisation, which is now stuck in some areas in northern Syria, to lay down its weapons, disband, and for there to be no more conflict," he said.

Laying down weapons is the only way out, he added, and any provocation would be a "suicide attempt."

Earlier, Erdogan's office said he discussed developments in Syria with U.S. President Donald Trump in a phone call . He said on Wednesday that their call was "fruitful" and that they spoke about the joint battle against Islamic State in Syria.

He also urged Kurds in Turkey not to fall for " provocations " by militants and said his government would continue to carry out the peace process with the PKK.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 11:31:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/IQMBMPRWWBLQHJBCIS6XBUADMM.jpg?auth=f8d7def88acd78b5333e641beeb9946ed7454272f6ceb3f486052819fd4f62aa&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US envoy Witkoff says he will meet with Putin on Thursday</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us-envoy-witkoff-says-he-will-meet-with-putin-thursday-2026-01-21/</link><description>Jan 21 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff said he would be traveling with Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner to Moscow on Thursday and that they would meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

"Well, look, we have to go meet him on Thursday," Witkoff told CNBC in an interview, referring to Putin.

"But it's the Russians who are asking for that meeting. I think that's a significant statement on their part," he said.

The Kremlin said last week it was preparing to welcome Witkoff and Jared Kushner to Moscow for peace talks on Ukraine, but that no dates had been set.

Asked if Putin was joining Trump's Board of Peace, Witkoff said "I think so," and reiterated that an invitation to do so had been extended to Putin.

He was 88. He died in the United Arab Emirates , ⁠two sources with knowledge of his passing said.

A former army officer who helped Hafez al-Assad seize power in a 1970 coup and establish his iron rule, Rifaat continued to harbour presidential ambitions during years of exile spent mostly in France. He returned to Syria in 2021, before fleeing again in 2024 following the ouster of his nephew, President Bashar al-Assad .

When Hafez died in 2000, Rifaat objected to ​the power transfer to Bashar and declared himself the legitimate successor in what proved to be an ultimately toothless leadership challenge.

He weighed in from abroad again in 2011 as rebellion swept ‍Syria, urging his nephew to step down quickly to prevent civil war . But he also deflected blame away from Bashar, attributing the revolt against his rule to an accumulation of errors.

More than a decade later, Bashar - still in power at the time - allowed his uncle to ​return home, helping him escape jail in France where he was found guilty of acquiring millions of euros of property using funds diverted from the ​Syrian state.

When Bashar fell, Rifaat had tried to escape via a Russian airbase but was denied entry and eventually crossed to Lebanon, carried over a river on the back of a close associate, according to one of the sources, who had direct knowledge of the incident.

Rifaat al-Assad, a younger brother to Hafez, was born in the village of Qardaha in a mountainous area near the Mediterranean coast which forms the heartland of the minority Alawite community to which the family belongs.

Rifaat became a powerful figure in the Assad regime after the 1970 coup. He commanded the loyalty of elite forces that crushed the 1982 Muslim Brotherhood uprising in Hama, one of the biggest threats to Hafez al-Assad during his 30-year rule.

The devastating three-week assault, which killed more than 10,000 people, has often been described as a model for how Bashar would deal with the rebellion against his rule some three decades later.

In 2022 ‍the independent Syrian Network for Human Rights (SNHR) monitoring group, citing informed estimates, alleged that between 30,000 and 40,000 civilians were killed in Hama.

In March 2024, the Attorney General’s Office of Switzerland said that it would put Rifaat al-Assad on trial for war crimes and crimes ​against humanity for his actions in Hama.

According to the Swiss prosecutors’ indictment, between 3,000 and 60,000 people, the majority civilians, died in the Hama assault. In response Rifaat’s lawyers said in a statement that he had always denied any involvement in the alleged acts.

His role in crushing the Hama insurrection further elevated his standing in that administration.

In his book - “Asad: The ‌Struggle for the Middle East” - journalist Patrick Seale listed victory over the Brotherhood as one of the factors that led senior regime figures to turn to Rifaat when Hafez fell ill in 1983 and they feared he would not recover.

He was appointed vice president the following year.

While Hafez was still unwell, Rifaat started ‍pressing for changes in government, and posters of him in uniform appeared in Damascus . When Assad recovered, he was “extremely displeased”, Seale wrote.

Their rivalry culminated in 1984 when Rifaat ordered his forces to seize control of key points in Damascus, threatening all-out conflict. But Hafez talked his younger brother down from confrontation.

Rifaat left Syria after the failed coup.

Establishing himself as a rich businessman in Europe, he initially settled in Geneva, later moving to France and Spain.

In his later years, he could be seen walking with an entourage of bodyguards in southern Spain’s Puerto Banus in Marbella, where he also had seaside property.

But his wealth increasingly became the focus of corruption investigations.

In 2020, a French court found him guilty of acquiring millions of euros’ worth of French property using funds diverted from the Syrian state and sentenced him to four years in jail.

All of his property in France, estimated to ‍be worth €100 million at the time, was ordered seized, as well as a property worth €29 million in London.

Rifaat repeatedly denied the accusations.

His return to Syria in 2021 was not the first time he had gone ‌home since the failed coup: in ​1992, he attended his mother’s funeral.

A pro-government newspaper reported he had returned in 2021 “in order to prevent his imprisonment in France” and would play no political or social role.

A photo posted on social media in April 2023 showed him among a group of people, including a smiling Bashar.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 11:51:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/43b45818-f6bd-11f0-9a32-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/AP19343359919982-1.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Turkey's foreign minister to represent Erdogan on 'Board of Peace', source says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/turkeys-foreign-minister-represent-erdogan-board-peace-source-says-2026-01-21/</link><description>ANKARA, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan will represent Turkey's president on U.S. President Donald Trump's international " Board of Peace " initiative, a Turkish source told Reuters on Wednesday.

Trump had sent an invitation to President Tayyip Erdogan to become a member of the board, an initiative that initially aimed to end the conflict in Gaza but that Trump has said will resolve conflicts globally.

Trump is due to preside over a ceremony marking the "Board of Peace" on Thursday at the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.

"Hakan (Fidan) will join," Erdogan told reporters in parliament on Wednesday when asked whether he accepted Trump's invitation.

The White House had earlier announced that Fidan was a member of a separate "Gaza Executive Board", along with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff, former British prime minister Tony Blair and Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner.

The Turkish source with knowledge of the matter, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Fidan would also represent Erdogan at the leaders-level "Board of Peace".

The Turkish Foreign Ministry said in a statement that Fidan would attend the signing ceremony on Thursday.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 12:51:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/XSKIDK3U3BJF3HB6YLZUAPFBLE.jpg?auth=7ab0404c755cbcd9068c77a6d0a0d9bb6f508d2355dfa650db17ca39a31cb0de&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Prince Harry appears in witness box to start evidence against Daily Mail publisher</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/prince-harry-give-evidence-again-latest-privacy-lawsuit-against-mail-publisher-2026-01-21/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Prince Harry appeared in the witness box at London's High Court to start giving evidence in his privacy lawsuit against the Daily Mail's publisher, the royal's second such appearance in three years.

The Duke of Sussex, 41, and six other claimants including singer Elton John are suing the Mail's publisher Associated Newspapers for violations of their privacy from the early 1990s until the 2010s.

Associated has called the allegations "preposterous smears", saying their journalists had legitimate sources for information, including from the celebrities' friends and acquaintances.

Having become in 2023 the first royal in 130 years to give evidence in court during another of his lawsuits against the press, the younger son of King Charles appeared as the claimants' initial witness in the case against Associated.

Asked how he wished to be addressed during the hearing, Harry said "same as last time", a reference to his previous appearance at the High Court in 2023. However, his evidence was then delayed as the court dealt with a technical issue.

The prince's case centres on 14 articles his legal team say were the product of unlawful information gathering, including by hacking voicemail messages, bugging landlines and obtaining private information by deception, known as "blagging".

Associated, however, says Harry's social circle was known to be "leaky" and that some articles were based on public statements issued by royal press officers.

Harry was originally due to give evidence on Thursday but this was brought forward after Associated concluded their opening argument much faster than expected.

"They have had to resort to game playing and dirty tricks," a source close to the prince's team said.

"They think that by pulling the schedule forward 24 hours they are giving Prince Harry less time to prepare - he’s been preparing for this moment for the last three years. Safe to say, he’s ready."</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 12:52:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5CUSCFF2WRMSJIOFLOPEVCZABY.jpg?auth=1e1041bf649810b1bcaf4b9bb09e1728a1fad677f626b7113cf20623eeb301aa&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israeli fire kills five Palestinians as Trump seeks to advance Gaza peace deal</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-fire-kills-five-palestinians-trump-seeks-advance-gaza-peace-deal-2026-01-21/</link><description>CAIRO, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Israeli fire killed five Palestinians, including two boys, in central and southern Gaza, local health authorities said, and the Israeli military said it had "eliminated" a Palestinian militant who posed a threat to soldiers.

Israel and Hamas have traded blame for many breaches of the October ceasefire after two years of war that devastated Gaza and caused a humanitarian disaster, and remain at odds over the next steps in U.S. President Donald Trump's 20-point peace plan.

Palestinian medics said three people, including a 10-year-old boy, were killed as a result of Israeli tank shelling east of Deir Al-Balah in the central Gaza Strip. Two others, a boy, 13, and a woman, were killed in two separate Israeli shooting incidents in eastern Khan Younis in Gaza's south, they said.

Residents said the two incidents occurred in Palestinian-controlled areas. The ceasefire led to a partial Israeli military withdrawal, leaving Israeli forces holding about 53% of the enclave, but they have been gradually expanding their presence in recent weeks, leading to further displacement of Palestinian families, residents told Reuters.

The Israeli military did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the two incidents.

Earlier on Wednesday, it said in a statement that Israeli forces killed a "terrorist" who crossed into an area under their control, posing an imminent threat to soldiers operating there.

The U.S.-brokered October deal has not progressed beyond the first-phase ceasefire, under which major fighting stopped, some Israeli forces pulled back, and Hamas freed hostages in return for Palestinian detainees and convicted prisoners.

Under future phases whose details have yet to be hammered out, Hamas is supposed to disarm, Israeli forces withdraw further and an internationally backed administration installed to rebuild the ruined, densely populated territory.

But no timetable has been set to implement the plan.

Trump was due on Thursday to preside over a ceremony celebrating the Board of Peace, a group he formed with the stated goal of redeveloping the coastal enclave.

Israel says it can only move into the second phase after Hamas hands over the remains of the last Israeli hostage.

On Wednesday, Hamas Gaza spokesperson Hazem Qassem said the Islamist group had shared all information it had on the body of the last hostage and searched for it but in vain, blaming what it called Israeli military obstruction.

More than 460 Palestinians and three Israeli soldiers have been reported killed in clashes since the ceasefire took effect.

Israel launched its air and ground war in Gaza after a Hamas-led cross-border attack on October 7, 2023 that killed 1,200 people, according to Israeli tallies. Israel's assault has killed 71,000 Palestinians, Gaza's health authorities say.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 12:53:21 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/GTBTRMCEDNOC3CS3JJLK2CTZTI.jpg?auth=a19fd308d84ccf3f705e7449d15ae88720f51f56dda0dc4199af2108b5a88910&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Davos-Citadel CEO Griffin says US has 'frayed' relationship with European allies</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/davos-citadel-ceo-griffin-says-us-has-frayed-relationship-with-european-allies-2026-01-21/</link><description>Jan 21 (Reuters) - Ken Griffin, the CEO of Citadel, said on Wednesday that the United States ​had "frayed its relationship" with its European allies in ‌a way that the billionaire said he did not "understand or appreciate".

Griffin's comments, made at the World Economic Forum in Davos, come after President Donald Trump vowed over the weekend to ‌implement a wave of increasing tariffs on European allies ​until the United States was allowed to buy Greenland, escalating a row over the future of Denmark's ‍vast Arctic island.

Griffin, a Republican supporter who has said he voted for Trump in the 2024 election, also said that the U.S. ⁠had seen higher inflation due to Trump's tariffs.

"We have disrupted ‍long-standing trading relationships because of the tariffs," he said.

Griffin also reiterated his concerns ‌about ‌the Trump administration's criticism of the U.S. Federal Reserve. Trump has repeatedly demanded large interest rate cuts, accusing the Fed of being too slow to lower borrowing ⁠costs and threatening to ⁠indict its ​chair, Jerome Powell, over comments he made.

"The easy money policies that Trump is trying to encourage the Fed to pursue increase ‍the risk of inflation, and I think puts both him and his party in a more precarious position," Griffin added.

Griffin has previously spoken ​of the need to maintain the ‍Fed's independence.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 12:53:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/GTNX27GTF5PMNF2TDGQVRIWCWE.jpg?auth=b169912660f9469e3d8d75167b46e0170450f397cc80ed1cc87059e9a60eaf66&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>NATO situation difficult but must focus on Russia, says Norway's defence minister</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/nato-situation-difficult-must-focus-russia-says-norways-defence-minister-2026-01-21/</link><description>OSLO, Jan 21 (Reuters) - The situation in NATO is difficult due to the crisis over Greenland, but western allies must remember their common adversary is Russia, which is increasing its military presence in the Arctic, Norway's defence minister said on Wednesday.

"These are demanding times. The situation in NATO is difficult," Tore Sandvik told a meeting with foreign correspondents in Oslo.

"The dimensional threat for the West, for NATO, (for) all members of NATO, still is Russia," he said.

Sandvik was speaking as the Western military alliance is fraying under the pressure of U.S. President Donald Trump's relentless push to acquire Greenland from fellow NATO ally Denmark.

Trump will later on Wednesday attend the World Economic Forum (WEF) meeting in Davos, Switzerland, where he is expected to renew his demands.

NATO-member Norway and Russia share a border in the Arctic.

On land, Norway spies on military installations on the Kola Peninsula, which hosts about two-thirds of Russia's second-strike nuclear capabilities - its ability to answer a nuclear attack with its own.

The area is also home to Russia's Northern Fleet, headquartered in Severomorsk, which operates six of the country's 12 nuclear-armed submarines.

The European ​Union signed its largest-ever trade pact with Mercosur members Argentina , Brazil , ​Paraguay and Uruguay on Saturday. The agreement still requires approval before it can take effect.

Opponents, led by France , the EU’s largest agricultural producer, say the deal will sharply increase imports of cheap beef, sugar and poultry, undercutting domestic farmers who have staged repeated protests.

A group of 144 lawmakers put forward a parliamentary motion to ask the EU Court of ‍Justice to rule on whether the agreement can be applied before full ratification by all member states ​and whether its provisions restrict the EU’s ability to set environmental and consumer health policies. The court typically takes around two years to deliver such opinions.

The ‌European Parliament backed the motion with 334 votes in favour to 324 against, with 11 abstentions.

If referred to the court, ‍the EU could still apply the pact provisionally pending the ruling and parliamentary approval. But doing so could prove politically difficult given the likely backlash, and the European Parliament would retain the power to annul it later.

Supporters including Germany and Spain point to US President Donald Trump’s disruption of global trade. They argue the deal is essential to ‍offset business lost to US tariffs and to reduce reliance on China by securing access to ‌critical minerals . They ​also warn that Mercosur governments are losing patience with the EU after years of negotiations.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 12:55:07 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/b24ac2a2-f6c3-11f0-b3d9-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-21T121332Z-317230047-RC2N5JAG10MW-RTRMADP-3-EU-MERCOSUR.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Europe's far right and populists distance themselves from Trump over Greenland</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europes-far-right-populists-distance-themselves-trump-over-greenland-2026-01-21/</link><description>BERLIN/PARIS/, Jan 21 (Reuters) - European far-right and populist parties that once cheered on Donald Trump and gained in standing through his praise are now distancing themselves from the U.S. president over his military incursion into Venezuela and bid for Greenland .

The Trump administration has repeatedly backed far-right European parties that share a similar stance on issues from immigration to climate change, helping legitimize movements that have long faced stigma at home but are now on the rise.

The new U.S. National Security Strategy issued last month said "the growing influence of patriotic European parties indeed gives cause for great optimism."

But those parties now face a dilemma as disapproval of Trump rises across the continent over his increasingly aggressive foreign policy moves and in particular his efforts to acquire Greenland from Denmark.

"Donald Trump has violated a fundamental campaign promise — namely, not to interfere in other countries," Alice Weidel of the far-right Alternative for Germany said, while party co-leader Tino Chrupalla rejected "Wild West methods".

The AfD has been cultivating ties with Trump's administration - but polls suggest this may no longer be beneficial. A survey by pollster Forsa released on Tuesday showed 71% of Germans see Trump more as an opponent than an ally.

Wariness of Trump has grown since he vowed on Saturday to slap tariffs on a raft of EU countries including Germany, France, Sweden and Britain, until the U.S. is allowed to buy Greenland.

Those countries had last week sent military personnel to the vast Arctic island at Denmark's request.

National Rally leader Jordan Bardella said on Tuesday Europe must react, referring to "anti-coercion measures" and the suspension of the economic agreement signed last year between the EU and the United States.

British populist party Reform UK, whose leader Nigel Farage has long feted his close ties with Trump, said it was hard to tell if the president was bluffing.

"But to use economic threats against the country that's been considered to be your closest ally for over a hundred years is not the kind of thing we would expect," Reform said in a statement published on Jan. 19.

Blunter still was Mattias Karlsson, often cited as chief ideologist of the far-right Sweden Democrats.

"Trump is increasingly resembling a reversed King Midas," he wrote on X. "Everything he touches turns to shit."

Political scientist Johannes Hillje said it would always be hard for nationalists to forge a common foreign policy "because the national interests do not always converge."

Not all European far-right and populist parties have been so critical. Some, like the far-right Dutch Party for Freedom and Spanish Vox, praised Trump for removing Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro yet kept silent on his Greenland threats.

Others, such as Polish President Karol Nawrocki and the nationalist government of Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban have called for the issue of Greenland to be settled bilaterally between the United States and Denmark.

Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis posted a video on social networks on Tuesday in which he brandished a map and a globe to show how big Greenland was and how close it was to Russia if it were to send a missile.

"The U.S. has a long-term interest in Greenland, it is not just an initiative of Donald Trump now," he said, calling for a diplomatic resolution.

Italy's right-wing Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who is seen as one of the closest European leaders to Trump, said his decision to slap tariffs on European allies was a "mistake".

"I spoke to Donald Trump a few hours ago and told him what I think," she said on Sunday, adding that she thought there was "a problem of understanding and communication" between Washington and Europe. She has not said anything since, but Italian media have said she is against slapping tariffs on the U.S. in response and is instead seeking to defuse the crisis with talks.

However, Italy's Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini, the leader of the far-right League party, blamed the renewed trade tensions on the European nations who dispatched soldiers to Greenland.

"The eagerness to announce the dispatch of troops here and there is now bearing its bitter fruit," he wrote on X.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 13:46:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KBUGWXOZ2FKSDLY3LLDBTW3GBY.jpg?auth=b363b2733b36947c32ef5ec432bfd5c610f613232f24a0b901349e56d5252085&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Britain will not yield to pressure from Trump on Greenland, Starmer says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/britain-will-not-yield-pressure-trump-greenland-starmer-says-2026-01-21/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 21 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he would not yield to Donald Trump on his opposition to U.S. demands to acquire Greenland, adding that the U.S. president had reversed his prior support for a Chagos Islands deal to put pressure on Britain.

Starmer has called for "calm discussion" on Greenland and indicated on Monday he did not wish to escalate a trade war, after Trump threatened tariffs on Britain and other European countries unless he was allowed to buy Greenland .

The next day Trump said Britain had been stupid and weak to agree a deal to cede sovereignty of the Chagos Islands in the Indian Ocean in order to secure the future of a U.S.-UK air base there. When the deal was announced, Trump's administration expressed support for it.

Starmer has sought close ties with Trump in order to preserve trade and security ties, but in some of his sharpest criticism of Trump, Starmer said he would not be bullied into changing his view that the future of Greenland should be decided by its people and by Denmark.

'FOOLHARDY' TO RIP UP RELATIONSHIP WITH U.S.

"I will not yield, Britain will not yield, on our principles and values about the future of Greenland under threats of tariffs, and that is my clear position," Starmer told lawmakers, adding the Danish prime minister would visit London on Thursday.

Starmer said that Trump's criticism of the Chagos Islands deal with Mauritius was because "he wants me to yield on my position, and I'm not going to do so".

"President Trump deployed words on Chagos yesterday that were different from his previous words of welcome and support," Starmer said.

"He deployed those words yesterday for the express purpose of putting pressure on me and Britain in relation to my values and principles on the future of Greenland."

In response to questions from lawmakers urging Starmer to go further in standing against Trump, Starmer said it was still important to work with the U.S. on issues such as Ukraine.

"That does not mean we agree with the U.S. on everything," he said. "But it is foolhardy to think that we should rip up our relationship with the U.S., abandon Ukraine and so many other things that are important to our defence, security and intelligence."</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 13:47:16 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/EPXQKTUNXVPSTHINGX2PF7NAGE.jpg?auth=d4fa8de874c005d62b2020be7f52897f70b68925848546e5e2a1af01ec7b5812&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Drone attacks shock city in central Sudan as war inches closer</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/drone-attacks-shock-city-central-sudan-war-inches-closer-2026-01-21/</link><description>EL OBEID, Sudan, Jan 21 - Drone strikes have intensified in and around al-Obeid in central Sudan as the country's devastating civil war closes in on the army-controlled city, causing significant civilian deaths in at least two cases, residents say.

The city is one of Sudan's most important and the capital of North Kordofan state, part of the wider Kordofan region that stands between the RSF's Darfur stronghold and the army-controlled eastern half of the country.

After the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) tightened their grip on the westernmost Darfur region in late October, they shifted their focus to Kordofan and drones have struck weekly in and around al-Obeid, residents say.

At around the same time, the paramilitary's ground forces began taking over towns and villages across the Kordofan region, while also besieging cities in South Kordofan state, according to residents.

The force has not yet approached al-Obeid, where daily life has continued despite the looming threat and an exodus late last year as the war intensified.

The army and allied forces have positioned themselves on the outskirts of the city.

Sudan's war erupted in April 2023 after the army and RSF clashed over their roles in a planned political transition. It has driven half the population into hunger and famine and decimated the country's economy. Drones have come to play an increasingly dominant role, with the RSF in particular using them to usurp the army's early air dominance .

Overall deaths from the conflict are hard to estimate, though researchers say at least tens of thousands have been killed.

More than 100 civilians were killed in the first half of December across the Kordofan region, according to the U.N. human rights office.

In al-Obeid, satellite imagery from the Yale Humanitarian Research Lab shows the appearance of about 100 new burial mounds in two cemeteries in the two weeks between January 2 and 14.

The imagery also shows evidence of bombardment of the city's power station, as well as the construction of berms around the city, a possible defense against future RSF encirclement.

In the al-Obeid area, residents say the worst of the incidents happened on November 5 in al-Luweib village.

Dozens had gathered from afar for a funeral when an ambulance belonging to the army-aligned Joint Forces drove past, and soon after a drone followed.

The drone, which residents assumed was directed by the RSF, fired on the funeral gathering, killing 65 people, all of them women and children, according to four al-Luweib residents who spoke to Reuters.

The incident echoes frequent attacks documented by Reuters in al-Fashir, Darfur, near or against ambulances and clinics alleged by the RSF to be harbouring enemy forces.

"We were sitting, and all of sudden the drone hit us. I went outside and felt something hitting me and I didn't know what it was. They told me it was a drone," said one of the witnesses, Safaa Hassan, who had burn marks on her arms and a shrapnel injury on her leg. "The yard was full of women," she said.

Victims' bodies, some of them torn apart by the impact, were later buried in a mass grave, the residents told Reuters.

Reuters could not independently verify the accounts. The RSF did not respond to a request for comment.

More recently, in early January, a drone strike killed Abdallah Mohamed Ahmed's wife, seven of his grandsons, and two other female relatives when it hit the home in al-Obeid they had rented after fleeing their village following an RSF attack.

They are among about 43,000 who fled their homes in North Kordofan and about 65,000 who have fled the region as a whole between late October and December 31, according to the U.N.'s International Organization for Migration.

"We found the children under the rubble, under the iron, under the beds. Only God knows the state of the children," said Moussa Adam, a neighbour present at the time of the attack.

"[They] could not achieve their goals they are looking for, so they started killing the citizens and terrorising the citizens," Ahmed said of the RSF.

Imagery obtained by Yale researchers corroborated the targeting of the home.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 13:47:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BDJ2SMMGVJKNZLZSTJZ273GMIM.jpg?auth=b770b5ccb7f3eb7031634e563da121ab9694324f8f5cc26713d0c9053540070b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Part found near Spain train crash site may be missing undercarriage, experts say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/part-found-near-spain-train-crash-site-may-be-missing-undercarriage-experts-say-2026-01-21/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 13:48:07 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Pakistan to join Trump's 'Board of Peace' on Gaza</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/pakistan-join-trumps-board-peace-gaza-2026-01-21/</link><description>ISLAMABAD, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Pakistan will join U.S. President Donald Trump's "Board of Peace" to help achieve lasting peace in Gaza, its foreign ministry said on Wednesday.

Pakistan hoped "concrete steps will be taken towards the implementation of a permanent ceasefire" as well as to boost aid and Gaza's reconstruction, the ministry said in a statement.

The announcement came after Pakistani army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir flew to Davos, three Pakistani officials told Reuters.

Munir, along with Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, is likely to see Trump, they said.

They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to disclose the information to the media.

Pakistan army's public relations wing did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.

The board, set up late last year under Trump's Gaza plan, is aimed at resolving global conflicts.

Some countries have reacted with caution to the initiative, although the U.S. has said that over 20 countries have agreed to join so far.

Pakistan was invited by Trump to join the board, the ministry said.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 13:48:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/SUUFVXA37NJQHMJIYSP62VUVXM.jpg?auth=670b8e62025758b28cc9819a28cfbe54045f2bc973006b75401441de43e861ef&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Macron's 'Top Gun' shades win the internet</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/davos/macrons-top-gun-shades-win-internet-leaders-wrangle-over-greenland-2026-01-21/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 13:49:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Syria says seven soldiers killed in a drone attack by Kurdish forces</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/syria-says-seven-soldiers-killed-drone-attack-by-kurdish-forces-2026-01-21/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 13:49:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Costa Rica's ruling party heads for victory in February elections, poll shows</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/costa-ricas-ruling-party-heads-victory-february-elections-poll-shows-2026-01-21/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 13:50:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Drone attacks shock city in central Sudan as war inches closer</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/drone-attacks-shock-city-central-sudan-war-inches-closer-2026-01-21/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 13:50:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Costa Rica's ruling party heads for victory in February elections, poll shows</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/costa-ricas-ruling-party-heads-victory-february-elections-poll-shows-2026-01-21/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 13:50:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Denied mourning: The ordeal of the family of Robina Aminian, killed in Iran</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260121-denied-mourning-the-ordeal-of-the-family-of-robina-aminian-killed-in-iran</link><description>Robina Aminian, 23, was a textile design student at a prestigious Tehran university, passionate about her field and the opportunity it provided to inject beauty into her world. “Robina was full of life, she made us very happy, she was unique,” recounted her aunt, Hali Noori.

From Norway, where she currently lives, Noori agreed to talk about her niece, who was killed on Thursday, January 8, in the Iranian capital by security forces. "What is happening in Iran is a crime against humanity. To remain silent is to be complicit in it. Close the Iranian embassies, stand with the Iranian people, not with the Islamic Republic," she said, addressing the international community.

Aminian, a student at Tehran’s Shariati Technical and Vocational College, talked a lot about the future, explained her aunt. “She was determined and creative, she dreamed of living in Milan.”

On January 8, the young Iranian woman was working on her fabrics, along with other students, in a university studio when an anti-regime demonstration erupted. She joined the crowd gathered on the outskirts of the campus. That evening, her family received a call from her friends to tell them that Aminian had been shot.

Her parents, who live in Kermanshah, a predominantly Kurdish city in northwestern Iran, immediately got in their car in the middle of the night and drove to Tehran, nearly 300 miles away. Unfortunately, they arrived too late. The body of their daughter, who had been shot in the back of the head, had already been taken to a large morgue.

“The officers who were there did not allow my sister to see Robina. She begged them, ‘I just want to find my child, please, I want to see my child.’ To put an end to the commotion, they let her in,” Noori recounted.

Aminian’s mother searched for her daughter among hundreds of “beautiful faces” wrapped in black plastic body bags.

“The family told me that the bodies were piled on top of each other, that the smell of blood was everywhere, and that when she recognised the face of her sweet Robina, she took her in her arms and could not let go,” said Noori.

“She held her so tightly that the officers couldn't tear her away from her [daughter’s body]. They tried many times to separate them, but no one could.” The distraught mother then asked to be allowed to show the body to the family waiting outside. “She took her, put her child in the car, and they fled,” Noori explained.

“I can't imagine what my sister was going through at that moment,” said the aunt, her voice trembling. "She drove hundreds of miles to Kermanshah, sitting in the back seat with her child's body on her lap. My family says Robina's blood was everywhere: on her clothes and on her mother. My family said she [the mother] didn't want to take off her clothes; she wanted to keep her daughter’s blood on her."

After a long journey, the family arrived in Kermanshah, where the authorities refused permission to bury the young student, to prevent any protest gatherings at her funeral. The family then traveled to several towns in the region, but local authorities also refused to allow a burial.

The parents finally found “a little place” to bury their daughter, after digging a grave themselves, in a location unknown to the aunt in Norway. “They just wanted to bury their child so that no one would take her away from them,” Noori explained.

The family was denied an opportunity to even mourn the deceased. None of the mosques in Kermanshah or Marivan, the family hometown near the border with Iraqi Kurdistan , would give them permission to hold a memorial service.

The young woman’s family was then ensnared in a security-surveillance trap. In Kermanshah, the entrance to the family home was under surveillance. “An officer was stationed at their door and wouldn't let anyone in,” recounted Noori.

In Marivan, around 200 km north of Kermanshah, where Noori's mother – the deceased’s grandmother – lives, agents were also stationed outside the family home. They prevented relatives from offering their condolences. “They said they had orders to shoot and didn't even let my cousin in. I've never seen such cruelty,” said Noori, her voice breaking with grief and anxiety.

Since then, Noori has been plunged into total darkness. From Norway, she’s had no news from her family in Iran. The widespread shutdown of the internet and international communications has prevented any information from leaving the country, especially in the country’s Kurdish regions. Noori is very worried, particularly about her mother's health, as the ageing woman has a heart condition and recently suffered two strokes.

"The authorities want us to remain silent. But I have decided to be the voice of Robina and the thousands of young people we have lost. I grieve for them, for all those precious lives, those dreams and hopes that have been thrown into black bags in Kahrizak," she said, referring to a morgue near Tehran that was overwhelmed with bodies after several days of protests – and has become a symbol of the regime’s brutality.

He had not shouted slogans, joined protesters or raised a fist.

A friend, speaking by telephone from the Iranian capital, described the moment in a voice cracking with grief: Arash fell instantly, lifeless on the pavement. He was 22.

The friend, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to fear for his security, said they had paused on the sidewalk to watch a protest in nearby Vanak Square when security forces in black uniforms arrived and began firing randomly towards the demonstrators .

Arash’s death on January 8 is an example of what witnesses say has been a reality of the country's latest anti-government protests -- bystanders uninvolved in the unrest caught in gunfire, or killed as they tried to flee the chaos.

Reuters was unable to independently verify this account or similar witness reports of deaths during the state’s crackdown on the unrest, and could not determine how many of the thousands killed were bystanders or people merely near the protests when they were shot.

But accounts from families and witnesses suggest that indiscriminate force used by security forces to crush the unrest killed many civilians who were not participating, leaving relatives to scour hospitals, morgues and detention centres for answers.

Officials in Iran could not be reached for comment about the deaths described in this story as authorities began blocking telephone lines and internet connections from January 8, when protests spread nationwide. From January 13, Iranians have been able to make outgoing international phone calls, while calls into the country remain blocked.

There was no immediate response to requests for comment sent to the Iranian U.N. missions in Geneva and New York.

Authorities have blamed the unrest and deaths on “terrorists and rioters” backed by exiled opponents and foreign adversaries , the United States and Israel. State TV aired footage of burned police and government buildings, mosques and smashed banks it said had been attacked by "terrorists and rioters"

The U.S.-based HRANA rights group said it has so far verified 4,519 unrest-linked deaths, including 4,251 protesters, 197 security personnel, 35 people aged under 18 and 38 bystanders who it says were neither protesters nor security personnel.

HRANA has 9,049 additional deaths under review. An Iranian official told Reuters the confirmed death toll until Sunday was more than 5,000 , including 500 members of the security forces.

The protests began on December 28 as modest demonstrations in Tehran’s Grand Bazaar over economic hardship and quickly spread nationwide.

Within days crowds in cities and towns were calling for an end to clerical rule, and state TV showed footage of what it called "rioters" burning images of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .

Amnesty International said in a report it had documented security forces positioned on streets, rooftops — including those of residential buildings, mosques and police stations — repeatedly firing rifles and shotguns loaded with metal pellets, often aiming at unarmed individuals’ heads and torsos.

It said the evidence points to a coordinated nationwide escalation in the security forces’unlawful use of lethal force against mostly peaceful protesters and bystanders since the evening of January 8.

The unrest has posed one of the gravest threats to Iran’s clerical establishment in years, with U.S. President Donald Trump repeatedly threatening to intervene if protesters continued to be killed on the streets or were executed.

Iran's judiciary has indicated that execution of those detained during protests may go ahead.

Numerous accounts from inside Iran, including from people who have since left the country, said security forces fired live ammunition indiscriminately, turning streets — particularly on January 8 and 9 — into what witnesses likened to war zones.

Among the victims was Fariba, a 16-year-old girl described by her mother, Manijeh, as curious and full of life.

On a night when she went with her mother to a nearby square simply to observe, security forces on motorcycles attacked the protesters.

Manijeh clutched her daughter’s hand and sought shelter behind a parked car amid the gunfire. In the ensuing panic, she lost her grip and mother and daughter became separated.

"I searched street after street, screaming her name,” Manijeh recounted, sobbing over the phone. “She was gone.”

That night, the family scoured police stations and hospitals. They found Fariba two days later in a black body bag inside the Kahrizak Forensic Medical Centre in south Tehran, shot in the heart, her body cold.

Officials told the family that "terrorists" had killed her.

“No,” her mother said. “I was there that night. The security forces opened fire on people. They killed my child.”

Videos on social media showed footage of families searching for their relatives among hundreds of body bags in morgues and the Kahrizak Centre. Reuters verified the location of the videos as Kahrizak Centre, although the identity of the people and the date when the videos were filmed could not be verified.

A physician who left Iran on January 14 said hospitals were overwhelmed with gunshot victims. In Karaj, west of Tehran, a resident described security forces deploying automatic rifles against protesters and bystanders on January 8.

Similar accounts emerged from the western city of Kermanshah, where Revolutionary Guards used armoured vehicles and tanks to contain demonstrations.

In Isfahan, the brother of a 43-year-old man recounted holding his sibling’s blood-soaked body after security forces shot him. "His only act was sheltering teenage protesters fleeing into his shop," said Masoud, 38, by telephone.

Like other Iranians interviewed for this story, Masoud asked for his full name to be withheld for fear of reprisals.

In another case, the family of Nastaran, a 28-year-old elementary school teacher in Tehran, spent days searching for her after she visited a cousin on January 9 and never returned.

They found her body in a warehouse near Tehran. She had been shot by security forces, said Nastaran's father.

Authorities allowed retrieval only on condition of burial in the family’s hometown in central Iran and pressured them to blame “terrorists” — a claim the relatives rejected, he said.

Another family in the northern city of Rasht said security forces stormed their apartment after spotting their 33-year-old daughter, Sepideh, watching protests from a window.

"They smashed doors, cursing and yelling. They detained her. We don't know where she is," said Morteza, her brother.

"My sister’s two young children cry for her; her husband has been warned of arrest if he keeps searching for her."</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 15:34:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CZQVKUVJ75LXPJFQKXPUXO5NDI.jpg?auth=fbcaf6a293a4fa1d5e083ed523d9a5d16e38c8d1ad480e485d7af84089692b51&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>How Syria's government has redrawn map with advances against the Kurds</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/how-syrias-government-has-redrawn-map-with-advances-against-kurds-2026-01-21/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 15:34:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Hopeful yet wary, Venezuelans across Latin America mull going home</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/hopeful-yet-wary-venezuelans-across-latin-america-mull-going-home-2026-01-21/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 15:35:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Almost 60% of Kyiv without power as Russian strikes shatter grid</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/almost-60-kyiv-without-power-russian-strikes-shatter-grid-2026-01-21/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 15:36:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Trump: We're reasonably close to a deal to end Ukraine war</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/davos/trump-were-reasonably-close-deal-end-ukraine-war-2026-01-21/</link><description>DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 21 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday said he thought "we're reasonably close" to a deal to end the war between Russia and Ukraine, adding he would meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy later in the day.

Plumes of smoke still lingered, and the current death toll of 20 is expected to rise as police and the state coroner searched for bodies in apartment blocks destroyed by the fires.

As searches continued, residents began clearing debris and rebuilding with aid mostly from neighbors and volunteers.

Carlos Lopez, a city councillor from nearby Cobquecura, gathered money, nails, wood, cement and other construction materials with help from local businesses and delivered them by truck to Punta de Parra, one of the hardest-hit areas that saw dozens of homes destroyed.

"We saw the desperation and the need and put our hand on our heart," Lopez said.

The truck ran out of wood before local resident Doralisa Silva, 34, could get any, but she received toys and jackets for her two-year-old daughter, Celeste. They were sheltering beneath metal sheets propped against a surviving cement wall.

"It was chaotic and painful, seeing all your dreams disappear overnight," Silva said.

When the fire broke out, Silva tried to flee the town with her daughter but exits were engulfed, forcing her to take refuge in a dirt field by their home.

Silva and other affected residents praised community help but criticized what they described as a lack of national government support.

"All the help we have right now has been from people who’ve delivered meals, food, everything," said neighbor Nancy Barrientos, 44, who called for tents, bathrooms or clear information from authorities.

The mayor of nearby Penco, Rodrigo Vera, said local governments were restoring basic services such as electricity but echoed criticism of a slow national response.

"It took 12 hours to declare an emergency," Vera said, adding the delay had hindered deployment of military and firefighting resources. "Everything has been slow. People's pain isn't tomorrow, it was yesterday."

Outgoing President Gabriel Boric visited Concepcion on Sunday but not the destroyed communities, citing security concerns.

In Temuco on Tuesday, Boric said reconstruction would begin once searches for victims were complete and that emergency housing and financial aid were starting.

"We are working at maximum speed, but there are processes that must be respected," Boric said.

His office did not immediately reply to a request for comment.

Boric's government was criticized for a slow reconstruction following deadly fires in Valparaiso in 2024 . President-elect Jose Antonio Kast, who takes office on March 11, has vowed to prioritize reconstruction in fire-hit communities.

"People are hungry and need a roof. This requires a different rhythm and political will," Vera said.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 15:36:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/UCVMF4DTPVIZ7KWNFRVE3UVHVI.jpg?auth=662fea7ec6d535b087eac1634d530cb080f2123cbf195c867225393b3a7ce1a9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Court jails man who killed Russian chemical weapons chief at Ukraine's behest for life</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/court-jails-man-who-killed-russian-chemical-weapons-chief-ukraines-behest-life-2026-01-21/</link><description>MOSCOW, Jan 21 (Reuters) - An Uzbek man was handed a life sentence on Wednesday after a military court in Moscow found him guilty of killing top Russian general Igor Kirillov and his assistant in a Ukraine-backed bomb attack in 2024.

Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov, who was chief of Russia's Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Protection Troops, and his assistant, Ilya Polikarpov, were killed outside an apartment building in Moscow after a bomb hidden in an electric scooter was remotely detonated in December 2024.

Ukraine's SBU intelligence service said it was behind the high-profile hit, one of a string of targeted killings it has organised inside Russia to punish people it deems responsible for Moscow's war in Ukraine. Russia says the killings amount to acts of state terrorism.

Uzbek national Akhmadzhon Kurbonov and three accomplices were found guilty of various crimes related to the Kirillov killing, including terrorism and the illegal trafficking of explosives, Russian investigators said on Wednesday.

The three accomplices were given jail sentences in maximum security correctional prison camps ranging from 18 to 25 years, the Investigative Committee, which handles serious crimes, said in a statement.

Kurbonov, who is now due to spend the rest of his life in a special regime correctional prison camp, pleaded guilty to the charges, while the others did not, Russian media reported. Reuters was not able to contact lawyers for the men.

The Investigative Committee said Kirillov's murder had been planned in Ukraine.

The perpetrators had smuggled the explosives into Russia from Poland, and one of the four men, Robert Safaryan, had stored the components at his home in Russia, it said.

Kurbonov had then assembled the bomb, planted it and remotely detonated it as Kirillov and Polikarpov stepped out of the building.

A string of senior Russian military figures have been killed since the start of the war in Ukraine nearly four years ago.

The latest was Lieutenant General Fanil Sarvarov , head of the Russian General Staff's army operational training directorate, who died after a bomb planted under his car went off last month.

Ukraine has not claimed responsibility for Sarvarov's death.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 15:36:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/C5WKOOQZAVIFNCBKBTHXEZ7UCU.jpg?auth=44902cbe463d4e448f2a7408ac09467e1a2879ad486bf26461154f36a8bc4a41&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump says he wants immediate negotiations to purchase Greenland</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/davos/trump-says-he-wants-immediate-negotiations-purchase-greenland-2026-01-21/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 15:36:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>France puts G7 finance ministers' meeting off to next week</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/france-puts-g7-finance-ministers-meeting-off-next-week-2026-01-21/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 15:36:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Number of jailed journalists fell from record high in 2025, CPJ report says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/number-jailed-journalists-fell-record-high-2025-cpj-report-says-2026-01-21/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 15:36:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Israel issues evacuation warning to residents of three Lebanese villages ahead of strikes</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-issues-evacuation-warning-residents-three-lebanese-villages-ahead-strikes-2026-01-21/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 15:36:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Chile’s fire-ravaged communities pull together as frustrations mount over state response</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/chiles-fire-ravaged-communities-pull-together-frustrations-mount-over-state-2026-01-21/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 15:36:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Court jails man who killed Russian chemical weapons chief at Ukraine's behest for life</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/court-jails-man-who-killed-russian-chemical-weapons-chief-ukraines-behest-life-2026-01-21/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 15:36:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Trump says he wants immediate negotiations to purchase Greenland</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/davos/trump-says-he-wants-immediate-negotiations-purchase-greenland-2026-01-21/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 15:36:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>France puts G7 finance ministers' meeting off to next week</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/france-puts-g7-finance-ministers-meeting-off-next-week-2026-01-21/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 15:37:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Number of jailed journalists fell from record high in 2025, CPJ report says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/number-jailed-journalists-fell-record-high-2025-cpj-report-says-2026-01-21/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 15:37:02 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Israel issues evacuation warning to residents of three Lebanese villages ahead of strikes</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-issues-evacuation-warning-residents-three-lebanese-villages-ahead-strikes-2026-01-21/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 15:37:03 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>No formal communication yet with Trump on LA 2028 Games, says IOC</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/no-formal-communication-yet-with-trump-la-2028-games-says-ioc-2026-01-21/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 15:37:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Israeli strike kills three journalists in Gaza, civil defence agency says</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260121-israeli-strike-kills-three-journalists-gaza-civil-defence-agency-says</link><description>An Israeli strike in the centre of Gaza killed three journalists on Wednesday, including a freelancer who regularly contributed for AFP, the Palestinian territory's civil defence agency said, despite the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas .

In a statement, the civil defence said "the bodies of the three journalists killed in an Israeli air strike in the Al-Zahra area southwest of Gaza City were transported to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah".

It named the dead as Mohammed Salah Qashta, Abdul Raouf Shaat and Anas Ghneim.

Since October 10, a fragile US-sponsored truce in Gaza has halted the large-scale fighting between Israeli forces and Hamas, but both sides have alleged frequent violations.

Israeli forces have killed at least 466 Palestinians in Gaza since the ceasefire took effect, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory, with the Israeli military saying that militants have killed three of its soldiers during the same period.

Shaat had contributed regularly to AFP as a photo and video journalist, but at the time of the strike he was not on assignment for the agency.

The Israeli military said it was checking the reports.

The civil defence, which operates as a rescue force under Hamas authority, said in an earlier statement that an Israeli drone strike had targeted "a civilian vehicle" near Al-Zahra.

Media watchdog Reporters Without Borders said that Israeli forces killed at least 29 Palestinian journalists in Gaza between December 2024 and December 2025.

The most deadly single attack was a "double-tap" strike on a hospital in south Gaza on August 25, which killed five journalists, including two contributors to international news agencies Reuters and the Associated Press.

In total, nearly 220 journalists have died since the start of the Gaza war in October 2023, making Israel the biggest killer of journalists worldwide for three years running, RSF data shows.

Last week, US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff announced the start of phase two of the Gaza ceasefire, saying it aimed to pave the way for reconstruction and the demilitarisation of all armed factions in the territory.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 15:37:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/eb2d00a0-f6d5-11f0-8cb9-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26021519159970.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US and Europe "need each other" says NATO chief at Davos</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/us-and-europe-need-each-other-says-nato-chief-at-davos</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 15:37:22 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/7c684aba-f6d2-11f0-ac0c-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260121-140051-140900-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Mercosur delayed by two years as MEPs refer it to top EU court</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/mercosur-delayed-by-two-years-as-meps-refer-it-to-top-eu-court</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 15:37:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/cc29d898-f6d2-11f0-8a31-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260121-133342-133745-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>What is Trump's 'Board of Peace' and who has joined so far?</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/what-is-trumps-board-peace-who-has-joined-so-far-2026-01-21/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 16:50:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Trump says he will meet with Ukraine's Zelenskiy, deal 'reasonably close'</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-says-he-will-meet-with-ukraines-zelenskiy-deal-reasonably-close-2026-01-21/</link><description>DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 21 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he would meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Switzerland, adding that he felt Zelenskiy and Russian President Vladimir Putin were now at a point where they could reach a deal to end the war.

Trump said he was dealing with Putin, who he said wanted to make a deal to end the nearly four-year-old war, adding that he thought Zelenskiy was also ready to reach an agreement.

Both leaders had backed away from an agreement before, but a deal was now "reasonably close," Trump said in a discussion after his prepared remarks to world leaders and business executives in Davos, Switzerland.

Trump twice said he would meet with Zelenskiy later on Wednesday, a fact disputed by a source familiar with Zelenskiy's schedule, but later said the meeting was planned for Thursday.

Ukraine will mark the fourth anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion on February 24.

Trump said he had expected to negotiate a deal to end the war sooner, but there was "abnormal hatred" between the two leaders. Last week, Trump told Reuters that Zelenskiy was the main impediment to reaching an agreement.

On Wednesday, he said Washington was getting closer to brokering a ceasefire agreement.

"I think I can say that we're reasonably close," he said. "We have to get it stopped ... I believe they're at a point now where they can come together and get a deal done. And if they don't, they're stupid."</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 16:50:44 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/RTDGZ6P2RJOBDBSAP4MOJSRT3A.jpg?auth=4b85abb8b8b73a6b653f04afa88413f8c22438fa08465e7e52bdadf0b3452c97&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Syria accuses Kurds of breaking truce in threat to chances of deal</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/syria-accuses-kurds-breaking-truce-threat-chances-deal-2026-01-21/</link><description>DAMASCUS, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Syria's government said a drone strike by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces killed seven of its soldiers on Wednesday, though the SDF denied this, in an incident that threatens to derail a ceasefire after days of fighting in the northeast.

The Syrian army called the attack, which it said took place as soldiers were securing a captured military base containing explosives, a dangerous escalation.

The SDF, previously the main U.S. ally in Syria, said it had not carried out a strike and that the blast had occurred when Syrian soldiers were moving explosives. It accused the Syrian army of violating the truce with attacks in several locations.

After days of rapid gains, the government on Tuesday said it had reached an understanding with the SDF for it to agree a plan over a four-day ceasefire to integrate into the central state, and that otherwise the SDF would face an assault on the two last main cities it holds.

The government advance against the SDF has put into doubt years of Kurdish de facto autonomy in the northeast and is significant for Syria's ties with the United States and Turkey, and for the fate of thousands of detained Islamist militants .

Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, a main ally of Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa, said on Wednesday that the SDF, which it regards as a terrorist group, must lay down arms and disband now to avoid further bloodshed.

The U.S., which backed the SDF as its main ally in driving Islamic State militants from swathes of Syria in bloody fighting a decade ago, on Tuesday urged the group to accept the government's offer.

The U.S. said the reasons for its partnership with the SDF had expired, but that it was still concerned about the fate of thousands of detained Islamic State militants and civilians associated with them in facilities guarded by the SDF.

The SDF said on Tuesday it accepted the ceasefire and that it would not engage in any military action unless attacked. SDF leader Mazloum Abdi had earlier said it regarded the protection of Kurdish majority areas as a "red line".

Wedged into a triangle between the Turkish and Iraqi borders, northeast Syria has areas with both Arab and Kurdish majorities and contains most of Syria's energy reserves.

Syrian troops were still positioned outside the last main Kurdish-held cities in the northeast, Hasakah and Qamishli, on Wednesday, Reuters reporters in the area said.

They had brought significant reinforcements the previous evening, with convoys of tanks and other military vehicles, as well as buses packed with fighters, arriving late into the night.

The troops had frozen their advance after Sharaa's new ceasefire announcement the previous evening, and were waiting for further orders that would be shaped by the SDF's reply to Sharaa's proposal.

RELATIONS WITH TURKEY, U.S.

The strategic picture in Syria has changed entirely over the past 13 months since rebels under former al Qaeda commander Sharaa ousted Iran-backed president Bashar al-Assad in a lightning advance that stunned the region.

The SDF, which had at times fought Sharaa's rebels during Syria's civil war, had controlled around a quarter of Syria where it maintained autonomous rule from Assad in Damascus.

The U.S. maintained a small military presence in the area and helped the SDF fend off attacks by Assad and allied forces. However, Sharaa has developed good ties with Washington, changing its relationship with the Damascus authorities.

Turkey, which regards the SDF as affiliated with the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) that has waged a decades-long insurgency inside Turkey, had a military presence in other parts of northern Syria in support of rebel groups there.

Ankara and the PKK are now engaged in a peace process and Turkey regards the end of SDF control in Syria as a vital part of that.

Speaking to parliament on Wednesday, Erdogan welcomed the declared ceasefire in Syria, saying he hoped the group's "full integration" into the Syrian state would herald a new era in Syria.

Erdogan and Trump discussed Syria in a phone call overnight, touching on the situation of prisoners in Syrian jails and the continued fight against Islamic State.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 16:52:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BNSGAE6FEVOW5DWBKMJO2VTCJ4.jpg?auth=fb53682faff02d9b0c4ae8be1934a83400361f5a93b8e024d405b0f6763005ea&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Davos participants react to Trump's Greenland speech</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/davos/davos-participants-react-trumps-greenland-speech-2026-01-21/</link><description>DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 21 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump ruled out the use of force in his bid to control Greenland on Wednesday but said in a speech in Davos that no other country can secure the autonomous Danish territory.

Here are comments from some of the people who listened to the speech at the World Economic Forum.

“It was a very insignificant speech."

"He wanted Greenland last week. He wanted Greenland two weeks ago, and he said we should negotiate. And the European Union said, 'We are happy to negotiate, and we never kicked you out. You kind of walked out. You can still put your bases there.'”

“This thing has unnerved many people, as seen from the stock market reaction.”

“I'm worried about NATO. I'm worried about truth and trust.”

CONRADIN CRAMER, HEAD OF THE CANTONAL GOVERNMENT OF THE CITY OF BASEL, SWITZERLAND

"We live in such crazy times that it is kind of a relief to hear that."

"If the president of the leading NATO country has to say he will not use force against another NATO country, and the world is relieved about that, that shows how crazy things are going now."

Gordon said the big takeaway was Trump ruling out use of force on Greenland: “There was a big sigh of relief in the room over that.”

However, he said the overall world view outlined by Trump in the speech would be deeply troubling to other nations: “We are entering a new world where middle powers have to figure out how to survive in a world where they can no longer count on U.S. protection.”

AL GORE, FORMER US VICE PRESIDENT

“To try and take a wrecking ball to these alliances the way he took a wrecking ball to the East Wing is literally insane.”

Asked if Trump’s actions were making NATO more secure, he said: “Of course not - it’s ridiculous.”

ALASTAIR CAMPBELL, BRITISH POLITICAL STRATEGIST

But he reserved strong words for Carney, who received a standing ovation for his remarks at the forum on Tuesday.

"They should be grateful to us, Canada. Canada lives because of the United States. Remember that, Mark, the next time you make your statements," Trump said.

In his special address , Carney expressed Canada's desire to forge new alliances with like-minded countries as he navigates a tricky relationship with the Trump administration in Washington.

"We are in the midst of a rupture, not a transition," Carney said, pointing to how "great powers" were using economic integration as weapons and tariffs as leverage. He did not directly name Trump or the United States.

"We know the old order is not coming back. We shouldn't mourn it. Nostalgia is not a strategy," he said.

Trump has previously threatened to annex Canada, and on Tuesday shared an AI image of a map showing Canada and Greenland as part of the United States.

Carney's office declined to comment on Trump's speech.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 16:52:48 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/FD2ZGAGTMFPFJAJ4MMOKEQKQMU.jpg?auth=e60d9c4ba376840db545d0c81ed17dd126bf45a6b59f795569543604bfbc4739&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ecuador to impose 30% tariff on Colombian goods from February</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/ecuador-impose-30-tariff-colombian-goods-february-2026-01-21/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 16:53:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Pope Leo invited to join Trump's 'Board of Peace', cardinal says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/pope-leo-invited-join-trumps-board-peace-cardinal-says-2026-01-21/</link><description>VATICAN CITY, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Pope Leo is among world leaders invited to join U.S. President Donald Trump's "Board of Peace" , Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican's top diplomatic official, said on Wednesday.

Leo, the first U.S. pope and a critic of some of Trump's policies, is evaluating the invitation, he said.

"The pope has received an invitation and we are considering what to do," Parolin told journalists. "I believe it will be something that requires a bit of time for consideration before giving a response."

The board was initially aimed at ending the conflict in Gaza, however Trump has said it will have a much broader remit and resolve conflicts globally.

While some countries, such as Israel and Egypt, have accepted the invitation, a number of others have expressed caution with diplomats warning it could harm the work of the United Nations.

The Vatican press office did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Parolin's remarks.

Leo, who has shown a robust but quiet diplomatic style since being elected pope last May, has decried conditions for Palestinians living in Gaza several times, including in a forceful sermon on Christmas Eve.

The pope, leader of the world's 1.4 billion Catholics, rarely joins international boards. The Vatican has an extensive diplomatic service and is a permanent observer at the United Nations, often taking part in debates.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 16:54:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/U4DJSIUROZJA5GKYJT3T7IK5OQ.jpg?auth=a8a0dbb32c395ac8050649bb69fb43383ffb3de7554112df30909929b197d793&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Romania's far-right opposition dominates in latest opinion poll</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/romanias-far-right-opposition-dominates-latest-opinion-poll-2026-01-21/</link><description>BUCHAREST, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Romania's hard-right opposition party the Alliance for Uniting Romanians is towering over the four parties of the pro-European coalition government in popular support, an opinion poll showed on Wednesday, although no election is due until 2028.

AUR, the second-largest party in the country, led surveys throughout 2025 despite its leader George Simion ultimately losing a presidential election re-run last May.

The party opposes extending military aid to neighbouring Ukraine, is critical of the European Union's leadership and supportive of U.S. President Donald Trump's policies including on energy and immigration. Romania is a member of both the EU and NATO.

The latest survey, conducted by pollster INSCOP, showed that 40.9% of Romanians would vote for AUR, the highest level of support for a hard-right party in more than three decades.

The leftist Social Democrats (PSD), currently parliament's biggest party and a member of the ruling coalition, ranked a distant second with 18.2%.

The Liberal Party of Prime Minister Ilie Bolojan had 13.5% support. The other two ruling parties - the centre-right Save Romania Union (USR) and the ethnic Hungarian party UDMR - polled at 11.7% and 4.9%, respectively.

Romania's next general election is due in 2028.

The survey was conducted from January 12 to 15 and has a margin of error of 3.0%.

Romania re-ran a presidential election last year after it cancelled the original ballot in December 2024 on suspicion of Russian interference in favour of far-right frontrunner Calin Georgescu.

The cancelled vote plunged the country into its worst political crisis in decades, exposing its deep vulnerability to hybrid attacks and disinformation, dividing voters, crashing markets and threatening the country's investment-grade rating.

The broad coalition government which came to power after the subsequent ballot raised taxes and cut some state spending to help narrow the widest budget deficit gap in the EU.

While the measures helped keep Romania on the last rung of investment grade and unlocked EU funds, with the budget deficit expected to narrow to around 6% of economic output this year from more than 9% in 2024, they have also triggered protests and fuelled support for the opposition.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 16:54:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/YCYDTCJW7JLCHKVOSY4XSMBB5E.jpg?auth=0bbb54e78c5ea10568a38ae2a31c0321c15f02f1158b69de08a55786147fe389&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukrainian power grid executive dies while supervising repairs at damaged facility</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/ukrainian-power-grid-executive-dies-while-supervising-repairs-damaged-facility-2026-01-21/</link><description>KYIV, Jan 21 (Reuters) - A senior executive from Ukraine's state grid operator Ukrenergo died while supervising repairs at a power facility damaged by a Russian strike, the company said on Wednesday.

The company did not say how Oleksiy Brekht died, only describing it as "a tragic death". Evropeiska Pravda, a local media outlet, reported, citing unnamed sources, that Brekht had died from an electric shock at one of the company's substations.

"Death caught up with him where he felt it was necessary to be in order to restore light to people as quickly as possible," the company said in its statement on social media.

Ukrenergo did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the cause of Brekht's death.

Brekht, an executive who temporarily served as the head of the company last year, was 47, Ukrenergo said.

"I watched him yesterday, with those beautiful sunglasses. What the hell happened?" Trump said, speaking to global elites at the annual World Economic Forum in the Swiss mountain resort .

Macron's office has said the choice to wear the dark, reflective sunglasses during his speech, which took place indoors, was to protect his eyes because of a burst blood vessel.

Memes flourished across the internet after Macron's speech, some praising him for sporting a "Top Gun" look as he criticised Trump over Greenland, some criticising him.

During his speech on Tuesday, Macron described as "fundamentally unacceptable" Washington's threat to impose new tariffs, including on French wine and champagne, to bend Europe's resolve and allow it to buy Greenland.

Macron promised France will stand up to "bullies" .

On Wednesday, Trump harshly criticised Europe and its leaders.

And, while ruling out the use of force in his bid to control Greenland, he made clear he wanted to own the Arctic island.

NATO leaders have warned that Trump's Greenland strategy could upend the alliance, while the leaders of Denmark and Greenland have offered a wide array of ways for a greater U.S. presence on the strategic island territory of 57,000 people.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 16:54:32 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/Z422PV6AQBMXRHIQFF5CZDELKU.jpg?auth=00b609a4eddcea96814ef2a89bd163ea616dd615ab4bf6e09503a6200343bc4f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump chides Carney at Davos, says Canada should be 'grateful'</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-chides-carney-davos-says-canada-should-be-grateful-2026-01-21/</link><description>DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 21 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump chided Mark Carney in a speech in Davos on Wednesday after the Canadian prime minister delivered a rousing address on a "rupture" in the international rules-based order.

"This measure will remain in place until there is a real commitment to jointly tackle drug trafficking and illegal mining on the border, with the same seriousness and determination that Ecuador is currently demonstrating," Noboa said on X.

Colombia's president's office, trade and foreign ministries told Reuters they were examining the measure.

Noboa has declared several states of emergency and recently mobilized over 10,000 soldiers to the country's three most violent provinces in a push to tackle organized crime in the Andean nation, which has sent murder rates soaring .

Noboa said Ecuador had not received "any cooperation" and cited an annual trade deficit exceeding $1 billion.

The announcement of tariffs against Ecuador's larger neighbor follows a 27% tariff on imports from Mexico , Latin America's No. 2 economy in February of last year.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 16:56:04 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LKQSH5H7SFPEXGND6WP5LPVLTE.jpg?auth=8097059edaeaa4ad58e91e88375236956b33ec3992282527bd82dac32f1de6f0&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Romania's far-right opposition dominates in latest opinion poll</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/romanias-far-right-opposition-dominates-latest-opinion-poll-2026-01-21/</link><description>BUCHAREST, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Romania's hard-right opposition party the Alliance for Uniting Romanians is towering over the four parties of the pro-European coalition government in popular support, an opinion poll showed on Wednesday, although no election is due until 2028.

Here is an overview of some of the most important prisons and camps holding IS-linked people in northeast Syria:

The two main prisons in Hasakah province are the Ghwayran and Panorama prisons, where thousands of battle-hardened IS fighters are held. Ghwayran, which was a school before being refurbished into a jail, holds around 4,000 inmates. Other prisons hold adolescent and juvenile boys, some of whom were born in Syria to parents who travelled to join IS.

Military personnel from a U.S.-led coalition secure the prison's outer perimeters and Kurdish forces maintain control inside the prison.

Reuters was granted rare access to one of those prisons in 2025 and spoke to detainees from Britain, Russia and Germany.

Other detention centres are located in the cities of Qamishli and Malikiyah, which - like Hasakah city - remain under Kurdish control.

The U.S. military said on Wednesday that it had transferred 150 IS fighters from a facility in Hasakah to "a secure location in Iraq." It said up to 7,000 IS detainees could ultimately be transferred from Syria to Iraqi facilities.

The Syrian government has taken over some of the other prisons holding IS detainees.

One of them is Shaddadi, which is in the Hasakah countryside. The SDF said it lost control of the prison as Syrian troops approached and that inmates escaped. Syria's government said the SDF abandoned its posts and released some 200 IS inmates, saying Syrian troops subsequently recaptured most of them.

A U.S. official confirmed that Syrian troops recaptured many of the 200 escapees, describing them as low-level IS members.

Another facility that came under Syrian government control is Al-Aqtan, in the neighbouring province of Raqqa.

Tens of thousands of civilians who fled IS's last strongholds as the group lost territory over the last decade were also rounded up by Kurdish security forces and held in two main camps, known as the al-Hol and Roj camps.

As of 2024, al-Hol held 44,000 people, virtually all of them women and children. Most of them are Syrians or Iraqis, but Westerners also live there in a separate annex.

Those held at the Roj camp also include some Westerners such as Shamima Begum, a British-born woman who joined IS. A resident of Roj told Reuters in 2025 that women from Tanzania and Trinidad also lived in the camp.

Kurdish forces said they were forced to pull out of al-Hol as government troops approached. On Wednesday, Reuters reporters saw dozens of children and women in black pressing up against the camp fence as Syrian government forces looked on.

It was not immediately clear what the status of the Roj camp was.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 16:57:32 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7V7BXYQQMRMUXNTYFVVCJ5EIME.jpg?auth=2d6c7c82e858e2be03949ee2240977a9deb7df2508ab730ed4b94943e801e1bd&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Britain's Prince William to visit Saudi Arabia in February</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/britains-prince-william-visit-saudi-arabia-february-2026-01-21/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Britain's Prince William will visit Saudi Arabia in February, Kensington Palace said in a statement on Wednesday.

"That's what they agreed to. They've got to do it. And we're going to know ... over the next two or three days - certainly over the next three weeks - whether or not they're going to do it," Trump said in a question and answer session following his speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos.

Trump on Saturday vowed to slap tariffs of up to 25 percent on eight European nations opposed to US ambitions to annex the Danish autonomous territory.

The ‍EU assembly has been debating legislative proposals to remove many EU import duties on US ​goods, a key part of the agreement struck in Turnberry, ​Scotland, at the end of July, as well as to continue zero duties for US lobsters, initially agreed with Trump in 2020. The proposals require approval by the parliament and EU governments.

Many lawmakers have complained that the trade deal is lopsided, with the EU required to cut most import duties while ‍the US sticks to a broad rate of 15 percent. However, they had previously appeared willing to ​accept it, albeit with conditions, such as an 18-month sunset clause and measures to respond to possible surges of US imports.

The trade ‌committee of the European Parliament was due to set its position in votes on January 26-27. This ‍has now been postponed.

The chair of the committee Bernd Lange told a news conference on Wednesday that the new tariff threats had broken the Turnberry deal, saying it would now be put on hold until further notice.

However, freezing the deal risks angering Trump, which could lead to higher US tariffs. ‍The Trump administration has also ruled out any concessions, such as cutting tariffs on ‌spirits or steel, ​until the deal is in place.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 17:00:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/781164b6-d51b-11f0-b770-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25246511311278.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Replay: US President Donald Trump gives speech at Davos forum</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/replay-us-president-donald-trump-gives-speech-at-davos-forum</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 17:00:26 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/903e5b2c-f6de-11f0-ae45-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260121-143839-155036-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Le Pen admits "negligence" in EU fund embezzlement appeal trial</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/le-pen-admits-negligence-in-eu-fund-embezzlement-appeal-trial</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 17:00:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/f628d96e-f6e1-11f0-85cc-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260121-163941-164133-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>How many people have been killed during the crackdown on Iranian protesters?</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260121-how-many-people-killed-crackdown-iranian-protesters</link><description>Weeks after protests in Iran began on December 28 – and with a near-total Internet blackout since January 8 – it is still impossible for activists and observers to establish the exact number of people killed in the government crackdown on protesters. A provisional count puts the death toll at more than 4,500, with a possibility of "up to 20,000 dead".

Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei publicly acknowledged the deaths of "thousands” on January 17. The next day, Iranian authorities, including an anonymous official who spoke to the Reuters press agency, said that at least 5,000 people had been killed during these protests.

"The final toll is not expected to increase sharply," the official added. He blamed the deaths on “terrorists and armed rioters”.

Despite statements by the regime, the real toll could be much higher. Numbers calculated by observers and activists are a testament to the extent of the crackdown on protesters carried out by Iranian security forces.

Estimates of the death toll published by several media outlets were four times the number given by Iranian authorities. US media outlet CBS reported on January 13, for example, that between 12,000 and 20,000 people were feared to have been killed in these protests, based on information gathered by Iran -based activists working to compile a death toll from reports from medical officials across the country.

Iran International , a media outlet based in London, reported on January 12 that the death toll was 12,000. The report cited high-ranking government and security sources. The death toll was estimated even higher - between 16,500 and 18,000 people - in a January 18 article by the Sunday Times , which based its reporting on a database of information gathered by sources in 24 hospitals and emergency services across Iran.

Despite these varying estimates, most international agencies and media outlets, including FRANCE 24, relied on data gathered by two NGOs dedicated to human rights in Iran: the Norway-based Iran Human Rights and Human Rights Activists in Iran (HRANA), which is based in the United States.

HRANA reported on January 20 that there had been 4,519 "verified” deaths, including 197 members of military and government forces. The NGO added that there were a further 9,049 deaths “still under investigation”. These numbers, based on information communicated by families and medical sources, are the result of a process of victim identification carried out by sources on the ground.

Iran Human Rights reported on January 14 that they had verified 3,428 deaths (see the chart below). The organisation noted that the majority of victims were killed during protests held between January 8 and 12, the period when the crackdown was the most violent. While the internet blackout slowed down the process of verifying the death toll during these protests, these two organisations continue to update their numbers as information comes in.

Some social media users have criticised these death tolls, which remain lower even than those given by Iranian authorities. This conservative estimate is linked to the verification process used by these two NGOs.

"It should be noted that the total figure is an absolute minimum,” clarified Iran Human Rights in their latest report from January 14 , which contains data from only 15 of Iran’s 31 provinces.

Jennifer Connet, a Senior Legal Advisor with HRANA, explained how they gathered their numbers:

The figures we post should be understood as minimums, not estimates of the full scale of harm. These figures only reflect cases that have been independently verified through primary sources, which is a process that takes additional time, particularly given the extent of cases to verify in this situation and the internet blackout that is compromising information flow.

[We confirm] that each of the [...] confirmed deaths is individually identified and verified through primary sources inside Iran. The '[...] under investigation' refers to cases that are in the process of being independently verified.

In its latest report, published on January 20, HRANA specified that 9,049 additional deaths were currently under investigation. If verified, the death toll would increase significantly.

Aside from being provisional, the death toll is also incomplete because of the difficulty of accessing information on the ground due to the regime’s internet shutdown. For nearly two weeks, Iranian authorities have been blocking internet access in a large swathe of the country, preventing people from using messaging services or calls using the internet. Connet explained:

In response to the information vacuum, HRANA issued a public call via telegram urging citizens, eyewitnesses, and individuals with access to reliable documents, images and videos to participate in the independent documentation of the protests.

The internet shutdown poses serious obstacles to documentation and verification. HRA maintains deep concern regarding the internet blackout, which not only violates the right of Iranians to access information but cuts 90 million plus people off from the outside world and facilitates impunity for the continued excessive use of force against protesters, by enabling the concealment of violence and repression.

"We’ve noticed a significant decline in contact in recent days, which corresponds with the severity of communications restrictions,” she added. “However, even during this same period, we have been able to maintain limited contact thanks to more stable but less sophisticated forms of communication, like phone calls with our established contacts.”

Whatever the final death toll, the crackdown on this opposition movement has been historic in comparison to previous protests against the regime.

Around 500 protesters were killed in the 2022 protests in support of Mahsa Amini , who was killed by the morality police after being arrested for “wearing inappropriate clothing”.

Trump said the tariffs would start at 10 percent in February and climb to 25 percent in June, rates that would be high enough to increase costs and slow growth, potentially hurting Trump’s efforts to tamp down the high cost of living in the US.

The president in a text message that circulated among European officials this week linked his aggressive stance on Greenland to last year’s decision not to award him the Nobel Peace Prize. In the message, he told Norway’s Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store that he no longer felt “an obligation to think purely of Peace”.

As Trump’s motorcade headed down a narrow road to the speech site, Onlookers, including some skiers, lined the route as Trump’s motorcade arrived in the Swiss mountain town. Some made obscene gestures, and one held up a paper cursing the president.

Billionaires and business leaders nonetheless sought seats inside the forum’s Congress Hall, which had a capacity of around 1,000, to hear Trump. By the time he began, it was standing room only.

​​​​​Trump is expected to have around five bilateral meetings with foreign leaders while at the forum, where more than 60 other heads of state are in attendance, though further details weren't provided.

Here are the highlights of Trump's speech:

Trump insisted he wants to “get Greenland, including right, title and ownership”, but he said he wouldn’t employ force to achieve that.

“What I’m asking for is a piece of ice, cold and poorly located,” Trump said, declaring of NATO : “It’s a very small ask compared to what we have given them for many, many decades.”

He urged NATO to allow the US to take Greenland from Denmark and added an extraordinary warning, saying alliance members can say yes “and we’ll be very appreciative. Or you can say, ‘No,’ and we will remember.”

“This enormous unsecured island is actually part of North America,” Trump said. “That’s our territory.”

On several occasions during a speech which lasted ‌more than an hour, Trump mistakenly referred to Greenland as Iceland .

Trump said that the US is booming but Europe is “not heading in the right direction" which he blamed on European leaders' policy missteps in areas ranging from wind power and the environment to immigration and geopolitics.

“I love Europe and I want to see Europe go good, but it’s not heading in the right direction,” Trump said. He added, “We want strong allies, not seriously weakened ones."

Trump also proclaimed that, “When America booms the whole world booms,” and, “You all follow us down and you follow us up.”

Trump took a hectoring ​tone, chastising the United States' European allies for their insolence and disloyalty to the US.

He singled out French President Emmanuel Macron, taking aim at sunglasses his French counterpart wore a day earlier for health issues and accusing him of playing tough over pharmaceutical price negotiations.

"I watched him yesterday with those beautiful sunglasses – what the hell happened? But I watched him sort of be tough" over his hesitation to raise drug prices to be more in line with US rates, Trump said in an address to the economic forum.

"I said, 'Emmanuel you've been taking advantage of the United States for 30 years with prescription drugs. You really should do it, and you will do it,'" Trump said.

Trump also targeted Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney saying he "should be grateful" to Washington, a day after Carney warned of a rupture to the US-led global system.

" Canada lives because of the United States. Remember that, Mark, the next time you make your statements," Trump added.

Trump planned to use his Davos appearance to talk about making housing more attainable and other affordability issues that are top priorities for Americans, but his appearance at the gathering of global elites focused more on his gripes with other countries.

When he finally did mention housing, meanwhile, Trump suggested he didn't support a measure to encourage affordability. He said bringing down rising home prices hurts property values and makes homeowners who once felt wealthy because of the equity in their houses feel poorer.

White House officials had promoted the speech as a moment for Trump to try to rekindle populist support back in the US, where many voters who backed him in 2024 view affordability as a major problem.

About six in 10 US adults now say that Trump has hurt the cost of living, according to the latest survey by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.

US home sales are at a 30-year low with rising prices and elevated mortgage rates keeping many prospective buyers out of the market. So far, Trump has announced plans to buy $200 billion in mortgage securities to help lower interest rates on home loans, and has called for a ban on large financial companies buying houses.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 17:00:39 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/d2b9ff36-f6d6-11f0-afc7-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-21T143004Z-821579615-RC2Q5JAGQVIO-RTRMADP-3-DAVOS-MEETING-TRUMP.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump "does not appear to give regard to US softpower" as he addresses economic leaders</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/trump-does-not-appear-to-give-regard-to-us-softpower-as-he-addresses-economic-leaders</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 17:00:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/0507f130-f6de-11f0-9f7c-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/capture-21088938886970f0eb261638-87149254.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump addresses World Economic Forum in Davos, making many "false statements"</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/trump-addresses-world-economic-forum-in-davos-making-many-false-statements</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 17:00:43 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/d33c705a-f6dc-11f0-a962-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260121-155057-155513-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'I am not a criminal': Uganda opposition leader Bobi Wine hits back from hiding</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/africa/20260121-i-am-not-criminal-uganda-opposition-leader-bobi-wine-hits-back-from-hiding</link><description>Uganda 's opposition leader Bobi Wine said on Wednesday he was "not a criminal" after going into hiding following last week's election in which President Yoweri Museveni won a seventh term.

Wine, 43, a former singer turned politician who was arrested ahead of Uganda's last election in 2021, said on Saturday that he had escaped a police raid on his home . His whereabouts have been unknown since then.

He had denounced last Thursday's presidential election as "blatant theft".

In a phone interview, Wine said he was constantly on the move but was being "housed and protected by the common people".

Responding to a threat by Uganda's army chief and Museveni's son Muhoozi Kainerugaba, he said: "I'm not a criminal."

"I'm a presidential candidate and it's not a crime to run against his father," Wine – whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi – said.

On Tuesday, Kainerugaba, 51, who has made no secret of his desire to succeed his father, threatened in a post on X to hunt down and kill Wine.

"We have killed 22 NUP terrorists since last week," Kainerugaba wrote, referring to the opposition National Unity Platform led by Wine, who came second in the ballot.

"I'm praying the 23rd is Kabobi," he added, using his nickname for the opposition leader.

In a separate post, Kainerugaba called on Wine to give himself up.

"I am giving him exactly 48 hours to surrender himself to the Police," Kainerugaba wrote. "If he doesn't we will treat him as an outlaw/rebel and handle him accordingly."

Police spokesperson Kituma Rusoke said on ​Monday night that Wine was not being sought.

Asked about the future for his party, Wine said he did not have a firm plan.

"In a dictatorship, you don't draw a strategy, but you respond to the kind of oppression," he said.

Last week's ballot was marred by violence and an internet shutdown, while African observers said arrests and abductions had "instilled fear".

Museveni, 81, who won a landslide with 72 percent of the vote, has said the opposition are "terrorists" who had tried to use violence to overturn results.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 17:55:08 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/9432e6a4-f6ec-11f0-b854-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-15T110250Z-972052072-RC2L1JAZMMBF-RTRMADP-3-UGANDA-ELECTION.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump in Davos: 'He's just like Putin, something European leaders never fully understood'</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/trump-in-davos-he-s-just-like-putin-something-european-leaders-never-fully-understood</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 17:55:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/d4638cac-f6d2-11f0-9647-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260121-131540-132146-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>What is Donald Trump's Board of Peace?</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/what-is-donald-trump-s-board-of-peace</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 17:55:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/a3db763c-f626-11f0-a975-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-16T205052Z-356949125-RC2K2JAYBNZ7-RTRMADP-3-USA-TRUMP.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US military starts transferring Islamic State detainees from Syria to Iraq</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-military-starts-transferring-islamic-state-detainees-syria-iraq-2026-01-21/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 18:44:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>At least 8 Nigerian soldiers killed in Boko Haram attack in Borno</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/least-8-nigerian-soldiers-killed-boko-haram-attack-borno-2026-01-21/</link><description>MAIDUGURI, Nigeria, Jan 21 (Reuters) - At least eight Nigerian soldiers were killed and 50 wounded on when Islamist Boko Haram insurgents attacked a military formation in Borno State, security sources said on Wednesday.

The militants arrived by motorcycle and in armoured vehicles in the incident on Monday, the sources said.

A military source said the military formation was part of an offensive to flush out insurgents from the Timbuktu Triangle, a longstanding militant stronghold in northeastern Nigeria.

The insurgents engaged the troops in a heavy gun battle, according to the sources.

In a statement on Wednesday, the military said troops had cleared several Islamist strongholds in the Timbuktu Triangle and disrupted planned attacks with vehicle‑borne improvised explosive device (VBIED).

The military said troops neutralised one explosive‑laden vehicle but a second breached defensive positions, killing several soldiers and members of the Civilian Joint Task Force, a civilian militia that supports the military.

A CJTF member confirmed the attack and said government forces had been outnumbered during the assault.

The Timbuktu Triangle, a vast and difficult‑to‑access area spanning parts of Borno State, has for more than a decade served as a base for Boko Haram fighters launching coordinated attacks on military positions and civilian communities.

Boko Haram, a jihadist group that emerged in northeastern Nigeria in 2009, has killed tens of thousands of people and displaced millions across Nigeria and neighbouring countries.

The group has since split, with one faction aligning with Islamic State to form Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP), which has increasingly targeted military bases in recent years.

Despite repeated military offensives, Boko Haram and its splinter groups have continued to mount large‑scale attacks, exploiting difficult terrain, porous regional borders and a limited state presence in parts of the arid northeast.

The Nigerian military has since withdrawn its forces from the triangle to a base in Damboa, according to the sources. The bodies of those killed and the wounded were being transported to the military hospital at Maimalari Barracks in Maiduguri.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 18:45:31 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Death toll in Karachi mall fire climbs to around 50, official says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/death-toll-karachi-mall-fire-climbs-around-50-official-says-2026-01-21/</link><description>KARACHI, Pakistan, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Pakistani firefighters on Wednesday retrieved the bodies of up to 25 people from the debris of a shopping mall fire in Karachi , taking the death toll to around 50.

The port city's largest fire in more than a decade broke out late on Saturday and quickly spread through the sprawling Gul Plaza shopping complex, famous for its 1,200 family-owned stores selling wedding clothes, toys, crockery and other goods.

"We have found 20 to 25 dead bodies, or you call them remains," Deputy Commissioner Javed Nabi Khoso told reporters. He said the remains had been taken to a hospital for DNA matching.

Due to the difficulties in identification, he said it was difficult to give a precise update on the death toll, which stood at 29 on Tuesday.

A small crowd paying tribute to the victims lit candles near the site, with some holding images of those presumed killed.

Firefighters had been battling the inferno inside the mall until Tuesday. By the time it was brought under control, Gul Plaza was reduced to a pile of ash and debris.

A total of 84 people had been registered missing, according to a state-run rescue service. Police have said most of the missing are feared dead, meaning the toll could rise still further.

"It is a doomsday scenario," said shopkeeper Rehmat Khan after seeing inside what was left of the plaza. He said around 18 to 20 people had been in the shop, including six staff, when the fire erupted in the mall. All of them were missing, he said.

The blaze was Karachi's most deadly since an industrial site went up in flames in 2012, killing more than 260 people.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 18:45:42 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7ZSX67OIDFNE3HBX5QJEL4KBWU.jpg?auth=ae4523aa23423a47771c2f395a172b2e39da700b56f0e8f78f8cc002db8e76bd&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Slovenia will not join Trump's 'Board of Peace', prime minister says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/slovenia-will-not-join-trumps-board-peace-prime-minister-says-2026-01-21/</link><description>BELGRADE, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Slovenia's Prime Minister Robert Golob said on Wednesday his country will not accept an invitation from U.S. President Donald Trump to join his so-called "Board of Peace" .

Trump has invited dozens of world leaders to join the U.S.-led initiative, which he would chair and would initially aim to end the conflict in Gaza but then be expanded to tackle wars elsewhere.

"The main concern is that the committee's mandate is too broad and that it could dangerously undermine the international order based on the United Nations Charter," the N1 news web portal quoted Golob as saying.

"Although we find any initiative that can calm the situation in the Middle East to be commendable, this invitation dangerously encroaches on the broader international order and not just on pacification in Gaza," he said.

While some traditional U.S. allies have responded cautiously - and in a few cases have rejected Trump's offer over concerns it could harm the work of the United Nations - other countries, including some with strained ties with Washington, have accepted.

N1 cited Golob as saying he will not attend the signing of the initiative's founding charter at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on Thursday, but will instead attend the meeting of the European Council leaders in Brussels.

The speech in Iowa will focus on the economy and energy, Wiles told reporters on the way to Davos, Switzerland. Cabinet officials will also increase their domestic travel in the coming months, she said.

The domestic travel comes as frustration has grown among senior White House aides and Republican lawmakers over Trump’s emphasis on foreign ‌policy, rather than the economic and healthcare concerns dominating the election year.

Opinion polls show Americans ​are broadly unhappy with Trump's handling of the economy, and Trump conceded in an interview with Reuters last week that his Republican Party could struggle to retain its tenuous grip of Congress because the party of the president historically suffers ‍losses during midterm elections.

Trump's attention on foreign policy has included a military operation that led to the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro , escalating rhetoric about seizing Greenland, negotiating an end to Russia's war in Ukraine, and pushing an ambitious international Board of Peace , that aims to resolve conflicts ⁠globally.

On Wednesday, Trump ruled out the use of force , opens new tab in his bid to control Greenland, but said in a speech to ‍world leaders in Davos that no other country can secure the Danish territory. His comments overshadowed a speech that was intended to ‌focus primarily ‌on the U.S. economy.

Trump has struggled to convey a message on affordability , opens new tab that resonates with voters, and the president's aides and allies fear blowback in November since foreign policy is rarely a winning issue in U.S. congressional elections. While Trump is not on the ballot in November, Republicans view him as their best messenger on the economy and plan to use him ⁠to win over skeptical voters.

Some ⁠36% of Americans approve of ​Trump's overall handling of the economy, according to a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll. That is well below his initial 42% rating on the issue when he first took office last year, but up from a low of 33% in a December poll.

In recent days, the White ‍House has scrambled to offer Americans a slew of populist economic proposals to ease cost-of-living concerns.

Trump has proposed a cap on credit card interest rates at 10%, a ban on large investors buying up family housing and a directive to government-controlled mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to buy $200 ​billion in mortgage bonds to lower mortgage interest rates.

Half a dozen economists and ‍lenders who spoke to Reuters expressed skepticism that Trump's recent economic proposals will have any meaningful impact on the cost of living between now and ​November's congressional elections and some could even backfire.

The accounts, not previously reported and shared on condition of anonymity, showed that the U.S. did not stand in the way of an operation that has radically altered Syria's balance of power, at the expense of a one-time ally.

The meetings paved the way for Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa to score two major wins: advance his vow to unite all Syrian territory under one leadership and become the favored Syrian partner for the U.S. administration under President Donald Trump, the sources said.

His offensive effectively wiped out the autonomous zone that Kurdish authorities had hoped to maintain in Syria's northeast and tested the boundaries of Washington's support for Sharaa, who once led al Qaeda's local affiliate.

But the Syrian rebel-turned-president came out on top, with U.S. envoy Tom Barrack saying Washington could now partner with the Syrian state and had no interest in maintaining a separate role for the SDF.

"It seems Sharaa is a master strategist," said a U.S. source briefed on Washington's position on Syria.

The U.S. had been a backer of the SDF since 2015, when the force was conceived to expel the Islamic State group from Syria's northeast.

The SDF later used that territory to establish an autonomous enclave, with separate civilian and military institutions.

But in late 2024, Sharaa's rebel forces ousted longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad and pledged to bring all of Syria under the new government's control, including SDF-run areas.

After months of talks in 2025, a year-end deadline for the SDF to integrate with Damascus passed with little progress.

That's when momentum for an offensive began to build.

On January 4, a Damascus meeting between Syrian officials and the SDF on integration was abruptly shut down by a Syrian minister, according to three Kurdish officials.

The following day, a Syrian delegation traveled to Paris for U.S.-brokered talks with Israel on a security pact. Syrian officials have accused Israel of backing the SDF and in Paris, they urged Israeli officials to stop encouraging Kurds to delay integrating, two Syrian sources briefed on the meeting said.

While there, Syrian officials suggested a limited operation to recapture some SDF-held territory and received no objections, another Syrian source briefed on the matter said.

Syria's information and foreign ministries and the Israeli prime minister's office did not immediately respond to Reuters questions about the Paris meeting. The U.S. State Department referred Reuters to a statement by Barrack issued on Tuesday that urged the SDF to integrate and said the U.S. had no interest in a long-term military presence in Syria.

The Syrian government received a separate message from Turkey that Washington would approve an operation against the SDF if Kurdish civilians were protected, a Syrian official said.

Turkey has repeatedly intervened in Syria against the SDF, accusing it of ties to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party, which fought a decades-long insurgency in Turkey.

"The agreement in Paris gave the green light for this war," said Kurdish political official Hadiya Youssef.

Two weeks later, the offensive was underway and Washington began signaling to the SDF that it was retracting its longstanding support, a U.S. diplomat, one of the Syrian sources and another Syrian interlocutor briefed on the issue said.

On January 17, Barrack met with SDF commander Mazloum Abdi in the Kurdistan region of Iraq and told him that U.S. interests lie with Sharaa, not the SDF, the three sources said. An SDF official denied the account.

A U.S. military official and two Kurdish officials said the U.S. had given the SDF assurances of protection if Sharaa's offensive harmed Kurdish civilians or destabilized detention centers holding Islamic State detainees .

As Syrian troops pushed past the zone they originally proposed to capture, the U.S. military urged them to halt their advances and coalition aircraft fired warning flares over some flashpoint areas. But those actions fell far short of Kurdish expectations.

"What the coalition forces and American officials are doing is not acceptable," said Youssef, the Kurdish political official. "Are you truly lacking in principles? Are you so willing to betray your allies?"

Asked about U.S. assurances, the U.S. State Department referred Reuters to Barrack's statement on SDF integration.

Sharaa nearly overplayed his hand in the offensive's final stage, the U.S. source briefed on Washington's position and two other U.S. sources familiar with its policy said.

His forces had swiftly recaptured Arab-majority provinces from the SDF and kept advancing. By January 19, they were encircling the final Kurdish-held cities in Syria's northeast, despite a ceasefire announced the previous day.

But the U.S. administration was angry that Syrian troops had ignored the truce and feared mass violence against Kurdish civilians, the three U.S. sources said. Two of the sources said U.S. lawmakers were considering reimposing sanctions on Syria if fighting continued.

A White House official told Reuters the U.S. was monitoring developments in Syria "with grave concern" and urged all parties to "prioritize the protection of civilians across all minority groups."

With his forces approaching the Kurds' last strongholds, Sharaa suddenly announced a new ceasefire on Tuesday. He said his troops would not proceed if the SDF proposed an integration plan by the end of the week.

The three U.S. sources said Sharaa's abrupt announcement had satisfied Washington and that he was now "in the clear."

Minutes later, Barrack issued his statement.

The original purpose of the SDF as a combat force against the Islamic State had "largely expired", he said, and the greatest opportunity for Kurds was under Sharaa's new government.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 18:46:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5BW622DSWRMQNCLOI5G7FTRTGM.jpg?auth=4e4425a6b93e90a6b008ef2480ea3aa8126ca384a163deacee93c267761c298c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump says he wants leaders of Egypt, Ethiopia to resolve Nile dam dispute</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/davos/trump-says-he-wants-leaders-egypt-ethiopia-resolve-nile-dam-dispute-2026-01-21/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 18:46:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Egypt, Jordan, Indonesia, Pakistan, Qatar, UAE join Trump's 'Board of Peace'</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/saudi-arabia-turkey-egypt-jordan-indonesia-pakistan-qatar-uae-join-trumps-board-2026-01-21/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 18:46:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Chile's miners flag risks in dual oversight of mining, economy ministries</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/chiles-miners-flag-risks-dual-oversight-mining-economy-ministries-2026-01-21/</link><description>SANTIAGO, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Chile's mining industry expressed concerns on Wednesday after President-elect Jose Antonio Kast named one minister to oversee both mining and the economy, warning that the economically critical sector needs dedicated oversight.

Kast on Tuesday appointed businessman Daniel Mas to lead the Ministry of Mining and the Ministry of Economy, Development and Tourism. Mas is vice president of the powerful Confederation of Production and Commerce and brings private-sector experience in construction, real estate and financial services, but lacks a mining background.

The mining sector is the backbone of Chile's economy and a major driver of fiscal revenue and exports.

Kast had been expected to appoint Santiago Montt, the CEO of Los Andes Copper and a former senior executive at global miner BHP, to the mining post.

Mining groups in Chile, the world's largest copper producer and second-largest lithium producer, questioned the decision to combine the two ministries' leadership.

Chile's National Mining Society, known as SONAMI, said it "did not agree" with the move given the scale of the sector's unresolved challenges, though it expressed hope the incoming administration would ensure effective management of the portfolio.

Manuel Viera, president of the Chilean Mining Chamber, said the appointment signaled a lack of prioritization.

"This was an opportunity to appoint a professional linked to mining to lead the portfolio," Viera said. "Today mining, despite being our national emblem and the activity that contributes the most resources to the public purse, is treated as second‑rate."

Previous administrations have combined ministerial roles, including under former President Sebastian Pinera, who paired the mining and energy posts.

The surprise appointment of Mas followed a statement by Los Andes Copper earlier on Tuesday welcoming what it said was Montt's imminent nomination, a move observers said may have triggered a last‑minute change.

Arturo Squella, president of Kast's Republican Party, told a local radio station that the company's statement was "imprudent" and likely influenced events.

Chile's copper industry faces declining ore grades and investment delays driven by a complex permitting process, while debate continues over private investment in lithium and the future of state‑owned mining firms.

Andres Gonzalez, an analyst at consultancy Plusmining, said Mas was likely to focus on accelerating permits and improving investment conditions.

"Mas has no direct mining experience," Gonzalez said. "But given his business background and his dual role, his priority will likely be speeding up project approvals, which the new government sees as critical."</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 19:28:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/6YYWUQDMTFPENAIY5S2ZDOZ6XE.jpg?auth=7bd099da83d75d58f3279708d742395c90d96692709438c19dab242916176dd7&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'Who can say no?' Trump's Board of Peace tests doubters' resolve in Davos</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/davos/who-can-say-no-trumps-board-peace-tests-doubters-resolve-davos-2026-01-21/</link><description>DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Donald Trump's Board of Peace , seen by some as a rival to the United Nations, has caught officials at some of the countries invited off guard, with several saying they felt compelled to sign up rather than risk the U.S. president's wrath.

Reuters canvassed 16 world leaders, including politicians and delegates from Arab nations, Latin American countries and Europe at the World Economic Forum annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, with the response fairly consistent.

Officials from several regions said privately that joining Trump's proposed board felt less like a choice and more an inevitability, as governments weighed the risks of staying out against the uncertainty of signing on.

One Western delegate pointed to flashpoints involving Trump -- tariffs, Iran, Venezuela, Gaza and Greenland -- as examples of how difficult it can be to resist U.S. demands.

"Who can say no to Trump?" one Arab official said.

A senior White House official said about 35 world leaders have committed so far to the board, which was unveiled last week when the White House sent invitations to about 60 governments, including Britain, Russia and China.

The board, which would be chaired by Trump, would aim to be "a more nimble and effective international peace-building body", a draft charter seen by Reuters showed.

Trump is expected to sign up members as soon as Thursday during a ceremony at the Swiss mountain resort meeting.

Originally conceived as a post‑war Gaza plan to administer and rebuild the devastated enclave, the Board's mandate has widened, with Trump saying it may work on global crises, a role traditionally performed by the United Nations.

He told a news conference on Tuesday that he likes the UN, but it has "never lived up to its potential".

Trump has also put a $1 billion price tag for countries to secure a seat at the table, according to the board's charter.

Some European leaders said they were uneasy about elements of the board's draft charter, particularly provisions that appear to concentrate decision-making power with Trump.

One European diplomat said although EU member states would consult one another, any final decision would ultimately be taken individually, based on each country's national interests.

He said Trump's initiative was still riddled with unanswered questions, including the location of its headquarters and what legal status it would hold.

Describing the process as "a nightmare" mired in bureaucracy, the diplomat said the charter's tightly drawn rules for removing the Board of Peace chairman appeared designed to position Trump in the role for life.

The chair can resign only voluntarily or be ousted unanimously by the executive board on grounds of incapacity.

Several European states have declined to sign up.

France said President Emmanuel Macron intends to turn down the invitation. Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said the board's charter was incompatible with France’s international commitments, particularly its membership of the UN.

Norway and Sweden also declined, while Italy and Germany said they were still assessing. EU officials said discussions are ongoing among member states, with no decision yet announced.

Britain has adopted a more cautious approach.

Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Britain was discussing the proposal with allies, but stopped short of endorsing it.

Foreign policy watchers said the initiative was an attempt by the U.S. president to cement his influence.

"In Trump's mind, he's the boss -- whether it's Gaza, Venezuela or anywhere else," said Paul Salem at the Middle East Institute, adding: "This Board of Peace may be his way of managing an American sphere of influence."

He said the ambiguity around the board's mandate was consistent with Trump's approach to power, namely keeping details fluid and intentions opaque to maximise leverage.

"It's not just his style; it's his strategy. He doesn't want people to know in advance what he intends to do as a superpower," Salem said.

Trump allies, including some Latin American and Arab countries, argue the initiative fits within his broader strategy of projecting U.S. strength and leveraging American power to shape outcomes abroad.

Turkey, which has joined along with Saudi Arabia, said it regards the board as a valuable development despite any potential "shortcomings".

"If it provides Gaza with a gram of benefit, if it will save the life of one person in Africa, our president (Tayyip Erdogan) looks at this very positively," Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan told Turkish media.

Critics say it has left governments wary of punishment.

Trump hit back at Macron for refusing to join and threatened punitive trade measures, saying: "I'll put a 200% tariff on his wines and champagnes, and he'll join -- but he (Macron) doesn't have to join."

The former billionaire investor, who was sentenced to 18 years in prison in 2024, applied last year for a pardon after completion of sentence with the U.S. Justice Department, according to the agency's website.

Archegos, a family office that once managed $36 billion, collapsed in 2021 when Hwang failed to meet margin calls on bank loans he had obtained to make large bets on media and technology stocks.

A jury in 2024 convicted Hwang on multiple criminal charges including wire fraud, securities fraud and market manipulation after prosecutors accused him of lying to banks about Archegos' portfolio so he could borrow money aggressively.

The Justice Department's Office of the Pardon Attorney makes recommendations to the President on pardon applications, which can take months or years to be processed, according to the agency.

A White House official did not comment on the clemency request but said the President is the final decider on all pardons or commutations.

The Justice Department did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for a comment.

Since returning to office last year, President Donald Trump has granted a flurry of pardons, many of which were for white-collar criminals and political allies.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 19:29:07 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/DPTCNN2EWRP5RBFRC72XV2ORUA.jpg?auth=ea3b643035c20283acf210a890818a9254c2ce671f694bc74fc8bcb9422d041e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Syrian defence ministry says 11 soldiers killed, 25 wounded in attacks by Kurdish-led SDF after ceasefire</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/syrian-defence-ministry-says-11-soldiers-killed-25-wounded-attacks-by-kurdish-2026-01-21/</link><description>CAIRO, Jan 21 (Reuters) - The Syrian defence ministry said on Wednesday that 11 soldiers were killed and more than 25 wounded in attacks by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) after an announced ceasefire, state media reported.

"Defence Ministry explosives experts are at the site. Residents of nearby houses must be evacuated to a safe location," Regional Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov wrote on Telegram.

"City services are going from apartment to apartment and organising evacuations."

Belgorod is about 40 km (25 miles) from the Ukrainian border. The region around the city has been the focal point of numerous Ukrainian strikes in the nearly four-year-old war pitting Russia against its smaller neighbour.

Photos posted on unofficial Telegram channels showed a large crater. It was not immediately clear what sort of ammunition was at issue and where it had come from.

Belgorod Mayor Valentin Demidov said on Telegram that buses had been parked near the site to enable residents to move.

"It is important to wait for the explosives experts to complete their work," Demidov said.

Emergency Management and Recovery Minister Mark Mitchell said on Radio NZ that the heavy rains hit almost the entire eastern seaboard of the North Island.

“The good news is everyone responded very quickly. There was time to get prepared, and that helps to mitigate and create a strong response,” he said.

Mitchell said emergency services were looking for two people after a landslide hit their home and that seven people had to be rescued off the roof of their house after water rushed through. A third man remains missing after he was washed away in his vehicle on Wednesday.

New Zealand Transport Authority reported a number of main road closures in Northland, Bay of Plenty and Waikato. Local authorities said some small communities remain cut off due to damage to the roads.

New Zealand forecaster MetService has lifted all weather warnings in the North Island as the tropical low moves east. Some warnings remain in place for the South Island, but they are expected to ease today, it added.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 21:28:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Two dead as rainstorm pound Greece</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/two-dead-rainstorm-pound-greece-2026-01-21/</link><description>ATHENS, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Two people died on Wednesday in Greece after torrential rain flooded homes and businesses in Athens and other parts of the country, authorities said.

“He was invited. He’s accepted,” Trump told reporters at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland after meeting with NATO chief Mark Rutte.

Soon after Trump's comments, Putin told the Russian security council that the foreign ministry was still studying the proposal and would respond in due course.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 21:31:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/GAQWSP6CPJKYLIXWK7QWKOIDKU.jpg?auth=0667c2f9fe1f1520959fd51755d35576d755999f22f2c835a7422d3264c873bb&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>France's Le Pen insists party acted in 'good faith' at EU embezzlement appeal</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260121-france-marine-le-pen-insists-party-acted-in-good-faith-eu-embezzlement-appeal</link><description>French far-right leader Marine Le Pen told an appeals trial on Wednesday that her party acted in "good faith", denying an effort to embezzle European Parliament funds as she fights to keep her 2027 presidential bid alive .

A French court last year barred Le Pen, a three-time presidential candidate from the far-right National Rally (RN) , from running for office for five years over a fake jobs scam at the European institution.

It found her, along with 24 former European Parliament lawmakers, assistants and accountants as well as the party itself, guilty of operating a "system" from 2004 to 2016 using European Parliament funds to employ party staff in France.

Le Pen and others ​were found guilty of misappropriating more than €4 million of EU funds.

Le Pen – who on Tuesday rejected the idea of an organised scheme – said on her second day of questioning that even if her party broke the law, it was unintentional.

"We were acting in complete good faith," she said in the dock on Wednesday.

"We can undoubtedly be criticised," the 57-year-old said, shifting instead the blame to the legislature's alleged lack of information and oversight.

"The European Parliament's administration was much more lenient than it is today," she said.

Le Pen also argued that the passage of time made it "extremely difficult" for her to prove her innocence.

"I don't know how to prove to you what I can't prove to you, what I have to prove to you," she told the court.

Asked about the hiring of her longtime personal assistant Catherine Griset under a Brussels contract despite working in Paris , Le Pen replied: "It's not because she's in Paris that she isn't doing her job as a parliamentary assistant."

She however went on to admit "the mistake" of having "hired people who worked at party headquarters".

On Tuesday, Le Pen was also asked about Julien Odoul, who was listed as her "special adviser" on the party's website in 2015 despite being contracted as a MEP's assistant.

She claimed he just contributed notes as her adviser, and did so little work for her she assumed he had "another job". She said she did not know he was supposed to be working for an MEP.

Eleven others and the party are also appealing in a trial to last until mid-February, with a decision expected this summer.

Le Pen was also handed a four-year prison sentence, with two years suspended, and fined €100,000 in the initial trial.

She now again risks the maximum sentence of 10 years in prison and a one-million-euro fine if the appeal fails.

Le Pen is hoping to be acquitted – or at least for a shorter election ban and no time under house arrest.

On Tuesday, Le Pen pushed back against the argument that there was an organised operation to funnel EU funds to the far-right party.

"The term 'system' bothers me because it gives the impression of manipulation," she said.

EU Parliament official Didier Klethi last week said that the legislature's rules were "clear".

EU lawmakers could employ assistants, who were allowed to engage in political activism, but this was forbidden "during working hours", he said.

If the court upholds the first ruling, Le Pen will be prevented from running in the 2027 election, widely seen as her best chance to win the country's top job.

She made it to the second round in the 2017 and 2022 presidential polls, before losing to Emmanuel Macron . But he cannot run this time after two consecutive terms in office.

If she cannot run, her protégé, 30-year-old RN party president Jordan Bardella , is expected to step in.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 21:32:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/1e9ad952-f6c3-11f0-89b2-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/cef7db4f1c438f7fa280f8fccd10cc3f02b56822.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Peru president says backlash over Chinese businessman meetings aims to derail elections</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/peru-president-says-backlash-over-chinese-businessman-meetings-aims-derail-2026-01-21/</link><description>LIMA, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Peruvian President Jose Jeri told lawmakers on Wednesday that calls for his removal over undisclosed meetings with a Chinese businessman are an attempt to destabilize his government and disrupt upcoming elections.

Jeri, who took office in October after the expulsion of former President Dina Boluarte, addressed a congressional oversight committee that is investigating him for meetings with businessman Zhihua Yang on December 26 and January 6.

"There is an intention, which investigations will surely determine who is behind it, to cause harm beyond just the person, to generate instability and to alter an ongoing electoral process," the president told the committee, emphasizing the need for transparency and responsibility in clarifying matters of public interest.

Jeri's failure to publicly disclose the meetings as part of his official agenda sparked criticism over a lack of transparency and potential corruption.

Opposition legislators are trying to advance motions to impeach or censure Jeri, 39, who is carrying out the current government's term until July. The meetings are also being investigated by the public prosecutor's office.

In his defense before Congress, Jeri apologized for his off-agenda meetings with the Chinese businessman, stating that they discussed the upcoming celebration of an anniversary of Peruvian-Chinese ties. He admitted his mistake in holding the meeting in a "hidden" manner and denied receiving any "irregular" requests.

Regarding the second meeting at one of the businessman's stores selling household goods and food, Jeri said he went to buy "various products, candies, and things like paintings, normal occurrences that have been deliberately distorted."

Peru, which has had a revolving door of seven presidents since 2018 due to resignations or dismissals, is scheduled to hold elections on April 12 to choose a new president, 60 senators and 130 deputies.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 21:55:21 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/A2YKCHM33NLGRF3T7YTTOX7S24.jpg?auth=98bb6d4564b95df19a45e13f27ff2306f756312126f87ff977d96eb567e2cdcd&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump cancels tariff threat, says NATO's Rutte agreed to Greenland deal 'framework'</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260121-trump-cancels-tariff-threat-says-nato-rutte-agreed-greenland-deal-framework</link><description>US President Donald Trump abruptly stepped back on Wednesday from threats to impose tariffs as leverage to seize Greenland , ruled out the use of force and said a deal was in sight to end a dispute over the Danish territory that risked the deepest rupture in transatlantic relations in ​decades.

On a whirlwind trip to the World Economic Forum annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, Trump backed down from weeks of ‍rhetoric that shook the NATO alliance and risked a new global trade war .

Instead, Trump said, Western Arctic allies could forge a new deal that satisfies his desire for a "Golden Dome" missile-defence system and access ​to critical minerals while blocking Russia and China 's ambitions in the Arctic.

“It’s a deal that everybody’s very happy ​with," Trump told reporters after emerging from a meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte . “It’s a long-term deal. It’s the ultimate long-term deal. It puts everybody in a really good position, especially as it pertains to security and to minerals.”

He added: "It’s a deal that’s forever."

A NATO spokesperson said seven NATO allies in the Arctic would work together to ensure their collective security.

"Negotiations between Denmark , Greenland and the United States will go forward aimed at ensuring that Russia and China never gain a foothold – economically or militarily – in Greenland," the spokesperson said.

Trump said on his Truth Social platform that the US and NATO had "formed the framework ‍of a future deal with respect to Greenland and, in fact, the entire Arctic Region," and that "based upon this understanding, I will not be imposing the Tariffs that were scheduled to go ​into effect on February 1st."

Denmark said the issue should be handled through private diplomacy rather than on social media.

"What is crucial for us is that we get to end this with respect for the integrity and sovereignty of the kingdom (of Denmark) and the right of the ‌Greenlandic people to self-determination," Denmark's Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen told public broadcaster DR.

Rasmussen said he had spoken with Rutte but declined to provide details on what had been agreed.

Trump ‍said he had tasked Vice President JD Vance , Secretary of State Marco Rubio , and special envoy Steve Witkoff to take part in further discussions.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 22:29:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/40a55eb6-f702-11f0-8b28-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26021669748686-1.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>House panel advances contempt charges against Clintons over Epstein probe</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260121-house-panel-advances-contempt-charges-against-clintons-over-epstein-probe</link><description>A House committee advanced resolutions on Wednesday to hold former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in contempt of Congress over the Jeffrey Epstein investigation, opening the prospect of the House using one of its most powerful punishments against a former president for the first time.

In bipartisan votes, the Republican-controlled House Oversight Committee approved the contempt of Congress charges, setting up potential votes in the House early next month. In a rare departure from party lines, some Democrats supported the contempt measures against the Clintons, with several progressive lawmakers emphasising the need for full transparency in the Epstein investigation.

The votes were the latest turn in the Epstein saga as Congress investigates how the late financier was able to sexually abuse dozens of teenage girls for years.

“No witness, not a former president or a private citizen, may wilfully defy a congressional subpoena without consequence. But that is what the Clintons did and that is why we are here,” Rep. James Comer, the chairman, said at the session on Wednesday.

The repercussions of contempt charges loomed large, given the possibility of a substantial fine and even incarceration. Still, there were signs of a potential thaw as the Clintons appeared to be searching for an off-ramp to testify. In addition, passage of contempt charges through the full House was far from guaranteed, requiring a majority vote – something Republicans increasingly struggle to achieve.

The Clintons have said they had nothing to do with Epstein for decades and are seeking a resolution to the dispute. This week, they offered to have the committee leadership and staff interview Bill Clinton in New York.

Comer rejected that offer on Tuesday, insisting that any interview also have an official transcript.

The push in Washington for a reckoning over Epstein has shown details of the connections between the wealthy financier and both Bill Clinton and President Donald Trump, among many other high-powered men. Epstein killed himself in 2019 in a New York jail cell while awaiting trial.

Bill Clinton, Trump and many others connected to Epstein have not been accused of wrongdoing. Yet lawmakers are wrestling over who receives the most scrutiny.

A spokesman for the Clintons, Angel Ureña, said on social media that the Clintons are trying to help the Epstein investigation but that “both Clintons have been out of office for over a decade. Neither had anything to do with him for more than 20 years”.

Behind the scenes, longtime Clinton lawyer David Kendall has tried to negotiate an agreement with Comer for months. Kendall raised the prospect of having the Clintons testify on Christmas and Christmas Eve, according to the committee’s account of the negotiations.

The Clintons, who contend the subpoenas are invalid because they do not serve any legislative purpose, have also offered the committee written declarations about their interactions with Epstein.

Democrats have largely been focused on advancing the investigation into Epstein rather than mounting a defence of the Clintons, who led their party for decades. They agreed that Bill Clinton should inform the committee if he has any pertinent information about Epstein’s abuses .

A wealthy financier, Epstein donated to Bill Clinton’s 1992 presidential campaign and Hillary Clinton’s joint fundraising committee ahead of her 2000 Senate campaign in New York.

“No president or former president is above the law,” the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, Rep. Robert Garcia, said at the hearing.

On Wednesday, Democrats tried to advance several changes to the contempt of Congress charges. Several argued that Hillary Clinton should be exempted because she has said she had very little personal interaction with Epstein. Democratic lawmakers also tried to downgrade the contempt of Congress resolution to a civil rather than criminal offence.

Democrats spent the hearing criticising Comer for focusing on the Clintons when the Justice Department is running a month late on a congressionally mandated deadline to publicly release its case files on Epstein. Comer has also allowed several former attorneys general to provide the committee with written statements attesting to their limited knowledge of the case.

The committee had also subpoenaed Ghislaine Maxwell , Epstein’s longtime confidant, who is serving a lengthy prison sentence for a conviction on sex trafficking charges. But Comer declined to press for the interview after Maxwell’s attorney indicated she would invoke Fifth Amendment rights in any deposition.

“It’s interesting that it’s this subpoena only that Republicans and the chairman have been obsessed about putting all their energy behind,” Garcia said.

Comer said the committee will interview Maxwell next month. Attorney General Pam Bondi will also appear before the House Judiciary Committee in February.

In the end, nine Democrats voted with all Republicans on the committee to advance contempt against Bill Clinton, and three Democrats – Reps. Summer Lee of Pennsylvania, Melanie Stansbury of New Mexico and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan – joined in the vote to advance the contempt resolution for Hillary Clinton.

Democrats embraced the call for full transparency on Epstein after Trump’s return to the White House, particularly after Bondi stumbled on her promise to release the entirety of the unredacted Epstein files to the public. The backlash scrambled traditional ideological lines, leading Republicans to side with Democrats demanding further investigation.

The pressure eventually resulted in a bipartisan subpoena from the committee that ordered the Justice Department and Epstein’s estate to release files related to Epstein. Republicans quickly moved to include the Clintons in the subpoena.

Comer has indicated that he will insist that the subpoena be fulfilled by nothing less than a transcribed deposition of Bill Clinton.

“They’re going to have two weeks until this bill is on the floor,” he said on Wednesday.

Contempt of Congress proceedings are rare, used historically as a last resort when lawmakers are trying to force testimony for high-profile investigations, such as the infamous inquiry during the 1940s into alleged Communist sympathisers in Hollywood or the impeachment proceedings of President Richard Nixon .

Most recently, Trump’s advisers Peter Navarro and Steve Bannon were convicted of contempt charges for defying subpoenas from a House panel investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, riot by a mob of the Republican president’s supporters at the Capitol. Both Navarro and Bannon spent months in prison.

The Jan. 6 committee also subpoenaed Trump in its inquiry. Trump’s lawyers resisted the subpoena, citing decades of legal precedent they said shielded ex-presidents from being ordered to appear before Congress. The committee ultimately withdrew its subpoena.

No former president has ever been successfully forced to appear before Congress, although some have voluntarily appeared.

But some Republicans said the Clintons should face the same consequences for refusing to testify as Bannon and Navarro.

Rep. Andy Biggs, an Arizona Republican, said on social media that if the Clintons “aren’t perp walked, we will have failed the American people”.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 22:56:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/02c685c6-d848-11f0-bf21-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25346574786901.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Hong Kong's squeeze on Tiananmen crackdown commemorations</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/hong-kongs-squeeze-tiananmen-crackdown-commemorations-2026-01-21/</link><description>HONG KONG, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Hong Kong's High Court will begin on Thursday a landmark subversion trial of the leaders of a group that once organised annual commemorations of Beijing's Tiananmen Square crackdown on student-led pro-democracy protests in 1989.

The vigil has been blocked since 2020, first because of COVID-19 curbs and then a national security law imposed that year following pro-democracy protests in 2019.

Chow Hang-tung , 40, the former vice-chair of the now-disbanded Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China, and two other former Alliance leaders, Lee Cheuk-yan and Albert Ho, face up to 10 years in jail for "inciting subversion of state power" under the security law.

Following is a timeline of key events:

* May 21, 1989 - The Alliance is set up by activists including Szeto Wah following a May 20 protest, when tens of thousands marched to oppose martial law in Beijing.

* June 4-5 - People's Liberation Army troops fire on protesters and citizens in and around Beijing's Tiananmen Square.

* A lone protester stands in front of a convoy of tanks on the Avenue of Eternal Peace close to the square, an iconic image beamed across the world.

* June 4, 1989 - The Alliance helps organise a mass "sit-in" protest at Hong Kong's Happy Valley racecourse that draws about 200,000 people who condemned the bloody crackdown.

* June 4, 1990 - The Alliance organises its first annual candlelight vigil in the Asian financial hub's Victoria Park, an event that drew thousands yearly for nearly three decades.

* July 1997 - Hong Kong, a British colony for more than 150 years, returns to Chinese sovereignty.

* 2019 - Millions turn out at mass pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, angered by Beijing's tightening grip on the city's freedoms.

* June 4, 2020 - Thousands defy a police ban on COVID-19 curbs to gather with candles in Victoria Park for the anniversary, resulting in more than two dozen charged.

* June 30 - China's parliament imposes a national security law on Hong Kong, drawing condemnation from the United States amid concerns it will be used to crack down on dissent.

* June 3, 2021 - Chow arrested on suspicion of promoting an unauthorised assembly to mark June 4.

* June 4, 2021 - Police block off Victoria Park to prevent gatherings.

* Sept 8-9, 2021 - Chow, Lee, Ho and four other Alliance members are arrested under the national security law.

* Sept 9, 2021 - Police raided and shut down a June 4 museum during an investigation into the Alliance.

* Sept 10, 2021 - The trio are charged with inciting subversion and remanded in custody . Chow is denied bail.

* Sept 25, 2021 - The Alliance members vote to disband .

* Dec 13, 2021 - Eight activists including Chow are jailed for up to 14 months for organising, taking part in and inciting participation in a banned June 4 vigil.

* March 11, 2023 - Chow and two former Alliance members are jailed for four and a half months for not complying with a national security police request for information.

* June 4, 2023 - Hong Kong police detain 23 people for "breaching public peace" on the Tiananmen anniversary.

* October 28, 2024 - The High Court bars Chow from calling overseas witnesses to testify virtually in the trial.

* March 6, 2025 - Hong Kong's top court unanimously overturns the convictions of Chow and two other Alliance members in the information request case, calling it a miscarriage of justice.

* Nov 3, 2025 - The High Court rejects Chow's application to terminate the trial, on grounds of prosecution accusations she called vague and insubstantial.

* Jan 22, 2026 - The trial opens after several delays, and is expected to run to 75 days.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 23:26:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Hong Kong begins national security trial of Tiananmen vigil group</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/hong-kong-begins-national-security-trial-tiananmen-vigil-group-2026-01-21/</link><description>HONG KONG, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Hong Kong's High Court is set to start on Thursday the landmark national security trial of three former leaders of a now disbanded group that organised annual vigils marking Beijing's 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown on pro-democracy protesters.

Once legal in China-ruled Hong Kong, such public commemorations were hailed as a symbol of the city's relative freedom compared to mainland China.

The events on June 4, 1989, when Chinese troops opened fire to end the student-led protests, are not publicly discussed in China, which treats the date as taboo and allows no public remembrance.

Several June 4 monuments, such as the "pillar of shame" , a memorial for those killed in the crackdown that depicted dozens of torn and twisted bodies were also removed from three Hong Kong universities.

Blocked in 2020 over COVID-19 curbs, the commemorations have never resumed since China imposed a tough national security law that year.

Under that law, Lee Cheuk-yan, 68, Albert Ho , 74, and Chow Hang-tung, 40, the three former leaders of the now-disbanded group, now face charges of "inciting subversion of state power" that carry punishments of up to 10 years in jail.

The trial is among the last of several such major cases, with Chow , the former vice chair of the group, the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China, held on remand for more than 1,500 days after being denied bail.

In an opening statement, prosecutors said the case centred on whether the Alliance's publicly stated goal of "ending one‑party rule" constituted illegally inciting others to carry out acts aimed at subverting state power.

The other key focus of the case was whether such acts amounted to "overthrowing or undermining" China's system of government, they added.

Rights groups and some foreign governments have criticised such national security cases against prominent democrats as a weaponisation of the rule of law to silence dissent.

Beijing, however, says the security law was necessary to restore order after sometimes violent protests rocked the Asian financial hub for months in 2019.

Detained since September 2021, Chow , a Cambridge-educated barrister, is one of the few democratic campaigners still speaking out against the Chinese Communist Party's crackdown.

She has represented herself in court and challenged prison rules, such as one barring female inmates from wearing shorts in summer.

"The state can lock up people but not their thinking, just as it can lock up facts but not alter truth," she told Reuters in an interview.

Last November, the High Court rejected Chow's bid to terminate the trial, and barred her from calling overseas witnesses to testify virtually in 2024.

It cited an amendment to the Criminal Procedure Ordinance that prohibits remote testimony in trials involving national security. "Both sides are subject to the same restrictions ... Nothing unfair is done to the defence," the judges held.

In another judgment on Wednesday, the judges said the court would adjudicate on the basis of evidence and legal principles and "will not allow trials to become a tool for political repression ... or an abuse of judicial procedures", as Chow claimed.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 23:28:42 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/RICV3JRHABI2JJTWSZOIOUABAQ.jpg?auth=8b83afae4d141a247646a621da1fdd3183d12f6931af20de9f05043a5818d055&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Vietnam's Lam edges closer to new leadership term after decisive congress cut short</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/vietnams-lam-edges-closer-new-leadership-term-after-decisive-congress-cut-short-2026-01-22/</link><description>HANOI, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Vietnam Communist Party delegates begin voting on Thursday in a process that will end with the selection of its general secretary, officials said, as the party shortened its congress in a sign of broad consensus for the reappointment of current leader To Lam.

The congress of the ruling Communist Party, held once every five years to select leaders and set political and economic priorities, was initially planned to last until Sunday. Delegates voted on Wednesday, however, to wrap up the meeting as early as Friday, the government said on its news portal.

No official explanation was provided, but the shortened schedule likely indicates no divisions have emerged within the party about leadership positions and a probable smooth reappointment of Lam, who is seeking to extend his tenure as general secretary, Vietnam's most powerful post.

Some congresses in the past required longer debates to decide leadership positions, warranting the initial week-long schedule for this year's congress.

The 1,600 delegates that began meeting on Monday are expected to elect 200 members of the party's central committee on Thursday, multiple officials said. The committee will then elect the party chief and up to 17 to 19 members of the Politburo from a pre-arranged shortlist.

No schedule has been given for the final voting session. Officials said it could happen as early as Thursday.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 01:51:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/NDU6WCGXUFNAVMN5NG3Q6UHT3U.jpg?auth=733518ec1e0c1ded91cdb08520d5878fe2a5e7fea7e4d2a89709fbf93e605c0d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Putin says he will meet US envoys Witkoff, Kushner on Thursday</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/putin-says-he-will-meet-us-envoys-witkoff-kushner-thursday-2026-01-22/</link><description>Jan 21 (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday he would meet on Thursday with U.S. envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, who have been tasked with finding a solution to Russia's nearly four-year-old war with Ukraine.

Putin, quoted by Russian news agencies, said during a meeting of Russia's Security Council that he would discuss the possible use of frozen Russian assets with the U.S. envoys in connection with recovery work in regions affected by the war.

"This possibility is also under discussion with representatives of the U.S. administration," Russian news agencies quoted him as saying.

Putin said he would also discuss use of the assets with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, scheduled to meet with the Russian leader on Thursday.

Putin said as well that Russia's Foreign Ministry had been instructed to study U.S. President Donald Trump 's invitation to join his proposed Board of Peace and would reply in due course.

Putin said he saw the proposal mainly as part of efforts to deal with a Middle East peace settlement.

Even before any decision on joining the Board, Putin said Moscow was ready to provide $1 billion - as required by Trump for long-term membership - from the frozen assets "in view of Russia's special relations with the Palestinian people".</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 01:53:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/GAQWSP6CPJKYLIXWK7QWKOIDKU.jpg?auth=0667c2f9fe1f1520959fd51755d35576d755999f22f2c835a7422d3264c873bb&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Australia begins day of mourning for victims of Bondi Beach attack</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/australia-begins-day-mourning-victims-bondi-beach-attack-2026-01-22/</link><description>SYDNEY, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Australia began a national day of mourning on Thursday for the victims of the Bondi Beach mass shooting, with flags across the country flown at half mast ahead of a commemoration event at Sydney's iconic Opera House.

A father and son allegedly opened fire at an event celebrating the Jewish festival of Hanukkah on December 14, killing 15 people in Australia's worst mass shooting in decades.

Police claim the men were inspired by Islamic State to carry out the attack, that the government has called an act of terrorism against Jewish people.

"Today is an opportunity for us to remember and pay respect to the 15 lives," Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told reporters on Thursday.

"It's an opportunity for us as a nation to wrap our arms around the Jewish community because people were targeted because they were Jewish Australians."

A minute's silence, including on the country's main television channels, will be held across the nation just after 7 p.m. local time in Sydney (0800 GMT) when the memorial event begins.

"This will be an opportunity to just take that minute to really think about what's happened and to pay respects, and I invite all Australians to participate in observing that minute of silence," Albanese said.

Event attendees, including relatives of the victims, will light candles and hear speeches from lawmakers, as well as Jewish prayers and video tributes.

Buildings across the country, including cricket stadiums in Melbourne and Perth, will also be illuminated.

The Bondi attack shocked the nation and led to calls for tougher action on antisemitism and gun control, with Albanese pledging to tackle both.

Australia’s lower house of parliament on Tuesday passed laws to enable a national gun buyback and tightened background checks for gun licences, despite opposition from the conservative opposition.

Lawmakers are also debating separate legislation that would lower the threshold for prosecuting hate speech offences.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 01:53:44 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/QSWUITMAWVPBVFPDB3SW6NMH2I.jpg?auth=66610d6c4b36d68e4707a5d7e0c307c6cf178de075fc9eae8df148c61e511900&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>NATO chief: Issue of whether Greenland stays with Denmark did not come up with Trump</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/davos/nato-chief-issue-whether-greenland-stays-with-denmark-did-not-come-up-with-trump-2026-01-22/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 21 (Reuters) - NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said on Wednesday the issue of whether Greenland will remain with Denmark did not come up in his talks with Donald Trump , as the U.S. president stepped back from threats of tariffs and ruled out the use of military force to take control of Greenland.

Rutte made his comments in an interview on Fox News' "Special Report with Bret Baier" show.

Earlier in the day, Trump abruptly stepped back from threats to impose tariffs as leverage to seize Greenland, ruled out the use of force, and said a deal was in sight to end a dispute over the Danish territory.

After meeting Rutte, Trump said on Wednesday that Western Arctic allies could forge a new deal over the strategic island territory of 57,000 people that satisfies his desire for a "Golden Dome" missile‑defense system and access to critical minerals, while blocking Russia and China's ambitions in the Arctic.

Trump had previously repeatedly said Washington must own Greenland, an autonomous part of the kingdom of Denmark that houses a U.S. airbase, to prevent Russia or China from occupying the strategically located and minerals-rich Arctic territory.

Rutte was asked if Greenland will still be "under the Kingdom of Denmark in this framework deal" that Trump mentioned.

"That issue did not come up anymore in my conversations tonight with the president," Rutte said in response.

"He (Trump) is very much focused on what do we need to do to make sure that that huge Arctic region - where change is taking place at the moment, where the Chinese and the Russians are more and more active - how we can protect it."

Greenland and Denmark have said Greenland is not for sale . Denmark and the U.S are NATO members. Trump's foreign policy agenda has been cast by many experts as imperialist in nature.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 01:54:43 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/SZHBCHBRWJJYFJYBNYM73UJS5Q.jpg?auth=68513142984be78754099ba5f8e36a1e8b65536813ccb7469af69d3466ad1094&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Spain urges EU to create joint army amid Greenland dispute</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/davos/spain-urges-eu-create-joint-army-amid-greenland-dispute-2026-01-21/</link><description>ZURICH, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Spain is urging the EU to move towards creating a joint army for the bloc as a deterrence measure, Spain’s Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares said in comments to Reuters on Wednesday ahead of a day of meetings in Davos.

The region should focus first on bringing together its tangible assets to properly integrate its defence industry, and then mobilising a coalition of the willing, the foreign minister said.

The concern over whether European citizens would be willing to assemble militarily is a “legitimate debate”, but the chance of assembling a critical mass was higher as a bloc than on a national level, Albares said, adding: “A joint effort would be more efficient than 27 separate national armies.”

The comments come ahead of an emergency meeting between EU leaders later on Thursday in Brussels to coordinate a joint response to U.S. President Trump’s threats to buy or annex Greenland. A Council spokesperson confirmed late on Wednesday the meeting will still take place despite Trump's announcement on social media that he and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte had “formed the framework of a deal”.

Albares, speaking after a meeting in Delhi on Wednesday with his Indian counterpart Subrahmanyam Jaishankar which included talks on deeper defence ties, stressed that the intention of such an army was not to replace NATO, underscoring the importance of the transatlantic alliance.

“But we need to demonstrate that Europe is not a place that will let itself be coerced militarily or economically,” Albares said.

His position remained unchanged despite Trump rowing back on his Greenland threats after speaking to Rutte, a senior foreign official said, adding that Spain was "glad a pathway for dialogue had been opened within the NATO framework, if that pathway is confirmed."

The concept of integrating national military forces into a supranational European army was first proposed in 1951 to counter the Soviet Union and ensure German rearmament did not threaten its neighbours, but was voted down by France's parliament in 1954.

“The idea of European defence was part of the origin of the EU. It is up to my generation to finish this task,” Albares said.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 01:56:32 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/UWFV7QVM3FID3LY45JMHYPBYJM.jpg?auth=6b3514204552252384815032ecb282ee2f450d60eebf12c4e527d501580ef595&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Australia's conservative opposition coalition splits again over hate speech laws</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/australias-conservative-opposition-coalition-splits-again-over-hate-speech-laws-2026-01-21/</link><description>SYDNEY, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Australia's conservative coalition split on Thursday for the second time in less than a year after the junior partner National Party severed ties with the Liberal Party, citing the Liberals' decision to back the government's hate speech laws.

Australia's parliament this week passed the centre-left Labor government's new anti-hate laws in the wake of the Bondi Beach mass shooting last month, with backing from the Liberals. Three National senators voted against the bill, saying it was rushed through parliament and could undermine freedom of speech.

In a show of solidarity, all National members quit the opposition's shadow cabinet late on Wednesday after three of their senators had earlier resigned for breaching coalition rules by voting against the Liberals' position.

National leader David Littleproud said the split was triggered by opposition leader Sussan Ley's decision to accept the senators' resignations.

"She has forced the coalition into an untenable position that can no longer continue," Littleproud said at a press conference.

"We made it very clear that there would be a consequence and that if Sussan accepted those resignations, then that consequence is that the coalition would be untenable. It would be forced into a position that could not continue. She was aware of that."

Littleproud said his party had not breached coalition rules and that it should not be forced into supporting a position.

Under the long-standing partnership in state and federal politics, the coalition had shared power in governments, with the Nationals broadly representing the interests of rural communities and the Liberals contesting city seats.

The two parties split briefly in May 2025 over policy differences, including renewable energy, following a resounding loss at a national election, before reuniting a week later.

The latest split comes after recent polls showed rising support for populist Senator Pauline Hanson's anti-immigration One Nation party.

A closely watched poll by The Australian newspaper released this week showed One Nation's primary vote had overtaken that of the coalition, with some analysts suggesting many Liberal voters are drifting toward One Nation.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 01:56:42 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ZOHR6HLNUJOXRPITQFJFPWOM7Q.jpg?auth=3c2166f6b382536c67d30de1acc4ec322127e5be2c06931852474db4269e47fe&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes asks Trump for early release from prison</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260122-theranos-founder-elizabeth-holmes-asks-trump-for-pardon</link><description>Elizabeth Holmes, the founder of now-defunct blood-testing startup Theranos, has asked US President Donald Trump to release her from prison with nearly six years left before she is eligible for release.

Holmes sought to commute her 11¼-year sentence last year, and her request remains pending, according to the US Department of Justice’s Office of the Pardon Attorney.

Now 41, Holmes was convicted in 2022 on four counts of wire fraud and conspiracy for cheating investors and was ordered to pay $452 million in restitution. A federal appeals court upheld her conviction and sentence last February.

Prosecutors said Holmes lied to investors from 2010 to 2015 by promising Theranos’ technology could run many medical tests on one blood drop from a finger prick.

Theranos was once valued at $9 billion, and Forbes estimated Holmes’ net worth at $4.5 billion in 2015.

Holmes would still owe restitution if Trump released her from prison , but she would not owe it if he pardoned her.

She is housed at a minimum-security federal prison camp in Bryan, Texas, and is eligible for release in December 2031.

The White House declined to comment on Holmes’ request. Lawyers for Holmes did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 01:57:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/1be11f2a-76cc-11ed-b300-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/Part-GTY-1442569992-1-1-2.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuela’s interim president to visit US amid deepening oil ties</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260122-venezuela-interim-president-to-visit-usa</link><description>Venezuela's interim president will soon visit the United States, a senior US official said Wednesday, further signalling President Donald Trump ’s willingness to embrace the oil-rich country’s new leader.

Delcy Rodriguez would be the first sitting Venezuelan president to visit the United States in more than a quarter century – aside from presidents attending United Nations meetings in New York.

She said Wednesday that she approached any dialogue with the United States “without fear”.

“We are in a process of dialogue, of working with the United States, without any fear, to confront our differences and difficulties… and to address them through diplomacy,” Rodriguez said.

The invitation reflects a head-snapping shift in relations between Washington and Caracas since US Delta Force operatives swooped into Caracas, seized President Nicolas Maduro and spirited him to a US jail to face narcotrafficking charges.

Rodriguez was a former vice-president and long-time insider in Venezuela’s authoritarian and anti-American government, before changing tack as interim president.

She is still the subject of US sanctions, including an asset freeze.

But with a flotilla of US warships still amassed off the Venezuelan coast, she has allowed the United States to broker the sale of Venezuelan oil , facilitated foreign investment and released dozens of political prisoners.

A senior White House official said Rodriguez would visit soon, but no date has been set.

The last bilateral visit by a sitting Venezuelan president came in the 1990s – before populist leader Hugo Chavez took power.

Since then, successive Venezuelan governments have made a point of thumbing their noses at Washington and building close ties with US foes in China , Cuba, Iran and Russia.

The US trip, which has yet to be confirmed by Venezuelan authorities, could pose problems for Rodriguez inside the government – where some hardliners still detest what they see as Washington’s hemispheric imperialism.

Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello and Defence Minister Vladimir Padrino Lopez remain powerful forces in the country, and analysts say their support for Rodriguez is not a given.

Trump has so far appeared happy to allow Rodriguez and much of the repressive government to remain in power, so long as the United States has access to Venezuelan oil – the largest proven reserves in the world.

Trump hosted Venezuela’s exiled opposition leader and Nobel peace laureate Maria Corina Machado at the White House earlier this month .

After initially dismissing Machado and her ability to control the country’s powerful armed forces and intelligence services, he said Tuesday that he would “love” to have her “involved in some way.”

Machado’s party is widely considered to have won the 2024 elections that Washington said were stolen by Maduro.

Analysts say Trump’s embrace of Rodriguez and avoidance of wholesale regime change can be explained by an unwillingness to repeat mistakes made in the overthrow of Saddam Hussein in Iraq.

“Those kinds of intervention operations – and the deployment of troops for stabilisation – have always ended very badly,” said Benigno Alarcon, a politics expert at the Andres Bello Catholic University in Caracas.

Trump’s stance has, however, angered democracy activists who argue that all political prisoners must be freed and granted amnesty, and Venezuela must hold fresh elections.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 01:57:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/6ef4955e-f3c7-11f0-9cab-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-17T070132Z-1638755467-RC2V1JAQYSGE-RTRMADP-3-USA-VENEZUELA-POLITICS-RODRIGUEZ.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Reversal on Greenland followed push by aides against military option, sources say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/trump-reversal-greenland-followed-push-by-aides-against-military-option-sources-2026-01-22/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 21 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's retreat from threats of force as an option for acquiring Greenland capped weeks of policy chaos, as top aides scrambled both to accommodate the president's demands and ease the panic they caused among U.S. allies, according to two sources with knowledge of the conversations.

In remarks on Wednesday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Trump ruled out using military force after weeks of refusing to do so, and in a social media post said he would no longer be imposing tariffs that he had threatened to put into effect on February 1.

White House officials had pushed a less provocative approach, with several key members of the president's team unenthusiastic about possibly using military force to seize the Danish territory, the two White House sources said. They spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.

After saying on Wednesday that tariffs are off the table, Trump said he and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte had "formed the framework of a future deal with respect to Greenland and, in fact, the entire Arctic Region" during talks in Davos. He tasked top officials with negotiating a potential deal.

The episode underscored how Trump's long-running fascination with acquiring Greenland keeps crashing into diplomatic and political reality, emblematic of a second term defined by abrupt policy shifts and rapid reversals. Again and again, the Republican president has changed course on tariffs and other issues under economic, political or market pressure.

Asked about Trump's aides not pursuing military options seriously on Greenland, White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly said: "The White House does not rule out options for President Trump unless he does so himself."

"He announced today that he will not use force to take Greenland, and the entire administration will follow his lead," Kelly said, adding that if a deal is reached, the United States would achieve its goals in Greenland at minimal long-term cost.

In recent weeks, Trump has revived his long-standing ambition to acquire the Arctic island, arguing that it is vital to U.S. national security as great-power competition intensifies in the Arctic.

The leaders of Greenland and Denmark, which oversees the territory, have rejected Trump's overtures, stressing that the island's future is for its people to decide and accusing the United States of bullying tactics.

In a social media post on Saturday, Trump said he would implement a wave of increasing tariffs on European allies until the U.S. was allowed to buy Greenland, which major EU states decried as blackmail .

The idea to use tariffs came from Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and other cabinet members, the White House sources said.

Lutnick did not respond to a request for comment.

The threats in Trump's post came after some European countries sent small numbers of military personnel to Greenland, ostensibly to show that they took U.S. warnings about the island's security seriously.

Ahead of the Davos summit, European leaders stepped up their pushback against the U.S. acquiring Greenland.

"He doesn't like being cornered," said one of the White House sources, explaining Trump's tariff threat.

That announcement set off a scramble in the White House to develop a tariff plan and understand how it would play out. Different agencies are still working out the "cycle of retaliation and counter-retaliation with tariffs" on EU members, the White House source said.

A spokesperson for the Danish embassy did not comment for this story.

Trump first floated the idea of taking over Greenland in 2019 but ramped up rhetoric after returning to power a year ago. In meetings last year, U.S. officials assured their Danish counterparts that relations were stabilizing, leaving them with the impression that any military takeover of the Arctic territory was no longer top of mind for the administration, according to two separate sources familiar with those discussions.

That changed in December, when Trump abruptly announced that Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry would serve as special envoy to Greenland and renewed his push to acquire the territory, seemingly emboldened by the successful January 3 operation to capture Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro.

While aides were broadly aligned on the goal of taking over Greenland, they were split over the president's aggressive approach, the two White House sources said.

In most White House meetings, more officials have urged caution than those pushing for the United States to take the island by force, said the sources, who were unaware of serious discussions on military options to seize Greenland.

Tom Dans, appointed by Trump to lead the U.S. Arctic Research Commission, along with Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, had been "pushing for a middle ground" on Greenland, while White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller showed a willingness to keep annexation and the potential use of military force on the table, the sources said.

Dans and Miller did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokeswoman for Vance declined comment.

A State Department official said: "President Trump's team, including Secretary Rubio, routinely present him with a suite of options on issues of national concern."

Trump himself has been driving the issue, the sources said. One of them, speaking before Trump's turnaround on tariffs and the use of force, said the president had wanted to retain the option of a military move.

U.S. officials have not said what a military operation in Greenland would entail. As a Danish territory, the island is already a member of NATO and the United States maintains a military base there.

A 1951 agreement between Denmark and the United States allows the U.S. military free access to the territory to defend Greenland or other NATO territories — something experts say already gives Washington the ability to send additional troops to Greenland.

Vance and Rubio last week hosted Danish and Greenlandic foreign ministers at the White House for talks characterized by Denmark's Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen as "frank but constructive."

Military action was not considered seriously at that meeting, where Vance discussed how a solution should be found despite seemingly incompatible positions, one of the White House sources said.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 03:48:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KZDYGUJP6BOHPBS3HUL6DLWFCA.jpg?auth=102aa7e7478a256906f2a86f457c673fde0fa9c0456d3cb4914d33bca885d5c5&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>After vanishing from view, two US-seized Venezuela oil tankers reappear near Puerto Rico</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/after-vanishing-view-two-us-seized-venezuela-oil-tankers-reappear-near-puerto-2026-01-22/</link><description>PONCE, Puerto Rico/HOUSTON, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Two oil tankers seized this month by the U.S. in its campaign against Venezuela were near Puerto Rico on Wednesday, a Reuters witness and Tankertrackers.com data said, the first sightings almost since their capture and a possible hint at their destination.

The ships are supertanker M Sophia, seized by the U.S. on January 7 carrying Venezuelan oil, and the smaller tanker Galileo, formerly called Veronica and taken last week empty, although it has previously carried Venezuelan oil.

The M Sophia and Galileo are among seven vessels linked to Venezuelan oil exports captured by the U.S. military and Coast Guard in recent weeks, mostly in the Caribbean Sea.

U.S. officials have not disclosed destinations or plans for the seized vessels. The U.S. Coast Guard declined to comment, directing inquiries to the White House. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for a comment.

Because the vessels' geolocating beacons have not been turned on, the locations of M Sophia and Galileo were unknown until the Tankertrackers.com and witness confirmation on Wednesday.

The vessels could remain in Puerto Rico or be moved to another U.S. port. The other five captured tankers are near the U.S. Gulf Coast, in Venezuelan waters and near Scotland, shipping data showed.

U.S. President Donald Trump has said the U.S. intervention — including the capture of President Nicolás Maduro on January 3 — is aimed at stopping drug trafficking.

Washington intends to direct Venezuela’s government and revive the country’s crippled oil sector by bringing major U.S. oil companies in to rebuild it.

Trump has imposed a blockade to prevent sanctioned tankers from shipping Venezuelan oil, which in December brought exports close to a standstill. Shipments have accelerated in January under U.S. supervision, but millions of barrels remain in onshore and floating storage.

The U.S. government has filed for court warrants to seize dozens more tankers linked to the Venezuelan oil trade, sources told Reuters last week. This week, vessel Sagitta was intercepted.

Along with most tankers under Western sanctions or part of the so-called shadow fleet, many of the Venezuela-linked tankers were built over 20 years ago and pose hazards to shipping because they lack safety certification and adequate insurance, experts said.

That means that if they have a collision or oil spill, establishing insurance claims or liability is very difficult to impossible, shipping and insurance industry sources said.

The age of these tankers, which exceeds the industry standard of 15 years, also raises concern about potential environmental damage, the sources said.

U.S. government civil forfeiture claims related to the ship seizures can take months or years to resolve, meaning there may be no immediate solutions to the challenges.

"These 'dark fleet' tankers can be incredibly unsafe.

Philippine Foreign Affairs Secretary Ma. Theresa Lazaro, who took over this year as the ASEAN special envoy on the crisis in war-torn Myanmar, did not name the groups represented or say when the meeting took place.

"I encouraged their active, constructive and meaningful sharing of perspectives on the implementation of the ASEAN Five-Point Consensus," she said on X, referring to the peace plan agreed between the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and Myanmar in 2021.

Lazaro said discussions included advancing deescalation, facilitating aid delivery, addressing transnational crime and fostering political dialogue.

Myanmar has been ravaged by conflict since a 2021 coup triggered a protest movement that has evolved into a civil war between the military on one side and a loose alliance of rebel groups on the other.

The military is currently holding a general election , with two of its three phases of voting completed and results showing low turnout and a party allied with the military winning the majority of seats so far.

Critics have dismissed the vote as a sham to prepetuate army rule through civilian proxies and ASEAN has not sent observers.

Aside from some improvements in humanitarian access, ASEAN's peace plan has largely been a failure, with fighting raging in swathes of the country and the junta refusing to engage in dialogue with opponents it calls "terrorists".

A spokesperson for Myanmar's military government did not answer calls seeking comment. Myanmar's shadow National Unity Government, which is allied with rebel groups, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Philippines is the 2026 ASEAN Chair and the political dialogue comes a week before the regional bloc's foreign ministers head to the central island of Cebu for a retreat.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 03:50:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/2Z4SN54JR5MODGDEG34XU2J4AM.jpg?auth=5105330a080c2fd97c616227bed4391714bc725158607f131c6b7088b1756179&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Former Texas police officer acquitted in Uvalde school shooting trial</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/uvalde-police-officer-acquitted-child-endangerment-deadly-texas-school-shooting-2026-01-22/</link><description>Jan 21 (Reuters) - A Texas jury acquitted a former police officer of criminal child-endangerment charges on Wednesday stemming from his role in the botched law enforcement response to the 2022 Uvalde school shooting that killed 19 elementary students and two teachers.

Adrian Gonzales, 52, who belonged to the Uvalde school district police force, faced 29 counts of felony child endangerment for what prosecutors said was his failure to stop the gunman in the first minutes of one of the deadliest school shootings in U.S. history.

Gonzales buried his head in his hands after the verdict was read, with his lawyers clapping him on the back. Parents and siblings of the victims appeared stunned by the decision, some wiping away tears, while others stared ahead with blank expressions.

The Corpus Christi jury deliberated for over seven hours before reaching its not guilty verdict on all 29 counts, each of which carried up to two years in prison.

The trial was a rare case of a U.S. police officer being charged with endangering lives by failing to halt a crime.

Defense lawyer Jason Goss told jurors that prosecutors wanted to scapegoat Gonzales for the mistakes of all police officers at the shooting.

"They have decided he has to pay for the pain of that day and it's not right," Goss said in closing arguments.

Gonzales was among the first of more than 400 law enforcement officers to arrive at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde on May 24, 2022. Police waited 77 minutes before entering a classroom where the gunman was holed up.

The gunman, a former student at the school, was ultimately shot dead by other officers.

Gonzales was accused of failing to confront the shooter after he arrived at Robb Elementary in his patrol car in response to a report of an active shooter.

"You can't stand by and allow it to happen," Special Prosecutor Bill Turner told the jury during closing arguments.

Gonzales said he could not see the shooter and denied that he froze during the first chaotic minutes of the incident when the gunman was outside the school.

The nearly three-week trial was held in Corpus Christi, about 175 miles (282 km) southeast of Uvalde, after the defense argued Gonzales could not get a fair trial in the town of around 16,000 in Texas' Hill Country.

State and federal investigations into the shooting found that officers left the 18-year-old gunman alone inside the classroom with children while weighing how to confront him.

By the time a tactical team led by Border Patrol officers stormed in, the death toll had reached among the worst ever in a country known for high-profile school shootings.

While debate has raged between proponents of gun control measures and those who say such controls violate the constitutional right to bear arms, there remain few restrictions on firearms in the U.S. compared with other industrialized nations.

Former U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland, in remarks made while presenting the federal report on Uvalde in 2024, said lives would have been saved had the police immediately confronted the gunman.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 03:51:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/INYX23VA4NKX3CAD35KMDKFJQU.jpg?auth=d5c3dc5eb77f0adf430ca6cf4e5979adecd96541d64e8453db7bc0ccee63d135&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>South Korea prosecutor appeals court ruling on ex-President Yoon's obstruction charges</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/south-korea-prosecutor-appeals-court-ruling-ex-president-yoons-obstruction-2026-01-22/</link><description>SEOUL, Jan 22 (Reuters) - South Korea's special prosecution team said on Thursday it has filed an appeal after a court sentenced former President Yoon Suk Yeol on charges including obstructing attempts to arrest him following his failed bid to impose martial law.

The Washington Post, citing an autopsy report by deputy medical examiner Adam C. Gonzalez, reported that the cause of death was "asphyxia due to neck and torso compression."

Reuters could not immediately verify the reports and the El Paso County Office of the Medical Examiner did not immediately provide comment.

The detainee, Geraldo Lunas Campos , 55, died in the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody on Jan. 3 at Camp East Montana after experiencing "medical distress," ICE said earlier this month.

When reached for comment on Tuesday, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security - under which ICE falls - said Campos attempted to take his own life while in federal custody.

"The security staff immediately intervened to save his life. Campos violently resisted the security staff and continued to attempt to take his life," the spokesperson said, adding that he stopped breathing and lost consciousness during the struggle.

DHS said the incident remains under active investigation.

At least 30 people died in ICE custody last year, the highest level in two decades, agency figures show. In the first 10 days of 2026, four immigrants, including Campos, died while in federal immigration custody.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:33:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Putin to discuss Ukraine peace with U.S. envoys after Trump says a deal is reasonably close</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/putin-discuss-ukraine-peace-with-us-envoys-after-trump-says-deal-is-reasonably-2026-01-22/</link><description>MOSCOW, Jan 22 - Russian President Vladimir Putin will on Thursday discuss a possible peace plan for Ukraine with U.S. envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner in Moscow after President Donald Trump said a deal to end the war was "reasonably close".

The United States has held talks with Russia, and separately with Kyiv and European leaders, on various different drafts of a plan for ending the war in Ukraine , but no deal has yet been reached despite Trump's repeated promises to clinch one.

Putin, speaking at a Russian Security Council meeting late on Wednesday, said that he would meet Trump special envoy Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law Kushner in Moscow to "continue dialogue on the Ukrainian settlement" as well as Trump's "Board of Peace" idea and the possibility of using frozen Russian assets.

At stake is how to end the deadliest war in Europe since World War Two, the future of Ukraine, the extent to which European powers are sidelined and whether or not a peace deal brokered by the United States will endure.

"I think I can say that we're reasonably close," Trump said . "We have to get it stopped ... I believe they're at a point now where they can come together and get a deal done.

"And if they don't, they're stupid," Trump said, referring to Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Last week, Trump told Reuters that Zelenskiy was the main impediment to reaching an agreement.

Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022 after eight years of fighting in eastern Ukraine, triggering the biggest confrontation between Moscow and the West since the depths of the Cold War.

Ukraine and European leaders say that Russia cannot be allowed to achieve its aims after what they cast as an imperial-style land grab. If Russia wins, European powers say, then it will one day attack NATO. Moscow says such claims are ridiculous and that it has no intention of attacking a NATO member.

Russia says that European leaders are intent on scuttling the peace talks by introducing conditions that they know will be unacceptable to Russia, which took 12 to 17 square km (4.6-6.6 square miles) of Ukrainian territory per day in 2025.

Putin, who has repeatedly said he is open to discussing peace, casts the war as a watershed moment in relations with the West, which he says humiliated Russia after the Soviet Union fell in 1991 by enlarging NATO and encroaching on what he considers Moscow's sphere of influence.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 06:39:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/AMF2KD55YZMUXFQ6PTQI46NQ6A.jpg?auth=675f7d0d75922598741a8233bba61a36966e8b2d69ff47f8ee0ed45ac5437a78&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Live: Trump pushes to expand 'Board of Peace', challenging UN Security Council</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260122-trump-pushes-to-expand-board-of-peace-challenging-un-security-council</link><description>US President Donald Trump is expected to spotlight his proposed “Board of Peace” at the World Economic Forum, with the White House saying a “charter announcement" will be presented on the sidelines of the conference.

Some 35 countries – including Egypt, UAE and Israel – of the 60 nations that have been invited to join have agreed to sign on to the project. But some, like Norway, Sweden and France, have declined.

The main concern is that the board’s mandate may be too broad and could undermine international order based on the UN Charter.

When asked by a reporter earlier this week if the board should replace the UN, Trump replied that “it might.” He asserted that the world body “hasn’t been very helpful” and “has never lived up to its potential” but also said the UN should continue ”because the potential is so great”.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday he would meet on Thursday with US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner.

Putin said during a meeting of Russia’s Security Council that he would discuss the possible use of frozen Russian assets with the US envoys in connection with recovery work in regions affected by the war, and that he would discuss use of the assets with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, who is scheduled to meet the Russian leader on Thursday.

Putin said as well that Russia’s foreign ministry had been instructed to study US President Donald Trump’s invitation to join his proposed Board of Peace and would reply in due course.

Even before any decision on joining the board, Putin said Moscow was ready to provide $1 billion – as required by Trump for long-term membership – from the frozen assets “in view of Russia’s special relations with the Palestinian people”.

Eight Muslim countries – including Qatar, Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates – accepted the invitation on Wednesday to join the Board of Peace, but reaffirmed their commitment in a joint statement to support its original mission aimed at advancing peace and reconstruction in Gaza and the Palestinians’ right to statehood.

France, a veto-wielding member of the Security Council, has said it will not accept Trump’s invitation, while the three other members with vetoes – Russia, China and Britain – are still assessing it.

As of Wednesday, Norway, Sweden and Slovenia had also declined. Slovenia’s main concern was that the board’s mandate is too broad and it could seriously undermine the international order based on the UN Charter.

The UN Security Council in November authorised the Board of Peace to serve as a transitional body to oversee a US-brokered ceasefire in the Israel–Hamas war in Gaza, as US President Donald Trump proposed. But in forming the board, he has described its role as a mediator for other global conflicts, a potential rival to the UN Security Council.

Retired US ambassador Robert Wood, who served at the US mission to the United Nations under Republican and Democratic leaders, said if Trump is trying to replace the Security Council with a Board of Peace dealing with issues beyond Gaza, “I don’t think there’s going to be a lot of interest”.

Welcome to today's liveblog, where we will be following US President Donald Trump's remarks at the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland.

Denmark's foreign minister said that US President Donald Trump has sent "positive messages" by saying that he would not use military force to seize Greenland.

US President Donald Trump met with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, who said sovereignty over Greenland "did not come up".

President Donald Trump gave notice that the U.S. would quit the organization on the first day of his presidency in 2025, via an executive order. Under U.S. law, it has to give one-year notice and pay all outstanding fees before departure.

On Thursday, a U.S. State Department spokesperson said the WHO's failure to contain, manage and share information had cost the U.S. trillions of dollars and the president had exercised his authority to pause the future transfer of any U.S. government funds, support, or resources to the WHO.

"The American people have paid more than enough to this organization and this economic hit is beyond a down payment on any financial obligations to the organization," the spokesperson said by email.

Over the last year, many global health experts have urged a rethink, including most recently WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.

“I hope the U.S. will reconsider and rejoin WHO,” he told reporters at a press conference earlier this month. “Withdrawing from the WHO is a lose for the United States, and it’s a lose for the rest of the world.”

The WHO also said that the U.S. has not yet paid the fees it owes for 2024 and 2025. Member states are set to discuss the U.S. departure and how it will be handled at the WHO’s executive board in February, a WHO spokesperson told Reuters by email.

“This is a clear violation of U.S. law,” said Lawrence Gostin, founding director of the O’Neill Institute for Global Health Law at Georgetown University in Washington, a close observer of the WHO. “But Trump is highly likely to get away with it.”

Speaking to Reuters at Davos, Bill Gates – chair of the Gates Foundation, a major funder of global health initiatives and some of the WHO’s work – said he did not expect the U.S. to reconsider in the short-term.

“I don’t think the U.S. will be coming back to WHO in the near future,” he said, adding that when he had an opportunity to advocate for it, he would. “The world needs the World Health Organization.”

WHAT THE DEPARTURE MEANS

For the WHO, the departure of the U.S. has sparked a budgetary crisis that has seen it cut its management team in half and scale back work, cutting budgets across the agency. Washington has traditionally been by far the U.N. health agency's biggest financial backer, contributing around 18% of its overall funding. The WHO will also shed around a quarter of its staff by the middle of this year.

The agency said it has been working with the U.S. and sharing information in the last year. It was unclear how the collaboration will work going forward.

Global health experts said this posed risks for the U.S., the WHO and the world.

“The U.S. withdrawal from WHO could weaken the systems and collaborations the world relies on to detect, prevent, and respond to health threats,” said Kelly Henning, public health program lead at Bloomberg Philanthropies, a U.S.-based non-profit.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 07:29:21 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4L6XPSF7I5IUNHEVTY2VBKVNFU.jpg?auth=e5c0772b16cc5f63a02462c633deab70c5f04945d6c71959e1caa97527da6626&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Denmark to discuss Arctic security, seeks respect for territorial integrity</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/denmark-discuss-arctic-security-seeks-respect-territorial-integrity-2026-01-22/</link><description>COPENHAGEN, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said on Thursday that Denmark and Greenland will continue to engage in a constructive dialogue on security in the Arctic, provided that this is done with respect for her country's territorial integrity.

U.S. President Donald Trump abruptly stepped back on Wednesday from threats to impose tariffs as leverage to seize Greenland, ruled out the use of force and suggested a deal was in sight to end a dispute over the Danish territory.

After meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, Trump said Western Arctic allies could forge agreement that satisfies his desire for a "Golden Dome" missile‑defence system and access to minerals while blocking Russia and China's ambitions.

Frederiksen said NATO was fully aware of Denmark's position, and that she had been informed that Rutte's talks did not involve her country's sovereignty.

""Security in the Arctic is a matter for the entire NATO alliance. Therefore, it is good and natural that it is also discussed between NATO's secretary general and the president of the United States," Frederiksen said in a statement.

"The Kingdom of Denmark wishes to continue to engage in a constructive dialogue with allies on how we can strengthen security in the Arctic, including the United States' Golden Dome, provided that this is done with respect for our territorial integrity," she said.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 07:29:43 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/NDQNIWK76ZJ67PO5IDF5OMMJ3Y.jpg?auth=cdf308384220b3055f168e4c1ee24a19f21dc7b29d2d6291d5d621884b24ac5f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia likely to keep trying to damage Baltic Sea infrastructure, Finland says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/russia-likely-keep-trying-damage-baltic-sea-infrastructure-finland-says-2026-01-22/</link><description>HELSINKI, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Russia will "likely persist in its ambitions to damage the undersea infrastructure of the Baltic Sea", Finland's Defence Command said in its annual military intelligence review published on Thursday.

The Baltic Sea region has been on high alert after a string of power cable, telecom link and gas pipeline outages since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. The most recent related incident occurred on New Year's Eve when Finnish authorities seized a cargo vessel en route from Russia to Israel on suspicion of sabotaging an undersea telecoms cable.

NATO has boosted its military presence in the region over the last year with frigates, aircraft and naval drones.

In an interview, Finland's Chief of Intelligence Major General Pekka Turunen said it was clear that Russia had the ability to destroy underwater infrastructure if it wanted, but added that no "smoking gun" had been found to prove Russia or another state actor was behind the recent incidents.

"It is unusual that this (so many incidents) occurs," Turunen said, adding their number had increased significantly since 2023, in comparison with past times.

"The change is real," he said.

Russia has repeatedly denied any involvement in the incidents, and last year conducted its own drills to defend against "underwater saboteurs" in the Baltic Sea.

The number of suspicious security-related incidents have also increased around military personnel and exercises on land in Finland, the Finnish Defence Command said in the review.

"The phenomenon is most likely related to increased vigilance and a lower threshold of reporting, but there is also genuine intelligence-gathering relating to military national defence in these numbers," it said.

Turunen said the incidents had involved drones and some people around military facilities or exercises, but he declined to give further details.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 07:30:31 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ADCOVQDFD5ML3EOBJWHEARRYS4.jpg?auth=fe25263e7e83a937acd158860566de01b1dd38f350b4daaf66d5f02b83684d6a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Poland summons Belarusian diplomat over balloon incursion, report says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/poland-summons-belarusian-diplomat-over-balloon-incursion-report-says-2026-01-22/</link><description>WARSAW, Jan 22 (Reuters) - The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs summoned the Belarusian charge d'affaires regarding last week's airspace breech by objects identified as smuggling balloons, national news agency PAP said on Wednesday evening, citing a ministry spokesman.

Polish police said on Saturday it was informed by the army that unidentified flying objects, most likely smuggling balloons, had entered Polish airspace from the territory of Belarus overnight and that police had retrieved the remains of balloons along with illegal cigarettes in north-eastern Poland.

"The Charge d'Affaires could not answer us regarding the Belarusian side's role in this (procedure), but we question the fact that the Belarusian side has no knowledge of or influence over such a number of these actions," the ministry spokesman was quoted by PAP as saying.

"He was also reminded that continuing such behaviour will have consequences, but we do not discuss the details of this matter publicly."

In Lithuania , smuggling balloons drifting over the Belarusian border have forced repeated shutdowns at the airport in the capital Vilnius, in what authorities call a "hybrid attack" by Belarus, a Kremlin ally. In December Lithuania declared a state of emergency due to the incursions.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 07:30:52 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>French dairy giant Lactalis recalls baby formula in 18 countries due to toxin</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260122-french-dairy-giant-lactalis-recalls-baby-formula-in-18-countries-due-to-toxin</link><description>French group Lactalis on Wednesday announced a worldwide recall of batches of infant formula over worries they contained a toxin. The countries concerned are: Australia, Chile, China, Colombia, Congo, Czech Republic, Ecuador, ​France, Georgia, Greece, Kuwait, Madagascar, Mexico, Monaco, Spain, Peru, Taiwan and Uzbekistan.

“Lactalis Nutrition Santé (LNS) is voluntarily recalling ​six batches of Picot brand infant milk, available ​in pharmacies and supermarkets, due to the presence of cereulide in an ingredient sourced from a supplier,” it said in a statement.

Cereulide, a substance of bacterial origin, may cause diarrhoea and vomiting, the statement said.  Lactalis did not name the supplier behind the tainted ingredient. It published a list of six lot numbers, but stressed that all other batches were safe.

“We are fully aware that this information may cause concern among parents of young children,” it said. But French authorities had not signalled to them “any claim nor any report related to the consumption of these products”.

The infant formula industry has been rocked by recalls in recent weeks.

Singapore authorities on Saturday recalled Dumex baby formula, a brand owned by French food giant Danone.

Danone said the authorities blocked just “a few pallets” of Dumex, indicating they were not yet on any store shelves.

The move comes after Nestlé also called back batches of infant milk in several European countries on January 6.

Nestlé France said it was carrying out a “preventive and voluntary recall” of certain batches of its Guigoz and Nidal infant formulas after new investigations showed the potential presence of cereulide.

French health authorities said Tuesday an investigation was underway after the death of a baby who had consumed milk from one of the batches recalled by Nestlé, though no link has been established between its consumption and the death at this stage.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 07:53:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/c25a3698-f761-11f0-97c4-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/000-93GH2T3.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Wounded Ukrainian veterans find healing on stage</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/wounded-ukrainian-veterans-find-healing-stage-2026-01-22/</link><description>By Alina Smukto

Ukrainian soldier Andrii Onopriienko ran into a challenge when he took up his new hobby of acting: having to learn his lines just by listening to them.

The 31-year-old lost both eyes when two Russian anti-tank rounds ripped into his position in the eastern Ukrainian city of Avdiivka in 2023.

He memorised his part nonetheless. Like the other veterans in his Kyiv-based group of around 15 actors, Onopriienko has found healing and fulfilment on stage, after a friend told him of a theatre looking for injured veterans and suggested he join. He reluctantly agreed to take part.

“Yes, we might not have an arm, or legs, or eyes - but we aren’t giving up,” he said.

Russia’s war , now entering its fifth year, has left countless Ukrainian soldiers wounded, with tens of thousands suffering one or more amputations.

Some of those with life-altering injuries struggle to reintegrate into a society itself navigating how to absorb a generation of maimed men and women.

Coping methods vary. For Onopriienko and his fellow troops-turned-thespians, none of whom had ever acted before, it meant taking to the stage.

Reuters followed the group, called Veterans’ Theatre, as they prepared for an avant-garde performance of an 18th-century Ukrainian parody of Virgil’s Aeneid.

“It’s rehabilitation and socialisation,” said Onopriienko. “It’s...positive emotions.”

Seeking meaning in something new

Russia’s war has left deep scars across wide swathes of Ukraine and its population, with no end in sight despite a U.S.-backed peace push.

Yehor Babenko, 27, was wounded in the first year of fighting when Russian forces struck his base in the southern region of Mykolaiv.

His face deformed by severe burns, he speaks by regulating a tube in his throat with one of two mangled hands that are missing all of their fingers.

That did not stop him from committing to months of taxing rehearsals full of dancing, twirling and tumbling.

Babenko, who began working as a veterans’ psychologist last year, said the transformative trauma of serious injury often compels people to seek meaning in something new.

“I know a lot of cases where people opened up or tried things they never dared to try,” he said.

For 57-year-old Roman Trokhymenko, who lost his right leg in 2024, participating in the theatre has helped reinforce the confidence he has tried hard to maintain since his injury.

The director, Olha Semyoshkina, told Reuters she had individually tailored the roles, which were heavily based around physical movement, to suit each veteran’s injury.

“Like you’re standing there naked”

Performing on stage poses not only physical challenges, the actors said.

Babenko, for instance, said it was difficult adjusting to a creative field which encourages free thought after spending years in the rigid order of the military.

Taras Kozub, 53, lost his left arm after storming an enemy position on the southeastern front. Today, the folk music aficionado plays a hurdy-gurdy with a specially designed prosthetic appendage that attaches directly to the instrument.

Even Kozub concedes the adjustment to theatre was challenging, and not a remedy for every veteran.

“The first thing I realised is that you can’t fool anyone while onstage,” he said. “It’s like you’re standing there naked.”

During the premiere in Kyiv, the veterans stomped and shuffled across the stage under bright neon lights, and to live musical accompaniment by Kozub and others.

They received a boisterous ovation from members of the audience, some of whom cried or embraced.

Babenko says it was critical for his fellow comrades to understand that life does not simply end after a serious injury.

“Sometimes, you understand it’s the opposite - that it just starts getting going.”

The United States has held talks with Russia, and separately with Kyiv and European leaders, on various different drafts of a plan for ending the war in Ukraine, but no deal has yet been reached despite Trump's repeated promises to clinch one.

"If both sides want to solve this, we're going to get it solved," Witkoff told an audience at the World Economic Forum in Davos.

"I think we've made a lot of progress", he added.

U.S. President Donald Trump a day earlier told the Davos forum that the leaders of Russia and Ukraine would be "stupid" if they failed to come together and get a deal done.

Witkoff said he was headed to Moscow later in the day. He spoke in an impromptu appearance a breakfast meeting on the future of Ukraine, with panelists including NATO Secretary Mark Rutte and Finnish President Alexander Stubb.

Rutte expressed confidence that Trump was committed to Ukrainian independence and sovereignty. "I have never doubted this," Rutte said.

"What we need is to keep our eyes on the ball of Ukraine. Let's not drop that ball", he added.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 08:34:03 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/YGJM673HHRMUREN5ECHVKXY5PI.jpg?auth=271a3021cfd0b1d6dcfa1a3e3f22683925c351edb898e38a7c29d92843ecf39c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>NATO's Rutte says Arctic talks with Trump will focus on keeping Russia, China out</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/davos/natos-rutte-says-arctic-talks-with-trump-will-focus-keeping-russia-china-out-2026-01-22/</link><description>DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 22 (Reuters) - NATO Secretary Mark Rutte said on Thursday that he and U.S. President Trump had discussed in Davos how the transatlantic alliance should best defend the Arctic against Russia and China.

Trump has repeatedly said he wanted to acquire Greenland, citing national security, though on Wednesday he ruled out using force and suggested a deal was in sight to end the dispute over the Danish overseas territory following talks with Rutte.

Trump's ambitions have put strain on the NATO alliance.

Rutte said he had a "very good discussion" with Trump on how NATO allies can work collectively to ensure Arctic security, including not just Greenland but the seven NATO nations with land in the Arctic.

Further talks would build on the Washington meeting last week between the United States and delegations from Denmark and Greenland.

"One workstream coming out of yesterday ... is to make sure when it comes to Greenland, particularly, that we ensure that the Chinese and the Russians will not gain access to the Greenland economy (or) militarily to Greenland," Rutte told a panel at the World Economic Forum.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 08:34:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4YEWEONZ2NKTPKYI64T2JOO2IQ.jpg?auth=70f4439ea2825d6dc86541aaf98d068588be7d88fb0e00a96d4e489e601d2541&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Uganda police detain opposition lawmaker after at least seven killed</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/uganda-police-detain-opposition-lawmaker-after-least-seven-killed-2026-01-22/</link><description>KAMPALA, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Uganda police said on Thursday they had detained a legislator and senior official of the country's biggest opposition party for his alleged role in election-related violence in which at least seven people were killed.

The lawmaker, Muwanga Kivumbi, is vice president of the opposition National Unity Platform party headed by pop star-turned-politician, Bobi Wine, who has been in hiding since last week.

Wine, whose legal name is Robert Kyagulanyi, said he fled a military raid on his house hours before veteran President Yoweri Museveni was declared the landslide winner of the January 15 presidential election.

Police confirmed Kivumbi's arrest in a post on the X platform and said he would "be arraigned before court in due course."

"His arrest is in connection with recent incidents of political violence," police said.

Police and Kivumbi have shared differing accounts of the clashes between security forces and the MP's supporters that erupted overnight after the vote on January 15.

Police said machete-wielding opposition "goons" organised by Kivumbi attacked a police station and vote-tallying centre.

Kivumbi told Reuters that people were killed inside his house, where they were waiting for election results for his parliamentary seat to be announced. He said 10 people had been killed and described it as a "massacre".

NUP Secretary General David Rubongoya told Reuters on Thursday that he was still gathering information on Kivumbi's arrest and would comment later.

Hundreds of NUP supporters and officials have been detained before and after the election in what the opposition says has been a campaign to intimidate them. Some have been tortured , they said.

In an interview with Reuters on Wednesday, Wine said "nobody is safe in Uganda".

"We don't believe in violence, but we believe that when we fight back morally and expose this impunity, maybe it will stop," he said, urging the African Union to speak up against what he alleged as widespread fraud in the election, including claims of ballot stuffing and kidnapping of his agents and supporters.

Museveni's win means that Africa's third longest-ruling head of state will have served for 45 years when the next term ends in 2031.

He is widely believed to be preparing his son Muhoozi Kainerugaba who is head of the military to take over power when he retires.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 08:34:08 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukraine's Zelenskiy arrives for Davos talks with Trump</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/ukraines-zelenskiy-arrives-davos-talks-with-trump-2026-01-22/</link><description>KYIV, Jan 22 (Reuters) - U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff on Thursday said "a lot of progress" had been made in Ukraine peace talks and that negotiations were down to one last issue, as Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskiy arrived in Switzerland for talks with U.S. President Donald Trump.

Zelenskiy had said earlier this week that he would not attend the annual World Economic Forum in Davos and would remain in Kyiv to focus on the energy crisis in Ukraine, where Russian airstrikes against electricity infrastructure have left swathes of the capital and other regions without power.

Zelenskiy had said he would only travel to Davos if there was the opportunity to sign an agreement with Trump on resolving the nearly four-year war that included security guarantees and post-war reconstruction funding for Ukraine.

On Wednesday, however, Trump announced he would be meeting the Ukrainian leader in Davos. Zelenskiy's spokesperson said in a statement that the Ukrainian leader would meet with Trump at 1 p.m. local time (1200 GMT) before delivering a speech at 2.30 p.m. (1330 GMT).

Witkoff has held talks in recent days with Ukrainian officials in Davos, following weekend discussions in Florida.

He was due in Moscow with fellow U.S. envoy Jared Kushner later on Thursday for talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin on the possible plan to end the conflict, Europe's deadliest since World War Two.

The Kremlin said Putin's meeting with Witkoff and Kushner will take place after 7 to 8 p.m. Moscow time (1600 to 1700 GMT).</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 09:33:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/C34RV7JEJFJULPLULEQIYWBCRE.jpg?auth=a9146d7afd65439b47ba8a5e85cbda6d9e51498a23a1c2e849fe378dcb4542d9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Putin says who owns Greenland is of no concern to Russia, says it might be worth $1 billion</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/putin-says-who-owns-greenland-is-no-concern-russia-says-it-might-be-worth-1-2026-01-22/</link><description>MOSCOW, Jan 21 (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday that Greenland's ownership was not Russia's concern and that the United States and Denmark - whose historical treatment of the island he criticised - should sort the matter out between themselves.

Moscow has watched with glee as U.S. President Donald Trump's drive to acquire Greenland has widened Washington's split with Europe, even though his moves could have ramifications for Russia, which already has a strong Arctic presence.

Speaking in Davos, Trump on Wednesday stepped back from threats to impose tariffs as leverage to seize Greenland and ruled out the use of force. He suggested progress towards a deal to end a dispute over the semi-autonomous Danish territory that risked the deepest rupture in transatlantic relations in decades.

Putin, addressing the matter for the first time in public, signalled that Russia would not object to Trump's push to control Greenland, which he speculated may be worth nearly $1 billion.

"What happens in Greenland is of no concern to us whatsoever," Putin told a meeting of Russia's Security Council.

"Incidentally, Denmark has always treated Greenland as a colony and has been quite harsh, if not cruel, towards it. But that is a different matter altogether, and hardly anyone is interested in it now," Putin added.

Denmark's financial and military support for Ukraine has angered Russia, which is fighting to take full control of four Ukrainian regions it claimed as its own in 2022.

Russia's foreign ministry has bridled at Trump's suggestion that Moscow has ambitions on Greenland too, but has been careful not to criticise Trump - who is trying to broker a deal to end the war in Ukraine - and has hinted it has some sympathy for his claim.

Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Tuesday that the giant resource-rich island, which already has a U.S. military presence, was not "a natural part" of Denmark.

Putin recalled that Russia in 1867 sold Alaska to the United States for $7.2 million, and that Denmark in 1917 sold the Virgin Islands to Washington, setting precedents for such land transactions.

Using the Alaska price - adjusted for inflation and accounting for the larger size of Greenland and changes in gold prices, Putin said buying Greenland from Denmark could cost around $1 billion, which he said he thought Washington could afford.

"I think they will sort it out between themselves," said Putin.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 09:34:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ZHJLDHSUFBJJHG4DQGOOYGXDSQ.jpg?auth=706315db8aa757ba13274c963eedf829b2c28b69d8e81aa9a8bb63cd71f1f5e1&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Son-in-law of Venezuela opposition leader Edmundo Gonzalez freed from prison</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/son-in-law-venezuela-opposition-leader-edmundo-gonzalez-freed-prison-2026-01-22/</link><description>Jan 22 (Reuters) - Rafael Tudares, the son-in-law of Venezuela's opposition leader Edmundo Gonzalez, was freed from prison early on Thursday after a year behind bars, Tudare's wife said on X, the latest such release since the U.S. capture of President Nicolas Maduro.

Tudares, a 46-year-old lawyer, was arrested in January 2025 while taking his young children to school in Caracas and accused, like other political detainees, of terrorism, charges their relatives say were unsubstantiated.

"After 380 days of an unjust arbitrary detention and having endured, for more than a year, an inhumane situation of enforced disappearance, my husband Rafael Tudares Bracho has returned home," Mariana Gonzalez de Tudares said on X.

The releases of prisoners, announced earlier this month by Venezuelan authorities, have moved slowly.

So far, rights group Foro Penal said that 151 political prisoners have been released, while families continue to wait anxiously.

Many relatives of detainees - both well-known and lesser-known - have gathered and held vigils outside prisons or have visited multiple detention centers in an effort to find out where their loved ones are being held.

The releases follow Maduro's capture on Jan. 3 in Caracas, his arraignment in a New York court on narcoterrorism charges, his deputy Delcy Rodriguez's interim swearing-in, and the announcement that the U.S. would refine and sell up to 50 million barrels of crude oil stuck in Venezuela under U.S. sanctions.

Among the prominent figures who remain imprisoned are opposition politician Juan Pablo Guanipa and lawyer Perkins Rocha, both close allies of opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Maria Corina Machado; Freddy Superlano, leader of the opposition party Voluntad Popular; and Javier Tarazona, the director of an NGO.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 09:35:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Three people shot dead in eastern Australia, town in lockdown</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/three-people-shot-dead-eastern-australia-town-lockdown-2026-01-22/</link><description>SYDNEY, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Three people have been shot dead in an attack in the Australian state of New South Wales, police said on Thursday, with local media reporting the gunman remained at large and the shooting was a suspected incident of domestic violence.

Police said an operation was underway in the town of Lake Cargelligo, about 611 kilometres (379 miles) west of Sydney, and urged residents to stay indoors.

Emergency services were called to the scene following reports of a shooting in the late afternoon.

Two women and one man were killed, and another man has been taken to hospital in a serious but stable condition, police said.

"A police operation is currently underway at Lake Cargelligo," police said in a statement on social media.

"The public is urged to avoid the area and for local residents to stay inside."

The Sydney Morning Herald newspaper reported the incident was a suspected domestic violence attack and that a gunman was believed to be holed up in the town with a long-arm weapon.

Lake Cargelligo is located in New South Wales' Central West region, and has a population of about 1,100, according to the 2021 census.

The shooting comes one month after two gunmen opened fire at an event on Bondi Beach celebrating the Jewish festival of Hanukkah, killing 15 people in Australia's worst mass shooting in decades.

Australia on Tuesday passed new laws to enable a national gun buyback and tighten background checks for firearm licences in response to the shooting.

New South Wales, which has the most guns of any state in the country, has also passed laws to limit individuals to possession of four guns and mandate gun club membership for licence holders.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 09:35:58 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China seeks deeper maritime ties with Malta in Central Mediterranean</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-seeks-deeper-maritime-ties-with-malta-central-mediterranean-2026-01-22/</link><description>BEIJING, Jan 22 (Reuters) - China is keen to deepen cooperation with Malta in shipping and port logistics, the Chinese Commerce Ministry said on Thursday, eager to leverage the island's strategic location in the Central Mediterranean.

In an economic and trade cooperation meeting in Beijing, the ministry also told representatives from Malta that it was willing to strengthen "strategic alignment" with the country, one of the European Union's 27 member states.

China and Malta have developed a close relationship since bilateral ties were established in 1972, with Valletta keen to help a major investor country promote relations with the EU, including access to the region's vast single market.

Under Chinese President Xi Jinping's Belt and Road initiative to build up global trade routes to China, state-owned and privately held Chinese companies have invested in Malta's infrastructure, including a stake in Malta Freeport Terminals, a major trans-shipment port in the Mediterranean, held by China Merchants Port Holdings.

Malta was one of the five EU nations that voted against imposing tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles in 2024.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 09:36:08 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Kremlin declines comment on Witkoff's optimism on Ukraine deal ahead of meeting with Putin</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/kremlin-declines-comment-witkoffs-optimism-ukraine-deal-ahead-meeting-with-putin-2026-01-22/</link><description>MOSCOW, Jan 22 (Reuters) - The Kremlin said on Thursday that it appreciated U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff's diplomatic efforts to end the war in Ukraine, but declined to comment on Witkoff's stated optimism that a deal was close.

Witkoff and Jared Kushner, U.S. President Donald Trump's son-in-law, are due to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow for talks on Ukraine later on Thursday. The Kremlin said it would give a briefing afterwards.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the two U.S. representatives would arrive in Moscow some time after 1600-1700 GMT and meet Putin.

"Discussion will continue on the Ukrainian settlement issue and other related topics," Peskov told reporters.

Witkoff said earlier that much progress had been made and that negotiations were now down to one final issue.

Asked if the Kremlin shared this optimism, Peskov said: "We would not like to comment on the current stage of the negotiations, especially in the lead-up to Witkoff's arrival in Moscow and his meeting with Putin."

He added: "It's clear that the Russian president highly values ​​the peacemaking efforts of President Trump personally and his team, including Special Envoy Witkoff...

Rutte said in an interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland that it was now up to NATO commanders to work through the details of extra security requirements and that he was sure non-Arctic NATO allies would want to contribute to the effort.

"We will come together in NATO with our senior commanders to work out what is necessary," Rutte said, adding: "I have no doubt we can do this quite fast. Certainly I would hope for 2026, I hope even early in 2026."

Rutte said minerals exploitation was not discussed during his meeting with Trump in Davos on Wednesday, adding that specific negotiations on the Arctic island would continue between the United States, Denmark and Greenland itself.

Rutte also said the intensified Arctic effort would not drain resources in support of Ukraine.

Asked if NATO allies can take Trump at his word, Rutte responded: "You can always take Donald Trump at his word".

Trump on Wednesday said the U.S. would not use force to pursue his ambition to acquire Greenland and later dropped the threat of additional tariffs against some of Washington's European allies and fellow NATO members over the issue.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 10:28:49 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4EAHKBMVSBNVPKSQNKK27Q3XKE.jpg?auth=9ff9d89d95a68cf06c51f648586bc95f4b0dfb834f29bd594beb557d3a4cb189&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump to launch Board of Peace that some fear rivals UN</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/trump-launch-board-peace-that-some-fear-rivals-un-2026-01-22/</link><description>DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 22 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump will on Thursday launch his Board of Peace , originally intended to help end the Gaza war but which he now sees having a wider role that Europe and some others fear will rival or undermine the United Nations.

Trump, who will chair the board, has invited dozens of other world leaders to join it and sees the grouping addressing other global challenges beyond the stuttering Gaza truce, though he does not intend it to replace the United Nations, he has said.

Some traditional U.S. allies have balked at joining the board, which Trump says permanent members must help fund with a payment of $1 billion each, either responding cautiously or declining the invitation.

Apart from the U.S., no other permanent member of the U.N. Security Council - the five nations with the most say over international law and diplomacy since the end of World War Two - has yet committed to join.

Russia said late on Wednesday it was studying the proposal after Trump said it would join. France has declined. Britain said on Thursday it was not joining at present. China has not yet said whether it will join.

The board's creation was endorsed by a United Nations Security Council resolution as part of Trump's Gaza peace plan, and U.N. spokesperson Rolando Gomez said on Thursday that U.N. engagement with the board would only be in that context.

However, around 35 countries have committed to join including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Turkey and Belarus.

Few of the countries that have signed up for the board are democracies though Israel and Hungary, whose leaders are both seen as close allies of Trump and supporters of his approach to politics and diplomacy, have said they will join.

The signing ceremony will be held in Davos, Switzerland, where the annual World Economic Forum bringing together global political and business leaders is taking place.

The board's charter will task it with promoting peace around the world, a copy seen by Reuters showed, and Trump has already named other senior U.S. officials to join it, as well as former British Prime Minister Tony Blair.

The ceasefire in Gaza , agreed in October, has sputtered for months with Israel and Hamas trading blame for repeated bursts of violence in which several Israeli soldiers and hundreds of Palestinians have been killed.

Both sides accuse each other of further violations, with Israel saying Hamas has procrastinated on returning a final body of a dead hostage and Hamas saying Israel has continued to curb aid into Gaza despite an ongoing humanitarian catastrophe.

Each side rejects the other's accusations.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has accepted an invitation by Trump to join the board, the Israeli leader's office says. Palestinian factions have endorsed Trump's plan and given backing to a transitional Palestinian committee meant to administer the Gaza Strip with oversight by the board.

Trump has been characteristically bold in his comments on Gaza, saying the ceasefire amounts to "peace in the Middle East".

Even as the first phase of the truce stumbles, its next stage must address much tougher long-term issues that have bedevilled earlier negotiations, including Hamas disarmament, security control in Gaza and eventual Israeli withdrawal.

On Wednesday in Davos, Trump met Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, whose country played a major role in Gaza truce mediation talks, and they discussed the board.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 10:29:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5Y6Q5UFAZZJ3ZITGHCMCPP4M5I.jpg?auth=f871f6039468c181f9f69aa9d12bbd800410e19c4a6ac1545b104ad5759f93f5&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>New trade map takes shape in Davos as world adjusts to Trump tariffs</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/new-trade-map-takes-shape-davos-world-adjusts-trump-tariffs-2026-01-22/</link><description>DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 22 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's use of tariffs as a foreign policy tool added fresh impetus in Davos this week to efforts to boost global trade beyond the U.S., with frustration palpable among many of Washington's top trading partners.

Tariffs roared back into focus when Trump last weekend threatened new tariffs on European allies opposing his designs on Greenland, before stepping back from them on Wednesday after announcing a deal framework with NATO over the Arctic island.

"It's the speed, scale, and scope of change that is really rattling the world," Canadian Finance Minister François-Philippe Champagne said during a panel discussion on tariffs at the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in the Swiss mountain resort.

The WEF is meeting in Davos for the first time since Trump last year hiked U.S. tariffs to their highest level in nearly a century, sending countries scrambling to pick up the slack by trading more with each other.

Trump, who says his policies are bringing back jobs to the United States, spurring trillions of dollars in investment and firing up growth, is ever present in WEF debates over how to temper exposure to the U.S., which studies forecast will play a lesser role in overall global trade than it did in the past.

Canada's Champagne said countries were diversifying their commercial relations and doing more at a regional level to make their economies more resilient to trade policy shocks.

"When you talk to CEOs today, what do they want? Stability, predictability, and the rule of law. I would say it's in short supply," he said, days after Canada and China struck a deal to slash tariffs on electric vehicles and canola.

Hot on its heels came the signing of a free trade agreement this month between the European Union and South American bloc Mercosur after 25 years of negotiations - the EU's largest ever trade pact, if it overcomes remaining legal obstacles .

Diversification of supply chains and reducing over-dependence are backed by the World Trade Organization, whose director-general Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said such moves helped spread job creation and growth to other countries.

"This helps build global resilience and we are very supportive of it," she told Reuters in Davos.

Boston Consulting Group forecasts the U.S. share of global goods trade could decline from 12% to 9% in the decade through 2034, giving way to more domestic U.S. economic activity.

"Trump is sawing on the branch he's sitting on," Dirk Jandura, head of Germany's BGA exporters' association, said this week after data showed German exports to the U.S. falling by 9% during the first 11 months of 2025.

Volker Treier, foreign trade chief of the German Chambers of Industry and Commerce, said surveys showed tariffs on raw materials like steel and aluminium were making it dearer for companies to build up U.S. industrial capacity.

U.S. manufacturing activity contracted for a tenth month running in December, according to a closely watched survey , opens new tab .

"The world has become more expensive, and structurally it will get even more expensive," Treier said.

BCG posits a patchwork of four main nodes dominating world trade: the U.S., China, BRICS+ minus China, and so-called plurilateralists comprising most of Europe, Canada, Mexico, Japan, Australia and several Asia-Pacific economies.

In the BCG study, trade among plurilateralists and China's commerce with allies in the Global South would be key drivers of global trade, with U.S. trade advancing more slowly.

Noel Hacegaba, CEO of the Port of Long Beach, said trade flows have been evolving significantly since Trump's first term.

In 2019, 70% of the port's cargo was trade with China; by last year, that figure had fallen to 60%, with more coming instead from farther afield in Southeast Asia, including Vietnam, Thailand and Malaysia, Hacegaba told Reuters.

Boudewijn Siemons, CEO of the Port of Rotterdam, Europe's biggest, said trade flows were adjusting rapidly to the new reality, and that the continent needed to be nimble.

"We've been relying on cheap production in China, cheap energy from Russia, and cheap defence from the United States," he said, adding: "And all three of these securities are falling away, so we have to reconfigure ourselves very fast."</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 10:29:52 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/C5KTZJJFMBNC7FLTIKNL2PSOGQ.jpg?auth=c7bb614cdf5f36bf8403f42defe9cebdefbcb7e771bdbab3eebe43b0aa89c1dc&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Philippines will insist South China Sea code is based on international law, foreign minister says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/philippines-will-insist-south-china-sea-code-is-based-international-law-foreign-2026-01-22/</link><description>MANILA, Jan 22 (Reuters) - The Philippines, as ASEAN chair, will insist that a long-delayed Code of Conduct with China on the South China Sea explicitly references the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) as it works to complete the document by this year, its foreign minister said on Thursday.

"The UNCLOS issue is something that we insist on, not only the Philippines, but other ASEAN member states," Ma. Theresa Lazaro told Reuters in an interview.

The idea of a formal code of conduct to ease tensions in the South China Sea was first raised more than two decades ago, but only in 2017 did the parties commit to start the drafting process. However, little substantive progress has been made since then.

The issue remains highly sensitive. China's Southeast Asian neighbours want the code to be grounded in international law, which Beijing has repeatedly been accused of disregarding as it asserts its sovereignty over nearly all of the South China Sea.

Lazaro reiterated Manila's position that the code must be legally binding, although she acknowledged this issue will require "further and deeper discussion" among ASEAN member states and China.

With the Philippines determined to use its position as ASEAN chair to complete the code of conduct this year, it plans to propose a set of strategies to fellow ASEAN members, Lazaro said, including increasing the frequency of negotiations.

Manila and Beijing have been locked in a series of maritime confrontations in recent years, with the Philippines accusing China of repeated aggressive actions inside its exclusive economic zone, including dangerous manoeuvres, water‑cannoning, and disrupting resupply missions.

China, for its part, has accused the Philippines of intruding into what it claims as its territory.

The diplomatic row comes as the Philippines has expanded defence cooperation with the United States. It has also strengthened security ties with other like-minded partners, including Australia, Japan, and Canada, all of which have publicly backed the 2016 Permanent Court of Arbitration ruling that invalidated China's sweeping South China Sea claims.

Recent weeks have seen sharper exchanges between the Chinese Embassy and Philippine officials, including criticism of the coast guard spokesperson and lawmakers, prompting a response from Manila that Lazaro reiterated, that differences between states are best handled through diplomacy, not public exchanges.

Beijing continues to assert sovereignty over most of the South China Sea, including areas that fall within the EEZs of the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, Taiwan and Vietnam.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 10:30:27 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CRCSY77VLBNENDQXWSZD7XWA64.jpg?auth=b539893982e7e6f3ccdc400ac3873b658cac4c4232fcb8eba70833fe164094e8&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Hungary's opposition lead narrows slightly ahead of April vote, poll shows</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/hungarys-opposition-lead-narrows-slightly-ahead-april-vote-poll-shows-2026-01-22/</link><description>BUDAPEST, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Hungary's main opposition Tisza party's lead over Prime Minister Viktor Orban's Fidesz has narrowed slightly in January, a poll showed on Thursday, ahead of an April 12 election in which Orban faces a tough reelection bid.

Nationalist Orban, in power since 2010, is facing a strong challenger for the first time in the vote, with the outcome having major implications not only for Hungary but for Europe and its far-right political forces.

Most polls show Fidesz trailing behind Tisza despite voter-pleasing measures after three years of economic stagnation. Pro-government pollsters show a Fidesz lead. Two other polls last week showed Tisza party widening its lead over Fidesz.

Tisza, a centre-right party led by former government insider Peter Magyar, has a 9-point lead over Fidesz, down from a 12-point lead in a December survey among decided voters, pollster Republikon said.

"The new year brought an even more intensive campaign, as Fidesz and the pro-government media threw their full weight behind the theme of war, which helped the governing parties to victory in 2022," Republikon said.

Orban has framed the 2026 election as a choice between war and peace , portraying Ukraine as undeserving of support and his government as the only safe choice.

Magyar's party, which was only launched in 2024, had the support of 47% of decided voters, down from 48% in December.

Support for Fidesz grew to 38% from 36% a month ago among decided voters, according to the survey conducted between January 15 and 20. Among all voters, Tisza leads on 33%, to 28% for Fidesz.

Among smaller parties, the far-right Our Homeland (Mi Hazank) party and the Two-Tailed Dog Party have enough support to reach the 5% threshold for getting into parliament, Republikon said. Mi Hazank is supported by 6% of decided voters while 5% back the Two-Tailed Dog Party.

"Mi Hazank cannot yet be considered a certain entrant," Republikon said, adding that 27% of voters were undecided.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 10:30:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/M6V7ORONRFPWNNOUUBVFOZHFO4.jpg?auth=c94e48fa00b3b8324da16042ac474a19a551fe34addb55150f73df46af5ddf08&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump's Greenland climbdown triggers relief but way forward unclear</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/trumps-greenland-climbdown-triggers-relief-way-forward-unclear-2026-01-22/</link><description>DAVOS, Switzerland/COPENHAGEN/NUUK, Jan 22 (Reuters) - NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said on Thursday that Western allies will need to step up their presence in the Arctic under a framework deal with the U.S., a day after President Donald Trump walked back threats to use tariffs or seize Greenland by force.

Rutte told Reuters in an interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos that it was now up to NATO commanders to work through the details of extra security requirements and that he was sure non-Arctic NATO allies would want to contribute to the effort.

"We will come together in NATO with our senior commanders to work out what is necessary," Rutte said.

"I have no doubt we can do this quite fast. Certainly I would hope for 2026, I hope even early in 2026," he said.

Trump's ambition to wrest sovereignty over Greenland from fellow NATO member Denmark has threatened to blow apart the alliance that underpinned Western security since the end of World War Two, and reignite a trade war with Europe.

After weeks of threats, Trump on Wednesday stepped back from the threat of imposing tariffs on countries opposing his plans and ruled out using force, suggesting instead that a framework deal over the Arctic island was in sight.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 10:30:42 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4G3GG5MNSZLLVIITXD3V7BY7R4.jpg?auth=777c68b26200eb766187edaaf71337630a81340080f884966ccb9bd335b12912&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Germany's Merz: Europe must not rush to write off transatlantic ties</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/davos/germanys-merz-europe-must-not-rush-write-off-transatlantic-ties-2026-01-22/</link><description>BERLIN, Jan 22 (Reuters) - German Chancellor Friedrich Merz welcomed on Thursday U.S. President Donald Trump's shift in rhetoric on Greenland and urged Europeans not to be too quick to write off the transatlantic partnership.

Merz was addressing the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, a day after Trump abruptly stepped back from threats to impose tariffs as leverage to seize Greenland and ruled out the use of force.

The U.S. threats had risked the deepest rupture in transatlantic relations in decades and a global trade war.

"Despite all the frustration and anger of recent months, let us not be too quick to write off the transatlantic partnership," Merz said in a sweeping speech covering global security and European competitiveness.

"We Europeans, we Germans, know how precious the trust is on which NATO rests. In an age of great powers, the United States, too, will depend on this trust. It is their — and our — decisive competitive advantage."

Europe and the United States must repair the trust on which the transatlantic alliance was built, he said.

Germany was among the seven European countries that sent small numbers of military personnel to Greenland last week as Denmark said it was pressing on with plans for a larger and more permanent NATO presence to secure the island.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 10:31:03 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4S7QLZPAWRPLVPG2UBPYWJV2TQ.jpg?auth=36d4e48c876d8bc03d4eff966badd17eba5ea71ef39977791ead538c729b0c98&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US begins transfer of up to 7,000 IS group detainees from Syria to Iraq</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260122-us-begins-transfer-of-up-to-7-000-is-group-detainees-from-syria-to-iraq</link><description>The US military said Wednesday it has started transferring detainees from the Islamic State group being held in northeastern Syria to secure facilities in Iraq .

The move came after Syrian government forces took control of a sprawling camp, housing thousands of mostly women and children, from the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces , or SDF, which withdrew as part of a ceasefire . Troops on Monday seized a prison in the northeastern town of Shaddadeh, where some IS group detainees escaped and many were recaptured, state media reported.

The Kurdish-led SDF still controls more than a dozen detention facilities holding around 9,000 IS group members, but is slated to hand the prisons over to government control under a peace process that also is supposed to eventually merge the SDF with government forces.

US Central Command said the first transfer involved 150 IS group members, who were taken from Syria’s northeastern province of Hassakeh to “secure locations” in Iraq. The statement said that up to 7,000 detainees could be transferred to Iraqi-controlled facilities.

“Facilitating the orderly and secure transfer of ISIS detainees is critical to preventing a breakout that would pose a direct threat to the United States and regional security,” said Admiral Brad Cooper, CENTCOM commander.

CENTCOM spokesperson Captain Tim Hawkins said in a statement that during a call with Syrian interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa, Cooper had urged Syrian forces to adhere to the ceasefire and “expressed expectations for Syrian forces as well as all other forces to avoid any actions that could interfere” with the transfer of prisoners.

US troops and their partner forces detained more than 300 IS group operatives in Syria and killed over 20 last year, the US military said. An ambush last month by IS group militants killed two US soldiers and one American civilian interpreter in Syria.

The Iraqi army confirmed that the first batch of prisoners had arrived and said others would arrive in numbers to be determined later “with the aim of containing the threat posed by these individuals, who are considered first-tier leaders within terrorist organisations”.

An Iraqi intelligence general told The Associated Press that the IS group members who will be transferred to Iraq are of various nationalities. He said they include around 240 Tunisians, in addition to others from countries including Tajikistan and Kazakhstan and some Syrians.

“They will be interrogated and then put on trial. All of them are commanders in ISIS and are considered highly dangerous,” the general said. He added that in previous years, 3,194 Iraqi detainees and 47 French citizens have been transferred to Iraq.

On Thursday, Iraq announced it would start legal proceedings against the IS group detainees that arrived in the country.

The IS group was defeated in Iraq in 2017, and in Syria two years later, but the group’s sleeper cells still carry out deadly attacks in both countries. The SDF played a major role in defeating the IS group.

Tom Barrack, the US envoy to Syria, said in a statement on Tuesday that the SDF’s role as the primary anti-IS group force “has largely expired, as Damascus is now both willing and positioned to take over security responsibilities.”

He added that the “recent developments show the US actively facilitating this transition, rather than prolonging a separate SDF role.”

Syria’s foreign ministry welcomed the transfer of detainees, calling it “an important step to strengthen security and stability.”

Earlier on Wednesday, a convoy of armoured vehicles with government forces moved into the al-Hol camp following two weeks of clashes with the SDF, which appeared closer to merging into the Syrian military, in accordance with government demands.

At its peak in 2019, some 73,000 people were living at al-Hol. Their number has since declined with some countries repatriating their citizens.

The camp is still home to some 24,000, most of them women and children. They include about 14,500 Syrians and nearly 3,000 Iraqis. Some 6,500 others, many of them loyal IS group supporters who came from around the world to join the extremist group, are separately held in a highly secured section of the camp.

An AP journalist visited the camp on Wednesday as scores of soldiers guarded the main entrance.

“Go inside and see the chaos that is happening. There are no clinics, no running water, no bread and no vegetables,” an Iraqi woman living in the camp said, after SDF fighters left the area. The woman, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of security concerns, called on the Iraqi government to repatriate her.

Another Iraqi woman, who also refused to give her full name out of fear of reprisal, said her brother and uncle were being held in jails in northeast Syria and called on authorities to release them so that they can all return home.

The Syrian government and the SDF announced a new four-day truce late Tuesday after a previous ceasefire broke down.

A drone attack on Wednesday killed seven soldiers and wounded 20 while they were inspecting a weapons depot abandoned by SDF fighters in the northeastern town of Yaaroubiyeh, the defence ministry said, blaming the Kurdish forces. The SDF said the blast was triggered by soldiers moving the ammunition.

The SDF and the government traded blame over the escape Monday of IS group members from the Shaddedeh prison on the border with Iraq. Under a deal announced Sunday, government forces were to take over the control of the prisons but the transfer did not go smoothly.

The largest detention facility, Gweiran Prison, now called Panorama, has held about 4,500 IS group-linked detainees and was still in SDF hands.

Defence ministry spokesman Brigadier General Hassan Abdul-Ghani said in televised comments Tuesday that the government “was and still is in direct confrontation” with the IS group. He added that authorities are ready to take over prisons with IS group members.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 10:31:26 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/b6dabade-f772-11f0-b729-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26020701590615.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump's rhetoric rallies Canadian support for Prime Minister Mark Carney</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/trumps-rhetoric-rallies-canadian-support-prime-minister-mark-carney-2026-01-22/</link><description>OTTAWA, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Renewed verbal attacks from U.S. President Donald Trump are prompting Canadians to rally behind Prime Minister Mark Carney , who earned a rare standing ovation in Davos for openly decrying powerful nations using economic integration as weapons and tariffs as leverage.

In his speech, Carney called on nations to accept that a rules-based global order was over and pointed to Canada as an example of how "middle powers" might act together to avoid being victimized by American hegemony.

"When the rules no longer protect you, you must protect yourself," he said. "Middle powers must act together because if you are not on the table, you are on the menu."

In response, Trump retorted that Canada “lives because of the United States,” and told the crowd in Davos that Carney should be grateful for the United States’ previous largesse, addressing the prime minister directly: “Remember that, Mark, the next time you make your statements.”

A day earlier, Trump had posted an AI-generated photo of Canada and Greenland draped in the American flag on Truth Social.

A well-received Davos speech capped an eventful overseas trip for Carney, who last week struck a trade deal with China and sought new partnerships in the Middle East aimed at reducing his country's overwhelming economic reliance on the United States.

“Canadians will feel a sense of pride - and possibly some concern - because our prime minister has been so blunt,” said Laura Stephenson, a political science professor at the University of Western Ontario. “Carney is displaying courage by saying these things so publicly and there will be pride that the global reception to his speech has been largely positive.”

ARTICULATING A DIFFERENT WORLD VIEW

Stephenson said Carney’s speech - written by the prime minister himself, according to his office - will resonate with Canadians, though their response may vary depending on whether or not their jobs are tied to U.S. trade.

“If you’re going to be personally impacted by CUSMA, you might be very upset and fearful about what might happen next,” she said, referring to the trade agreement between Canada, the U.S. and Mexico that is up for review this year.

Despite the tough rhetoric, Carney has yet to broker a trade deal with the U.S. and his "elbows up" approach to the U.S. has somewhat faded - he dropped a digital services tax to restart trade negotiations with the U.S. and apologized for a Canadian advertisement that angered Trump, for example.

On the snowy streets of Toronto, retired race walker Ann Peel said Trump’s escalating rhetoric about annexing Canada left her “deeply concerned” about the possibility of U.S. aggression. She called Trump “a big bully” and said Carney’s speech was powerful because it articulated a fundamentally different world view than that of the U.S.

“We’re very values-based,” she said. “Canadians, as a people, stand proud,” Peel said. “We’re not just going to roll over because the United States wants us to.”

Since Trump first started threatening to make Canada the 51st state of the U.S. shortly after winning the 2024 election, Canadians have dramatically cut travel to the United States, boycotted American booze and prioritized buying Canadian goods.

CARNEY ENJOYS STRONG SUPPORT AT HOME

Jonathan Kalles, a former senior adviser to ex-Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, said he was struck by the support for Carney’s speech from across the political spectrum, including some Conservatives.

Most polls show Carney's approval rating holding above 50% since he came to power in April last year and recent data from Nanos Research shows Carney with a 22-point lead over Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre.

Carney's Liberal party reversed a nearly 30-point lead held by the Conservatives to win last year's federal election after Trump started threatening Canada's sovereignty.

James Moore, a former minister of industry under former Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper posted a clip of Carney’s speech while calling for people to “put down your partisan swords today and take a moment and listen to this speech.”

Michelle Rempel Garner, a Conservative member of parliament from Alberta, wrote in the National Post newspaper that Carney's speech "rightly named the hard realities of a fractured geopolitical system and the urgent need for middle powers like Canada to step up with resolve and realism" and called on him to follow through with action.

Jack Cunningham, a professor of international relations at the University of Toronto, said Canadians responded overwhelmingly to Carney’s speech in part because the prime minister dared to press back against Trump and appears to still command the president's respect.

“For a long time, every other leader has tried to treat Trump as if he were a difficult grandfather you had to manage,” Cunningham said. “There’s a sense of pride among Canadians that Carney is the leader that has been able to confront Trump ... We just hope now that we’re no longer alone.”</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 11:25:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/GBUKSN6FEVL6PGQN3JXPM3HRP4.jpg?auth=fecdcbca519f0ef742db814d34ba3cc8dd8c31e2a02e58062f0eccc8ad81f5fb&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Vance heads to Minneapolis amid tension over ICE crackdown</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/vance-heads-minneapolis-amid-tension-over-ice-crackdown-2026-01-22/</link><description>MINNEAPOLIS, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Vice President JD Vance is expected to visit Minneapolis on Thursday to show support for a massive federal law enforcement operation underway in a city that has been on edge since an ICE officer shot dead a 37-year-old mother of three.

With the city and the country deeply divided over the January 7 fatal shooting of Renee Good, the vice president's visit is meant to show support for the work of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, part of a force of 3,000 federal law enforcement officers deployed to the area.

Minnesota has become the latest Democratic-leaning jurisdiction targeted by Republican President Donald Trump with a federal police show of force that the administration says is aimed at immigration violators and a fraud investigation involving social service programs in the Somali community.

Trump and his supporters have described the federal police rollouts as a necessary response to lax Democratic policies on crime and immigration. Local Democratic leaders and street protesters have accused ICE agents of aggressive tactics and racial profiling, and urged Trump to withdraw from what they say is a provocation dividing Americans.

Heavily armed federal officers in tactical gear have been combing the streets of Minneapolis rounding up suspects they say are dangerous criminal immigration violators, while sometimes ensnaring law-abiding U.S. citizens . Demonstrators have responded with their own observer patrols, blowing whistles to warn people of ICE raids while voicing their displeasure with Trump's escalation.

The operations have divided some of the president's own supporters .

Vance has taken a leading role in defending the Minnesota ICE shooting . Less than 24 hours after Good's death, Vance stood up for the officer involved, blamed the woman who was killed, and said the incident should be a political test ahead of the 2026 midterm elections that will determine control of Congress.

The vice president will host a roundtable event with local leaders and community members where he will discuss "restoring law and order in Minnesota" and meet with officers in a show of support, the White House said on Wednesday. He will also argue that Minneapolis’ policy of banning city staff from enforcing federal immigration law has degraded public safety and endangered ICE officers, the White House said.

Vance is also expected to discuss how the Trump administration is taking on so-called sanctuary cities that do not cooperate with the administration's immigration crackdown, threatening to cut them off from federal funding starting on February 1.

Richard Carlbom, chair of Minnesota's Democratic Party, said he hopes Vance will promote calm but fears political agitation.

“I think he is simply coming here for political theater. This entire situation we're being faced with is a retribution campaign by him and the president of the United States against Minnesotans," Carlbom told Reuters, calling on Minnesotans to "continue to resist the vice president."

Trump addressed the Minnesota issue during his speech to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Wednesday, saying, "ICE gets beat up by stupid people from leadership in Minnesota. We actually are helping Minnesota so much, but they don’t appreciate it."

Patty O'Keefe, a 36-year-old Minnesotan and non-profit worker who was pepper sprayed and detained by federal agents in January after documenting ICE movements in the city, did not welcome Vance's visit.

"He's calling for law and order when it's his federal agents who are creating chaos and escalating violence," O'Keefe said. “His divisive rhetoric is not welcome here."

The president and the White House have tied the ICE operation to issues of welfare fraud in the state. Since 2022, at least 56 people have pleaded guilty , according to the Justice Department.

“Minnesota reminds us that the West cannot mass import foreign cultures,” Trump said in Davos.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 11:25:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/PLHCZNVWVVICPMG2O3QGYQJCZE.jpg?auth=dfd0737fcf5c960db827775ac645ca629c5d1d47bfcc5eca41fa51cd7195470f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>EU leaders to reassess US ties despite Trump U-turn on Greenland</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/eu-leaders-reassess-us-ties-despite-trump-u-turn-greenland-2026-01-22/</link><description>BRUSSELS, Jan 22 (Reuters) - EU leaders will rethink their ties with the U.S. at an emergency summit on Thursday after Donald Trump's threat of tariffs and even military action to acquire Greenland badly shook confidence in the transatlantic relationship, diplomats said.

Trump abruptly stepped back on Wednesday from his threat of tariffs on eight European nations, ruled out using force to take Greenland, a semi-autonomous territory of NATO ally Denmark, and suggested a deal was in sight to end the dispute.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz , welcoming Trump's U-turn on Greenland, urged Europeans not to be too quick to write off the transatlantic partnership.

But EU governments remain wary of another change of mind by a mercurial president who is increasingly seen as a bully that Europe will have to stand up to, and they are focused on coming up with a longer-term plan on how to deal with the United States under this administration and possibly its successors too.

"Trump crossed the Rubicon. He might do it again. There is no going back to what it was. And leaders will discuss it," one EU diplomat said, adding that the bloc needed to move away from its heavy reliance on the U.S. in many areas.

"We need to try to keep him (Trump) close while working on becoming more independent from the U.S. It is a process, probably a long one," the diplomat said.

EU RELIANCE ON U.S.

After decades of relying on the United States for defence within the NATO alliance, the EU lacks the needed intelligence, transport, missile defence and production capabilities to defend itself against a possible Russian attack. This gives the U.S. substantial leverage.

The U.S. is also Europe's biggest trading partner, making the EU vulnerable to Trump's policies of imposing tariffs to reduce Washington's trade deficit in goods, and, as in the case of Greenland, to achieve other goals.

"We need to discuss where the red lines are, how we deal with this bully across the Atlantic, where our strengths are," a second EU diplomat said.

"Trump says no tariffs today, but does that mean also no tariffs tomorrow, or will he again quickly change his mind? We need to discuss what to do then," the second diplomat said.

The EU had been considering a package of retaliatory tariffs on 93 billion euros ($108.74 billion) on U.S. imports or anti-coercive measures if Trump had gone ahead with his own tariffs, while knowing such a step would harm Europe's economy as well as the United States.

Several diplomats noted there were still few details of the new plan for Greenland, agreed between Trump and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte late on Wednesday on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.

"Nothing much changed. We still need to see details of the Greenland deal. We are a bit fed up with all the bullying. And we need to act on a few things: more resiliency, unity, get our things together on internal market, competitiveness. And no more accepting tariff bullying," a third diplomat said.

Rutte told Reuters in an interview in Davos on Thursday that under the framework deal he reached with Trump the Western allies would have to step up their presence in the Arctic.

He also said talks would continue between Denmark, Greenland and the U.S. on specific issues.

Diplomats stressed that, although Thursday's emergency EU talks in Brussels would now lose some of their urgency, the longer-term issue of how to handle the relationship with the U.S. remained.

"The approach of a united front in solidarity with Denmark and Greenland while focusing on de-escalation and finding an off-ramp has worked," a fourth EU diplomat said.

"At the same time it would be good to reflect on the state of the relationship and how we want to shape this going forward, given the experiences of the past week (and year)," he said.

Ali Shaath made the announcement by video link during an event in Davos hosted by President Donald Trump, who convened a group of leaders to formally launch a "Board of Peace" initially focused on cementing Gaza's ceasefire.

A key unfulfilled element of the ceasefire, brokered by Trump in October, has been the reopening of Gaza's main gateway to the world to allow the entry and exit of Palestinians.

"I am pleased to announce the Rafah crossing will open next week in both directions. For Palestinians in Gaza, Rafah is more than a gate. It is a lifeline and symbol of opportunity," Shaath said.

"Opening Rafah signals that Gaza is no longer closed to the future and to the war," Shaath said.

There was no immediate comment from Israel, which has controlled the Rafah crossing since 2024.

The ceasefire deal left Israel in control of more than half of Gaza, including the area that abuts the border crossing. Hamas controls the remainder of the enclave.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 11:27:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ZVSMMPUTE5JGVOQBBDKIHF3UVU.jpg?auth=8ce9e37ed8835fef9d7657394db280d7fece5a9790ea56cf6334bbdd04e85b07&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Guinea Bissau sets December 2026 election date after coup</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/guinea-bissau-sets-december-2026-election-date-after-coup-2026-01-22/</link><description>Jan 22 (Reuters) - Guinea Bissau has scheduled presidential and legislative elections to be held on December 6, following a coup in the troubled West African nation late last year that disrupted the electoral process.

The soldiers, calling themselves the Military High Command, toppled incumbent President Umaro Sissoco Embalo and installed Major-General Horta Inta-a as interim president the following day.

The coup was criticized by the Economic Community of West African States regional bloc, which called on them to restore order and proceed with the election.

Putin ​has said he is studying Trump's invitation to join his Board of Peace , which has been sent to dozens of world ‌leaders, including Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Trump launched the initiative with some leaders on Thursday and said others would join later.

Trump first proposed the initiative in September when he announced his plan to end the Gaza war . He later made clear the board's mandate would be expanded to tackle other conflicts worldwide. The charter says that permanent members must help fund the board with a payment of $1 billion each.

Putin offered to use $1 ‌billion from its frozen assets in talks with Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas on Thursday.

Putin ​said that Russia could donate the money to the initiative due to Russia's "special relationship with the people of Palestine", according to comments reported by the Kremlin from the Security Council meeting on Wednesday.

Putin is due to meet U.S. envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner later ‍on Thursday, with the Kremlin emphasizing the importance of bilateral economic relations and trade in the ongoing talks.

The central bank said in its last comprehensive report on its holdings from the start of 2022 that about 11% of its $613 billion gold and forex ⁠reserves, or about $67 billion, were held in dollar-denominated assets.

Dollar-denominated assets can only be held at U.S.-based depositaries.

The central bank estimates that ‍about $300 billion of Russia's sovereign funds are frozen by Western countries. Most of these assets are frozen in Europe and are held at Belgian depositary ‌Euroclear.

The ‌Russian Elites, Proxies, and Oligarchs (REPO) Task Force, created by the Group of Seven, European Union, and Australia, in 2023, estimated frozen Russian sovereign assets at $280 billion.

Axios reported in September 2023 that the task force had identified only $5 billion in Russia's sovereign assets frozen in the U.S. The Central Bank's head, Elvira Nabiullina, declined to comment on the geographical distribution of the frozen assets.

The Kremlin's ⁠spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said on Thursday ⁠that the move will require ​an unblocking of the assets by the U.S. authorities and that Russia still considers the freeze as illegal.

"It's still unclear how it will be legally structured. All of this needs to be discussed," Peskov said.

Russia's central bank filed a lawsuit in Moscow last December seeking $230 billion in damages from ‍Euroclear in response to the EU's move to make the freeze indefinite and proposals to confiscate the assets to fund Ukraine.

Reuters sources said last year that Russia is open to the idea of using its frozen sovereign assets for the reconstruction of Ukraine as part of the peace deal but will insist that ​part of the money is spent on the territories it controls.

Some proposals from ‍leaked drafts of a peace plan included an idea to use one-third of Russia's total frozen assets to fund U.S.-led efforts to rebuild and invest in Ukraine, ​while the rest would go to a U.S.-Russia investment fund.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 11:46:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/UU32TWP5DFIPJEPHSKCXWVQ63Q.jpg?auth=b1161d6dfa8f4f0a0786dfb5dc67fc958c848a2c2b3af8cdd9af4561129c4087&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Exclusive: EU-Mercosur deal likely to take effect provisionally from March</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/eu-mercosur-deal-likely-take-effect-provisionally-march-says-eu-diplomat-2026-01-22/</link><description>BERLIN, Jan 22 (Reuters) - The EU's free trade deal with South American countries will probably be applied on a ​provisional basis as soon as March, an EU diplomat ‌told Reuters on Thursday, despite a looming challenge at the bloc's top court.

EU lawmakers dealt a blow to the contentious trade agreement with Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay on Wednesday by referring ‌it to the European Court of Justice, potentially delaying ​it by two years.

"The EU-Mercosur agreement shall be applied provisionally once the first Mercosur country has ratified it," an EU ‍diplomat told Reuters.

"That will probably be Paraguay in March," the diplomat added.

The EU signed its largest-ever trade pact with the Mercosur members on Saturday after ⁠25 years of negotiations, and the delay has caused dismay ‍among many businesses in Germany and with one of its main backers, Chancellor ‌Friedrich ‌Merz.

He told delegates at the World Economic Forum in the Swiss alpine resort of Davos that he regretted the decision by the European Parliament, which meant another obstacle had been ⁠erected.

"But rest assured: ⁠We will ​not be stopped. The Mercosur deal is fair and balanced. There is no alternative to it if we want to have higher growth ‍in Europe," he said on Thursday.

Supporters argue that the deal is important to offset business lost to U.S. tariffs and to reduce reliance on ​China.

Critics, led by France, say it ‍will increase imports of cheap beef, sugar and poultry and undercut domestic farmers.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 12:52:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7NY4HMKAMVJV7DVEKGYQANN6OI.jpg?auth=bb581c1229e9e9ba902396a06bf39b9a330aa9723eb9f0f88d1b5f083e415cc5&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Train collides with crane in Spain's fourth rail crash in a week, several injured</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/train-crashes-against-crane-southeastern-spain-tve-reports-2026-01-22/</link><description>MADRID, Jan 22 (Reuters) - A commuter train collided with a crane in southeastern Spain on Thursday, emergency services said, in the country's fourth rail crash in less than a week.

Several people suffered minor injuries in the crash near the port city of Cartagena in Murcia region, authorities added.

"The train hasn't been overturned or derailed," a spokesperson for Murcia's emergency services said. The first calls about the crash came in just after noon, they added.

Spain is still reeling from Sunday's high-speed train collision in the southern Andalusia region that killed at least 43 people.

Two days after that, a commuter train derailed after a containment wall fell on the track due to heavy rain near the city of Barcelona, killing the driver and seriously injuring four passengers.

The main train drivers' union called a nationwide strike over safety standards after that and a second collision in the northeastern Catalonia region the same day, Tuesday.

On Thursday, Spanish rail operator Adif said traffic on the line in Murcia was disrupted by what it described as "the intrusion into the infrastructure gauge by a crane not belonging to the railway operation". Its message on X did not go into more detail.

A later posting said servicexs had resumed on the line.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 12:53:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia-China cooperation in Arctic is a concern for NATO, top general says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/russia-china-cooperation-arctic-is-concern-nato-top-general-says-2026-01-22/</link><description>Jan 22 (Reuters) - Increased cooperation between China and Russia is a source of concern for NATO, the top commander of the trans-Atlantic alliance Alexus Grynkewich said on Thursday.

"We're constantly trying to enhance our posture and think of ways that nations can enhance our posture in the Arctic."

U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday abruptly stepped back from threats to impose tariffs as leverage to seize Greenland, ruled out the use of force, and said a deal was in sight to end a dispute over the Danish territory.

In areas across Gaza, Israel has placed the concrete blocks meant to demarcate its "Yellow Line" dozens or sometimes hundreds of metres inside Hamas-controlled territory, and its military has built up at least six fortifications to station troops, the satellite imagery shows.

The imagery depicts how Israel has unilaterally shifted its line of control in Gaza -- and cordoned off more land where Palestinians could live -- even as President Donald Trump presses ahead with a ceasefire plan that calls for further Israeli troop withdrawals.

Nowhere is Israel's widening zone of control more stark than in Al-Tuffah, once a historic quarter of Gaza City but now a wasteland of destroyed buildings and mangled metal following two years of Israeli bombardment.

Thousands of Palestinians took shelter in Al-Tuffah after the October ceasefire, which was meant to see Israeli troops retreat to a yellow line marked on military maps that runs nearly the full length of Gaza and hugs the neighbourhood's eastern edge.

But satellite images of Al-Tuffah taken December 2 and 13 show that Israel initially placed blocks on the Hamas-controlled side of the Yellow Line and then moved them roughly 200 metres further in.

After moving the yellow-painted blocks, the military began razing the area, destroying at least 40 buildings, a Reuters analysis of the imagery shows. Few buildings remain standing between the newly positioned blocks and the Yellow Line.

It was unclear how Israel demolished the buildings. In the past, it has used a combination of aerial bombardment, controlled explosions and bulldozers to raze structures.

The Israeli military said it was checking Reuters' questions on why the blocks were moved and why the buildings were destroyed. The military has said it has continued operations against Hamas since the ceasefire, including by targeting its tunnel network under Gaza.

A military source said it was not possible to mark the Yellow Line exactly as it appeared on maps because homes, buildings or other obstacles often stand in the way. The source described the yellow line depictions published by the military and the Trump administration as "illustrations".

Trump's 20-point plan to end the Gaza war , which underlies the ceasefire deal, called for an immediate halt to fighting, saying: "All military operations, including aerial and artillery bombardment, will be suspended, and battle lines will remain frozen until conditions are met for the complete staged withdrawal."

Manal Abu Al-Kas is one of many Palestinians who say they were forced to flee eastern Al-Tuffah after Israel moved the blocks beyond where they were living.

Abu Al-Kas and her husband said two sons had been killed and buried in Al-Tuffah along with other relatives. She said the family was living happily there, "until they put up these yellow stones and we were forced to leave" and she fled, along with her husband and another son, both of whom had legs amputated.

The military moved the blocks in mid-December and they decided to flee in January, she said, adding: "If there weren't shells falling on us in our homes, we wouldn't have left our house."

Beyond Al-Tuffah, the satellite imagery shows that Israel has placed the blocks firmly in Hamas-controlled territory in areas across Gaza.

In Khan Younis, in southern Gaza, the military in December placed a block some 390 metres beyond the line, the images show, and another about 220 metres beyond it.

During that time, multiple buildings were destroyed and two tent clusters meant to house displaced people were dismantled, the images show.

The imagery also shows the military has built up at least six large fortifications, all on the Israeli side within 700 metres of the line of control. One of them, in Beit Hanoun in north Gaza, is around 264 metres from the line.

The military said it was checking Reuters' questions on Khan Younis and on the fortifications. The military source said the fortifications, crafted mostly from mud and earth, were temporary in nature and meant to protect troops from incoming fire.

Hazem Qassem, a Hamas spokesperson, said the Yellow Line's expansion had caused thousands to flee west.

"It also means that the entire people of the Gaza Strip will be crammed into a narrow strip in the west of the Gaza Strip, in an area that is less than 30% of the strip's area," Qassem said.

The U.S.-backed deal called for a complete ceasefire but left Israel in control of well over half of Gaza, with further troop withdrawals tied to Hamas disarmament. On Thursday, Trump launched his "Board of Peace" after announcing a Palestinian technocratic committee last week in a bid to move the deal to its next phase.

Nearly all of Gaza's 2 million people have been forced into a narrow coastal strip where Hamas has retained control and where most live in tents or damaged buildings. Officials have voiced concerns about a de facto partition of the territory, with reconstruction likely to be limited to Israeli-controlled areas.

Israel has repeatedly shot at people in areas around the Yellow Line since the ceasefire deal was struck in October, often accusing militants of trying to cross the line or attack troops.

In Al-Tuffah, videos taken in early January and verified by Reuters show Israel flying quadcopters, or small drones, over buildings some 500 metres inside the Yellow Line as it patrols the area. The military had no comment on its use of quadcopters.

More than 460 Palestinians, including many children, have been killed by Israel since the October deal came into effect, according to Gaza medics, while militants have killed three Israeli soldiers. Both sides have accused each other of ceasefire violations.

Israel launched its offensive in Gaza after a Hamas-led cross-border attack on October 7, 2023 that killed 1,200 people, according to Israeli tallies. Israel's assault has killed 71,000 Palestinians, Gaza's health authorities say.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 13:48:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/S7OL7JKULBPSTHSB6MJUIIU54M.jpg?auth=8290e104c20d4d955db69e936e0bbec412cd15575e7003c69e86e3c61a22d43e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UK's Starmer welcomes Trump move to drop Greenland tariff threat</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uks-starmer-welcomes-trump-move-drop-greenland-tariff-threat-2026-01-22/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 22 - British Prime Minister Keir Starmer told his Danish counterpart on Thursday that U.S. President Donald Trump's decision not to pursue tariffs on European countries who opposed his plans to take control of Greenland was a pragmatic and common sense step.

Trump abruptly stepped back on Wednesday from threats to impose tariffs as leverage to seize Greenland, ruled out the use of force and suggested a deal was in sight to end a dispute over the Danish territory.

"In terms of recent developments and the withdrawal of the threat of tariffs, I see that as a reflection of pragmatism, common sense and sticking to our values and our principles," Starmer told Mette Frederiksen.

Frederiksen said Britain was one of Denmark's oldest and most important allies and partners and thanked Starmer for his support.

"I like the British way of doing things... You have a cup of tea and then you think a bit about everything, you get the facts on the table, and then you find a way forward, and that's exactly what we're doing now," she told Starmer at the start of their meeting at Chequers, the British prime minister's country residence.

The collision between two trains was one of Europe's worst rail disasters in recent years, injuring more than 120 people. Investigators are still working to establish its cause.

Boro, a cross between a schnauzer and a water dog, was riding on one of the trains with his owner Ana Garcia Aranda and her pregnant sister at the time of the crash. Both women were injured, with the sister hospitalised in intensive care .

Relatives had pleaded with the public for help finding the dog.

"If I can't do anything for (my sister), at least I hope I can find Boro," Garcia Aranda said earlier this week in comments reported in Spanish media.

Police first spotted the dog near the crash site on Wednesday, but he ran off when officers tried to approach him. Firefighters caught him the following morning.

"We knew since yesterday the area where he could be, and today we were finally able to find him and bring him with us, so he can be returned to his family," one of the firefighters told reporters.

The dog has since been reunited with relatives.

"It has been very difficult and very beautiful," a family spokesperson said.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 13:50:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5GV3YO2OP5NDTC3EWAYRT5F67Y.jpg?auth=a25267fcb5d18661b977576520947be53308f22d15561848c8b80c70c3ec509b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukraine anti-graft police target former border guard chief</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-anti-graft-police-target-former-border-guard-chief-2026-01-22/</link><description>KYIV, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Ukrainian anti-corruption authorities said on Thursday they were investigating a former border guard chief over bribery allegations, pressing on with a campaign against graft as the fourth anniversary of Russia's 2022 invasion approaches.

The National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) said the official, who was not named, and two others had taken at least 204,000 euros ($238,780) in kickbacks in exchange for helping facilitate cigarette smuggling into the European Union.

"To hide their activities, the perpetrators used vehicles registered in the Czech Republic and Austria, on which they installed special license plates similar to diplomatic ones," NABU said in a statement.

It said that a 3,000-euro bribe had been paid for each car. Ukrainian authorities do not identify suspects by name.

Thursday's probe is the third high-profile investigation announced by the agency over the past week, part of a drive by anti-graft authorities as Ukraine seeks EU membership.

Investigators on Wednesday named a former senior aide in President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's office as one of nine suspects in an alleged plot to claim government payments for green energy.

Last week, they accused former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko of running a vote-buying scheme in parliament, a charge she denied.

In November, NABU shocked Ukrainians by announcing details of an alleged $100-million kickback scheme in the energy sector involving a former Zelenskiy associate.

The allegations led to the departure of Zelenskiy's chief of staff in a wider political overhaul while focusing attention on the size of Ukraine's task in tackling corruption as Russia's war in Ukraine drags on.

In the Gaza Strip, health officials said Israeli airstrikes on Thursday had killed five people in the enclave. There was no immediate Israeli comment on the violence, the latest to fray the October truce accord.

Trump has parlayed the ceasefire into a broader "Board of Peace" initiative aimed at resolving conflicts globally.

After hosting a signing ceremony for the board in Davos, Switzerland, on Thursday, Trump invited his son-in-law Jared Kushner to present development plans for Gaza, its densely populated cities and towns now in ruins from two years of war.

"In the beginning, we were toying with (building) a free zone, and then (having) a Hamas zone," Kushner told an audience in Davos of Trump's early plans to rebuild Gaza, where nearly the entire 2 million population is internally displaced.

"And then we said, you know what? Let's just plan for catastrophic success."

Kushner presented the audience with a slideshow depicting a "master plan" for what he termed a "New Gaza", displayed on a colour-coded map with areas reserved for residential development, data centres and industrial parks.

The slides included an image of a Mediterranean coastline packed with glittering towers akin to those in Dubai or Singapore. They suggested redevelopment would begin in Rafah in the south, an area under complete Israeli military control.

But they did not address key issues such as property rights or compensation for Palestinians who lost their homes, businesses and livelihoods during the war. Nor did they address where displaced Palestinians might live during the rebuilding.

Kushner did not say who would fund the redevelopment, which would first require clearing an estimated 68 million tons of rubble and war debris.

A conference will be held in Washington in the coming weeks "where we'll announce a lot of the contributions that will be made ... from the private sector," Kushner said, without elaborating.

The slides shown by Kushner were nearly identical to slides leaked to the Wall Street Journal in December. The newspaper reported then that the U.S. had offered to "anchor" 20% of the redevelopment project, without going into detail.

Trump has floated the idea of transforming long-impoverished and dilapidated Gaza into the "Riviera of the Middle East", an idea that has drawn criticism from Palestinians.

Kushner's presentation in Davos followed remarks by Ali Shaath, the Palestinian technocrat leader backed by Washington to administer the enclave under Trump's 20-point plan for Gaza.

A key unfulfilled element of the ceasefire has been the reopening of Gaza's key Rafah border crossing with Egypt for the entry and exit of Palestinians. Shaath, speaking by video link, announced the Rafah crossing would open next week.

"Opening Rafah signals that Gaza is no longer closed to the future and to the war," Shaath said.

Israel, which controls the Gaza side of the crossing, has rejected reopening it until Hamas fulfills its ceasefire obligation of returning the remains of the last hostage held in the territory.

After Shaath's announcement, an Israeli political source said a special effort was being made to return Ran Gvili's remains and that Israel would discuss reopening the crossing starting next week.

The next phase of Trump's Gaza plan would see Hamas disarm and international peacekeepers deploy in the crowded, coastal enclave as Israeli troops withdraw further. The first phase left Israel in control of well over half of Gaza, with Hamas holding a sliver of territory along the coast.

Israel has continued to carry out air and artillery strikes in Gaza, often accusing Hamas militants of preparing attacks on its troops or encroaching into areas it controls.

Health officials at Al Shifa Hospital, Gaza's largest, said four Palestinians were killed on Thursday by Israeli tank shelling in the Zeitoun suburb of eastern Gaza City. A fifth person was killed by Israeli fire in Khan Younis in the south, health officials said.

Israel's military did not immediately provide comment.

A day earlier, Israeli fire killed 11 people including two boys and three journalists, health officials said. On Thursday, Palestinians in Gaza held funerals for the three journalists, who press advocates said had been using a drone to film tents housing displaced people.

Without providing evidence, the Israeli military said the drone they were operating was "affiliated with Hamas" and "posed a threat to (troops') safety." The troops "precisely struck the suspects who activated the drone", the military said.

Israel has killed more than 480 Palestinians since the ceasefire took effect, health officials say, while militants have killed three Israeli soldiers.

Israel launched its air and ground war in Gaza after a Hamas-led cross-border attack on October 7, 2023 that killed 1,200 people, according to Israeli tallies. Israel's assault has killed 71,000 Palestinians, health authorities say.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 14:31:22 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/6GTBDVX6SFM5XMXYSCGYHE26I4.jpg?auth=4b506cf559d06f277c447e9862661cc35d8520074e59a597add9a49aec94d486&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>ICE detains four children from Minnesota school district, school officials say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/ice-detains-four-children-minnesota-school-district-school-officials-say-2026-01-22/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 22 (Reuters) - U.S. immigration authorities detained at least four children including a 5-year-old from the same Minneapolis-area school district this month, school district officials said at a press conference.

The report comes amid concerns over the scope and tactics of federal law enforcement officers as part of U.S. President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown, which has seen 3,000 officers deployed to Minnesota's largest city.

Trump has described the crackdown as a battle to get violent criminals out of the U.S.

"Why detain a 5-year-old?" Zena Stenvik, the Columbia Heights Public Schools district superintendent, said at a Wednesday press conference, according to U.S. media. "You cannot tell me that this child is going to be classified as a violent criminal."

Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin on Thursday denied a child was targeted.

“ICE did NOT target a child," she said in a statement. ICE conducted a targeted operation on Tuesday to arrest Adrian Alexander Conejo Arias, who she said was in the country illegally. "As agents approached the driver Adrian Alexander Conejo Arias, fled on foot—abandoning his child. For the child’s safety, one of our ICE officers remained with the child while the other officers apprehended Conejo Arias," she said.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 14:31:26 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/H7LBEZCC3NKPNLNXJ3BWNXRTGI.jpg?auth=5e7f692510feb8618ec5c05425df9d2d6071efab5d35a56e7d1fea577ce50e3d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iraq says it will prosecute Islamic State detainees transferred from Syria</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iraq-says-it-will-prosecute-islamic-state-detainees-transferred-syria-2026-01-22/</link><description>Jan 22 (Reuters) - Iraq's Supreme Judicial Council said on Thursday it would begin legal proceedings against Islamic State detainees transferred from Syria after the rapid collapse of Kurdish-led forces in northeast Syria triggered concerns over prison security.

The U.S. military said on Tuesday its forces had transferred 150 Islamic State detainees from Syria to Iraq and that the operation could eventually see up to 7,000 detainees moved out of Syria. It cited concerns over prison security after the military setbacks suffered by the Syrian Democratic Forces.

An Iraqi military spokesperson confirmed that Iraq had received a first batch of 150 Islamic State detainees, including Iraqis and foreigners and said the number of future transfers would depend on security and field assessments. The spokesperson described the detainees as senior figures within the group.

In a statement, the Supreme Judicial Council said Iraqi courts would take "due legal measures" against the detainees once they are handed over and placed in specialised correctional facilities, citing the Iraqi constitution and criminal laws.

"All suspects, regardless of their nationalities or positions within the terrorist organisation, are subject exclusively to the authority of the Iraqi judiciary," the statement said.

Iraqi officials say under the legal measures, Islamic State detainees will be separated, with senior figures — including foreign nationals — to be held at a high‑security detention facility near Baghdad airport that was previously used by U.S. forces.

The SDF has previously said it was guarding some 10,000 IS fighters, while thousands of women and children linked to the group remain confined in camps.

The transfers have raised concerns among some relatives of Islamic State detainees in Europe. A European woman whose relative joined the group and was detained in Syria said her family was alarmed by reports that prisoners were being moved to Iraq.

Speaking on condition of anonymity, she said the family initially hoped changes in control in Syria might bring information on her relative’s fate.

"At least we thought we might finally learn where he is, whether he is alive or sick," she said.

"But when we saw that the prisoners were being taken to Iraq, that frightened us," she added, citing Iraq’s use of the death penalty.

Iraqi officials say the country's courts are responsible for ensuring due process.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 14:31:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LHRRQRGFHVOL5PNOPMUBPTXIZY.jpg?auth=71339d0bad73385f95e5d55fd16ac9aaf7a14d7441e1b203fce7e33005e5dff5&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Free-wheeling Amsterdam cracks down on electric 'fatbikes'</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/free-wheeling-amsterdam-cracks-down-electric-fatbikes-2026-01-22/</link><description>AMSTERDAM, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Amsterdam, one of Europe's biggest cycling cities, is planning to ban super-sized electric "fatbikes" from its main park after a rise in high-speed crashes and injuries blamed on reckless riders.

The ban on the bikes - which authorities say can travel up to 60 kph (40 mph) down Amsterdam's narrow streets and paths - pleased safety campaigners but annoyed some cyclists who said it clashed with the city's laissez-faire image.

Alderwoman Melanie van der Horst, who first proposed the move, said she had been deluged with complaints from pedestrians in the Vondelpark.

Elderly people have said they are worried about being hit and some women had reported being slapped by passing riders.

“We see a lot of fatbikes going more than 50 or 60 kilometres an hour. Well, they are only supposed to go 25, so it's very dangerous,” Van der Horst said.

The fatbikes - which stand out from regular electric bicycles with their thick tires, large batteries and heavy frames - are particularly popular among young riders and delivery drivers.

Fatbike owner Sjoerd Jonkers said the outright prohibition was an overreaction, and that authorities should concentrate on banning illegal, imported models, and bikes that had been modified to go too fast.

"I love driving it, my girlfriend's on the back, my son on the front, the three of us on one bicycle. So I ditched my car," he told Reuters.

Alex Manuputty, riding a flashy orange fatbike made by Stoer in the park, said there was always resistance to new things.

"There need to be rules and then all cultures - all people - can actually get along," Manuputty said.

More than half the 800,000-strong population use some form of bicycle every day in Amsterdam, a city famed for its cycling lanes.

Batteries are overtaking pedal-power. Out of all the bicycles sold in the Netherlands in 2024, 48% were electric, and another 13% were fatbikes, according to vehicle association RAI.

In October, Dutch hospitals found that people injured on fatbikes were 70% more likely to need extra medical treatment than people hurt on conventional bicycles.

About half of fatbike accidents involved children aged 12-15, according to the findings.

Dr. Barbara Swarthout-ten Kate, a family doctor in Amsterdam, said her practice has seen a spike in concussions and arm fractures. Helmets should be compulsory and under-16s should be banned from riding fatbikes, she added.

"The helmet will make it safer, but also less cool," she said.

The city council has not set a date for the ban to go into effect.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 14:31:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/EVT5A27W2NLK3HVJE7OWNRKCP4.jpg?auth=60148694243e92cf92e96ef95bf4f8e2e75ca963338d0225d77c570270c9d9ad&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Wife of detained Uganda opposition figure says husband sick, condition worrying</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/wife-detained-uganda-opposition-figure-says-husband-sick-condition-worrying-2026-01-22/</link><description>KAMPALA, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Detained Ugandan opposition figure Kizza Besigye is in a "worrying" health condition after falling sick, his wife Winnie Byanyima told Reuters, citing symptoms including high temperature, stomach pain, dehydration and inability to walk.

Besigye, 69, has spent more than a year in detention after his arrest in neighbouring Kenya , where he had travelled before being extradited to Uganda and charged with treason and other offences.

His lawyers, wife, and political allies have rejected the charges, describing him as a political prisoner targeted for opposing President Yoweri Museveni's decades-long rule.

Museveni, 81, secured another term in last week's election after he was declared winner with just under 72% of the vote against his opponent, Bobi Wine, who has contested the results as fraudulent.

Byanyima, the executive director of the U.N. agency UNAIDS, said in an interview with Reuters at their Kampala residence that Besigye's health had deteriorated significantly since falling ill. His condition includes severe pain in his legs and limited food intake.

He is also unable to walk and eats little, Byanyima, who visited her husband on Wednesday, added.

Frank Baine, spokesperson for the Uganda Prisons Service, did not respond to calls for comment.

The government denies persecuting opposition figures and says all those who have been detained have committed crimes.

Byanyima said that a doctor who took tests suspects Besigye has a bacterial infection but results of the diagnosis are not yet out.

Prisons authorities had rejected Besigye's request to be admitted to his private doctor's clinic for effective treatment and monitoring, Byanyima said.

"Every hour they delay to do that is a cost on his life because his condition is not under control," she said.

"He (Besigye) is a political prisoner, and he's being treated in a way that is compromising his health right now."

Byanyima said Besigye, who was Museveni's ally and personal physician before he became an opposition leader, is being held in solitary confinement in a small, hot room with limited space and forced to sleep on a thin, bedbug-infested mattress.

Besigye, who has contested Museveni in presidential elections four times, missed a court appearance on Wednesday due to his worsening condition. "They are denying him health care. They want to kill him," Byanyima said.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 14:32:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/NSLKSC4NG5IC5CLCQRPZBX2DWM.jpg?auth=b678837be3a0957c5e33bee68f5c6975018d7922a0566ce2ebf3872789a940e3&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump says Greenland agreement still being negotiated</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/davos/trump-says-greenland-agreement-still-being-negotiated-2026-01-22/</link><description>Jan 22 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said the details of a U.S. agreement over Greenland were still being worked out on ​Thursday, speaking one day after he stepped back from a tariff ‌threat and ruled out the use of force to seize the Danish territory.

Trump, in an interview on Fox Business Network from Davos, also acknowledged the impact of his quest for Greenland on global markets and said he did ‌not plan to pay to acquire it.

"It's really being negotiated ​now, the details of it. But essentially it's total access. It's - there's no end, there's no time limit," Trump said from the sidelines ‍of the World Economic Forum.

"I noticed the stock market went up very substantially after we announced it," he told FBN's "Mornings with Maria" program.

Asked about the possibility of Europeans ⁠selling U.S. stocks and bonds, he added: "If they do, they do. ‍But if that would happen, there would be a big retaliation on our part, ‌and ‌we have all the cards."

Trump began floating the idea of acquiring Greenland after taking office last year but stepped up his rhetoric in recent weeks, threatening a 10% tariff on eight European countries over the weekend ⁠that shook investors.

He continued ⁠his push ​in a more than hour-long speech at Davos on Wednesday before meeting with the head of NATO and announcing plans for a new deal that has yet ‍to be defined.

Asked on Thursday what he was willing to pay for the semi-autonomous territory, he added: "We're going to not have to pay anything other than the fact ​that we are building the Golden Dome."

Trump ‍said any deal would allow "total access" to Greenland, including for the military: "We're getting everything we want ​at no cost".</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 14:32:19 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/INFRSS4Z7VOALKJRIH773MJOP4.jpg?auth=fbb3c7155f86b6148cd28f95394df011f8a6208e5cd41b9ac1966d4d64100512&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UN says 35 million Nigerians risk hunger after global funding collapse</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/un-says-35-million-nigerians-risk-hunger-after-global-funding-collapse-2026-01-22/</link><description>ABUJA, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Nearly 35 million Nigerians are at risk of hunger this year, including 3 million children facing severe malnutrition, the United Nations said on Thursday, following the collapse of global aid budgets .

Speaking at the launch of the 2026 humanitarian plan in Abuja, UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator Mohamed Malick Fall said the long-dominant, foreign-led aid model in Nigeria is no longer sustainable and that Nigeria's needs have grown.

Conditions in the conflict-hit northeast are dire, Fall said, with civilians in Borno, Adamawa and Yobe states facing rising violence. A surge in suicide bombings and widespread attacks killed more than 4,000 people in the first eight months of 2025, matching the toll for all of 2023, he said.

The UN can only aim to deliver $516 million to provide lifesaving aid to 2.5 million people this year, down from 3.6 million in 2025, which in turn was about half the previous year's level.

"These are not statistics. These numbers represent lives, futures and Nigerians," Fall said.

He also said the UN had no choice but to focus on "the most lifesaving" interventions given the drop in available funding.

Shortfalls last year led the World Food Programme to also warn that millions could go hungry in Nigeria as its resources ran out in December and it was forced to cut support for more than 300,000 children.

Fall said Nigeria was showing growing national ownership of the crisis response in recent months through measures such as local funding for lean-season food support and early-warning action on flooding.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 14:32:27 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/527G7GNVHVOJJAL7EUTKZY3GDQ.jpg?auth=a2bc4a448e89775ada712fee4609e4ff198294beea61e2664dec4a4a2275ca78&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Germany to expel Russian diplomat over espionage accusations</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/germany-expel-russian-diplomat-over-espionage-accusations-2026-01-22/</link><description>FRANKFURT, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Germany is expelling a member of Russia's diplomatic service because the person was involved in espionage, Germany's foreign minister said on Thursday.

"I'm not scared," 73-year-old Ringsted said, standing beside one of his two chest freezers packed with reindeer meat, halibut, cod, redfish, and seal meat in his home in the Kapisillit settlement in the Nuuk fjord.

"I have enough food here for more than a year."

Ringsted, who no longer hunts due to health issues, depends on family and friends to deliver fish and meat from the Nuuk fjord. Supply chains in remote parts of Greenland are vulnerable to sudden weather changes, and the local grocery store in his settlement is restocked just once a week with basic necessities.

On Wednesday, Greenland's government issued updated recommendations for crisis preparedness, advising residents to keep five days' worth of water and food, as well as access to hunting weapons, ammunition, and fishing gear.

That same day Trump abruptly stepped back from threats to impose tariffs on key European allies as leverage to seize Greenland, ruled out using force and said a deal was in sight to end the dispute over the Danish territory. He said on Thursday the details of the agreement were still being worked out.

For many Greenlanders, self-sufficiency has long been integral to daily life.

Aslak Wilhelm Jensen, 50, who keeps three chest freezers full of fish and meat at his home in Nuuk, expressed little concern about food security or Trump's remarks as he worked aboard his small fishing boat at the bottom of the Nuuk fjord.

"Fish are all around here, there are seals right over there, the area is teeming with reindeer," Jensen said. "You're not really afraid of dying of hunger if someone comes and takes over your land."

Denmark, which holds sovereignty over Greenland, has promoted modernisation and urbanisation since the 1950s, often shifting locals away from traditional pursuits of hunting and fishing. However, many Greenlanders continue to balance modern occupations with skills honed over generations.

Jensen, who had caught 900 kilograms of cod the day before, emphasized a worldview shaped by surviving in a rugged environment.

"We're not the kind of people who go into complete panic when we hear something is happening out in the world," he said.

"Us Greenlanders, we relax when we have food on the table," added Jensen. "We live with the animals as neighbours."

Greenlanders have long been adapted to harsh weather conditions, isolation, and unreliable supply chains. Stocked freezers and self-reliance aren't considered "doomsday prepping" but a way of life.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 15:32:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/MGXYLK3OKBJ4LHRCJXY2IA7HMA.jpg?auth=1f989ad98c0b1185f09bbda1bf01434bbc12968554155cd57ae5098c9bf3b040&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Elizabeth Hurley tells UK court she endured 'brutal invasion of privacy'</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/elizabeth-hurley-tells-uk-court-she-endured-brutal-invasion-privacy-2026-01-22/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 22 (Reuters) - A tearful Elizabeth Hurley said her landlines and home was bugged as part of a "brutal invasion of privacy" to produce stories, as the actor gave evidence to the High Court in London as part of high-profile privacy lawsuit against the Daily Mail.

Hurley, 60, is one of seven claimants, including Prince Harry and singer Elton John, suing the Mail's publisher Associated Newspapers for alleged privacy violations dating from the early 1990s to the 2010s.

Associated, which also publishes the Mail on Sunday, has called the allegations against it "preposterous smears".

Hurley, the claimants' second witness, is suing over 15 stories which she says featured information obtained unlawfully, including medical details about her pregnancy with son Damian and arguments with his late father, Steve Bing.

While she gave forceful responses to some questions, at times she clutched a tissue to her face and wiped away tears during cross-examination from Associated lawyer Antony White.

Watching on in court was Harry, who appeared in the witness box himself on Wednesday and was sitting next to her son Damian, supportively patting his back when she became emotional.

Hurley rejected suggestions that her friends, including Elton John's husband David Furnish, had passed on information to the press.

She said her phones had been bugged and microphones attached to windows in her house "listening to all my conversations".

"It was deeply hurtful," she said. In her written witness statement, she said her discovery in 2020 about this "brutal invasion of privacy" had left her crushed.

Much of White's questioning centred on whether Hurley could have known about her claims against the Mail sooner, with the publisher arguing that the lawsuits had been filed too late.

She said she first learned about phone hacking from her ex-boyfriend, the actor Hugh Grant, in 2015 when he told her that she could launch a claim against another newspaper group, Mirror Group Newspapers.

She told the court she gave all the damages she won from MGN, 350,000 pounds ($469,770), to 'Hacked Off', a press reform campaign group Grant supports, but said she never really had any "grown-up conversations" with him about the issue.

"Sometimes he tried to tell me but I'm afraid I didn't really listen," she said. "We are just silly together ... maybe I'm not a very good friend."

The investigation was launched after the Spanish government disclosed in 2022 that NSO's spyware had been used to spy on members of the Spanish cabinet, sparking a political crisis that led to the resignation of the country's spy chief.

Officials did not clarify whether domestic or foreign entities were linked to the espionage, whose targets included Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez and several ministers.

Investigating judge Jose Luis Calama said he was unable to advance the probe into the alleged spying on politicians because a lack of response to requests for information from Israel meant there was no identifiable suspect.

NSO has always denied wrongdoing, saying the software, which it licences to governments after Israeli government approval, is intended to fight crime and protect national security and that it cannot monitor how it is used. Israel says its role is limited to export licences rather than day-to-day operations. The Israeli government and NSO did not immediately reply to requests for comment.

Calama had previously closed the investigation in 2023, also citing a lack of cooperation from Israeli authorities. He reopened it in 2024 following details provided by France regarding its own probe into Pegasus' use in 2021 to target reporters, lawyers, public figures, and French government and political officials.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 15:32:16 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/2VOCC74WJRPQXCYHH4RO3F5QPQ.jpg?auth=434b9e99d99d5487a4ac9dc26441677c86ecf5b87e07c36549f2947619c1b1c9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Mozambique counts 13 dead in floods so far but toll expected to rise</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/mozambique-counts-13-dead-floods-so-far-toll-expected-rise-2026-01-22/</link><description>MAPUTO, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Mozambique authorities on Thursday reported 13 deaths from severe floods over the past two weeks, though the figure is expected to rise sharply, with aid workers saying they expect more bodies to be found as waters recede.

The country has been hit with heavy rains that caused rivers and dams to overflow, submerging towns and affecting more than half a million people . Parts of neighbouring South Africa were also flooded .

Rain had subsided in some areas by Thursday. Some buildings in the capital Maputo were submerged to their rooftops, and the city was cut off from the rest of the country due to flooding on a major national highway, making areas inaccessible.

"I won't give up," shopkeeper Justino Zita said, wading through the brown water that had flooded his shop and destroyed his livelihood in Maputo. "We won't give up but we will have difficulty."

Mary Louise Eagleton, representative of the United Nations children's agency (UNICEF) in Mozambique, said she expected the toll of dead and wounded to rise.

"We expect that a large proportion of those who have been swept away or killed by the floods are children," she told Reuters.

Officials describe the flooding as the worst since at least 2000, when around 700 people were killed in Mozambique.

Early-warning systems and mandatory evacuations could mean fewer people may have been killed this time, said Paulo Tomas, spokesperson for the National Institute for Disaster Risk Management.

"Many people complied by voluntarily leaving the most affected areas," he said. But he said the lower death toll counted so far may also be partly a result of "limited access to some areas and the fact that several zones remain submerged".</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 15:32:19 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ZCUEXB4KHNP3PANIFKPDN3PHNA.jpg?auth=2c003796414fdd8464be8cdabc2332a99c626e0847cee0b54fc09e706a5ee5a3&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>French navy intercepts sanctioned Russian tanker in Mediterranean, Macron says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/french-navy-intercepts-sanctioned-russian-tanker-mediterranean-macron-says-2026-01-22/</link><description>PARIS, Jan 22 (Reuters) - The French navy intercepted a sanctioned Russian tanker in the Mediterranean on Thursday, French President Emmanuel Macron said on X.

The vessel was subject to international sanctions and suspected of operating under a false flag, he said.

The move came a day after Ecuador's President Daniel Noboa said his government would impose a 30% "security charge" on goods from Colombia, starting on February 1, citing a trade deficit and a lack of cooperation on fighting drug trafficking.

Colombia, which has repeatedly denied accusations it is not doing enough to tackle drug smuggling, is an important exporter of power to its South American neighbor. Noboa's government later said the measure included exceptions for the sale of electricity and oil logistics services.

In response to Bogota's tariff announcement on Thursday, Ecuador's energy minister said Colombian crude being transported on the OCP pipeline - Ecuador's second-largest - would have "the reciprocity given in the case of electricity". She gave no further details on what that would mean in practice.

Ecuador's trade deficit with Colombia totaled $838 million in the first 10 months of last year, according to Ecuador's central bank.

Colombia shipped $1.67 billion worth of goods to its neighbor in the first 11 months of last year, according to statistics agency DANE, representing 3.6% of total exports.

"The collaboration with the armed forces of Ecuador is tight," Colombian President Gustavo Petro wrote on X Wednesday, adding that Colombia had seized 200 metric tons of cocaine on the two countries' shared border.

"I hope Ecuador has been grateful, when they have needed us, that we have acted energetically in solidarity."

His government was willing to expand joint efforts with Ecuador to fight fentanyl trafficking, he said.

Posting on X overnight, Colombia's commerce and industry ministry said the 30% tariff was "proportional, transitory and revisable" and is meant to restore balance in trade relations following Ecuador's "security charge" decision. It added that Colombia remained open to dialogue.

In its announcement, it did not say what products were covered under the tariff. Colombia's leading imports from Ecuador are fish, vegetable oil and auto parts.

Colombia's energy ministry later said it had issued a resolution suspending "international transactions of electricity with Ecuador".

It did not link the decision to Ecuador's trade measures, instead calling it "a preventative measure to guarantee internal supply in the face of climate variability."

"When adequate technical, energy and commercial conditions exist, exports will be reactivated," the ministry added.

Colombia Energy Minister Edwin Palma had previously criticized Ecuador's actions and on Wednesday cancelled a recent initiative to allow private firms to take part in energy sales between the countries.

Noboa, a close ally of U.S. President Donald Trump, has made the fight against criminal gangs a cornerstone of his administration, aligning Ecuador with one of the White House's main policy priorities in South America.

He has declared several states of emergency and recently mobilized over 10,000 soldiers to tackle organized crime. The government has said turf wars between splintered gangs caused murder rates to soar 30% last year.

Trump has, meanwhile, pressured Colombia, as well as Mexico, over drug trafficking, both before and after U.S. forces captured Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro, whom the White House called a "narco-dictator", earlier this month.

Accused of failing to stop the flow of cocaine to the U.S., which he denied, Colombia's Petro was sanctioned by the U.S. last year. But tensions eased in January, following a cordial phone call between Petro and Trump.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 15:32:27 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/QAFQH3B3C5PNHFBSEKGICWGTVA.jpg?auth=9467d85a85d5141ce5acf0d0e791cc6cfec81adbd495e0c851c9e0df5b626a37&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'We will let nothing pass': France intercepts Russia-linked oil tanker in Mediterranean</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260122-we-will-let-nothing-pass-france-intercepts-russia-linked-oil-tanker-in-mediterranean</link><description>France 's navy, with the help of allies, on Thursday boarded a tanker alleged to be from Russia 's sanction-busting "shadow fleet" in the Mediterranean, President Emmanuel Macron said.

"This morning, the French Navy boarded and searched an oil tanker from Russia, subject to international sanctions and suspected of flying a false flag," he said on X.

"The operation was carried out on the high seas in the Mediterranean, with the support of several of our allies," he added, saying the vessel had been "diverted".

"We will let nothing pass," said Macron.

"The activities of the shadow fleet help finance the war of aggression against Ukraine ," he added.

Local maritime authorities said the navy seized an oil tanker called "Grinch" between Spain and Morocco .

"After the team boarded, an examination of documents confirmed the doubts as to the regularity of the flag," the Mediterranean Maritime Prefecture said.

The ship "is currently being escorted by the national navy to a point of anchorage for further verifications", it added.

“We are determined to uphold international law and to ensure the effective enforcement of sanctions," Macron said in a post about the interception, with a photo showing a French helicopter hovering over a ship.

Western countries have slapped sanctions on a number of oil tankers accused of transporting Russian oil in defiance of sanctions imposed by the US, EU and UK following Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 15:32:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/255104b0-f7a4-11f0-b33c-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/G-ReuMSXcAAKVfj.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Key US allies keep their distance as Trump launches 'Board of Peace' initiative for Gaza</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260122-donald-trump-launches-board-of-peace-initiative-for-gaza-as-key-us-allies-stay-away</link><description>US President Donald Trump on Thursday inaugurated his Board of Peace to lead efforts at maintaining a ceasefire in Israel's war with Hamas , insisting that “everyone wants to be a part” of the body that could eventually rival the United Nations – despite many US allies opting not to participate.

In a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Trump sought to create momentum for a project to map out a future of the war-torn Gaza Strip that has been overshadowed this week, first by his threats to seize Greenland , then by a dramatic retreat from that push.

“This isn’t the United States, this is for the world,” he said, adding, “I think we can spread it out to other things as we succeed in Gaza.”

The event featured Ali Shaath, the head of a future "technocratic" government in Gaza, announcing that the Rafah border crossing will open in both directions next week. That's after Israel said in early December it would open the crossing, which runs between Gaza and Egypt , but has yet to do so.

Shaath, an engineer and former Palestinian Authority official from Gaza, is overseeing the Palestinian committee set to govern the territory under US supervision.

The new peace board was initially envisioned as a small group of world leaders overseeing the ceasefire, but it has morphed into something far more ambitious – and scepticism about its membership and mandate has led some countries usually closest to Washington to take a pass.

Trump tried not to let those not participating ruin his unveiling party, saying 59 countries had signed onto the board – even though heads of state, top diplomats and other officials from only 19 countries plus the US actually attended. He told the group, ranging from Azerbaijan to Paraguay to Hungary , “You’re the most powerful people in the world."

Trump has spoken about the board replacing some UN functions and perhaps even making that entire body obsolete one day. But he was more conciliatory in his remarks on the sidelines of the forum in the Swiss alps.

“We’ll do it in conjunction with the United Nations,” Trump said, even as he denigrated the UN for doing what he said wasn't enough to calm some conflicts around the globe.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that some countries’ leaders have indicated they plan to join but still require approval from their parliaments, and the Trump administration says it has also gotten queries about membership from countries that hadn’t been invited to participate yet.

Big questions remain, however, about what the eventual board will look like.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said his country is still consulting with Moscow’s “strategic partners” before deciding to commit. The Russian president on Thursday is due to host Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas for talks in Moscow .

Others are asking why Putin and other authoritarian leaders had even been invited to join. Britain’s foreign secretary, Yvette Cooper, said her country wasn't signing on “because this is about a legal treaty that raises much broader issues”.

“And we do also have concerns about President Putin being part of something which is talking about peace, when we have still not seen any signs from Putin that there will be a commitment to peace in Ukraine ,” she told the BBC.

Norway and Sweden have indicated they won’t participate, after France also said no. French officials stressed that while they support the Gaza peace plan, they were concerned the board could seek to replace the UN as the main venue for resolving conflicts.

Canada, Ukraine, China and the executive arm of the European Union also haven't committed. Trump calling off the steep tariffs he threatened over Greenland could ease some allies' reluctance, but the issue is still far from settled.

The Kremlin said Thursday that Putin plans to discuss his proposal to send $1 billion to the Board of Peace and use it for humanitarian purposes during his talks with Abbas. But it noted that the use of those assets will require the US action to unblock them.

The idea for the Board of Peace was first laid out in Trump's 20-point Gaza ceasefire plan and even was endorsed by the UN Security Council .

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced he’s agreed to join, after his office has earlier criticised the makeup of the board’s committee tasked with overseeing Gaza.

Months into the ceasefire, Gaza’s more than 2 million Palestinians continue to suffer the humanitarian crisis unleashed by more than two years of war. And violence in Gaza, while not at the same level as before the October ceasefire and hostage deal was agreed on, continues.

Key to the truce continuing to hold is the disarming of Hamas, something that the militant group that has controlled the Palestinian territory since 2007 has refused to do and that Israel sees as non-negotiable. Trump on Thursday repeated his frequently mentioned warnings that the group will have to do so or face dire consequences.

He also said the war in Gaza “is really coming to an end” while conceding, “We have little fires that we'll put out. But they're little,” and they had been “giant, giant, massive fires.”

Trump's push for peace also comes after he threatened military action this month against Iran as it carried out a violent crackdown against some of the largest street protests in years, killing thousands of people.

Trump, for the time being, has signalled he won't carry out any new strikes on Iran after he said he received assurances that the Islamic government would not carry out the planned hangings of more than 800 protesters.

But Trump also made the case that his tough approach to Tehran – including strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities in June last year – was critical to the Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal coalescing.

Iran was Hamas's most important patron, providing the group hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid, weapons, training and financial support over the years.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 15:32:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/d448bb3e-f79a-11f0-9260-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26022400748847.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US envoy calls for Syria truce to be upheld</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-envoy-calls-syria-truce-be-upheld-2026-01-22/</link><description>DAMASCUS, Jan 22 (Reuters) - A U.S. envoy called for a truce between the Syrian government and Kurdish-led forces to be upheld, urging steps to build trust after Damascus captured swathes of the northeast in a push to reassert central authority.

Tensions between President Ahmed al-Sharaa's government and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) spilled into conflict this month as the SDF resisted government demands for its fighters and enclaves to be integrated into the state.

Under a ceasefire announced on Tuesday, the government gave the SDF four days to come up with a plan for its remaining enclaves to merge, and said government troops would not enter two remaining SDF-held cities if an agreement could be reached.

U.S. envoy Tom Barrack said he met SDF commander Mazloum Abdi and leading Syrian Kurdish politician Ilham Ahmed on Thursday, and reaffirmed U.S. support for an integration process set out in a January 18 agreement.

"All parties agreed that the essential first step is the full upholding of the current ceasefire, as we collectively identify and implement confidence-building measures on all sides to foster trust and lasting stability," he wrote on X.

The SDF, dominated by the Kurdish YPG militia, and the government have accused each other of violating the ceasefire since Tuesday.

The SDF was once Washington's closest ally in Syria but its position has been weakened as President Donald Trump has deepened ties with Sharaa. Barrack said on Tuesday the original purpose of the SDF had largely expired.

The SDF has now fallen back to Kurdish-majority areas.

Abdi also met Nechirvan Barzani, president of Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurdistan Region, on Thursday. Iraqi Kurdish politician Wafa Mohammed of Barzani's Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) said the meeting had been convened at the request of the Iraqi Kurdish leadership to discuss the SDF's deal with Sharaa.

"There is strong U.S. and international pressure on the Syrian Democratic Forces to end the disputes and implement the agreement, but that does not necessarily mean the U.S. pressure will lead to a positive outcome. The problem is that the SDF does not trust the promises made by (Sharaa)," Wafa Mohammed told Reuters.

A second Iraqi Kurdish source close to the meeting said talks would also focus on a proposal for both sides to withdraw forces by around 10 km (6 miles) from the outskirts of Hasakah city, which is ethnically mixed and still in SDF hands.

The territories seized by the Syrian government from SDF control in recent days have included Syria's biggest oil fields, agricultural land, and jails holding Islamic State prisoners.

The SDF, which once held a quarter or more of Syria, has sought to preserve a high degree of autonomy for areas under its control, expressing concern that the Islamist-led government in Damascus aims to dominate the country, despite Sharaa's promises to protect the rights of all Syrians.

A Syrian foreign ministry official said the government had preferred a political solution from the outset, and continued to, adding the rights of Kurds were guaranteed and they would not be marginalized as they had been under the ousted President Bashar al-Assad.

All "options were on the table", the official told Reuters, speaking on the condition of anonymity, urging the YPG to "heed the voice of reason and come to the negotiating table".</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 16:38:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/J47EGMADIBL6BJJO6M6XMV5DGY.jpg?auth=00b0155cca9e6444dba600862edc04b83acbbf241fecbd9911634cc3a353a25e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Finnish president aims to ready plan for Arctic security by NATO July summit</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/finnish-president-aims-ready-plan-arctic-security-by-nato-july-summit-2026-01-22/</link><description>DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Finnish President Alexander Stubb said on Thursday he wants a plan to bolster Arctic security to be ready by a NATO summit in Turkey in July after the United States announced a framework deal to de-escalate a row over Greenland's future.

Earlier, President Donald Trump said he had secured total and permanent U.S. access to Greenland in a deal with NATO, whose head said allies would have to step up their commitment to Arctic security to ward off threats from Russia and China.

The deal came as Trump dropped threats to impose tariffs on eight European allies over their stance on Greenland and ruled out taking the vast, mineral-rich island by force.

Stubb said he wanted a package of measures to be put together to boost Arctic security that would be "not dissimilar" to a deal agreed in The Hague last June, when NATO leaders backed a big rise in defence spending, as demanded by Trump.

"In an ideal world, we would have something ready by the NATO summit in Ankara," Stubb told Reuters on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.

Stubb said that a more robust Arctic security architecture should draw on closer cooperation between NATO's Scandinavian members - Sweden, Finland, Norway, Denmark and Iceland - plus the United States and Canada.

Trump's threat last weekend to impose tariffs on European countries that opposed his ambition to acquire Greenland has rattled European capitals, and EU leaders are meeting in Brussels later on Thursday for emergency talks on the issue.

Stubb said he was confident that the EU leaders would maintain a united front on Greenland, and he underlined that it was especially important for the views of Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen to be heard.

Greenland is an autonomous region of the kingdom of Denmark.

Trump has argued that only the U.S. can ensure the security of Greenland in the face of what he says are Chinese and Russian ambitions in the Arctic. But his bellicose approach has threatened to blow apart the NATO alliance and reignite a trade war with Europe.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 16:38:42 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/GLIE3QHO7ZJJXBJSAMUH7VEB6M.jpg?auth=542ed964f5f6025ab30e6ec1276923d27a6046986771e5ccf9d3689a18690464&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Transatlantic relationship is not about 'harming each other,' German finmin says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/davos/transatlantic-relationship-is-not-about-harming-each-other-german-finmin-says-2026-01-22/</link><description>DAVOS, Jan 22 (Reuters) - German Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil, speaking on Thursday in Davos, opposed an escalation of tensions between the United States and Europe amid new tariffs threats .

"The transatlantic relationship is not about harming each other," Klingbeil said.

The minister pushed back against calls for financial retaliation after reports that a Danish pension fund had sold U.S. government bonds.

"This is absolutely not about breaking with the Americans or dissolving the relationship," the minister said in Davos.

Europe was strong and had options, he said, but its aim was not escalation.

Speaking to reporters at the World Economic Forum after meetings with investors, the minister said the world was in upheaval and long-standing alliances were being tested, but added that many countries and regions were seeking closer cooperation with Germany and Europe.

Regarding the Greenland dispute, the minister said it was "good that people are talking" but cautioned against drawing conclusions before any arrangement was available "in black and white."

He said threats of military force and any attempt to make Greenland part of the United States were unacceptable to Europe, while signalling willingness to discuss legitimate security interests within NATO.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 16:39:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/Y2LUGX36NNJZ7EUZ4XZXSX5WSM.jpg?auth=a946b199223da57553649773f6bce27fb3da9b923655154028c44ad14333d353&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ryan Coogler's Jim Crow-era vampire film 'Sinners' makes Hollywood history with 16 Oscar nominations</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/culture/20260122-coogler-sinners-makes-hollywood-history-with-16-oscar-nominations</link><description>Ryan Coogler’s blues-steeped vampire epic “Sinners” led all films with 16 nominations to the 98th Academy Awards on Thursday, setting a record for the most in Oscar history.

Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences voters showered “Sinners” with more nominations than they had ever bestowed before, breaking the 14-nomination mark set by “All About Eve”, “Titanic” and “La La Land”. Along with best picture, Coogler was nominated for best director and best screenplay, and double-duty star Michael B. Jordan – who plays a pair of twins – was rewarded with his first Oscar nomination, for best actor.

Paul Thomas Anderson’s father-daughter revolutionary saga “One Battle After Another,” the favourite coming into nominations, trailed in second with 13 of its own. Four of its actors – Leonardo DiCaprio , Teyana Taylor, Benicio del Toro and Sean Penn – were nominated, though newcomer Chase Infiniti was left out in best actress.

In those two top nominees, the film academy put its full force behind a pair of visceral and bracingly original American epics that each connected with a fraught national moment. Coogler’s Jim Crow-era film – the rare horror movie to win the academy’s favour – conjures a mythical allegory of Black life. In “One Battle After Another,” a dormant spirit of rebellion is revived in an out-of-control police state.

Both are also Warner Bros. titles. In the midst of a contentious sale to Netflix, the 102-year-old studio had one of its best Oscar nominations mornings ever.

As the fate of Warner Bros., which Netflix is buying for $72 billion, hangs in the balance amid a challenge from Paramount Skydance, Hollywood is bracing for potentially the largest realignment in the film industry’s history.

The 10 films nominated for best picture are “Bugonia”, “F1”, “Frankenstein”, “Hamnet”, “Marty Supreme”, “One Battle After Another”, “The Secret Agent”, “Sentimental Value”, “Sinners” and “Train Dreams”.

Guillermo del Toro’s “Frankenstein”, Josh Safdie’s “Marty Supreme” and Joachim Trier’s “Sentimental Value” all scored nine nominations.

The nine for “Marty Supreme” included a third best actor nod for 30-year-old Timothée Chalamet, the favourite in the category he narrowly missed winning last year for his portrayal of Bob Dylan in “A Complete Unknown”. With Jordan and Chalamet, the nominees are Leonardo DiCaprio for “One Battle After Another”, Ethan Hawke for “Blue Moon” and Wagner Moura for “The Secret Agent”.

Nominated for best actress was the category favourite, Jessie Buckley (“Hamnet”), along with Rose Byrne (“If I Had Legs I’d Kick You”), Kate Hudson (“Song Sung Blue”), Renate Reinsve (“Sentimental Value”) and two-time winner Emma Stone, who landed her sixth nomination, for “Bugonia.”

The year’s most-watched movie, with more than half a billion views on Netflix , “KPop Demon Hunters,” scored nominations for both best song (“Golden”) and best animated feature. Sony Pictures developed and produced the film, but, after selling it to Netflix, watched it become a worldwide sensation.

Blockbusters otherwise had a difficult morning. Universal Pictures’ “Wicked: For Good” was shut out entirely. While “Avatar: Fire and Ash” notched nominations for costume design and visual effects, it became the first “Avatar” film not nominated for best picture.

The biggest box-office hit nominated for Hollywood's top award instead was “F1”, an Apple production that landed four nominations. The streamer partnered with Warner Bros. to distribute the racing drama.

This year, the Oscars are introducing a new category for casting. That new honour helped “Sinners” and “One Battle After Another” pad their already impressive stats. Along with those two films, the nominees are “Hamnet”, “Marty Supreme” and “The Secret Agent”.

The academy, which has expanded its overseas membership in recent years, also continued its tilt toward international films. Every category included one international nominee. For the eighth year in the row, a non-English-language film was nominated for best picture. More non-English performances were nominated than ever before.

The top nominee of them all was Joachim Trier's Norwegian family drama “Sentimental Value”. The film cleaned up in the supporting actor categories, with nods for Stellan Skarsgard, Inga Ibsdotter LilIeaas and Elle Fanning. Also nominated for best supporting actress, in addition to Taylor: Amy Madigan for “Weapons” and Wunmi Mosaku for “Sinners”. In supporting actor, the nominees included Jacob Elordi for “Frankenstein” and, in a surprise that likely dislodged Paul Mescal of “Hamnet”, Delroy Lindo for “Sinners.”

A competitive best international feature category mirrored the turbulent state of the world. That included the Iranian revenge drama and Palme d'Or winner “It Was Just an Accident”, by the often-imprisoned filmmaker Jafar Panahi . He's spoken passionately against the ongoing crackdown of demonstrators in his home country. France nominated the film.

Also nominated: the Tunisian entry “The Voice of Hind Rajab”, about volunteers at the Palestine Red Crescent Society; the Brazilian political thriller “The Secret Agent”; the apocalyptic Spanish road movie “Sirat” and “Sentimental Value.”

The 98th Academy Awards will take place on March 15 at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles and will be televised live on ABC and Hulu. YouTube 's new deal to exclusively air won't take effect until 2029. This year, Conan O’Brien will return as host.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 16:40:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/da6ba600-f7a6-11f0-b495-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26022480008831.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Zelensky says US 'security guarantees' for Ukraine ready after meeting with Trump</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260122-zelensky-says-us-security-guarantees-ready-after-meeting-with-trump</link><description>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Thursday blasted the EU's lack of "political will" in countering Russian leader Vladimir Putin , during a fiery address criticising some of Kyiv 's top allies at the World Economic Forum .

The speech to the Davos elite came minutes after Zelensky had met with US President Donald Trump , a conversation which he said brought agreement about what post-war US security guarantees for Ukraine would look like.

Zelensky did not say what the security guarantees included, only that they were "done" and were ready to be signed by the leaders and ratified by the Ukrainian parliament and US Congress .

But in a marked departure from his usual warm rhetoric towards the EU, Kyiv's main political and financial backers, Zelensky slammed what he cast as inaction, drawing parallels with the cult film "Groundhog Day" to describe the slow progress on key areas of support for Kyiv.

"What's missing: time or political will?" he said at one point, referencing delays over the establishment of a European war crimes tribunal on the Russian invasion.

He also said Europe , without mentioning any single country, was failing to agree on how to address global problems.

"There are endless internal arguments and things left unsaid that stop Europe from uniting and speaking honestly enough to find real solutions," Zelensky told the forum.

"Instead of becoming a truly global power, Europe remains a beautiful but fragmented kaleidoscope of small and middle powers," he added.

He said Europe looked "lost" over how to deal with the challenge presented by Trump.

"Europe looks lost trying to convince the US president to change. But he will not change. President Trump loves who he is, and he says he loves Europe, but he will not listen to this kind of Europe," he said.

Trump had hailed a "good" meeting with Zelensky in the Swiss ski resort, hours before his envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner were due in Moscow for talks with Putin.

"This war has to end," Trump told reporters when asked what message he was sending to the Russian leader.

Zelensky said the question of territory was the one outstanding issue in the talks to find an end to the war.

"It's all about the eastern part of our country. It's all about the land. This is the issue which we (have) not solved yet."

Russia, which occupies around 20 percent of Ukraine, is pushing for full control of the country's eastern Donbas region as part of a deal – but Kyiv has warned ceding ground will embolden Moscow.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 17:29:44 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/0c4a55c8-f7b0-11f0-aa71-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/7e206cc8399b1bbe325aabfd4506becf1ebb7cbd.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Zelenskiy tells Europe: have courage to finally 'act now'</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/davos/zelenskiy-tells-europe-have-courage-finally-act-now-2026-01-22/</link><description>KYIV, Jan 22 (Reuters) - President Volodymyr Zelenskiy criticised Europe on Thursday as a "fragmented kaleidoscope of small and middle powers" lacking courage to act decisively and facing a dark future unless it stood up to U.S. and Russian power.

In some of his toughest remarks to key allies of Kyiv, Zelenskiy urged Europe not to "degrade" itself by failing to stand up to Russian aggression and U.S. President Donald Trump's aspiration to control Greenland.

"Europe can and must be a global force," he told global leaders at the World Economic Forum in Davos as Russia's war in Ukraine neared its four-year mark.

"Not one that reacts late, but one that defines the future."

Zelenskiy, who for years has rallied often reluctant European allies against Russia, repeated calls for Europe to create its own united armed forces and to use frozen Russian financial assets to support Ukraine.

He spoke after meeting Trump in Davos for talks on ending the war which both leaders described as positive. But he urged European leaders to be more robust in defending democratic values in their region, as U.S. attention turns away.

"Instead of taking the lead in defending freedom worldwide, especially when America's focus shifts elsewhere, Europe looks lost trying to convince the U.S. president to change," Zelenskiy said in his fiery speech.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 17:56:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HQ2QJHWYVFIHDMRQYSOVRCNEAI.jpg?auth=3c6761955ffc600e803d52d5982099909a46bbc56d22d0090f5915abbfec5e0d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Half of all Sudanese children not in education due to civil war, says aid group</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/half-all-sudanese-children-not-education-due-civil-war-says-aid-group-2026-01-22/</link><description>GENEVA, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Around half of all school-age children in Sudan, or more than eight million, are no longer in education because of the country's civil war, in one of the world's worst education crises, Save The Children said in a report on Thursday.

"Right now the international community is failing the children of Sudan," Inger Ashing, the CEO of Save the Children International, one of the largest charities operating in the country, told reporters in a video-link briefing from Stockholm.

The report said more than eight million Sudanese children had missed about 500 days of education since the civil war began in April 2023.

"That is more than any child missed during the COVID pandemic," Ashing said, adding that many schools had closed or been damaged during the conflict, while others were being used as shelters for displaced families.

In recent days, drone strikes have intensified in and around the city of al-Obeid, the capital of North Kordofan state in central Sudan, causing significant civilian deaths in at least two cases, residents say.

Aid groups have called for urgent assistance to provide aid to the Darfur city of al-Fashir, taken by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in October, as well as to Kadugli, another besieged city in Sudan's south. Both cities are facing famine.

More than 100,000 people are estimated to have fled al-Fashir since the RSF took control there after an 18-month siege.

Only 3% of schools are open in North Darfur, where conflict is ongoing, with areas in West Kordofan, South Darfur and West Darfur also gravely impacted, Save The Children's report said.

Some teachers have left their jobs after not being paid for months, it added.

"Without immediate funding to pay and train teachers, restore learning spaces, and provide essential learning supplies, the education system risks total breakdown," Save the Children said.

Education is a lifeline to protect children from exploitation and recruitment into armed groups, Ashing said following her visit this month to schools in Port Sudan, River Nile and Khartoum.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 17:56:48 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7QIBIKE5TFM6FOWMSITSKFWG2E.jpg?auth=d6fb207ff7886f6c3d3a151c862f0cb5a0d32c866780f0b0c0a8c35e37d8f48d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>EU must show unity on Greenland, Ukraine, Board of Peace, preserve U.S. ties</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/eu-must-show-unity-greenland-ukraine-board-peace-preserve-us-ties-2026-01-22/</link><description>BRUSSELS, Jan 22 (Reuters) - The European Union must show unity in dealing with Greenland, the Board of Peace and return to discussions on helping Ukraine, which is the main security problem for Europe, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said on Thursday.

Speaking to reporters before an emergency summit on EU relations with the United States, Tusk said Europe should be careful to preserve its ties with the U.S. but that Washington should also understand it should not try to dominate Europe.

"It is important for ...our partners in Washington to understand the difference between domination and leadership. Leadership is OK," Tusk said. "Coercion is not a good method in relation with our transatlantic partners," he said.

"I would like us to clearly confirm today that we can act as a political community on various issues, be it Greenland or the Board of Peace and primarily Ukraine, because ...it cannot be that ...the topic of Ukraine has been sidelined -- it is a key issue for the security of Europe," Tusk said

He added that Poland had expected progress on Ukraine peace talks this week at the World Economic Forum in Davos and the fact that Greenland became the key issue was bad news.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 17:56:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LLDAD5OC35LMXO3LERP3TPOROY.jpg?auth=516ab3465ab2c6cfae67c4ec10f8e3132c8dc9240280939ec425463c5510b817&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Albania, Bulgaria to join Trump's 'Board of Peace'</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/albania-bulgaria-join-trumps-board-peace-2026-01-22/</link><description>TIRANA, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Albanian lawmakers on Thursday approved a government decision to join the "Board of Peace" initiative launched by U.S. President Donald Trump to resolve global conflicts.

Prime Minister Edi Rama called the move “an act of goodwill” and "a special honour", saying it would strengthen Albania’s role on the international stage.

The legislation passed with support from 110 of the 140 deputies, and Rama argued that joining the initiative ensures Albania remains "at the table" in global diplomacy, referring to the statement by Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney in Davos.

Neighbouring Kosovo, a close ally with the U.S. which supported its independence from Serbia in 2008, also joined the Board of Peace.

Bulgaria's outgoing government has joined the treaty, a decision the parliament is expected to ratify next week. Diplomat Nikolay Mladenov, a former UN envoy, has been elected as the High Representative for Gaza at the board.

Bulgaria and Hungary are the only EU members that have joined the Board of Peace so far.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 17:56:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/TI4AQSRZ6ZMDPIMZVRFZGH55L4.jpg?auth=0b2955e38416e03764b6a784d8a7a67a4082432fc3e5e15e554ef5837d198446&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Davos-Quotes from Zelenskiy speech criticising Europe</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/davos/davos-quotes-zelenskiy-speech-criticising-europe-2026-01-22/</link><description>DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy delivered an address to world leaders in Davos on Thursday in which he chided Europe for failing to act more forcefully on the global stage and demanded more courage from Kyiv's partners.

Here are some quotes from his speech:

"We should not accept that Europe is just a salad of small and middle powers, seasoned with enemies of Europe. When united, we are truly invincible."

"Instead of becoming a truly global power, Europe remains a beautiful but fragmented kaleidoscope of small and middle powers. Instead of taking the lead in defending freedom worldwide, especially when America's focus shifts elsewhere, Europe looks lost, trying to convince the U.S. president to change."

"Europe needs strength. For that, we must act together - and act in time. And most of all, we must have the courage to act."

"Without action now, there is no tomorrow. Let's end this 'Groundhog Day'."

"Because if Europe is not seen as a global force, if its actions don't scare bad actors, then Europe will always be reacting – catching up with new dangers and attacks."

"But when you refuse to help people fighting for freedom, the consequences return – and they're always negative."

"Why can (U.S.) President (Donald) Trump stop tankers from the 'shadow fleet' and seize oil – but Europe doesn't?"

"Russian oil is being transported right along European shores. That oil funds the war against Ukraine. That oil helps destabilize Europe. So Russian oil must be stopped and confiscated and sold for Europe's benefit. Why not?"

"There were different opinions, but the fact remains: (Venezuela's former President Nicolas) Maduro is on trial in New York. Sorry, but (Russian President Vladimir) Putin is not on trial."

"Everyone turned attention to Greenland. And it's clear – most leaders simply are not sure what to do about it."

"And if you send 30 or 40 soldiers to Greenland – what is that for? What message does it send? What's the message to Putin? To China? And even more importantly, what message does it send to Denmark – the most important – your close ally?"

"If Russian warships are sailing freely around Greenland, Ukraine can help – we have the expertise and weapons to ensure not one of those ships remains. They can sink near Greenland just as they do near Crimea."

"Europe still remains in 'Greenland mode'. Maybe … Someday … Someone will do something."</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 17:57:02 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/GTOEFTIDVZL7VEMLMJBNZN5AFE.jpg?auth=4cde3e5f98f42e06571b50021f512bf039e0b60f86fa8bbbc0651e6695754333&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Austrian ex-intelligence accused of spying for Russia goes on trial</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/austrian-ex-intelligence-accused-spying-russia-goes-trial-2026-01-22/</link><description>VIENNA, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Austrian former intelligence officer Egisto Ott went on trial on Thursday, accused of helping Russia hunt down opponents and selling it government phones and secure laptops at the behest of fugitive former Wirecard executive Jan Marsalek .

Ott's is the biggest spying case in Austria since a retired army colonel was convicted in 2020 of having spied for Moscow for decades. Ott, 63, denies the charges, which include supporting a foreign intelligence agency to the detriment of Austria, and pleaded not guilty.

The trial could shed light on Russian intelligence-gathering in Europe, and provide more details on Marsalek's alleged spying operations across the continent after a London court convicted three Bulgarians last year of being part of a Russian spy ring run by the Austrian fugitive.

Prosecutors accuse Ott of making unauthorised searches in police and other databases and asking counterparts in other countries to do the same in an attempt to locate people Moscow wanted to hunt down, such as Dmitry Senin, a former Russian intelligence agent who has now claimed asylum in Montenegro.

Ott, who ran undercover agents, has acknowledged saving the results of his searches in his private Gmail account or in unrelated case files of the agency he worked for, the now-defunct Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution and Counterterrorism (BVT).

Ott's lawyer Anna Mair said Ott had in fact been operating under the orders of a superior who had been contacted by an allied intelligence agency that had hoped to recruit Senin.

"He carried out or ordered these searches, but not for Russia," she told the court, adding that one witness would confirm the secret operation's existence.

Ott was "highly intelligent" and would have better covered his tracks if he had been acting illegally, she said. He later echoed that message.

"Do you really think I would do that? That I am that dumb?" Ott told the court.

Not all those Ott looked up were former Russian operatives.

One was Bulgarian journalist Christo Grozev, who worked for investigative outlet Bellingcat and led its reporting on the 2018 poisoning in Britain of Russian double agent Sergei Skripal, which Britain blames on Russia.

Moscow denies all involvement in that case and has regularly accused Western powers of trying to enflame anti-Russian hysteria.

Prosecutors said Ott provided Grozev's address in Vienna to Marsalek, who then arranged a break-in at the apartment. Grozev later moved away from Austria for security reasons when he found out he was a target.

Ott told the court he had looked up Grozev because he wanted to discuss the findings of Bellingcat's investigations with him.

Marsalek, the former chief operating officer of Wirecard, the collapsed German payments firm, is on the run and believed to be in Russia. As such, he could not be reached for comment.

The trial continues on Friday and is likely to last for months.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 17:57:08 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/TQPVKGF6DJJCDCY5UM6AVOSCCE.jpg?auth=f31133af973c43210f539e89bdb9fb50646dd67b649ce278419ebf1234e58294&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Brazil finance minister wants deputy Durigan as successor, sources say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/brazil-finance-minister-wants-deputy-durigan-successor-sources-say-2026-01-22/</link><description>BRASILIA, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Brazil's Finance Minister Fernando Haddad would like President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva to appoint his executive secretary, Dario Durigan, to succeed him once he leaves the post in coming weeks, two sources said.

For the No. 2 position that Durigan would vacate, Haddad is considering naming the current Treasury secretary, Rogerio Ceron, the sources added, in a configuration that would signal continuity in the ministry's current management.

According to the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the plans are private and still require Lula's approval, Haddad is also discussing who would lead the Treasury if that scenario is confirmed.

The finance ministry declined to comment.

Haddad said last week he intends to step down before the end of January, though no departure date has been announced.

One factor that could delay his exit is a possible trip to India with Lula from February 19–21, but the ministry has not yet received a request from the presidential palace for Haddad to join the delegation, according to a third source.

Durigan, responsible for coordinating work across the ministry's different areas, has played a key role in negotiations with Congress on economic measures and has also strengthened his relationship with Lula.

Haddad has said that after leaving the ministry he hopes to help with Lula's reelection campaign this year, though allies in the president's Workers Party (PT) also tout him as a potential candidate for the Senate or for governing the state of Sao Paulo.

He said this week he has begun discussing with Lula what role he will play in this year's general elections, but the two have yet to reach an agreement.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 18:39:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/FPAPEUJFANIYZJ46AMH7WOLBOY.jpg?auth=0a2abe9f3b1f559ee6269d77531a1a0e11dcdb1aee2c66fce2b42632a186cdc4&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>India's Modi speaks to Brazil's Lula on strategic partnership</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/indias-modi-speaks-brazils-lula-strategic-partnership-2026-01-22/</link><description>Jan 22 (Reuters) - Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Thursday he had spoken to Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and was looking forward to welcoming him to India soon.

The losses are the latest setback for the Kurds, an ethnic group that was left stateless a century ago when the borders of the modern Middle East emerged from the collapsing Ottoman Empire.

Kurdish nationalism stirred in the 1890s when the Ottoman Empire was on its last legs. The 1920 Treaty of Sevres, which imposed a colonial carve-up of Turkey after World War One, promised them independence.

Three years later, Turkish leader Mustafa Kemal Ataturk rendered that accord obsolete by winning the Turkish War of Independence. The Treaty of Lausanne, ratified in 1924, divided the Kurds among the new nations of the Middle East.

They speak a language related to Farsi and are concentrated in a mountainous region straddling the borders of Armenia, Iraq, Iran, Syria and Turkey. Kurds are mostly Sunni Muslims.

Kurds form about 10% of the Syrian population.

Under deposed President Bashar al-Assad, the Baathist state deprived thousands of them citizenship rights, banned their language and clamped down on Kurdish political activity.

As Syria descended into civil war in 2011, with Assad focused on trying to crush Sunni Arab rebels in western Syria, the Syrian Kurdish PYD group and an affiliated militia, the YPG, established self-rule in Kurdish-majority areas of the north.

The area under Kurdish control expanded as the YPG, under the umbrella of the Syrian Democratic Forces, partnered with the United States in the campaign against Islamic State.

Following Assad's ouster by Islamist rebels led by Sharaa in 2024, the Kurdish groups have aimed to preserve their autonomy, concerned that the new rulers in Damascus aim to dominate the new order.

But their hand has been weakened as Washington has built close ties to Sharaa, echoing his calls for the Kurds to integrate with Damascus.

Sharaa, who has vowed to protect the rights of all Syrian groups, issued a decree on January 16 formally recognizing Kurdish as a national language alongside Arabic, and permitting it to be taught in schools, among other steps.

Since then, government advances have forced the SDF to retreat to Kurdish-majority areas.

The PYD is heavily influenced by the ideology of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), long active in neighbouring Turkey.

Kurds form about 20% of the population of Turkey, mainly living in the southeast.

The PKK took up arms against the state in 1984, waging an insurgency, initially seeking a separate state but later moderating its goal to autonomy and greater rights for Kurds.

More than 40,000 people have been killed in the conflict.

Turkey has held PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan in prison since capturing him in 1999.

In early 2025, Turkey launched a peace process with the PKK, and Ocalan called on the PKK to lay down arms. The process has, however, somewhat stalled since then.

President Tayyip Erdogan removed restrictions on using the Kurdish language during the 2000s and early 2010s.

The United States, the European Union and Turkey classify the PKK as a terrorist organization.

Turkey's military has often struck targets in Iraq's Kurdish region near the PKK's stronghold in the Qandil mountains.

Turkey has also sent troops into northern Syria several times to counter the YPG, which Ankara deems an extension of the PKK.

Turkish officials have said recent events in Syria could kick-start the peace process in Turkey.

Kurds form 15-20% of the population, mainly inhabiting three mountainous northern provinces that make up Iraqi Kurdistan.

In the late 1980s, Iraq's authoritarian ruler Saddam Hussein targeted Iraqi Kurds with chemical gas, razed Kurdish villages and forced thousands of Kurds into camps.

After Saddam's forces were driven out of the north in the first Gulf War in 1991, Kurdish political parties gained control of Iraqi Kurdistan.

Since the U.S.-led invasion that toppled Saddam in 2003, Iraq's central government has recognised autonomy for Kurdistan, which is led by a regional government with a budget apportioned from Baghdad under a formula for dividing oil income.

When Islamic State militants swept through much of northern Iraq in 2014, Kurdish fighters exploited the collapse of central authority to expand their territory, including taking control of Kirkuk, an oil city they view as their ancient capital.

In September 2017, Iraq's Kurds held a referendum on independence, which backfired, eliciting fierce opposition from Baghdad and regional powers. The vote prompted military and economic retaliation from Baghdad, which retook Kirkuk and other disputed areas. Ties between the centre and the Kurdish regional government have since improved, though tensions remain over oil exports and revenue-sharing.

Kurds form about 10% of the population.

Rights groups say Kurds, along with other religious and ethnic minorities, face discrimination under the ruling clerical establishment. The Islamic Republic denies persecuting Kurds.

There are three main Iranian Kurdish separatist factions, all based in Iraqi Kurdistan. Iran has demanded authorities in Iraq hand over separatist Kurdish dissidents stationed there and close their bases.

Iran's Kurdish regions have been a focal point of unrest following anti-government protests that began in late December 2025 and led to thousands of people being killed in January 2026. During the unrest Reuters reported that armed Kurdish separatist groups had sought to cross the border into Iran from Iraq.

Kurdish areas were also a major flashpoint during the previous major wave of domestic unrest in 2022, when nationwide protests were triggered by the death in custody of an Iranian-Kurdish woman.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 18:45:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5BW622DSWRMQNCLOI5G7FTRTGM.jpg?auth=4e4425a6b93e90a6b008ef2480ea3aa8126ca384a163deacee93c267761c298c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UN-backed force in Haiti to deploy fully by summer amid political turmoil</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/un-backed-force-haiti-deploy-fully-by-summer-amid-political-turmoil-2026-01-22/</link><description>Jan 22 (Reuters) - A U.N.-backed security force deployed to Haiti to help local police fight off armed gangs that have taken over much of the country should reach its new full-strength , opens new tab by summer, the U.N.'s special envoy for Haiti said on Thursday.

The announcement comes amid political uncertainty in the Caribbean nation ahead of February 7, when the current transition government's mandate ends. No official succession plan has been put forward.

U.N. envoy Carlos Ruiz said more troops should arrive by April and that the force should reach its full strength - envisioned at 5,500 troops - by the this summer, or autumn at latest.

Around 1,000 mostly Kenyan police are currently in Haiti as part of the force, whose deployment has been marked by delays and severe lack of funding. Since the first deployment in June 2024, gangs have expanded to much of central and rural Haiti.

By comparison, Haiti's police and the numbers of armed group members in the country are estimated at around 12,000 each, with large amounts of guns and ammunition trafficked to criminal groups largely from the U.S.

Ruiz spoke after reports of a majority of members of Haiti's transitional presidential council, the CPT - effectively its top executive - moved to oust the prime minister days before their mandate ends next month.

If successful, this would be the CPT's second ouster of a prime minister since appointed in April 2024. Their term has been marked by political infighting and corruption accusations, while worsening insecurity has repeatedly pushed back the likelihood of holding the country's first election in a decade .

"The country cannot spare more internal fighting," Ruiz said. "The current authorities should still make use of the couple weeks they have to do whatever they can to benefit the country."

If stakeholders do not agree on a plan for after February 7, Ruiz said, "we know the constitution provides for the prime minister to continue if that's the case, and we need an authority and a government that is stable enough."

None of Haiti's CPT members have publicly commented on the reported attempt to oust Prime Minister Alix Didier Fils-Aime.

U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau on Thursday warned against taking that step, saying such a measure by non-elected CPT members so close to the end of their tenure would undermine U.S. goals of security in Haiti.

"The U.S. would consider anyone supporting such a disruptive step favoring the gangs to be acting contrary to the interests of the United States, the region, and the Haitian people and will act accordingly," Landau said on X.

Haitian gangs have killed thousands and taken control of most of the capital Port-au-Prince, expanded to central Haiti and its agricultural heartlands, carried out multiple massacres, mass rapes, ransom kidnappings and arson. Some 1.4 million people have been internally displaced by the conflict.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 19:25:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/DDC5AZ7PBFO5RG3Q4ZT77QE3UA.jpg?auth=1e32d88fd13453816a9cb7a64edfa1a533b5f435e3d69132e3d4540ebe40e37a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'Trump whisperer' Rutte steers NATO around Greenland crisis</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/trump-whisperer-rutte-steers-nato-around-greenland-crisis-2026-01-22/</link><description>AMSTERDAM/BRUSSELS, Jan 22 (Reuters) - As tensions over Greenland between Donald Trump and Europe neared boiling point this week, NATO boss Mark Rutte cemented his reputation as a "Trump whisperer" after the U.S. president dropped his tariff threats following a meeting in Davos.

Trump said he and Rutte agreed on a "framework of a future deal" on the entire Arctic Region, which would be "a great one for the United States of America, and all NATO Nations".

While details were scant, the outcome was a diplomatic win for Rutte that steered the fraying transatlantic alliance back from the precipice, diplomats and political analysts said.

Rutte, who served as Dutch prime minister for 14 years, was already known as "the Trump whisperer" in European newspapers when he took up the NATO job a month before Trump's re-election in 2024, based on their rapport during Trump's first term.

His strategy is not subtle - it is built on lavishing praise on the U.S. president, even as other European leaders are increasingly critical of Trump.

"The work of the Secretary General of NATO is always important. And when it's manifested in the personality of Mark Rutte, who's cool, calm, and collected, and is able to talk with the president of the United States, we should just be thankful that he's our secretary general right now," Finnish President Alexander Stubb told Reuters in Davos.

Trump had previously said the U.S. needed to own Greenland. Quite how much of his backtracking was down to Rutte was unclear. He had already taken military force off the table before his meeting with the NATO chief.

But many diplomats give Rutte credit for holding NATO together and managing turbulent transatlantic ties with Trump in the first year of the U.S. president's second term.

"He is not perfect. Allies may have different opinions about him and his managing style. But he is very good at keeping this alliance together in difficult times," a European diplomat said.

"President Trump was already prepared for concessions and Rutte was the perfect interlocutor."

While a frenzy of diplomacy in global capitals laid the groundwork, and Europe's strong backing for Denmark's refusal to cede Greenland played a part, Rutte's personal intervention was seen as crucial.

A senior NATO diplomat said the agreement showed why Rutte "does what he does to stay on speed dial" with Trump.

The latest NATO compromise came on the back of a similar intervention by Rutte in The Hague in June, when he poured on the charm, likening Trump to a "daddy" in global conflicts.

He successfully negotiated a deal that saw allies agree to Trump's call for an increase in military and related spending to 5% of GDP.

Trump, clearly delighted, brought up the "daddy" comment in his speech on Wednesday in Davos.

Now Rutte has proposed a framework agreement that would see the alliance beef up security for Greenland and the broader Arctic, addressing what Trump says are concerns about threats posed by China and Russia.

While French President Emmanuel Macron called Trump a bully in his own speech at Davos, Rutte has always lauded Trump. In a text that Trump posted on social media this week, Rutte praised his "incredible" work in Syria and commended his work on Gaza and Ukraine.

Rutte, who honed his consensus-building skills keeping together coalition governments in the politically fractious Netherlands, often refuses requests from journalists to discuss sensitive matters on camera. He changes topics, saying diplomatic problems should not be splashed across newspaper headlines.

Tim Sweijs, director of research at The Hague Centre for Strategic Studies, said Rutte's ability to keep parties together for such a long stint as prime minister made him "a somewhat rare political figure" in the Netherlands.

"Instead of withdrawing — as many leaders do — and limiting discussions to a small inner circle, he would always pick up his old Nokia phone and call both his coalition partners and members of the opposition," Sweijs said.

That has left Rutte open to criticism that he is willing to set aside ideals to reach an agreement, said Simon Otjes, associate professor of Dutch politics at Leiden University.

"He's famous for saying, 'If you want vision, then you should go to an eye doctor.' He's the guy who gets to the compromise, who brings people together, who makes people feel valued in order to move further," Otjes said.

"He really tries to understand not just what Trump needs in terms of policy to move, but also what Trump needs psychologically."</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 19:26:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/SZHBCHBRWJJYFJYBNYM73UJS5Q.jpg?auth=68513142984be78754099ba5f8e36a1e8b65536813ccb7469af69d3466ad1094&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Finnish president Stubb says Trump is putting pressure on Russia</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/finnish-president-stubb-says-trump-is-putting-pressure-russia-2026-01-22/</link><description>DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Finnish President Alexander Stubb said on Thursday U.S. President Donald Trump is putting pressure on Russia over the war in Ukraine and argued that conditions are evolving favourably from the perspective of western powers.

Speaking after the United States and Europe stepped back from a row over Greenland, Stubb said efforts to craft a peace deal had gained strength since Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner began complementing U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff's own endeavours.

Stubb said he was optimistic about the peace process from the point of view of Ukraine, the United States, and Europe, highlighting a 20-point peace plan encompassing security guarantees for Ukraine and the reconstruction of the country.

"I think President Trump is putting a lot of pressure on Russia, and I hope he continues to do that," Stubb told Reuters in an interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in the Swiss mountain resort of Davos.

However, Stubb said he was not convinced Russia would accept the plan out of domestic political considerations.

Trump said a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Davos was "very good" and that his message to Russian President Vladimir Putin is that the war must end.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 19:26:12 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/OE3MQRBJ45OOBGFGWT3NRIAOBA.jpg?auth=7ea16356970e6a6c5a50123ee5f2fcc72be0e585c62c985b5c79aeb2ca8778ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US allows China to purchase Venezuelan oil but not at 'undercut' prices of Maduro days, official says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/us-allows-china-purchase-venezuelan-oil-not-undercut-prices-maduro-days-official-2026-01-22/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 22 (Reuters) - The Trump administration is allowing China to purchase Venezuelan oil but not at "unfair, undercut" prices at which Caracas sold the crude before the U.S. removed President Nicolas Maduro, a U.S. official said on Thursday.

While the oil will be sold in the global marketplace, the administration has required that the majority be sold to the United States, the administration official said on condition of anonymity. The U.S. says it will control Venezuela's oil sales indefinitely after seizing Maduro on January 3.

"Thanks to President (Donald) Trump’s decisive and successful law enforcement operation, the people of Venezuela will collect a fair price for their oil from China and other nations rather than a corrupt, cheap price," the official said.

China has been Venezuela's top oil buyer for years, and the sales helped Caracas repay massive loans to Beijing in debt-for-oil deals.

The administration is allowing China to buy the oil at "fair market prices - not the unfair, undercut prices" at which Maduro sold oil to China to pay debts, the official said.

U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said last week that the U.S. was receiving about $45 per barrel for Venezuelan oil compared with the roughly $31 Venezuela was getting before Maduro's capture.

Trading houses Trafigura and Vitol have sold some 11 million barrels of oil in an initial supply deal between Venezuela and the U.S. of stranded crude, representing about a quarter of the $2 billion agreement.

Trafigura completed its first crude sale to a customer in a deal with Spanish company Repsol (REP.MC) , opens new tab while Vitol has negotiated cargoes to U.S. refiners including Valero (VLO.N) , opens new tab and Phillips 66 (PSX.N) , opens new tab and to its refinery in Italy, sources said.

China's oil imports from Venezuela are expected to slump starting in February as fewer tankers have managed to leave after the U.S. claimed control of the OPEC producer's sales, traders and analysts said last week.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 19:45:39 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/GDUXMN6GBFN33FMCXIBI4GS3XI.jpg?auth=12edd5902d400f68efd8ce357cee43551f73cb56dbb4872b039276a1963c6bef&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Tunisia sentences two prominent journalists to three and a half years in prison, state news says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/tunisia-sentences-two-prominent-journalists-three-half-years-prison-state-news-2026-01-22/</link><description>TUNIS, Jan 22 (Reuters) - A Tunisian court sentenced two prominent journalists, Bohran Bssaies and Mourad Zghidi, to three and a half years in prison on Thursday, TAP state news quoted a judicial official as saying.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 19:45:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/J2OT46IMSVO2LHG3HHCW3T5WGM.jpg?auth=1bb42dc711388997fd45b2f1aac58ca16ebd233c55b315fd77faa5f6343d7aff&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Explainer: Can Donald Trump buy Greenland?</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/can-donald-trump-buy-greenland-2026-01-22/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 22 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump has said repeatedly that he wants to acquire Greenland, possibly by purchasing it from Denmark, despite the U.S. ally's repeated insistence that it is not for sale.

On Wednesday, Trump appeared to rule out military force as a means of taking the Arctic island, saying that he had secured a deal with NATO to guarantee U.S. access to Greenland. The details remained unclear, however.

Here is what we know about the likely cost of a purchase and the constitutional limits on the president's ability to add a new territory to the United States:

With no market for buying and selling countries, it is of course impossible to put any meaningful price tag on Greenland.

But Otto Svendsen, an expert on the Arctic at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank, said it was not unreasonable to expect that the total cost of acquiring Greenland would approach $1 trillion.

That would include the cost of acquiring the world's largest island, as well as potential lump-sum payments to the Greenlanders, budget transfers to maintain the island's welfare state, infrastructure and defense investments, he said in an emailed statement.

Investors have questioned the wisdom of such a purchase when the U.S. has a $38 trillion deficit. Political rivals have also criticized Trump for spending abroad instead of helping American citizens. "How about instead of giving the American people Greenland, we give them healthcare?" Democratic Representative Brendan Boyle of Pennsylvania asked on Wednesday.

Congressional approval is required to expand the size of the U.S. Past purchases, such as the 1917 acquisition of the U.S. Virgin Islands - also from Denmark - have been carried out by treaty.

Two-thirds of the Senate, or 67 senators, must approve any treaty, according to the Constitution. That would mean Trump currently would have to convince at least 14 members of the Democratic caucus to approve a deal, even if he had the support of every Republican.

And some Senate Republicans have joined Democrats in saying that Washington should not force a sale. "Respect for the sovereignty of the people of Greenland should be non-negotiable," Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, the co-chair of the Senate Arctic Caucus, said in a statement.

It was not expected that Greenland, now a self-governing territory within Denmark, would become a U.S. state. With just 57,000 residents, the island's population is far smaller than any state's.

Other possibilities include forming a "compact of free association" with the U.S., which would include financial assistance in exchange for a security presence, or making Greenland a territory, like Guam or Puerto Rico. Territories are under federal control but residents lack rights such as voting representation in Congress.

The U.S. Constitution also gives Congress, not the president, control of federal lands.

The U.S. Constitution grants Congress, not the president, control of spending.

Trump's Republicans, who have slim majorities in both the House of Representatives and Senate, have backed Trump as he has pushed the boundaries of the president's spending authority, including by downsizing and closing agencies funded by Congress and spending millions on efforts like changing the name of the Department of Defense without congressional approval.

But it would be difficult to find and spend an amount comparable to the entire U.S. military budget without obtaining Congress' buy-in.

Trump and his backers have insisted the U.S. needs Greenland to fend off threats from Russian and Chinese interests in the Arctic and that Denmark cannot ensure its security. But the United States already has a base on the island and the ability to expand its presence there.

Trump also wants more access to Greenland's rich but largely untapped rare-earth and critical mineral resources . Extracting oil and natural gas is banned in Greenland for environmental reasons, while the development of mining has been snarled in red tape and opposition from indigenous people.

In a recent Senate speech, Republican Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky cited the importance of the NATO alliance, and U.S.-Danish military ties.

"There is no ambiguity here. Close ties with our northernmost allies are what make America’s extensive reach in the Arctic possible. And I have yet to hear from this administration a single thing we need from Greenland that this sovereign people is not already willing to grant us," he said.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 19:46:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WXCD6MYBJZP27N2OHPEC5RWZWU.jpg?auth=f694d2bc38c1d5d437745a57809eb698e3537f77a4ef55f4c6005df84abdf0c8&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US names new top envoy for Venezuela after Maduro capture</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/us-names-new-top-envoy-venezuela-after-maduro-capture-2026-01-22/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 22 (Reuters) - The United States has named a two-time U.S. ambassador as its top envoy for Venezuela , according to the U.S. embassy in Caracas website.

Laura Dogu, who previously served as ambassador to Honduras and Nicaragua, will serve as charge d'affaires to the Venezuela Affairs Unit based out of the embassy in Bogota, according to the website.

Dogu takes up the role after the United States captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro in a raid earlier this month and whisked him to New York to face drug-trafficking charges.

“The Trump Administration continues to work with the interim authorities to stabilize Venezuela as part of the three-phase plan Secretary Rubio laid out for Congress and the American people," a senior State Department official said.

"This plan requires a full-time Chargé d'Affaires at the Venezuela Affairs Unit, located at the United States Embassy in Bogota. Ambassador Dogu is ... well-positioned to lead the team during this transition period.”

The United States earlier this month began preparations in case President Donald Trump decides to reopen the U.S. embassy in Venezuela's capital Caracas.

U.S. diplomatic and security personnel traveled to Caracas on January 9 for an assessment of a "potential phased resumption" of embassy operations there, a State Department spokesperson said at the time.

The U.S. in 2019 withdrew all diplomatic personnel from Venezuela, citing the deteriorating situation in the country after months of political unrest.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 20:29:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/E6B5CQ524VM2BP5ALFTEAXGOZQ.jpg?auth=c5e970b0f8adff726918f6c35afb98834772efa1074c699ef71dcf97bcbfb258&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US military assets heading to Middle East even as Trump backs off toughest Iran rhetoric</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-military-assets-heading-middle-east-even-trump-backs-off-toughest-iran-2026-01-22/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 22 (Reuters) - A U.S. military aircraft carrier strike group and other assets will arrive in the Middle East region in the coming days, two U.S. officials said on Thursday, even as U.S. President Donald Trump voices hopes of avoiding new military action against Iran.

U.S. warships including the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, several destroyers and fighter aircraft started moving from the Asia-Pacific last week as tensions between Iran and the United States soared following a severe crackdown on protests across Iran in recent months.

One of the officials said additional air defense systems were also being eyed for the Middle East. The United States often increases U.S. troop levels in the Middle East at moments of heightened regional tensions, something that experts note can be entirely defensive in nature.

However, the U.S. military staged a major buildup last summer ahead of its June strikes against Iran's nuclear program, and later boasted about how it kept its intention to strike a secret.

Trump had repeatedly threatened to intervene against Iran over the recent killings of protesters there but protests dwindled last week and Trump's rhetoric regarding Iran has eased. He has turned his gaze on other geopolitical issues, including his pursuit of Greenland .

On Wednesday, Trump said he hoped there would not be further U.S. military action in Iran, but said the United States would act if Tehran resumed its nuclear program.

"They can't do the nuclear," Trump told CNBC in an interview in Davos, Switzerland, noting major U.S. air strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities in June 2025. "If they do it, it's going to happen again."

It is now at least seven months since the U.N. nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, last verified Iran's stock of highly enriched uranium. Its own guidance is that it should be done monthly.

Iran must file a report to the IAEA on what happened to those sites that were struck by the United States and nuclear material thought to be there, including an estimated 440.9 kg of uranium enriched to up to 60% purity, close to the roughly 90% weapons-grade level. That is enough material, if enriched further, for 10 nuclear bombs, according to an IAEA yardstick.

It is unclear whether protests in Iran could also surge again. The protests began on December 28 as modest demonstrations in Tehran’s Grand Bazaar over economic hardship and quickly spread nationwide.

The U.S.-based HRANA rights group said it has so far verified 4,519 unrest-linked deaths, including 4,251 protesters, 197 security personnel, 35 people aged under 18 and 38 bystanders who it says were neither protesters nor security personnel.

HRANA has 9,049 additional deaths under review. An Iranian official told Reuters the confirmed death toll until Sunday was more than 5,000, including 500 members of the security forces.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 20:31:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/VYA52T2ULZIZRC4Q3UZY5EFPIU.jpg?auth=0d320fc17ffed991c1612774020fcbf75b2a186c2d328f9d64e59e52a1a4b310&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US to expand anti-abortion aid rule to cover 'gender ideology,' diversity</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-expand-anti-abortion-aid-rule-cover-gender-ideology-diversity-2026-01-22/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 22 (Reuters) - The Trump administration is set to expand the Mexico City Policy that blocks U.S. assistance to organizations that provide or promote abortions to cover groups involved in what the administration calls "gender ideology" and diversity, equity and inclusion, an administration official said on Thursday.

The policy, which opponents call the "global gag rule" because they say it silences abortion rights advocates, will be expanded on Friday to include international organizations and U.S. nongovernmental organizations, the official said.

The change will cover $30 billion of U.S. foreign assistance. The move was first reported by Fox News.

Established by former President Ronald Reagan in 1984, the Mexico City Policy, which previously only applied to foreign NGOs, has been rescinded by each Democratic president since and reinstated when a Republican returns to the White House. It was most recently restored by Trump in January 2025.

"The State Department will release three final rules on Friday expanding the Mexico City Policy to protect foreign assistance from subsidizing not only abortion as a method of family planning, but also gender ideology (and) discriminatory equity ideology/DEI," said the official, who confirmed the plans on condition of anonymity.

The Trump administration has aggressively closed government programs that relate to acceptance of transgender people or gender-affirming care, including as part of an overhaul of foreign aid that saw the U.S. Agency for International Development shuttered.

It has also shut down offices and fired staff working on diversity initiatives , which Trump and his supporters say unfairly discriminate against white people and men.

The State Department in November announced plans to classify actions under pro-diversity policies and state subsidies for abortion as human rights abuses in its reports.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 20:55:17 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/Y5I3BLOUTNMC3G6D6XSL5VMT5A.jpg?auth=632ba7031097c6c46508a162d44dd357b2023175c672a64b8068429ecec35f9e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuela moves to open up oil sector to private investors as US ties thaw</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260122-venezuela-moves-to-open-up-oil-sector-to-private-investors-as-us-ties-thaw</link><description>Venezuelan lawmakers on Thursday gave their initial backing to plans to throw open the oil sector to private investors, paving the way for the return of US energy majors – a key demand of President Donald Trump .

Less than three weeks after the US ouster of Nicolas Maduro , MPs endorsed on first reading a bill allowing private companies to independently engage in oil exploration and extraction.

If adopted on a second reading, the bill would roll back decades of state controls over Venezuela's oil sector, which were tightened by Maduro's late mentor, socialist firebrand Hugo Chavez , in the mid-2000s.

The bill has been promoted by Maduro's former deputy, acting president Delcy Rodriguez , who has overseen a lightning-fast thaw in ties with Washington since taking the helm.

In another sign of the speed of the changes unfolding in Caracas, the United States confirmed Thursday it had named a new head for its mission in Venezuela.

The US embassy page listed Laura F. Dogu – a former ambassador to Nicaragua and Honduras – as the new charge d'affaires to Venezuela, in what was seen as another step towards the restoration of full diplomatic ties.

Caracas and Washington severed relations after Maduro's widely disputed claim to reelection in 2019.

The US embassy has been mostly deserted since then.

Within days of Maduro's January 3 capture in Caracas, US diplomats travelled to the Venezuelan capital to discuss reopening the embassy.

Dogu will work from Bogota in neighboring Colombia until the mission is operational.

Trump has boasted that he is working "really well" with Rodriguez, who was vice president in Maduro's rabidly anti-US government.

On Wednesday a senior US official said Rodriguez would soon visit the United States, despite still being under US sanctions.

Maduro was toppled after a months-long US pressure campaign and flown to New York with his wife to face trial on drug trafficking charges.

Trump claims Washington now effectively runs Venezuela and controls its oil industry.

Rodriguez has appeared ready to comply so far.

This week she ploughed $300 million from a US-brokered oil sale into propping up the ailing national currency, the bolivar.

The mere anticipation of the injection drove down the price of dollars, the currency in which many Venezuelans conduct their business.

But economists warned that true relief from spiralling prices would require a sustained influx of dollars -- which in turns requires foreign investment.

Venezuela has the world's largest proven reserves of oil.

The energy reform bill before parliament ends a Chavez-era requirement for private companies to form joint ventures with state-owned oil firm PDVSA, which insisted on holding a majority.

The law also makes the royalties regime more flexible, based on the success of the oil exploration project.

Rodriguez was petroleum minister under Maduro, a position she still holds.

To win the support of both Venezuelans and Washington, she needs to quickly show improvements in the economy and signal an end to a decade of worsening repression under Maduro.

In the past two weeks, her government has slowly freed dozens of political prisoners from the hundreds behind bars.

On Thursday, authorities released the son-in-law of opposition figure Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia , who was serving a 30-year sentence on terrorism charges.

Gonzalez Urrutia, in exile in Spain , is widely considered the rightful winner of Venezuela's 2024 presidential election, which Maduro professed to win.

His son-in-law Rafael Tudares was arrested by masked men in January 2025 while on his way to school with his two children.

Since Maduro's ouster Trump has ramped up pressure on another Latin American arch-foe, communist Cuba , a longtime Venezuela ally.

Trump has vowed to cut off all oil supplies to Cuba, which has relied for years on heavily-subsidized Venezuelan oil and cash to remain afloat.

Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel said Thursday he spoke by telephone with Rodriguez to express his "support and solidarity."</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 21:24:43 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/a61c6c42-f7d6-11f0-9217-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-22T191336Z-1355770464-RC26FCAS6DK8-RTRMADP-3-VENEZUELA-ASSEMBLY.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US urges nations to repatriate their citizens from Iraqi facilities with ISIS members</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-urges-nations-repatriate-their-citizens-iraqi-facilities-with-isis-members-2026-01-22/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 22 (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Thursday that Washington welcomed Iraq's initiative to detain Islamic State members in secure facilities in Iraq while also urging nations to repatriate their citizens in these facilities "to face justice."

"The United States welcomes the Government of Iraq's initiative to detain ISIS terrorists in secure facilities in Iraq, following recent instability in northeast Syria," Rubio said in a statement.

"Non-Iraqi terrorists will be in Iraq temporarily; the United States urges countries to take responsibility and repatriate their citizens in these facilities to face justice."

Iraq's Supreme Judicial Council said on Thursday it would begin legal proceedings against Islamic State detainees transferred from Syria, a day after the U.S. military announced its forces had transferred 150 of the suspected militants from Syria to Iraq.

The U.S. military has said its operation could eventually see 7,000 detainees moved out of Syria.

The United Nations said it was taking management responsibility for vast camps in Syria housing tens of thousands of women and children associated with the Islamic State, after the rapid collapse of Kurdish-led forces who guarded them for years.

Iraq has begun taking in detainees transferred from prisons in Syria as the Kurds retreat, and has called on other countries to help take them in.

"This is a critical part of a long-term framework to prevent an ISIS resurgence, in line with proper burden sharing among Coalition members," Rubio said on Thursday.

More than 10,000 members of the Islamic State, and tens of thousands of women and children associated with them, have been held for years in about a dozen prisons and detention camps guarded by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in Syria's northeast.

The SDF has rapidly retreated this week after clashes with Syrian government forces, raising concern about security at prisons and humanitarian conditions at the camps.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 21:47:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CDHPFLQYWBO2DBV4IPRB4GUSOE.jpg?auth=91c03884d99748a8ba6b0f609aab201337a2235757c43126d0f14b4b01703afe&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Putin meets three US envoys for late-night talks on Ukraine</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/putin-meets-us-envoys-late-night-talks-ukraine-2026-01-22/</link><description>MOSCOW, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin began a meeting with three U.S. envoys late on Thursday to discuss a plan to end the war in Ukraine, the Kremlin said.

Americans Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner were accompanied by Josh Gruenbaum, newly appointed by President Donald Trump as a senior adviser to his Board of Peace, which is tasked with ending international conflicts.

Putin greeted the Americans shortly before midnight in Moscow after Trump said a deal was "reasonably close" and Witkoff said negotiations had come down to one last issue.

Minutes after the talks began, Russia said it had carried out a patrol of strategic bomber planes - something it regularly does as a show of strength and deterrence.

The defence ministry said the Tu-22M3 bombers - part of a long-range fleet that Russia has used throughout the war to fire missiles at Ukrainian cities, military targets and energy infrastructure - flew for more than five hours over the Baltic Sea, escorted by Russian fighter jets.

The Kremlin said Putin was joined, as at previous meetings with the U.S. side, by his foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov and special envoy Kirill Dmitriev.

A brief video clip showed Putin shaking hands with the three Americans and inviting them to take their seats at a long oval table.

Trump has pressed hard over the past year for an end to the nearly four-year conflict, the deadliest in Europe since World War Two. He said on Wednesday that Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy would be "stupid" if they failed to come together and get a deal done.

Witkoff did not name the main outstanding problem, but all sides have previously highlighted the issue of territory.

In particular, Putin has demanded that Ukraine surrender the 20% it still holds of the eastern region of Donetsk . Zelenskiy has refused to give up land that Ukraine has successfully defended at great cost through years of grinding, attritional warfare.

Russia also demands that Ukraine renounce its ambition to join NATO, and rejects any presence of NATO troops on Ukrainian soil following a peace deal.

Witkoff and Kushner flew in from Davos, Switzerland, where they met Ukrainian officials this week, and Trump met Zelenskiy on Thursday.

Zelenskiy said after the meeting that the terms of security guarantees for Ukraine had been finalised , but that the issue of territory remained unsolved.

Ukraine is enduring its harshest winter of the war as Russia mounts heavy missile and drone strikes on its energy infrastructure. With temperatures way below freezing, hundreds of thousands of people in Kyiv and other cities have suffered long power cuts and been left without heating.

In what he called a positive sign, Zelenskiy said negotiators from Russia, Ukraine and the U.S. would hold trilateral meetings for the first time in Abu Dhabi on Friday and Saturday.

He also said a deal was almost ready on economic recovery after the war with Russia, a key element of Ukrainian-backed proposals to push back on an earlier U.S. peace plan seen as heavily favouring Moscow.

Trump, when asked what message he had for Putin, replied: "The war has to end."</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 21:47:27 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/NUU5GV7C4FKQTPZXQ5577BN4TE.jpg?auth=4a43002e507a321df62a7698b58c6efb56e4c644a6e1221cc7f9500f1bc68666&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US to complete transfer of Islamic State detainees from Syria to Iraq in coming days, official says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-complete-transfer-islamic-state-detainees-syria-iraq-coming-days-official-2026-01-22/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 22 (Reuters) - The U.S. military expects to complete the transfer of up to 7,000 Islamic State detainees from Syrian prisons to Iraq in the coming days, a U.S. official told Reuters on Thursday, saying hundreds would be moving across the border daily.

The U.S. military's Central Command said on Wednesday its forces had transferred 150 Islamic State detainees from a detention facility in Syria's Hasaka province to Iraq, citing the need to guard against any prison breakout.

The transfers are taking place after the rapid collapse of Kurdish-led forces in northeast Syria triggered concerns over prison security following Tuesday's escape of roughly 200 low-level Islamic State fighters from Syria's Shaddadi prison. Syrian government forces recaptured many of them.

The U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the U.S. transfers prioritized "the most dangerous" Islamic State fighters and noted that they were citizens of many different countries, including in Europe.

Iraqi legal sources said the IS detainees sent from Syria so far include a mix of nationalities, with Iraqis making up the largest group, alongside Arab fighters from other countries and nationals of Britain, Belgium, France, Germany and Sweden.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Thursday applauded Iraq for taking the prisoners.

"Non-Iraqi terrorists will be in Iraq temporarily; the United States urges countries to take responsibility and repatriate their citizens in these facilities to face justice," Rubio said in a statement.

Islamic State emerged in Iraq and Syria, and at the height of its power from 2014-2017 held swathes of the two countries, ruling over millions of people. Its "caliphate" eventually collapsed after military campaigns by regional governments and a U.S.-led coalition.

The prisons that the Islamic State members are being transferred from are located in northeast Syria's Hasaka province, where the Syrian Democratic Forces had been working closely with the United States for years to secure them.

The U.S. had been a backer of the SDF since 2015, when the force was conceived to expel the Islamic State group from Syria's northeast. The SDF later used that territory to establish an autonomous enclave, with separate civilian and military institutions.

But in late 2024, President Ahmed al-Sharaa's rebel forces ousted longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad and pledged to bring all of Syria under the new government's control, including SDF-run areas.

The Syrian government has recently seized swathes of northern and eastern Syria from Kurdish forces, consolidating Sharaa's rule, in a rapid turn of events that has brought almost all of Syria back under the authority of the Damascus-based state.

The United States has about 1,000 troops in Syria but has long mulled exiting.

With Assad toppled, U.S. President Donald Trump has developed close ties to Sharaa, lifting sanctions and welcoming Syria into an international anti-Islamic State coalition.

U.S. envoy Tom Barrack said on Tuesday the original purpose of the SDF had largely expired, and that the U.S. had no long-term interest in retaining its presence in Syria.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 22:23:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>In Davos, African president pitches business deals to Trump’s son Eric</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/davos-african-president-pitches-business-deals-trumps-son-eric-2026-01-22/</link><description>DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 22 (Reuters) - The president of Somaliland was at the World Economic Forum this week to win international recognition for his country and pitch investment opportunities in the East African nation.

One of his main meetings, according to an aide, was with Eric Trump, son of the U.S. president Donald Trump and a leading executive of the Trump family’s sprawling business spanning from real estate to crypto .

On Wednesday, while Donald Trump was delivering a speech to an international audience of chief executives at the Davos forum, the Somaliland president, Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi, met with Eric Trump in a nearby hotel conference room.

Also attending the meeting was Israel’s president, Isaac Herzog, whose country recognized Somaliland last month —a first by any United Nations member.

During the closed-door meeting, Abdullahi outlined investment opportunities in Somaliland, notably the country’s strategic deep-sea port of Berbera, which sits along one of the world’s busiest shipping routes, according to two people present.

“The meeting went well, it went very well,” the Somaliland president told Reuters on Thursday, confirming his meeting with both Eric Trump and Herzog.

A spokeswoman for Eric Trump did not respond to a message seeking comment.

In a post on X that did not mention Eric Trump, Herzog said he had been pleased to meet with his Somaliland counterpart in the Swiss resort.

During Trump's first term, the family’s self-imposed ethical guidelines prohibited them from seeking new business outside the U.S. Yet, days before his second inauguration, the Trump Organization, as the family business is known, released revised guidelines that jettisoned that constraint.

The White House did not respond to a message seeking comment.

The House voted 215 to 215, a tie that defeated the resolution which "directs the President to remove United States Armed Forces from Venezuela, unless explicitly authorized by a declaration of war or specific statutory authorization for use of military force."

The close vote reflected concern in Congress, including from a handful of Republicans, over Trump's foreign policy. There is growing support for the argument that Congress, not the president, should have the power to send U.S. troops to war, as spelled out in the U.S. Constitution.

Opponents of the resolution had argued that it was unnecessary because the U.S. does not currently have troops on the ground in Venezuela.

"We do not have anybody there in Venezuela fighting," Republican Representative Brian Mast of Florida said in debate before the vote.

Trump's Republicans also accused Democrats of introducing the legislation only as an attack on Trump. "It's about spite," Mast, the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said. "You will condemn him no matter what he does."

Backers disagreed, saying they wanted to keep Trump from pulling the U.S. into another "forever war," after decades fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq.

"The American people want us to lower their cost of living, not enable war," said Representative Gregory Meeks of New York, the top Democrat on the foreign affairs panel.

U.S. forces swept into Caracas on January 3 and captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro . A large flotilla of U.S. ships is blockading Venezuela, and has spent months firing on boats in the southern Caribbean and Pacific.

Trump recently has said the U.S. will run Venezuela for years, told Iranians protesting against their government that "help is on the way" and threatened military action to take Greenland, a territory of NATO ally Denmark.

Some Democrats also denounced Trump for leaving most of Maduro's government in place in Caracas and failing to present a plan for Venezuela after his removal.

"The machinery of repression was left in place and the Democratic hopes of Venezuelans are being left behind," said Democrat Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida.

Recent votes on war powers have been very close, with the measure failing in the Senate last week only because Vice President JD Vance came to the Capitol to break a tie.

"If the president is contemplating further military action, then he has a moral and constitutional obligation to come here and get our approval," said Representative Jim McGovern of Massachusetts, a lead sponsor of the House resolution.

The Trump administration argues that Maduro's capture was a very limited judicial operation to bring him to trial in the U.S. on drug charges, not a military operation.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 22:51:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/UX3QAAAHGJJBZHCSK7PWZMRO64.jpg?auth=626eb0a3befe921d18e9629305b004cdb954642b2a5fb5e2414c26910c3232dc&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>New Zealand continues hunt for victims at campground hit by landslide</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/new-zealand-continues-hunt-victims-campground-hit-by-landslide-2026-01-22/</link><description>WELLINGTON, Jan 23 (Reuters) - New Zealand emergency crews continued to search on Friday for victims of a landslide that ripped through a busy campground on the country's North Island the day before due to heavy rains.

The landslide hit Mount Maunganui on the island's east coast at 9:30 a.m. on Thursday (2030 GMT Wednesday), bringing soil and rubble down on the busy campsite.

Police reported that as many as nine people may be missing including children. Families enjoying the summer school holiday were among the campers. Recreational vehicles and at least one structure were crushed, images showed.

Prime Minister Christopher Luxon was due to visit areas hit by recent flooding on Friday.

Local Mayor Mahe Drysdale told Radio New Zealand that while search-and-rescue teams had continued at the campground through the night, there had been no progress in finding missing people.

“That's really hard, and we're here with the families and as you can imagine, just that uncertainty of where they are and when we might have a result is pretty hard,” Drysdale said.

He said the area remained unstable. Emergency Management and Recovery Minister Mark Mitchell told Radio New Zealand it was a challenging and difficult environment.

He said police were checking if some campers may have left without informing authorities.

The landslide happened after heavy rains soaked much of the North Island’s east coast earlier this week and caused widespread damage. A landslide in the neighbouring town of Papamoa killed two on Thursday, and a man was washed away with his vehicle north of Auckland on Wednesday.

Roads remained closed in some of the worst-hit areas, making some North Island towns inaccessible by land. The civil defence organization in Tairawhiti District said in a social media post that people were walking over landslides to collect water and food from welfare hubs and warned against this due to fears of further landslides.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 22:51:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/Y4PN2KWE7FOH7G54CKYVGU5DZU.jpg?auth=b75cff5301401b2a86e6db67fb81dad203ba41ac1a71c1bc11aee7c1ee89ce08&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russian forces hit two localities in southeast Ukraine, killing one</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/russian-forces-hit-two-localities-southeast-ukraine-killing-one-2026-01-22/</link><description>Jan 22 (Reuters) - Russian forces launched attacks on two localities in southeastern Ukraine on Thursday, killing one person and injuring more than 20, local officials said.

The governor of Zaporizhzhia region said in a Telegram post that Russian forces launched four strikes on the town of Komyshuvakha, killing one person and injuring 10. Several private homes were damaged in the attack on the town, east of the region's main city, also called Zaporizhzhia.

In the industrial city of Kryvyi Rih, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's home town in Dnipropetrovsk region, a combined drone and missile attack injured 13 people, including four children, Oleksandr Vilkul, head of the city's military administration, said on Telegram.

The attacks hit apartment buildings, schools and critical infrastructure.

"The main thing is everyone is alive," Vilkul wrote. "Six people are in hospital, including three children."

Reuters could not independently confirm the attacks had taken place and Russian officials made no comment.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 23:24:26 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump eases Greenland tensions as Europe braces for what's next</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260123-trump-greenland-europe</link><description>One crisis defused, how long until the next one? European leaders huddled for summit talks Thursday exuding relief at Donald Trump's climbdown on Greenland -- but already steeling themselves for the next jolt from the mercurial US leader.

Trump's threats over the vast Arctic island -- an autonomous territory of NATO member Denmark -- plunged relations between Europe and its key ally Washington to a historic low.

While the immediate danger appeared to recede after Trump struck a "framework" agreement with NATO chief Mark Rutte, the bloc maintained a meeting called to address the crisis -- and how to handle the US leader going forward.

It was still unclear what exactly prompted Trump's U-turn, but French President Emmanuel Macron insisted a push to unleash the European Union's trade arsenal against the United States played a part -- and said Europe remains "extremely vigilant".

Addressing a news conference after the summit, European Council chief Antonio Costa vowed the bloc "will continue to stand up for its interests" and defend itself "against any form of coercion."

"It has the power and the tools to do so, and will do so if and when necessary."

Trump backed down Wednesday night both on threatening to seize Greenland by force and on imposing tariffs against European allies, touting a "framework" agreement that would give Washington "everything we wanted".

Costa described the about-turn on tariffs as "positive" and called for the trade deal agreed with Washington last summer -- which senior European lawmakers had vowed to block in response to US threats -- to be fully rolled out.

"The goal remains the effective stabilisation of the trade relations between the European Union and the US," Costa said, summing up what EU leaders concluded during the evening talks.

NATO's Rutte appeared to have pulled off a diplomatic coup by talking Trump down from his demands -- but swirling questions remained about their purported deal, and what might follow.

Details remain scant, with Greenland's Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen saying he did not know what had been agreed.

But a source familiar with the talks told AFP the United States and Denmark would renegotiate a 1951 defence pact on Greenland.

In Brussels, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen told reporters the matter of Denmark's sovereignty was off the table, but that Copenhagen was open to discussing the pact with the United States.

She also said NATO states backed having a "permanent presence" in the Arctic, including around Greenland.

The Danish leader -- who has maintained close contact with Rutte -- was to meet the NATO chief for a debrief Friday morning in Brussels.

Europe has struggled to set red lines as its once-close American ally has turned hostile under Trump -- to the point of threatening its sovereignty.

"You know we're only a tweet away from the next crisis," summed up one EU diplomat.

Greenland is only part of the picture, as Trump wages a broader attack on the EU's laws, politics and values, zig-zags on the Ukraine conflict, or pushes a self-styled "Board of Peace" after a year of tearing down global norms.

EU leaders had "serious doubts about a number of elements" of the latter initiative, including its scope, governance and compatibility with the UN Charter, Costa said.

Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said the importance of preserving transatlantic ties was "absolutely obvious" for all Europeans.

"But what we need today in our politics is trust and respect among all partners, not domination, and for sure, not coercion," he said.

The continent is ramping up defence spending to break its security reliance on the United States -- but for now, it still needs US help to end the Ukraine war, and deter the looming Russian threat to its east.

With a transatlantic clash over Greenland at least temporarily defused, the EU's top diplomat Kaja Kallas said it was "important to focus back on where the problems really lie -- and this is the war in Ukraine."

But as leaders met in Brussels, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky aimed a brutal warning at the bloc, saying Trump "will not listen to this kind of Europe" unless it steps up to become "a truly global power."</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 01:49:39 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/247c6f48-f704-11f0-a5c0-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26021671953132.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Spain train crash death toll rises to 45 after two more bodies found</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260123-spain-train-collision-death-toll-45</link><description>Spanish investigators on Thursday found two more bodies in the wreckage of a high-speed train involved in a devastating collision last weekend, taking the death toll to 45.

Deadly back-to-back rail accidents just days apart have raised doubts about the safety of train travel in the European Union' s fourth-largest economy, a top tourist destination boasting the world's second-largest high-speed network.

Spain observed three days of national mourning after Sunday's collision involving two high-speed trains in the southern region of Andalusia -- the country's deadliest rail accident in more than a decade.

An Andalusia emergency services spokesman told AFP two bodies had been recovered from the train operated by state company Renfe, which smashed into another service by private firm Iryo that had derailed and crossed onto its track.

"In theory, they are the two people" yet to be recovered from a total of 45 reported as missing following the disaster, which also injured more than 120, the spokesman said.

Rescuers found the two bodies after conducting a "more thorough" search of two carriages that "were in a severely deteriorated condition", the head of the Civil Guard's investigative unit, Fernando Dominguez, told a news conference.

Of those 45 people, all are Spanish apart from three women from Morocco, Russia and Germany, according to the latest update from a body set up to coordinate the identification work.

Spain is searching for answers to what the transport minister has called an "extremely strange" disaster, which happened on a recently renovated stretch of straight, flat track and involved a modern Iryo train.

On Tuesday, a train driver died and 37 people were injured when a commuter service hit a retaining wall that fell onto the tracks near Barcelona in the northeastern region of Catalonia.

The second accident, believed to have been a consequence of recent heavy rainfall, prompted the suspension on Wednesday of all of the wealthy region's main Rodalies commuter network, used by hundreds of thousands of people, while safety checks were carried out.

Rodalies services were expected to resume on Thursday but remained suspended as only six of 140 drivers reported for work, said Catalan regional government spokeswoman Silvia Paneque.

Service will resume after inspections involving the drivers, she said, with no date set.

The secretary general of the Semaf train driver union, Diego Martin Fernandez, told RAC 1 radio that a thorough review of infrastructure had been agreed but that "the procedure had not been respected".

"To restore confidence that the infrastructure meets safety conditions, we need guarantees," he said, denouncing fresh landslips on the lines.

Semaf has called a national strike for February 9 to 11, denouncing repeated safety failings.

Transport Minister Oscar Puente vowed to negotiate to have the strike called off and said the two tragedies were unrelated, defending the public transport system.

The list of incidents grew on Thursday after a commuter train in the southeastern region of Murcia hit a crane mounted on a truck, causing six light injuries.

Murcia emergency services said the victims were taken to hospital after the accident in the municipality of Alumbres, where the train did not derail.

The mayor of the nearby city of Cartagena, Noelia Arroyo, wrote on social media that the electricity company truck was working on cables belonging to a building next to the track.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 01:49:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/10e807e8-f6ce-11f0-8b48-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26020429259995-1.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Taiwan offers talks with Ukraine on weapons sanctions-busting</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/taiwan-offers-talks-with-ukraine-weapons-sanctions-busting-2026-01-23/</link><description>TAIPEI, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Taiwan President Lai Ching-te on Friday offered talks with Ukraine to crack down on sanctions-busting after Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy name-checked the island as a source of illicit missile components.

Since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, semiconductor powerhouse Taiwan has successively updated export controls to stop high-tech goods being used for military purposes, and has joined in wide-ranging Western-led sanctions against Moscow.

Speaking in Davos on Thursday, Zelenskiy said Russia would not be able to produce missiles without "critical components sourced from China, Europe, the United States, and Taiwan", showed excerpts published on the Ukraine president's website.

Responding on his X account in English, Lai said Taiwan has long worked with global partners to "staunchly support Ukraine through humanitarian aid &amp; coordinated sanctions".

"We welcome further exchanges of information with President @ZelenskyyUa to further clamp down on illegal 3rd country transshipment &amp; concealed end-use," he said, posting a picture of orchids in the colour of Ukraine's flag.

Lai said "there have been young Taiwanese who have sacrificed their lives to defend freedom in Ukraine," referring to volunteer soldiers who have died fighting against Russia.

"We remain clear: any assistance to the aggressor or violations of int'l embargoes &amp; export control regulations are unacceptable. We pray for peace to be restored to Ukraine soon."

Speaking to reporters in Taipei later on Friday, Lai said he welcomed Zelenskiy to pass on any information to Taiwan about sanctions busting.

"We are willing to strengthen controls on goods that are routed through third countries while concealing their final destination, to prevent them from entering Russia and to protect Ukraine," Lai added.

Reuters could not reach the Ukraine presidential office for comment outside of office hours.

In November, Taiwan said it was revising export controls to comply with the Wassenaar Arrangement, an international agreement aimed at preventing weapons proliferation, though diplomatically isolated Taiwan is not a signatory.

While senior Taiwan officials have spoken directly with some Ukrainian city mayors, there has been no publicly acknowledged direct contact between the two governments.

Taiwan and Ukraine do not have de facto embassies in each other's capitals, and Taiwanese humanitarian aid to Ukraine has mostly been coordinated by Taiwan's diplomatic offices in central and eastern Europe.

Taiwan has compared the Russian invasion of Ukraine to China's military threat against an island it claims as its own. Taiwan's government rejects Beijing's sovereignty claims.

Late last year, a senior Taiwanese military officer told a forum in Poland that if Russia defeats Ukraine it would embolden China in its behaviour towards Taiwan and that Taipei hoped Kyiv emerged victorious.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 03:44:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5425YUFTENKQBG7WGKZHER7FHQ.jpg?auth=c15a44c62d88d53bd890cb9879fd098f316a34141e21e616c95f22c8abab0046&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump revokes Canada's invitation to join Board of Peace</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/trump-says-he-is-withdrawing-canadas-invitation-board-peace-2026-01-23/</link><description>WASHINGTON/OTTAWA, Jan 22 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew on Thursday an invitation for Canada to join his Board of Peace initiative aimed at resolving global conflicts.

Trump's aboutface follows Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney's speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, where he openly decried powerful nations using economic integration as weapons and tariffs as leverage.

"Please let this Letter serve to represent that the Board of Peace is withdrawing its invitation to you regarding Canada’s joining, what will be, the most prestigious Board of Leaders ever assembled, at any time," Trump wrote in a Truth Social post directed at Carney.

Neither Carney's office nor the White House immediately responded to Reuters requests for comment on Thursday evening.

Last week, Carney's office said he had been invited to serve on the board and planned to accept.

Carney received a rare standing ovation in Davos after the speech, in which he urged nations to accept the end of a rules-based global order.

Canada, which recently signed a trade deal with China, can show how "middle powers" might act together to avoid being victimized by American hegemony, he added.

Trump retorted that Canada "lives because of the United States," and told listeners in Davos that Carney should be grateful for the United States’ previous largesse.

"Remember that, Mark, the next time you make your statements," he added, addressing Carney directly.

The withdrawal of Canada's invitation came hours after Trump officially launched the board, which was initially meant to cement a Gaza ceasefire .

Permanent members must help fund the board with a payment of $1 billion each, according to Trump.

"Once this board is completely formed, we can do pretty much whatever we want to do," Trump said in Switzerland on Thursday. "And we'll do it in conjunction with the United Nations.

The board's establishment was endorsed by a United Nations Security Council resolution as part of Trump's Gaza peace plan, and U.N. spokesperson Rolando Gomez said on Thursday that U.N. engagement with the board would only be in that context.

Member nations include Argentina, Bahrain, Morocco, Pakistan and Turkey. Other U.S. allies, such as Britain, France and Italy, have indicated they will not join for now.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 03:44:10 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/QTNMFNVLLVKIHKK5REGZSMJ3NY.jpg?auth=999c9747fcbacd3fe8e10151f5339f7f7cb729ebfcc7c1c48d7ac293c3a496e1&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China coast guard says it rescued Philippine crew near Scarborough Shoal</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-coast-guard-says-it-rescued-philippine-crew-near-scarborough-shoal-2026-01-23/</link><description>BEIJING, Jan 23 (Reuters) - The Chinese Coast Guard said on Friday it dispatched two vessels to rescue 21 Philippine crew members in a foreign cargo ship that capsized in waters near the Scarborough Shoal.

Trump has repeatedly left open the option of new military action against Iran after Washington backed and joined Israel's 12-day war in June aimed at degrading Iranian nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.

Trump said Thursday a US naval "armada" was heading toward the Gulf, adding: "We're watching Iran."

A fortnight of protests starting in late December shook Iran's clerical leadership under supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, but the movement has petered out in the face of a crackdown that activists say killed thousands, accompanied by an unprecedented internet blackout.

The prospect of immediate American action against Tehran appears to have receded, with both sides insisting on giving diplomacy a chance.

On his way back from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Trump told reporters on Air Force One the United States was sending a "massive fleet" toward Iran "just in case."

"I'd rather not see anything happen but we're watching them very closely," he added.

In a standoff marked by seesawing rhetoric, Trump had on Tuesday warned Iran's leaders the United States would "wipe them off the face of this Earth" if there was any attack on his life in response to a strike targeting Khamenei.

Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian in a speech Thursday accused the United States and Israel of stoking the protests as a "cowardly revenge... for the defeat in the 12-Day War".

Guards commander General Mohammad Pakpour warned Israel and the United States "to avoid any miscalculations, by learning from historical experiences and what they learned in the 12-day imposed war, so that they do not face a more painful and regrettable fate".

"The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and dear Iran have their finger on the trigger, more prepared than ever, ready to carry out the orders and measures of the supreme commander-in-chief," he said.

Pakpour's comments came in a written statement quoted by state television marking the national day in Iran to celebrate the Guards, whose mission is to protect the 1979 Islamic revolution from internal and external threats.

Activists accuse the Guards of playing a frontline role in the deadly crackdown on protests.

The group is sanctioned as a terrorist entity by countries including Australia, Canada and the United States, and campaigners have long urged similar moves from the EU and UK.

Another senior military figure, General Ali Abdollahi Aliabadi who leads the Iranian joint command headquarters, meanwhile warned that if America attacked, "all US interests, bases and centres of influence" would be "legitimate targets" for Iran's armed forces.

Giving their first official toll from the protests, Iranian authorities on Wednesday said 3,117 people were killed.

The statement from Iran's foundation for martyrs and veterans sought to draw a distinction between "martyrs", members of security forces or innocent bystanders, and what it called US-backed "rioters".

Of its toll of 3,117, it said 2,427 people were "martyrs".

Pezeshkian said Thursday that protest "is the natural right of citizens", but a distinction had to be drawn between protesters "whose hands are stained with the blood of innocent people".

However, rights groups say the heavy toll was caused by security forces firing directly on protesters and that the actual number of dead could be far higher, even more than 20,000.

Efforts to confirm the scale of the toll have been hampered by the national internet shutdown, with monitor Netblocks saying Thursday the blackout had surpassed "two full weeks".

"All the evidence gradually emerging from inside Iran shows that the real number of people killed in the protests is far higher than the official figure," said the director of the Iran Human Rights NGO Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam, saying the authorities' toll has "no credibility whatsoever".

Warning that their own current tolls do not reflect the true number of fatalities, IHR says it has verified at least 3,428 killings. Another NGO, US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA), has documented 4,902 deaths.

The alleged perpetrator did not have a gun licence and was on bail for domestic violence offences when the attack happened, New South Wales police western region Commander Andrew Holland told reporters.

"We don't know how the weapon came into the possession of the gunman ... that will form part of the investigation," Holland said.

A 19-year-old man was also injured in the attack on Thursday in the town of Lake Cargelligo, around 610 km (380 miles) west of Sydney, and he was taken to hospital in a serious but stable condition, police said.

Australian media reported one of the victims was a 25-year-old woman, who was about seven months pregnant.

An extensive search was underway in Lake Cargelligo, with a population of just over 1,000, with specialist personnel joining the search, police said.

The shooting comes a month after two gunmen opened fire at an event on Bondi Beach celebrating the Jewish festival of Hanukkah, killing 15 people in Australia's worst mass shooting in nearly three decades.

In response to that attack, Australia's parliament passed new laws on Tuesday enabling a national gun buyback scheme and tougher background checks for firearm licences.

New South Wales, which has the highest number of firearms of any Australian state, has also introduced laws limiting individuals to owning no more than four guns and requiring licence holders to be members of a gun club.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 04:44:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>South Korea repatriates 73 scam suspects from Cambodia in $33 mln online fraud probe</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/south-korea-repatriates-73-online-scam-suspects-cambodia-yonhap-news-says-2026-01-23/</link><description>INCHEON, South Korea, Jan 23 (Reuters) - South Korea has repatriated 73 people suspected of involvement in online scam operations in Cambodia and will question them over allegations they had defrauded more than 800 South Koreans of about $33 million, officials said.

The plane carrying the suspects, the largest such group to be returned so far, landed at Incheon International Airport on Friday.

Footage from South Korean broadcasters showed the suspected scammers, wearing masks and mostly clad in shorts and sandals, being escorted by police from the plane to a waiting bus.

"It's a big mistake if you think you can evade punishment if you commit a crime outside the country," a South Korean police official told a briefing at the airport.

"We will pursue crimes that harm our citizens to the end and demand that they take responsibility."

A foreign ministry official told the briefing that South Korea would continue to cooperate with Cambodia "until transnational scam crimes were eradicated".

The return of the group follows a joint investigation by both nations, a spokesperson for the Korean presidential office, Kang Yu-jung, told a separate briefing on Thursday.

Investigators uncovered seven scam centres, where the suspects are accused of defrauding 869 South Koreans of 49 billion won ($33 million) online, Kang said.

Among the suspects are a couple accused of extorting about 12 billion won from 104 South Koreans using deepfake technology to disguise their identities in romance scams, she said.

The couple are believed to have undertaken plastic surgery in a bid to avoid being traced by police, she added.

Another suspect is accused of being involved in extorting 19.4 billion won from retirees and entry-level employees by pretending to be a professional investor, according to the presidential office.

Cambodian authorities could not immediately be reached for comment.

In October, a group of 64 South Koreans was returned home over suspected scams, following the alleged murder of a South Korean college student tortured in Cambodia in August in a case linked to an employment scam.

The ATR 42-500 turboprop owned by aviation group Indonesia Air Transport (IAT) lost contact with air traffic control on Saturday at about 1:30 p.m. local time (0530 GMT) around the Maros region in South Sulawesi.

There were seven crew members and three passengers on board the plane, which was chartered by Indonesia's Marine Affairs and Fisheries Ministry to conduct air surveillance on its fisheries. The passengers were ministry staff members.

Andi Sultan, an official at South Sulawesi's rescue agency, said through tears during a video statement that authorities found the ninth and tenth bodies early on Friday, adding that the evacuation process was still ongoing.

The agency said separately on its Instagram account that 10 victims have been found.

Local rescuers previously discovered the wreckage of the plane in different locations around Mount Bulusaraung in the Maros region, about 1,500 km (930 miles) northeast of the sprawling island nation's capital, Jakarta.

Indonesia's National Transportation Safety Committee (KNKT), which probes transport accidents, is currently investigating the contents of the recently-found black box, its chief told local media this week.

Diplomatic efforts to end Europe's deadliest conflict since World War II have gained pace in recent months, though Moscow and Kyiv remain at odds over the key issue of territory in a post-war settlement.

US negotiators, led by envoy Steve Witkoff, talked with the Russian leader in Moscow into the early hours of Friday, according to a Kremlin statement.

Kremlin diplomatic adviser Yuri Ushakov told reporters their discussions had been "useful in every respect".

Witkoff and the US team are next flying to Abu Dhabi, where talks are expected to continue.

A Russian delegation, headed by General Igor Kostyukov, director of Russia's GRU military intelligence agency, will also head there "in the coming hours", according to Ushakov.

"It was agreed that the first meeting of a trilateral working group on security issues will take place today in Abu Dhabi," Ushakov added.

"We are genuinely interested in resolving (the conflict) through political and diplomatic means," he said, but added: "Until that happens, Russia will continue to achieve its objectives... on the battlefield."

Witkoff previously said he believed the two sides were "down to one issue", without elaborating.

Video published by the Kremlin showed a smiling Putin shaking hands with Witkoff, US President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and White House advisor Josh Gruenbaum.

The high-stakes meeting came just hours after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said a draft deal was "nearly, nearly ready" and that he and Trump had agreed on the issue of post-war security guarantees.

He also said the UK and France had already committed to forces on the ground.

Russia, which occupies around 20 percent of Ukraine, is pushing for full control of the country's eastern Donbas region as part of a deal.

But Kyiv has warned that ceding ground will embolden Moscow and says it will not sign a peace deal that fails to deter Russia from launching a renewed assault.

The full details of the upcoming talks in the United Arab Emirates have not been released, and it is not clear whether the Russian and Ukrainian officials will meet face-to-face.

Zelensky said these talks would last two days.

Trump repeated on Wednesday his oft-stated belief that Putin and Zelensky were close to a deal.

"I believe they're at a point now where they can come together and get a deal done. And if they don't, they're stupid -- that goes for both of them," he said after delivering a speech at Davos.

Zelensky, at his address in Davos, blasted the EU's lack of "political will" in countering Putin in a fiery address.

"Instead of becoming a truly global power, Europe remains a beautiful but fragmented kaleidoscope of small and middle powers," he said.

Trump's dramatic foreign policy pivots including a recent bid to take over Greenland -- an autonomous Danish territory -- have stirred worries in Europe about whether Washington can be trusted as a reliable security partner.

In his speech, Zelensky criticised Europe for pinning hopes on the United States defending them in case of aggression.

"Europe looks lost trying to convince the US President to change," Zelensky said.

Russian strikes this week have left most of Kyiv without electricity, with residents of 4,000 buildings without heat in sub-zero temperatures.

Russia, which launched its Ukraine offensive in February 2022, says its strikes are aimed at energy infrastructure fuelling Ukraine's "military-industrial complex".

Kyiv says the strikes are a war crime designed to wear down its civilian population into submission.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 04:46:02 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/4edaf2be-f80d-11f0-bf95-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26022757953996.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran warns 'finger on trigger' as Donald Trump says talks still possible</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260123-iran-warns-finger-on-trigger-as-donald-trump-says-talks-still-possible</link><description>The commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guards warned Washington Thursday that the force had its "finger on the trigger" in the wake of mass protests, as US President Donald Trump said Tehran still appeared interested in talks.

In a telephone call with Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Xi stressed that both countries are constructive forces in safeguarding world peace and improving global governance, the agency added.

"China is willing to remain a good friend and partner to Latin American and Caribbean countries," Xi told Lula, reiterating a long-time stance on regional ties .

It looked to advance the building of a China-Latin America community with a shared future, he added.

A 2024 strategic partnership to align China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) with Brazil's plans to boost farming, infrastructure, and the energy transition exemplifies solidarity and cooperation among Global South countries, Xi said.

At a Group of 20 meeting that year Xi unveiled measures related to the BRI as well as science and technology, aimed at support for the Global South.

Friday's talks came weeks after the Trump administration seized Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro to be prosecuted in the United States on narcotics charges.

That threw Caracas into political uncertainty, and set its Latin America and Caribbean neighbours worrying about similar interventions by force on their turf.

How much does Venezuela owe China, and how and why was the country getting debt payments after Venezuela's default?

Data on Venezuela's debt is sketchy, particularly since 2017 when U.S. sanctions triggered a sovereign default .

AidData, ‌a research lab at the U.S. university William &amp; Mary which tracks lending, estimated that official sector Chinese creditors extended loan commitments worth $106 billion to Venezuela between 2000 and 2018. Separately, they calculated that there was $44 billion outstanding in 2017.

Current estimates vary. Societe Generale puts the value of Venezuela's outstanding debt to China at roughly $10 billion - a figure AidData's Brad Parks said was consistent with their understanding. JP Morgan estimates ‌total obligations of $13 billion to $15 billion.

Parks said it was unclear whether Venezuela had repaid any of the ​principal of the outstanding loans since the 2017 default or had only been making interest payments.

Sources at state oil firm PDVSA said China granted Venezuela a grace period for the capital payments in 2019, allowing debt service payments to be compensated for by crude ‍cargoes.

Internal PDVSA documents put crude oil and fuel oil exports to China at 642,000 barrels per day, with a small fraction of that going to debt servicing.

Venezuela has not produced comprehensive, reliable debt statistics for decades. The last figures of any sort were released by the ⁠central bank in 2019, making it tough to determine what debts are outstanding and whether the country has taken on more.

The ‍International Monetary Fund, which tracks economies, debt and development, has not produced a comprehensive "Article IV" report on Venezuela since 2004.

This has left outside observers ‌to patch ‌together information based on sourcing, public comments by Venezuelan officials and movements of crude oil exports, the country's main revenue earner.

After U.S. sanctions were imposed, Venezuela's primary allies were Russia and China.

AidData's Parks said most of Venezuela's public debts to China were contracted with China Development Bank via oil-backed lending arrangements.

Cash proceeds from some of the oil sent to ⁠China, Parks said, went into a ⁠Beijing-controlled account and on ​to service the debts - even as sanctions and default kept many other creditors from getting paid.

The United States has said it will funnel proceeds of Venezuelan oil sales into a Qatar-based account it controls , from which Washington would have to send funds to China in ‍order to keep servicing the debt.

Comments from the Trump administration have made clear this is unlikely.

China's largest state-owned oil major, CNPC, also has producing assets in Venezuela. Sinovensa - its most significant joint venture with PDVSA - pumps roughly 110,000 barrels per day. How the U.S. will handle those cargoes is unclear.

Other creditors, ​including bondholders, are pushing their case in the auction of Venezuela's most valuable foreign ‍asset - the U.S. refining company Citgo. However, its location inside the United States means China is unlikely to join the fray.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 06:38:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/RX3O3RMDTFOTXO7LHX74GLH7PQ.jpg?auth=8537e31ea99efb62e64ed534318dc58e317af56a6ff1f01314852ae1c604f477&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Senior US defence official Colby to visit South Korea and Japan next week, Yonhap says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/senior-us-defence-official-colby-visit-south-korea-japan-next-week-yonhap-says-2026-01-23/</link><description>SEOUL, Jan 23 (Reuters) - U.S. Under Secretary of Defense for policy Elbridge Colby will visit South Korea from Sunday to Tuesday and discuss military alliance issues before travelling on to Japan, South Korea's Yonhap News Agency reported on Friday.

His talks with South Korean officials will likely touch on Seoul's proposed increase in defence spending and the modernisation of the two countries' military alliance, Yonhap said, citing an unnamed source.

South Korea's Defence Ministry declined to confirm the report, saying questions should be directed to the U.S. side.

Colby, the Pentagon's top defence and foreign policymaker, leads the implementation of U.S. defence strategy.

The two countries have been discussing President Donald Trump's push for U.S. allies to shoulder a greater share of their defence cost and Washington's realignment of its military footprint to ready its troops stationed around the world for wider missions.

South Korea hosts about 28,500 U.S. troops in combined defence against North Korea's military threat. Seoul raised its defence budget by 7.5% for this year.

South Korea is pursuing the construction if its own nuclear-powered submarines, a plan Trump has backed.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 07:28:58 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/OK6H26UDTVI5JPRCWMPSJXWCFM.jpg?auth=4974853dadcc4e266d73267c16701ee20530ce2982640f15825111bbe2e86c71&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Live: US, Ukraine and Russia to meet in Abu Dhabi for first trilateral talks</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260123-live-us-ukraine-russia-meet-abu-dhabi-first-trilateral-talks</link><description>A fire ​broke out at ⁠an oil depot in Russia’s central Penza region as ​a result ‍of debris falling from a ​downed drone, the regional governor ​said.

Klitschko added on ‍the Telegram ​messaging app that the buildings were being ‌re-connected for the ‍second time after an earlier Russian attack on January ‍9.

Russia, which occupies around 20 percent of Ukraine, is pushing for full control of the country’s eastern Donbas region as part of a deal. Kyiv, meanwhile, has warned that ceding ground will embolden Moscow and says it will not sign a peace deal that fails to deter Russia from launching a renewed assault later on.

Ukrainian, Russian and American negotiators are meeting in Abu Dhabi today to hold security talks on the war in Ukraine. It is the first time the three countries hold a trilateral meeting since Russia launched its full-scale invasion nearly four years ago.

The high-stakes meeting comes just a day after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said a draft deal was “nearly, nearly ready” and that he and US President Donald Trump had agreed on the issue of post-war security guarantees.

The US negotiating team will be headed by envoy Steve Witkoff, and the Russian side by General Igor Kostyukov, the director of Russia’s GRU military intelligence agency.

Ukraine’s delegation will be led by Secretary of the National Security and Defence Council, Rustem Umerov, and include Lieutenant General Andriy Gnatov, the chief of staff of the Ukrainian armed forces.

"We appreciate the invitation, but we decline," Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez told reporters late on Thursday after an EU summit in Brussels.

Washington says the body will help broker and monitor ceasefires, organise security arrangements and coordinate rebuilding in places emerging from war. The concept stems from Trump's Gaza peace plan.

Missing from the board's launch ceremony held at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland's Davos on Thursday were traditional U.S. allies such as Canada, Britain and all European Union members except Hungary and Bulgaria.

Sanchez cited consistency with Madrid's commitment to international law, the U.N. and multilateralism as the main reasons it was declining to participate.

Sanchez also said the Board of Peace did not include the Palestinian Authority.

Israel has joined the board, along with Middle Eastern countries such as Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 08:31:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/SWXIG3RI55OPTB52ZTSVJTYDLA.jpg?auth=1045abf201d9de52b58622e1a26f94de34ede83d35ff1ac63c13f1ab793b1522&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Seven miners shot dead in Nigeria's restive Plateau, youth group, official say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/seven-miners-shot-dead-nigerias-restive-plateau-youth-group-official-say-2026-01-23/</link><description>ABUJA, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Seven people were shot dead in an overnight attack at a mining site in Nigeria's central Plateau state, a local youth group and a state official said on Friday.

Plateau is one of several ethnically and religiously diverse hinterland states known as the Middle Belt, where communal conflict has claimed hundreds of lives in recent years.

The violence is often cast as ethno-religious conflict between nomadic Muslim herders and largely Christian farmers.

The Berom Youth Moulders-Association (BYM) said the victims, aged 15 to 28, had been killed late Wednesday in what it described as part of a pattern of coordinated attacks on Berom communities. Reuters could not independently confirm who was behind the assault.

Emmanuel Solomon, a senior aide to the Plateau governor, confirmed seven people had been killed in the attack.

Plateau police did not immediately comment, but a spokesperson for Operation Safe Haven, the military task force in the state, said troops had found seven bodies and spent cartridges at the scene, adding that the victims were miners who had remained at the site despite a ban on night-time mining.

U.S. President Donald Trump has said Nigerian Christians are being persecuted and killed in record numbers, and launched an airstrike a month ago against alleged perpetrators.

The Nigerian government denies that there is systematic persecution of Christians but says it is tackling Islamists and other violent groups that have attacked both Muslim and Christian civilians, often for ransom.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 09:31:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Uganda detains 2,000 opposition supporters, kills 30 after disputed election, army chief says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/uganda-detains-2000-opposition-supporters-kills-30-after-disputed-election-army-2026-01-23/</link><description>NAIROBI, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Uganda's military chief said on Friday that authorities had detained 2,000 opposition supporters, killed 30 and were hunting for more following a disputed presidential election in which his father Yoweri Museveni, won a seventh term.

Museveni, 81, who has led the East African nation for nearly four decades, was declared to have resoundingly defeated Bobi Wine, leader of the opposition National Unity Platform (NUP) party in the January 15 vote, held during an internet blackout.

Wine, a former musician whose legal name is Robert Kyagulanyi, rejected the election result, alleging widespread irregularities including ballot stuffing, and went into hiding.

In a series of overnight social media posts, military chief Muhoozi Kainerugaba, Museveni's son, gave the first details of the arrests and killings of NUP supporters, describing them as hooligans and terrorists.

"So far we have killed 30 NUP terrorists," Kainerugaba said on X, without explaining the circumstances of the deaths. "Most NUP terrorist leaders are in hiding. We shall get them all," he said in another post.

The government has accused Wine's supporters of violence during the election while the opposition says its members were attacked by security forces. Reuters has not been able to authenticate the allegations.

A police spokesperson declined to give any further comment on the situation. Military spokesperson Chris Magezi could not be reached for comment.

Reacting to the situation in Uganda after the election, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres expressed concern over the arrests and violent incidents involving opposition figures and supporters, spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said late on Thursday.

"He (the Secretary General) notes the importance of restraint by all actors and respect for the rule of law and Uganda's international human rights obligations," Dujarric said.

Wine has alleged that hundreds of his supporters have been illegally detained in recent months, targeted for their political affiliation and said this was aimed at instilling fear and intimidating his supporters.

Uganda's opposition parties and rights activists say some of those arrested are held in unofficial detention centres where some are tortured .

The crackdown has intensified with the recent detention of Muwanga Kivumbu , a lawmaker and Wine's deputy in the NUP, on Thursday. Two other senior NUP figures have been reported missing for days.

Wine, 43, has said he fled his residence after a raid by security personnel shortly after the election.

Museveni is widely believed to be grooming Kainerugaba as his successor, and the military chief has previously expressed presidential ambitions .</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 09:32:43 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/EQOZD5OQ3JMOTK2ZYJF7IFNKNA.jpg?auth=9db6215136a992a88e484d149629544bc02fd43820f7bd3ff366b5e741cac1f7&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China rejects UN experts' concerns for alleged forced labour in Xinjiang</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-rejects-un-experts-concerns-alleged-forced-labour-xinjiang-2026-01-23/</link><description>BEIJING, Jan 23 (Reuters) - China defended its human rights record on Friday after UN experts said alleged forced labour , opens new tab involving Uyghurs and Tibetans in the Xinjiang region and other parts of China might amount to "enslavement".

The experts said there was "a persistent pattern" of alleged forced labour affecting Uyghur, Kazakh and Kyrgyz minority groups as well as Tibetans in Xinjiang and across multiple provinces.

Such forced labour is enabled through a government-mandated poverty alleviation programme which coerces Uyghurs and members of other minority groups into jobs in Xinjiang and other regions, they said in a statement released on Thursday.

"In many cases, the coercive elements are so severe that they may amount to forcible transfer and/or enslavement as a crime against humanity," they said.

The experts' concerns are "completely fabricated" and groundless, Guo Jiakun, a spokesperson for China's foreign ministry, said in a press briefing on Friday.

The Chinese government has always been committed to promoting and protecting human rights, Guo said, urging the experts to "perform their duties impartially and objectively and not become tools and accomplices of anti-China forces".

Human rights organisations and Western governments including the United States and Canada have repeatedly raised concerns about human rights violations against Uyghurs and other Muslim minority groups in Xinjiang, allegations which Beijing denies .</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 09:33:03 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WKX5XDYIZ5MKPCGQAHOKPI7OYE.jpg?auth=885bd5f6fa559710f7dc0e1ad560aa560b0ab558eb324e55f499f892d5be3741&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UN rights body holds emergency session on Iran's protest crackdown</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/un-rights-body-holds-emergency-session-irans-protest-crackdown-2026-01-23/</link><description>GENEVA, Jan 23 (Reuters) - The U.N. Human Rights Council will hold an emergency session on Friday to discuss the "alarming violence" used in Iran against protesters, while a group of states will call on United Nations' investigators to document alleged abuses for future trials.

Rights groups say thousands, including bystanders , were killed during the unrest , which represented the biggest challenge to Iran's clerical government since 2022.

At least 50 countries backed the call for a special session of the U.N. Human Rights Council to address credible reports of violence, crackdowns on protesters and violations of international human rights law across the country, according to a letter drafted by Iceland.

"The scale of the crimes is unprecedented," Payam Akhavan, a former U.N. prosecutor with Iranian-Canadian nationality, told Reuters ahead of the session, where he is set to speak.

"We are trying to set the stage for transitional justice in Iran, for the country’s Nuremberg moment, should that come to pass," he said, referring to the international criminal trials of Nazi leaders following World War Two.

Iran's diplomatic mission did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Authorities have blamed the unrest and deaths on "terrorists and rioters" backed by exiled opponents and foreign adversaries, the United States and Israel.

The proposal before the Geneva body seeks to extend by two years the mandate of a U.N. investigation set up in 2022 after the previous wave of protests. It would also launch an urgent investigation into violations and crimes linked to the latest unrest that began on December 28 "for potential future legal proceedings".

It was not clear who would cover the costs amid a U.N. funding crisis that has stalled other probes .

Human rights advocates hope that the emergency session will pressure Iran's government.

"The session sends a strong message to Iranian authorities that the international community is closely monitoring their actions and will not tolerate the suppression of dissenting voices," said Azadeh Pourzand, the spokesperson for Impact Iran, which is a coalition of 19 non-governmental organizations campaigning for human rights in Iran.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 09:33:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/AOB4NKE7G5OX7GPK6SAJCBQ55E.jpg?auth=049c6c73aeff7e2a19748afbc8c658afc98d5fc32ec6df5049cc455478380877&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Orban rebukes Zelenskiy as Hungarian election looms</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/orban-rebukes-zelenskiy-hungarian-election-looms-2026-01-23/</link><description>BUDAPEST, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Hungary's Viktor Orban criticised Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, describing him as "a man in a desperate position" whose "war efforts" he would not support, intensifying his anti-Ukrainian campaign ahead of pivotal April elections.

As Hungary's economy stagnates and Orban's Fidesz party trails the opposition Tisza party in most polls, the prime minister has framed the parliamentary election due on April 12 as a choice between war and peace, portraying Ukraine as undeserving of financial support.

In a Facebook post directly addressed to Zelenskiy, late on Thursday Orban said:

"You are a man in a desperate position who, for the fourth year now, has been unable or unwilling to bring a war to an end - despite the fact that the President of the United States has provided every possible assistance to do so."

"Therefore, no matter how much you flatter me, we cannot support your war efforts," the nationalist leader added, again rejecting financial aid for Ukraine.

Zelenskiy on Thursday criticised Europe for being a "fragmented kaleidoscope of small and middle powers" lacking the courage to act decisively and facing a dark future unless it stood up to U.S. and Russian power.

Orban, who has maintained close ties with Moscow and with Russian President Vladimir Putin, has sought to associate Hungarian opposition leader Peter Magyar with Brussels and Ukraine, and accused Ukraine of wanting a change in government.

"The Ukrainians will be active participants in the Hungarian campaign, because they have a vested interest in a change of government in Hungary," Orban told a briefing early on Friday in Brussels.

Ukraine's government could not immediately be reached for comment.

Orban said his government would launch a "national petition" that Hungarians can sign to "tell Brussels that Hungarians won't pay to Ukraine."

This primarily targets rural voters and echoes Orban's past anti-migrant campaigns.

Magyar has said Tisza supports peace in Ukraine, rejects the idea of conscription, and will not support any escalation in the war.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 09:33:26 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/N2NJKMYI7NPN7FUUCTCYN7USM4.jpg?auth=eb1a1cb0e3832026870a22a3433444745aa0848cb51414eb2bc917d3515a1476&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>TikTok sets up joint venture to avert threat of US ban</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260123-tiktok-sets-up-joint-venture-to-avert-threat-of-us-ban</link><description>TikTok announced Thursday it has established a majority American-owned joint venture to operate its US business, allowing the company to avoid a ban over its Chinese ownership .

The video-sharing app is a global digital entertainment powerhouse but its mass appeal and links to China have raised concerns over privacy and national security.

The TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC will serve more than 200 million users and 7.5 million businesses while implementing strict safeguards for data protection and content moderation, the company said.

The new structure responds to a law passed under US President Donald Trump 's predecessor Joe Biden that forced Chinese-owned ByteDance to sell TikTok's US operations or face a ban in its biggest market.

Trump welcomed and claimed credit for the deal, but also thanked Chinese President Xi Jinping for approving it.

"I am so happy to have helped in saving TikTok!" Trump said in a post on Truth Social late Thursday.

"It will now be owned by a group of Great American Patriots and Investors, the Biggest in the World, and will be an important Voice."

"I would also like to thank President Xi, of China, for working with us and, ultimately, approving the Deal," he added.

ByteDance retains a 19.9 percent stake in the joint venture – keeping its ownership below the 20 percent threshold stipulated by the law.

Three investors – Silver Lake, Oracle and Abu Dhabi-based AI investment fund MGX – each hold 15 percent stakes. Oracle's executive chairman Larry Ellison is a longtime Trump ally.

Other investors include Dell Family Office, affiliates of Susquehanna International Group and General Atlantic.

The joint venture will retain decision-making authority over trust and safety policies and content moderation for US users.

But TikTok's global entities will manage international product integration and commercial activities including e-commerce and advertising.

Under the arrangement, US user data will be stored in Oracle's secure cloud environment, with cybersecurity audited by third-party experts and adhering to federal standards, TikTok said.

Jasmine Enberg, co-CEO of Scalable, a media company focused on the creator economy, said TikTok users would be relieved by the deal but that there were "still big questions about how this will all play out."

"Behind the scenes, TikTok is likely working hard to assure advertisers it will remain business as normal," she said.

"While the need for users to download a new app seems unlikely, brand partners will want to know that their TikTok strategies won't be disrupted."

The joint venture will be governed by a seven-member, majority-American board including TikTok CEO Shou Chew and executives from investment firms.

TikTok executive Adam Presser was appointed CEO of the new entity, with Will Farrell serving as chief security officer.

The 2024 law came as US policymakers, including Trump in his first presidency, warned that China could use TikTok to mine Americans' data or exert influence through its algorithm.

But Trump, crediting the app for his appeal with young voters, delayed enforcement through successive executive orders, most recently extending the deadline to January 22.

The deal largely confirms an outline announced to staff by Chew last month.

In September, one-time venture capitalist and Vice President JD Vance said the US entity would be valued at about $14 billion but it would ultimately be up to investors to determine pricing.

That month, Trump said a new venture had been agreed with China and would meet the law's requirements.

Trump specifically named Ellison, one of the world's richest men, as a major player in the arrangement.

Ellison has returned to the spotlight through his dealings with Trump, who has brought his old friend into major AI partnerships with OpenAI.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 09:34:10 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/eb507380-f80d-11f0-820c-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/f2dae84f7d10c591d8495f13feb5f0f0e5385770.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Explainer: How attacks on Ukraine's nuclear power substations could cause a total blackout</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/how-attacks-ukraines-nuclear-power-substations-could-cause-total-blackout-2026-01-23/</link><description>KYIV, Jan 23 (Reuters) - In the midst of extreme cold weather, Russia has intensified its attacks on Ukraine's energy system, which relies almost entirely on electricity produced by nuclear power plants and has already lost half of its generating capacity.

President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said that Russia intends to deprive Ukraine of this energy by planning to hit substations that supply nuclear power to consumers, plunging the country into a complete blackout.

Ukraine currently operates three nuclear power plants with a total capacity of 7.7 gigawatts. The fourth plant, Europe's largest, Zaporizhzhia NPP, is occupied by Russia and not operating.

The current generation deficit is about 10 gigawatts, which is only partially compensated for by imports, meaning authorities must implement large-scale rolling blackouts during which entire regions are left without power for hours.

One industry source, who asked not to be identified due to the sensitivity of the subject, said nuclear generation was now providing up to 80% of the power consumed in Ukraine, which has virtually no other generating capacity left intact.

With most of Ukraine's thermal power generation knocked out by Russian air strikes, the removal of the nuclear power stations would cause cities' infrastructure to collapse, the industry source said.

Zelenskiy previously said that domestic generation and imports cover only about 60% of demand.

Economy Minister Oleksiy Sobolev said at this week's World Economic Forum in Davos that Russian shelling since October 2025 has damaged 8.5 gigawatts of generating capacity in Ukraine, including thermal and hydroelectric power plants.

Nuclear power units are useless without powerful substations that can deliver the generated electricity to high-voltage grids and then, through smaller substations, to consumers.

Oleksandr Kharchenko, director of the influential independent Energy Research Centre in Kyiv, said that 10 key substations transported more than half the electricity consumed by Ukraine from nuclear power plants.

Some of the substations are located directly next to the nuclear power plants, while others are dozens or even hundreds of kilometres (miles) away.

Rafael Grossi, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said this week that key Ukrainian power substations had already been "affected" by the latest Russian missile salvoes.

Kharchenko said that so far there had been no strikes on substations at nuclear power plants, but during the almost four years of war , opens new tab , Russia has attacked substations located far from power units at least 60 times.

The attacks target rare powerful transformers but protective measures have been put in place around them, and as a result of the strikes, only auxiliary equipment has been damaged.

Usually, such damage takes only a couple of days to repair and to return the substation to operation, Kharchenko said.

Still, the industry source said that nuclear power plants have been forced to reduce the output from nuclear reactors many times due to such attacks.

Analysts and energy experts say the consequences of a missile strike on substations located near nuclear reactors are unpredictable as an explosion - even if it did not damage a reactor itself - could damage the system of piping that contains radioactive water, as well as other nuclear equipment.

Some substations are located just a few hundred metres (yards) from reactors, and hitting them could have unpredictable consequences.

An industry source noted that the reactor buildings were constructed of thick concrete and would not be easily penetrated by a drone's warhead, although a fire could damage other vulnerable objects of the power station. And they would not withstand a hit by a ballistic missile, the source said.

Ukraine already experienced a nuclear disaster when, in 1986, a power unit at the Chornobyl nuclear power plant exploded, rendering tens of thousands of hectares of land uninhabitable just 80 kilometres (50 miles) from Kyiv.

Kharchenko said that Russian missiles aimed at substations could simply hit the reactor or damage other key equipment - mainly kilometres of pipelines carrying radioactive water, turbine equipment or control systems at the nuclear power plant.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 10:26:19 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/C6Q2F6OW4FIJXFC7ONCRST6EPQ.jpg?auth=cbed8cffadccd6905fcf29b360fc951f7500fc4b0cc8bc7cf1c3958293e4f3c7&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Zelenskiy says territorial issue to be discussed at trilateral talks in UAE</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/zelenskiy-says-territorial-issue-be-discussed-trilateral-talks-uae-2026-01-23/</link><description>KYIV, Jan 23 (Reuters) - President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Friday that the vital question of territory in Ukraine's war with Russia would be discussed at U.S.-brokered trilateral talks in Abu Dhabi on Friday and Saturday.

Kyiv is under mounting U.S. pressure to secure a peace deal in the nearly four-year-old war with Moscow, which has demanded Ukraine give up its entire eastern area of Donbas before it stops fighting.

Responding to questions in a WhatsApp media chat a day after meeting U.S. President Donald Trump for talks both leaders described as positive, Zelenskiy said the issue would be a top priority of talks.

"The question of Donbas is key. It will be discussed how the three sides...see this in Abu Dhabi today and tomorrow."

The talks will begin on Friday evening, Zelenskiy's aide said.

Putin's demand that Ukraine surrender the 20% it still holds of the eastern Donetsk region have proven a key stumbling block. Zelenskiy has refused to give up land that Russia has not been able to capture in four years of grinding, attritional warfare.

The Ukrainian leader added that a deal on U.S. security guarantees for Kyiv was ready, and that he was only waiting on Trump for a specific date and place to sign it.

Ukraine has sought strong security guarantees from allies in the event of a peace deal to prevent Russia, which has shown little interest in ending the war, from invading again.

Asked about using Moscow's frozen assets to fund reconstruction on Russian territory, Zelenskiy dismissed as "nonsense" the idea of using the money to rebuild "their parts".

Russia had previously floated the idea of using frozen assets to pay for the recovery of Russian-occupied territory inside Ukraine.

"Of course, we will fight (to use the assets for Ukraine), and it is absolutely fair regarding the use of all frozen assets (by Ukraine)," Zelenskiy said.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 10:26:43 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/OCFAICI7BVKYJDAC3JEX3JPFE4.jpg?auth=d87e87c401aecf9dba143e438b26b2405793b678283ff539d4a003d82c1f4a9d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Denmark, NATO seek to boost Arctic security amid Greenland crisis</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/denmark-nato-seek-boost-arctic-security-amid-greenland-crisis-2026-01-23/</link><description>COPENHAGEN, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said on Friday she had agreed with NATO chief Mark Rutte that the alliance needs to boost security in the Arctic following weeks of turmoil over U.S. President Donald Trump's threat to annex Greenland.

The governments of Denmark and Greenland, a Danish autonomous territory, insist that sovereignty over the island is not up for discussion, but have said they are open to talks on a wide range of other topics.

Trump said on Thursday he had secured total and permanent U.S. access to Greenland after talks with Rutte, while the NATO chief said allies would have to step up efforts to ward off threats from Russia and China in the high north.

"We agree that NATO must increase its engagement in the Arctic. Defense and security in the Arctic is a matter for the entire alliance," Frederiksen said in a social media post on Friday, along with a photo of herself and Rutte in Brussels.

Rutte said he was working with the Danish leader to enhance deterrence and defence.

Frederiksen will travel to Greenland's capital Nuuk later on Friday to meet with the island's prime minister.

Denmark's foreign minister said on Friday that diplomats from Denmark and the United States had met in Washington on Thursday, establishing a plan for how to proceed.

"We will not communicate when those (future) meetings are, because what is needed now is to take the drama out of this... we need a calm process," Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said.

A source familiar with the matter said on Thursday that Rutte and Trump had agreed in Davos on further talks between the U.S., Denmark and Greenland on updating a 1951 agreement that governs U.S. military access and presence on the Arctic island.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 10:26:54 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/SOB6QXIMQZNXHJ7T2TQHNF4DHY.jpg?auth=a94fde3b8689313912fac9f75a8d72f0d7f16963a10c3be405a4a73bf8cdec7c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>France to hold call with G7, Nordics on urgent Ukraine energy support</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/france-hold-call-with-g7-nordics-urgent-ukraine-energy-support-2026-01-23/</link><description>PARIS, Jan 23 (Reuters) - France will hold a call on Friday with G7 countries as well as Nordic and Baltic states to coordinate support for Ukraine’s energy grid after Russian bombings left hundreds of thousands of people without power and heating , its foreign minister said.

Electrical engineers have been working around the clock in hazardous conditions for weeks after Russia escalated attacks on Ukraine's grid during an extreme cold snap.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has declared an energy emergency after sustained Russian strikes over winter knocked out power generation and distribution facilities.

"He continues to shell Ukrainian cities and energy infrastructure. We will continue to support Ukraine," French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot told BFM television.

He said France would supply Ukraine with the equivalent of 13 extra megawatts of electricity and around 100 generators to replace destroyed infrastructure.

Other countries would also pledge assistance during the meeting later on Friday, he said.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 10:27:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/6DOXEVBFTZOMVMIMVZP5D3KTSU.jpg?auth=5d864601da2117bee73d83f56d47d6e27418de502ba747dec89a2ce79f832424&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran: IAEA must clarify stance on June attacks before inspecting bombed sites</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-iaea-must-clarify-stance-june-attacks-before-inspecting-bombed-sites-2026-01-23/</link><description>Jan 23 (Reuters) - The U.N. nuclear watchdog must clarify its stance on U.S. and Israeli attacks on Iran's nuclear sites last June before inspectors are allowed to visit those facilities, Iranian media on Friday quoted the country's atomic chief as saying.

Mohammad Eslami said the inspections so far had been limited to undamaged sites and he criticised the watchdog for letting Israeli and U.S. pressure influence its actions.

Eslami made his comments in response to the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, who said on Tuesday that the standoff over inspections "cannot go on forever".

Grossi has not explicitly condemned or criticised the attacks nor has he formally outlined a protocol for inspecting the damaged facilities.

Access to sites that were attacked needs "a specific protocol", Eslami said, adding: "When a military strike occurs and there are environmental risks, it must be defined and a guideline must be designed."

"The agency has to clarify its position regarding the military attacks on the nuclear facilities that have been registered by the agency and are under its supervision so we can understand what role they play," state TV quoted Eslami as having told reporters in Tehran on Thursday.

He said Tehran had submitted a statement at the IAEA's General Conference last September demanding that attacks on nuclear sites be prohibited. But it was not placed on the agenda and was ignored, he said.

"It is unrealistic, unprofessional and unfair that, because of pressure from Israel and the U.S., he [Grossi] is putting pressure on us," Eslami said.

Grossi told Reuters on Tuesday that the IAEA had inspected all 13 declared nuclear facilities in Iran that were not targeted last June but had been unable to inspect any of the three key sites that were bombed - Natanz, Fordow and Isfahan.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 10:27:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/K7G3EN374JIF5INVO5RESVQREA.jpg?auth=5a34deb191fbf93789a70fe5e29af973ad1d70af8a869c382d180b70205aabc8&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Syrian government says it controls prison in Raqqa with Islamic State-linked detainees</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/syrian-government-says-it-controls-prison-raqqa-with-islamic-state-linked-2026-01-23/</link><description>Jan 23 (Reuters) - Syria's Interior Ministry said on Friday it had taken over al-Aktan prison in the city of Raqqa in northeastern Syria, a facility that was formerly under the control of Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF).

The prison has been holding detainees linked to the militant group Islamic State, and witnessed clashes in its vicinity this week between advancing Syrian government forces and the SDF.

It was not immediately clear how many IS detainees remain in al-Aktan prison as the U.S. military has started transferring up to 7,000 prisoners linked to the militant Islamist group from Syrian jails to neighbouring Iraq. U.S. officials say the detainees are citizens of many countries, including in Europe.

"Specialized teams were formed from the counter-terrorism department and other relevant authorities to take over the tasks of guarding and securing the prison and controlling the security situation inside it", the Interior Ministry said in a statement.

Under a sweeping integration deal agreed on Sunday, responsibility for prisons housing IS detainees was meant to be transferred to the Syrian government.

The SDF said on Monday it was battling Syrian government forces near al-Aktan and that the seizure of the prison by the government forces "could have serious security repercussions that threaten stability and pave the way for a return to chaos and terrorism".

The U.S. transfer of IS prisoners follows the rapid collapse of Kurdish-led forces in northeast Syria. Concerns over prison security intensifed after the escape on Tuesday of roughly 200 low-level Islamic State fighters from Syria's Shaddadi prison. Syrian government forces later recaptured many of them.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 10:27:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/N24QWVGDQVOJFCSVW5HTFPEFBY.jpg?auth=0a4c7f9e810c283b5462907ea14e0a9b58ec778b328257e31282543fdac5506e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Who is leading Russia's delegation at the Ukraine talks in Abu Dhabi?</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/who-is-leading-russias-delegation-ukraine-talks-abu-dhabi-2026-01-23/</link><description>MOSCOW, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Russian Admiral Igor Kostyukov is set to head Moscow's team at trilateral security talks with the U.S. and Ukraine on Friday in Abu Dhabi, as part of efforts to reach a deal to end the war in Ukraine.

What do we know about Kostyukov?

Kostyukov is the director of Russia's military intelligence organisation, known as the GRU. Born in 1961, he received a naval education and went on to serve as a military diplomat, which included a posting as a military attache to the Russian embassy in Greece in 2004.

After he was transferred to the GRU, Kostyukov participated in operations in Syria, according to the RBC newspaper. In 2018, he became acting head of the GRU upon the illness of his boss, Igor Korobov, and full-time head following Korobov's death. He was the GRU's first head with a naval background and became an admiral in 2019.

President Vladimir Putin has previously sent Kostyukov to participate in talks on Ukraine. He was a member of a Russian delegation that met with Ukrainian counterparts in May 2025 in Istanbul, the first face-to-face talks between the warring sides in three years.

Kostyukov has played a role in other high-profile foreign policy discussions. Last June, he joined Putin, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Kremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov at a meeting with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi in the Kremlin shortly after the United States conducted attacks on Iran's nuclear sites , opens new tab .

The GRU has been thrust into the international spotlight several times during Kostyukov's tenure there.

In March 2018, when Kostyukov was serving as the GRU's first deputy head, Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were poisoned by a nerve agent in the English city of Salisbury.

A UK inquiry found last year that a team of GRU military intelligence officers had attempted to murder Skripal. Russia has always denied any involvement in the attack, casting the accusations as anti-Russian propaganda.

Kostyukov was put under sanctions by the United States in 2016. In 2019, the European Union sanctioned him and several GRU colleagues over the Salisbury poisoning. He is also under sanctions by Britain and several other Western countries.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 10:27:44 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/P74XBQ4WLFNABNGCKGJYGER3OA.jpg?auth=2f74e3092a041abf779f345f1aa51690457923fa6e6b492b0dec2aa454d6b7d9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>ICE detains 5-year-old in Minnesota, school official says he was used as ‘bait’</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260123-ice-detains-5-year-old-minnesota-school-official-says-he-was-used-as-bait</link><description>A 5-year-old boy arriving home from preschool in Minnesota was taken by federal agents along with his father to a detention facility in Texas, school officials and the family’s lawyer said, making him the fourth student from his Minneapolis suburb to be detained by immigration officers in recent weeks.

Federal agents took Liam Conejo Ramos from a running car in the family’s driveway Tuesday afternoon, Columbia Heights Public Schools Superintendent Zena Stenvik told reporters Wednesday. The officers told him to knock on the door to his home to see if other people were inside, “essentially using a 5-year-old as bait”, she said.

The father told the child’s mother, who was inside the home and has not been named, not to open the door, Stenvik told reporters Thursday.

School officials said the agents would not leave Liam with another adult who lives at the home or an official from the school district. But on Thursday, Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in an online post that the father asked for the child to stay with him and that they are together at an immigration lockup in Dilley, Texas.

The family, who came to the US in 2024, has an active asylum case and had not been ordered to leave the country, Stenvik said.

“Why detain a 5-year-old?” she asked. “You cannot tell me that this child is going to be classified as a violent criminal.”

McLaughlin said in a statement Wednesday that “ICE did NOT target a child.” She said Immigration and Customs Enforcement was arresting the child’s father, Adrian Alexander Conejo Arias, who McLaughlin said is from Ecuador and in the US illegally. He fled on foot, “abandoning his child”, she said.

“For the child’s safety, one of our ICE officers remained with the child while the other officers apprehended Conejo Arias,” McLaughlin said, adding that parents are given the choice to be removed with their children or have them placed with a person of their choosing.

Minnesota has become a major focus of federal immigration sweeps. Greg Bovino, a US Customs and Border Protection official who has been the face of the crackdowns, said immigration officers have made about 3,000 arrests in Minnesota in the last six weeks.

Stenvik suggested that the father did not run. She said another adult who lives at the home was outside when the father and son were taken, but agents would not leave Liam with that person.

Mary Granlund, school board chair for Columbia Heights Public Schools, told reporters Thursday that she had told agents she would take the child before they left with him.

Rachel James, a Columbia Heights city council member who lives nearby the family, said she saw another neighbour from across the street tell the agents they had papers authorising them to take care of Liam on behalf of the parents. The agents ignored them, James said.

The family’s lawyer, Marc Prokosch, said Thursday that he assumes Liam and his father are in a family holding cell but that they have not been able to have “direct contact” with them.

“We’re looking at our legal options to see if we can free them either through some legal mechanisms or through moral pressure,” he said at a news conference.

Vice President JD Vance met with Minneapolis leaders Thursday and said he heard the “terrible story” but later learned the boy was only detained, not arrested.

“Well, what are they supposed to do? Are they supposed to let a 5-year-old child freeze to death? Are they not supposed to arrest an illegal alien in the United States of America?” said Vance, noting that he is the parent of a 5-year-old.

Vance was not asked about why immigration officers allegedly would not leave the boy with the other adult who lives at the home and offered to take him.

Families are reporting that children are malnourished, extremely ill and suffering profoundly from prolonged detention at the Dilley lockup, where conditions are worse than ever, said Leecia Welch, chief legal counselor at Children’s Rights. Welch visited the facility last week as part of a lawsuit over the welfare of immigrant children in federal custody.

“The number of children had skyrocketed and significant numbers of children had been detained for over 100 days,” Welch said. The administration in December acknowledged that about 400 children had faced extended detention.

“Nearly every child we spoke to was sick,” Welch said.

Columbia Heights Public Schools has five schools and about 3,400 students from pre-K to 12th grade, according to its website. Most come from immigrant families, Stenvik said.

Before Liam, a 17-year-old was taken Tuesday while heading to school, and a 10-year-old and a 17-year-old have also been taken, Stenvik said. Attendance has dropped over the past two weeks, including one day where about one-third of the students were out from school, she said.

“Over the last few weeks, ICE agents have been roaming our neighbourhoods, circling our schools, following our buses, coming into our parking lot multiple times and taking our kids,” said Stenvik, adding that this is causing “trauma”.

Ella Sullivan, Liam’s teacher, described him as “kind and loving.”

“His classmates miss him,” she said. “And all I want is for him to be safe and back here.”</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 10:28:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/26265f32-f837-11f0-a48a-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-22T214535Z-511562760-RC225JALNI4I-RTRMADP-3-USA-TRUMP-MINNESOTA-CHILD.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump's NATO front line comments 'deeply disappointing', UK minister says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/trumps-nato-front-line-comments-deeply-disappointing-uk-minister-says-2026-01-23/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 23 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's comments that NATO troops stayed off the front line in Afghanistan were "deeply disappointing", a British minister said on Friday, noting that many European soldiers had died supporting American-led operations.

Criticising NATO in a Fox News interview on Thursday, Trump said the United States had "never needed" the alliance and that its allies stayed "a little off the front lines" in Afghanistan.

"Many, many British soldiers and many soldiers from other European NATO allies gave their lives in support of American-led missions in places like Afghanistan and Iraq," junior minister Stephen Kinnock told Sky News.

"I think anybody who seeks to criticise what [our armed forces] have done and the sacrifices that they make is plainly wrong," he added.

Britain lost 457 military personnel during its 20-year deployment in Afghanistan.

More than 150 Canadians were killed along with 90 French service personnel, while Denmark - which has been under heavy pressure from Trump to sell its semi-autonomous region of Greenland to the U.S. - lost 44 troops, one of NATO's highest per-capita death rates.

Kinnock also recalled that the U.S. was the only NATO member ever to invoke the alliance's collective-defence clause, Article 5, which treats an attack on one as an attack on all, prompting allies to rally in support of Washington after the September 11, 2001 attacks.

He added that the NATO alliance was the most successful international security pact in "the history of the world", and that the U.S. and its European partners, including Britain, played a vital role.

Other British politicians noted that Trump had avoided the draft for the Vietnam War, citing bone spurs in his feet.

"Trump avoided military service 5 times," Ed Davey, leader of Britain's centrist Liberal Democrats, wrote on X. "How dare he question their sacrifice."</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 10:52:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/W2CNGGHRIBKYNJ53Z4LDWPMDJI.jpg?auth=83b12f3fa3232ad55571891633647df5be2477f8ce0404df1de91944b5474c61&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>French government survives no-confidence vote over budget process</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/french-government-survives-first-no-confidence-vote-2026-budget-2026-01-23/</link><description>PARIS, Jan 23 (Reuters) - The French government survived on Friday the first of two votes of no-confidence in parliament called over its decision to ram through the income part of the 2026 budget without giving the National Assembly the final say.

269 lawmakers voted in favor of the no-confidence motion presented by the hard-left France Unbowed together with the Greens and Communists. 288 votes were required to bring down the government.

A second vote will follow shortly. If that vote fails too, Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu will again invoke article 49.3 of the constitution to force the expenditure part of the budget through the National Assembly - a move that will almost certainly trigger further votes of no confidence.

President Emmanuel Macron's government is having to circumvent parliament after months of negotiations failed to deliver a deficit-taming finance bill that would pass in a lower house where no party has a working majority.

In the hunt for a budget, Macron lost two governments and saw France plunged into turmoil rarely seen since the 1958 creation of the Fifth Republic, the current system of government.

With France depending on an emergency rollover budget from last year to keep afloat, Lecornu made last-minute concessions earlier this month to secure the agreement of Socialists to not topple the government if it resorted to using the special constitutional powers.

Le Pen said government opponents who supported Lecornu in the confidence vote would pay the price in future elections, including local elections in March and presidential elections in 2027.

"Don't think that no one is watching you. The French people see you, and they will make you pay for it at the ballot box," Le Pen told lawmakers ahead of the vote. "Not only for the (budgetary) bloodletting you are inflicting on them, but also for the humiliating process you are using."

Lecornu says the budget deficit will not exceed 5% of GDP, below the 5.4% hit in 2025 but still well above the European Union's 3% cap.

The second motion, filed by the far-right National Rally (RN), stands even less chance of succeeding as left-wing lawmakers have historically refused to back RN motions.

The government expects the entire budget to be definitively adopted in the first half of February, one government official said.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 10:53:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/AUPLSMVC5RO5VEDBZL3547VNOM.jpg?auth=dab5ee4761b040469ed459ae0567d2d95a5893e2b51fcf597537136309bcba1e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UK's Royal Navy tracks Russian vessels sailing through English Channel</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uks-royal-navy-tracks-russian-vessels-sailing-through-english-channel-2026-01-23/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Britain's Royal Navy shadowed Russian vessels sailing through the English Channel in a two-day operation coordinated with NATO allies, the navy said on Friday, as the military alliance steps up monitoring of Russian shipping.

The navy said two patrol ships, supported by a Wildcat helicopter, were dispatched to intercept the Russian warship Boikiy and accompanying oil tanker MT General Skobelev as they headed north, before handing the monitoring over to a NATO ally.

The operation comes a day after Britain said it provided support to a French operation to board a sanctioned Russian oil tanker as it passed through the Straits of Gibraltar, in a bid to choke off the funds that fuel Russian's invasion of Ukraine.

Britain's navy routinely conducts shadowing missions to monitor any potential threats to national security, including to critical infrastructure such as undersea cables or pipelines.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 10:54:47 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Poland sends hundreds of generators to Ukraine as Russia strikes energy system</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/poland-sends-hundreds-generators-ukraine-russia-strikes-energy-system-2026-01-23/</link><description>WARSAW, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Poland is sending hundreds of generators to Ukraine, authorities and fundraisers said on Friday, as Russian attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure leave citizens facing a bitter winter without heat or electricity.

Russia's onslaught on Ukraine's energy system has led to power and water outages in Kyiv that typically last three to four times longer than in previous winters. Temperatures in the capital at night have plunged as low as minus 20 degrees Celsius.

Russia says its attacks on Ukraine are designed to degrade its ability to fight. Ukraine says the aim is to harm civilians and break the national will . Poland has been a staunch supporter of Ukraine throughout the war.

"Given the dire situation in Ukraine... Prime Minister Donald Tusk has ordered equipment to protect civilians from the effects of freezing temperatures," the Interior Ministry said in a statement.

Members of the public in Poland have so far donated over 5.8 million zlotys ($1.62 million) to a fundraising campaign to buy generators for Kyiv.

"For us, it is a gesture of support - for them, a real chance to survive the winter," fundraisers said on their website.

The Interior Ministry said that 379 power generators and 18 heaters will be delivered to Ukraine from the Government Agency for Strategic Reserves, with another 447 power generators provided using European Union funds.

The Polish capital, Warsaw, is also donating 90 generators to Kyiv.

"We are all observing what is happening in Ukraine right now, these brutal Russian attacks on critical infrastructure, on Ukrainian cities, which are, of course, causing civilian casualties, but have also led to a large part of Kyiv being cut off from energy and electricity supplies," Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski told a news conference.

France has been unable to pass a budget for 2026, prompting French Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu to invoke a controversial constitutional Article 49.3 – known as the “nuclear option” – on Tuesday to end the impasse.

"When debate no longer allows for a conclusion, someone must take responsibility," he said of the controversial decision ahead of the vote on Friday, calling Article 49.3 “an instrument of last resort”.

Lecornu invoked the article to push the budget through the lower house, where it had ​become deadlocked after three months of discussions.

In response, opposition parties LFI and far-right National Rally (RN) filed no-confidence motions against his government.

Lecornu, however, appears to have won enough political backing, notably from the centre-left Socialists, to survive the no-confidence votes.

Lecornu has sought to make concessions in the spending bill to please the Socialists, a key swing group in the hung parliament, in order to survive any vote to oust him. Among the concessions was Lecornu’s agreement that a controversial pension reform would not be implemented until after the 2027 presidential elections.

President Emmanuel Macron has hailed the proposed budget, saying it "guarantees stability" and "allows the country to move forward", a government spokesperson said.

Macron also emphasised that the budget "required compromises and concessions from everyone".

Lecornu has vowed to keep the public deficit at 5 percent of gross domestic product ( GDP ).

No-confidence votes triggered after Article 49.3 was invoked to force through a budget also toppled Lecornu’s immediate predecessors, François Bayrou and Michel Barnier.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 10:56:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/5e904388-f846-11f0-b8ac-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/000-93RC2A2.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Supporters gather as South African politician Malema awaits sentence in firearm case</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/supporters-gather-south-african-politician-malema-awaits-sentence-firearm-case-2026-01-23/</link><description>EAST LONDON, South Africa, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Thousands of supporters of South African opposition politician Julius Malema gathered outside a court on Friday as the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) party leader awaited his sentence for firing a rifle in the air at a rally in 2018.

Malema was convicted in October of charges including unlawful possession of a firearm, discharging a weapon in a public place and reckless endangerment of people or property.

He had pleaded not guilty, arguing the gun was a toy.

Malema faces a possible prison sentence of 15 years. However, the sentence could also be more lenient, like a suspended sentence or community service, if the court thinks there are mitigating factors.

One of South Africa's most prominent politicians, Malema commands a strong following among the youth and those who argue governments have not done enough to address racial inequalities in the three decades after the end of white minority rule.

EFF supporters outside the East London Magistrate's Court held aloft placards reading "We stand with Julius Malema" and "Hands off CiC (Commander-in-Chief) Julius Malema."

Many wore party regalia including the EFF's trademark red berets.

It was not immediately clear whether Malema would be told his sentence on Friday during what is termed a pre-sentencing hearing or the sentencing would be deferred to a later date, but EFF officials said his followers wanted to turn out in numbers to support Malema in case.

The far-left EFF is the fourth biggest party in South Africa's parliament with roughly 10% of seats in the lower house.

It advocates nationalising mines and seizing land from white farmers, which critics fear would threaten Africa's most industrialised economy.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 11:23:04 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/DS7GKZWFWBLYJBNELJTXNTY5ZQ.jpg?auth=c865f52972d669931d03eac22e74d2b65504f528f70373b42f3b797d919c2883&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>West Bank education centre could close in days due to Israeli seizure threat, says UNRWA</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/west-bank-education-centre-could-close-days-due-israeli-seizure-threat-says-2026-01-23/</link><description>GENEVA, Jan 23 (Reuters) - A training centre for hundreds of Palestinians in the occupied West Bank could be closed within days by Israeli authorities, jeopardising the education of students, the U.N. Palestinian refugee agency said on Friday.

The Kalandia Training Centre, which teaches 350 young male students from across the West Bank skills such as plumbing and vehicle maintenance, could be shut, as the land it sits on is at risk of expropriation by Israeli authorities, UNRWA said.

"If the centre were to be forcibly closed - and we do fear that this could happen within days - there is no educational alternative for these students. So you're depriving a large cohort of Palestine Refugees of economic opportunities," Jonathan Fowler, UNRWA's spokesperson, told reporters in Geneva speaking via video link from Amman, Jordan.

"The right to education would be under attack there...The international community needs to wake up," he added.

The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters.

UNRWA has functioned for decades as the main international agency providing for the welfare of millions of Palestinian descendants of those who fled or were driven from homes during the war around Israel's founding.

Israel accuses UNRWA of bias, and Israel's parliament passed a law in October 2024 banning the agency from operating in the country and prohibiting officials from having contact with it.

Israel demolished structures inside the agency's East Jerusalem compound on Tuesday, a site it seized last year.

The agency's chief Philippe Lazzarini said the demolition was the latest in a series of Israeli actions against UNRWA, including a raid on a medical clinic this month and a plan to cut power and water to UNRWA facilities in the coming weeks.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 11:23:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/2VJ374WMG5OS7OBG45J5ZXRWPY.jpg?auth=e05511042fb7f99ca78c9cb0313bd30607ec30cb454ae9b0d23fa0bd39accfe7&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Rail fracture likely occurred before train crash in southern Spain, investigators say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/rail-fracture-likely-occurred-before-train-crash-southern-spain-investigators-2026-01-23/</link><description>MADRID, Jan 23 (Reuters) - A fracture in the rail appeared to have occurred before a high-speed train derailed in southern Spain last Sunday, rail accident investigating body CIAF said in a preliminary report published on Friday.

Sunday's deadly collision in Adamuz, Cordoba province, killed 45 in one of Europe's worst train accidents. A first train belonging to private consortium Iryo derailed and smashed into another oncoming high-speed train from state-owned rail company Renfe.

"Based on the information available at this time, it can be hypothesised that the rail fracture occurred prior to the passage of the Iryo train involved in the accident and, therefore, prior to the derailment," read the CIAF report, posted on the body's website.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 11:45:02 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LPSTZL76VFKBHC2BI6UBQWSAUQ.jpg?auth=3cd24f5eff914f9aff629856e5ac35bcf4263d2544912cdf9f83f6ef68c39d9e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Greenland galvanizes Europe to confront new US reality</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/davos/greenland-galvanizes-europe-confront-new-us-reality-2026-01-23/</link><description>DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Europe may have rallied to see off President Donald Trump over Greenland, but its leaders recognise the confrontation is unlikely to be the last in dealings with his increasingly strident version of the United States.

The stakes could hardly be higher, given the $2 trillion trading relationship between the European Union and the U.S. and the dominant role Washington continues to play in the NATO alliance ​and in support of Ukraine against Russia.

This week, in the space of a few hours at the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos, Trump first ruled out taking Greenland ‌by force and then removed the threat of new tariffs on eight European states standing in his way - hailing instead a vague deal for the Arctic island with NATO chief Mark Rutte.

European leaders believe Trump backed down in part because - in contrast to their more accommodating stance in last year's tariff negotiations - this time they made it clear he was crossing a red line by asserting that Greenland's status as an autonomous territory of Denmark was non-negotiable.

"All this shows that you cannot let the Americans trample all over the Europeans," said a European Union official, who requested anonymity to speak candidly about U.S. ties.

"We did the right thing to push back, to be firm in what we said, but it is ‌not over. My sense is that we will be tested constantly on issues like this," the official told Reuters.

While Europe may have learned the value of standing up ​to Trump, the challenge is ensuring it is less exposed next time.

"It's a hard route, and it's going to take time," said Rosa Balfour, director at Carnegie Europe, adding that Europe had "far more leverage than it has dared to use".

An emergency summit of Europe's leaders on Thursday called for last year's EU-U.S. trade deal to be put back on track after lawmakers suspended its ratification in protest over Greenland.

"Despite all the ‍frustration and anger of recent months, let us not be too quick to write off the transatlantic partnership," German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said in Davos beforehand.

While seeking to stabilise the partnership, Europe is also taking steps aimed at "de-risking" it given the open antipathy from Trump, whose new national security strategy accuses the continent of freeloading on defence and demands it open its markets to U.S. companies.

Europe is only too aware of how long it can take to get agreement among 27 nations with different histories, politics ⁠and economies, which was highlighted in taunts this week by U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.

Two EU officials said the Greenland row has accelerated discussions on how the approach taken on Ukraine - in which countries offer security guarantees on ‍a voluntary basis and no one has a right of veto - can be extended.

"We should do more with coalitions of the willing and leave it open for others to follow if they want," said one, adding that joint efforts to ‌boost Europe's development ‌of artificial intelligence technology could be one example.

Coalitions such as the "E3" group comprising France, Germany and Britain focusing on security matters also allow non-EU states to take part, which speaks to others on the rough end of Trump policies.

"The middle powers must act together, because if we're not at the table, we're on the menu," Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said in a Davos speech to warm applause.

Another route is using the leeway afforded by EU law.

In December, EU states used an emergency provision to indefinitely immobilise hundreds of billions of dollars of Russian assets. That removed the risk of a pro-Moscow country like Hungary blocking the roll-over of the measure at some point ⁠and forcing the EU to return the money.

Europe also plans to toughen up on economic policy.

Next ​month it will kickstart legislation that will include "Made in Europe" requirements on strategic sectors and strengthening conditionality clauses for any foreign direct investment in the EU.

"Some provisions were originally conceived to reduce reliance on China but in reality they will help us to de-risk from other markets," European Commissioner for Prosperity and Industrial Strategy Stephane Sejourne told Reuters.

"This will totally change the European doctrine on those sectors," Sejourne added.

Unlike Canada , there is no plan in Europe to pivot more towards China to compensate ‍for transatlantic strains. But the bloc is actively pursuing others in a diversification drive.

While the impact of higher U.S. tariffs on European goods is not clear - in fact Europe's trade surplus with the U.S. initially rose over the course of 2025 as companies front-loaded exports ahead of the new levies - recent data shows that German companies nearly halved investments there last year.

After the signing of the EU-Mercosur pact this month - the largest in EU history - European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said it is now "on the cusp" of ​a deal with India .

However, nobody is saying Europe can redress the imbalance with the U.S. overnight, particularly on security.

Despite European commitments to a ‍defence spending surge and even calls for an EU army , analysts say it will be years before its military might is up to tasks which now include bolstering Arctic security.

The question is whether the past few weeks provide a catalyst for Europe to start reducing its U.S. ​dependencies.

"All this is not surprising," Swedish deputy Prime Minister Ebba Busch said of Trump's showing in Davos.

"The EU needs to toughen up," she told Reuters.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 12:49:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HKHIJLXAU5JXJCZUCZVUPNKA34.jpg?auth=cdc7d83dc2720141f1eed623a01e45432b9ab9665763bf321ded2a693186712e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UN human rights chief urges US to uphold international law in immigration crackdown</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/un-human-rights-chief-urges-us-uphold-international-law-immigration-crackdown-2026-01-23/</link><description>GENEVA, Jan 23 (Reuters) - The U.N. human rights chief urged the Trump administration on Friday to ensure that its migration policies respect individual rights and international law, citing concerns over arbitrary and unlawful arrests and detentions.

"Individuals are being surveilled and detained, sometimes violently including at hospitals, churches, mosques, courthouses, markets, schools, and even within their own homes, often solely on mere suspicion of being undocumented migrants," the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Turk, said in a statement.

U.S. President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown has seen some 3,000 heavily armed masked federal officers deployed to the city of Minneapolis, rounding up suspects they say are dangerous criminal immigration violators, while sometimes ensnaring law-abiding U.S. citizens and immigrants.

The city is on edge after an immigration officer shot and killed Renee Good, 37, a U.S. citizen and mother of three on January 7. Vice President JD Vance delivered a broad defense on Thursday, saying that "far-left agitators" and uncooperative local officials were to blame for chaos on the streets.

U.S. immigration enforcement operations have used what appears to be unnecessary or disproportionate force, Turk said. Such measures should only be used as a last resort if an individual posed an immediate threat to life, he added.

Turk said the U.S. must comply with international law and that migration enforcement must respect due process, voicing concern that, in some cases, people arrested or detained had not been granted timely access to legal advice.

He called for an independent investigation into the rising number of deaths in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody. He cited 30 deaths reported in 2025 and six recorded so far this year.

Turk condemned what he called the routine denigration of migrants and refugees in the United States that portrays them as criminals or a burden on society, saying it increased their "exposure to xenophobic hostility and abuse".</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 12:49:17 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/Y3BBUOCHYFMEVNHF6AOHUMIPLM.jpg?auth=f4d3d944ab927a868173e67838502e4f91f082208b1bf491c877d5a89b72957c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>World order changing, not rupturing, finance chiefs say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/world-order-changing-not-rupturing-finance-chiefs-say-2026-01-23/</link><description>DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 23 (Reuters) - The world order is changing but not enduring a rupture, finance leaders said on Friday, pushing back on Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney's narrative that a new order, driven by major power coercion, was taking shape.

In his speech at Davos , Carney called on nations to accept that a rules-based global order was over and great powers were abandoning even the pretence of following international agreements.

Quoting ancient Greek historian Thucydides, Carney said the world was entering a period in which "the strong can do what they can and the weak must suffer what they must".

"I'm not exactly on the same page as Mark," European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde told the World Economic Forum in Davos, just days after Carney's appearance. "I'm not sure that we should be talking about rupture."

"I think we should be talking about alternatives. We should be identifying, much more so than we have probably in the past, the weaknesses, the sore points, the dependencies, the autonomy," she said.

World Trade Organization chief Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said that uncertainty was unlikely to remain as high as this month, when U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to take over Greenland from NATO ally Denmark.

But the old order was also not going to return, uncertainty would linger and countries must invest in their own resilience, she said.

"I don't think we'll go back to where we were. But they will not be as bad and maybe we'll have a slightly better, steady state for the future," Okonjo-Iweala said.

If I was running a country, I'd be trying to strengthen myself and my region, and I'd be looking at my region and then building resilience."

Kristalina Georgieva, the International Monetary Fund's director, argued that change was natural and has been happening for years, and it was time to embrace this because shocks would keep happening.

"We are not in Kansas, anymore," she said, referencing a line in the Wizard of Oz, meaning that the comforts of familiar surroundings were gone for good.

Lagarde, who walked out of a Davos dinner during a speech critical of Europe by U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, was in a more forgiving mood on Friday.

"We have heard quite a lot of European-bashing in the last few days, but if anything, it has been good, and we should say 'thank you' to the bashers, because I think it has given us a complete realisation of the fact that we have to be more focused; we have to work on those plans B."</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 12:49:49 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/C75D2BKNG5JDVAEVWGVRUXYWQM.jpg?auth=cf251dd6e3cb5a73dda50462c019f70e81b8194c605e72817953484a4b67d0c5&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Bulgarian court approves President Radev's resignation</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/bulgarian-court-approves-president-radevs-resignation-2026-01-23/</link><description>Jan 23 (Reuters) - Bulgaria's constitutional court said on Friday it had approved the resignation of President Rumen Radev, opening the way for him to step down from the post.

Radev resigned this week , fuelling speculation that he will form his own political party to run in upcoming parliamentary elections. He was due to hold the largely ceremonial post until January 2027.

The Constitutional Court said Radev's powers have now been removed.

Radev, whose resignation came after the previous government quit last month, will be replaced by Vice President Iliana Iotova, who is expected to appoint a caretaker government and set a date for parliamentary elections, the eighth in four years.

Radev has long raised the prospect of forming his own party to bring stability and fight graft in one of the European Union's poorest and most corrupt countries, which joined the euro on January 1.

It was unclear if he would make a move ahead of the upcoming elections.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 12:50:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/RGA7DVJZ3ZOCVLLSA2K55Q6PMY.jpg?auth=bcd66f55567894f7222c8b73157f6c92275bce0b449dcc9aba797c92ecc64a14&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Power cuts and freezing temperatures test Kyiv's resilience after Russian attacks</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260123-power-cuts-freezing-temperatures-test-kyiv-resilience-after-russian-attacks</link><description>Nadia, a 31-year-old Kyiv resident, is working from home in thermals, two jumpers and fingerless gloves. Outside, it’s -4 degrees Celsius, and her apartment has no heating, electricity or water .

On days when the temperature has dropped even lower, she has added a coat and hat to her work outfit. “But the fingerless gloves are my best investment,” she says. “When you need to type on your laptop, it saves your life because it's really freezing.”

Nadia is one of hundreds of thousands of people in the Ukrainian capital who have been struggling with lengthy interruptions to heat, electricity and water supplies in recent weeks due to a surge in Russian attacks on energy infrastructure .

At the same time, Kyiv is in the grip of the harshest winter since Russia's full-scale invasion began nearly four years ago. Temperatures have not risen above freezing so far this year and have frequently dipped as low as -10 degrees Celsius.

Ukraine’s government last week declared a state of emergency related to the energy crisis, for the first time since the war began.

“It’s horrible,” says Sofia, who lives in central Kyiv. Her electricity has been out for more than 48 hours, and she had almost no water supply the previous day.

“In these conditions, you have no thoughts in your mind except how not to die from being cold, how to cook yourself something, how to take a shower and how to flush the toilet,” she says.

“It is uncomfortable and quite exhausting”, agrees Olga, who lives with her 11-year-old daughter in an apartment on Kyiv’s right bank. Their power has been down for more than 30 hours.

Without electricity, there is no heating, so the pair have been wearing plenty of layers and “often wrap ourselves in duvets as well”, she says. They still have water, but she adds, “that’s a matter of luck”.

After a Russian ballistic missile strike on January 9 caused major outages in Kyiv, a second massive attack on January 20 left more than half of the capital’s homes without power and the city’s entire left bank without water.

Repairing Ukraine’s battered energy infrastructure in freezing temperatures is dangerous and difficult work .

But local authorities say water has been restored, although not for residents on the upper floors of high-rise buildings that require electric booster pumps to access their supply.

Power is also slowly returning , but Kyiv’s Mayor Vitali Klitschko said on Friday that 1,940 apartment buildings were still ​without heating.

Across the city, thousands of people are still gathering in schools and at around 90 “heating points” run by Ukraine’s Emergency Service and the Red Cross , where generators allow them to warm up, charge their phones and connect to the internet.

The hum of generators has become a constant backdrop to city life, says Daria, 36, who lives in the west of the city with her 6-year-old son, and has been going to her generator-powered gym to wash her hair.

“Whenever the sound of generators stops, it means the electricity is back on,” she says.

Daria is not surprised that recent attacks on energy systems have ramped up in intensity. “It is one of the coldest winters for ten years. Of course, the Russians are using this against us,” she says.

While scheduled power outages have long been a part of daily life in Kyiv, the unpredictable and lengthy emergency outages caused by recent attacks have brought endless small challenges that disrupt the rhythms of daily life and zap morale.

Meals are often basic fare cooked on gas camping stoves that smell and are dangerous to use indoors. Everyone keeps a bucket in the bathroom and bottles of water in case they can no longer flush the toilet.

“Some days are manageable, others are much heavier, but I’m trying to keep going,” says Olga.

She and Daria are grateful that their children’s schools have heating and are still open – most have been closed until February . Across the city, streetlights have been dimmed, and roughly half a million residents have left.

Those who remain are in survival mode. Sofia’s neighbours have taken to lighting fires and barbecues outside in a bid to stay warm. Many feel “angry, tired and sad,” she says.

Sofia finds the combination of extreme cold and continued nighttime bombings makes it difficult to sleep, and fears she will have to move away from the city. “Which I don’t want. Kyiv is my home. But it simply breaks your will,” she adds.

Nadia is worried a surprise power cut could leave her trapped inside the lift in her building. “It already happened to me once,” she says. She now walks up stairs to her 12th-floor apartment.

Among her friends and family in Kyiv, she experienced the longest stretch without any power – for 50 hours straight after Tuesday night’s attacks. In that time, “there have been lots of highs and lows”, she says.

This morning, a high: When she woke up the power was – briefly – back. “There was electricity, there was light, and I could make myself a coffee.” She says, “I was so happy.”

Daria has been cold at her office, where the central heating no longer works, but mostly warm enough at home as she has invested in backup options, including a power station worth thousands of euros that she can link to the electricity supply in her apartment.

It is, she acknowledges, a “very expensive option” – and is still not always enough.

In the past 24 hours, the power in her building has only been on for 50 minutes, and she has not been able to charge the power station. “It makes me slightly panic”, Daria says.

She hopes that the power will return for a few hours overnight and she will wake up with a full charge in the morning, but there is no guarantee this will happen. If it doesn’t, she faces another day without heat or electricity.

“It’s Russian roulette,” she says.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 12:50:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/55f6f31a-f83d-11f0-b412-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26014476390336.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Exclusive: Israel aims to ensure more Palestinians are let out of Gaza than back in</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-aims-ensure-more-palestinians-are-let-out-gaza-than-back-2026-01-23/</link><description>TEL AVIV, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Israel wants to restrict the number of Palestinians entering Gaza through the border crossing with Egypt to ensure that more are allowed out than in, three sources briefed on the matter said ahead of the border's expected opening next week.

The head of a transitional Palestinian committee backed by the U.S. to temporarily administer Gaza, Ali Shaath, announced on Thursday that the Rafah Border Crossing - effectively the sole route in or out of Gaza for nearly all of the more than 2 million people who live there - would open next week.

The border was supposed to have opened during the initial phase of President Donald Trump's plan to end the war , under a ceasefire reached in October between Israel and Hamas.

Earlier this month, Washington announced that the plan had now moved into the second phase, under which Israel is expected to withdraw troops further from Gaza and Hamas is due to yield control of the territory's administration. The Gaza side of the crossing has been under Israeli military control since 2024.

The three sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue, said it was still not clear how Israel planned to enforce limits on the number of Palestinians entering Gaza from Egypt, or what ratio of exits to entries it aimed to achieve.

Israeli officials have spoken in the past about encouraging Palestinians to emigrate from Gaza, although they deny intending to transfer the population out by force. Palestinians are highly sensitive to any suggestion that Gazans could be expelled, or that those who leave temporarily could be barred from returning.

The Rafah Crossing is expected to be staffed by Palestinians affiliated with the Ramallah-based Palestinian Authority and monitored by EU personnel, as took place during an earlier, weeks-long ceasefire between Israel and Hamas early last year.

The Israeli prime minister's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment for this story. The military referred questions to the government, declining to comment.

The three sources said that Israel also wants to establish a military checkpoint inside Gaza near the border, through which all Palestinians entering or leaving would be required to pass and be subjected to Israeli security checks.

Two other sources also said that Israeli officials had insisted on setting up a military checkpoint in Gaza to screen Palestinians moving in and out.

The U.S. Embassy in Israel did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether Washington supported Israel in limiting the number of Palestinians entering Gaza or setting up a checkpoint to screen those entering and leaving.

Under the initial phase of Trump's plan, the Israeli military partially pulled back its forces within Gaza but retained control of 53% of the territory including the entire land border with Egypt. Nearly all of the territory's population lives in the rest of Gaza, under Hamas control and mostly in makeshift tents or damaged buildings.

The sources said that it was not clear how individuals would be dealt with if they were blocked by Israel's military from passing through its checkpoint, particularly those entering from Egypt.

The Israeli government has repeatedly objected to the opening of the border, with some officials saying Hamas must first return the body of an Israeli police officer held in Gaza, the final human remains of a hostage due to be transferred under the ceasefire's first phase.

U.S. officials in private say that Washington, not Israel, is driving the rollout of the president's plan to end the war.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 13:43:27 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BF47YIEF2ZNIPF7RJ76EPYDEW4.jpg?auth=69e739be1e0801092eae4b612c7a2946121cb42abeaaec50fe361dc4dad97ddd&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Exclusive: UK finance and business ministers to accompany PM Starmer on China visit</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-finance-business-ministers-accompany-pm-starmer-china-visit-2026-01-23/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 23 (Reuters) - British finance minister Rachel Reeves will accompany Prime Minister Keir Starmer on his trip to China next week, underscoring UK efforts to strengthen ties with the world's second-largest economy at a time of strained transatlantic relations.

Among the goods Britain hopes to sell to China are financial services products such as pensions, insurance and wealth management services, luxury cars and clothing, and whisky.
While China has been prevented from investing in certain parts of the British economy, such as nuclear plants and core mobile networks, it has invested in renewable energy systems, infrastructure and real estate.

Reeves will join Starmer and business leaders on the trip next week, the first by a British prime minister to China since 2018, three sources familiar with the visit told Reuters.

Along with business secretary Peter Kyle, who will also be on the trip, Reeves will have separate itineraries from the prime minister, one of the sources said. Their presence on the visit has not previously been reported.

The Treasury and the Department for Business and Trade declined to comment.

CHINA VISIT COMES AT A TIME OF TENSION WITH U.S.

Starmer's trip comes after Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney visited Beijing last week and hailed improving ties with China as well as the leadership of Chinese President Xi Jinping.

The decision to send the two most senior figures in the government, and the business secretary, shows the importance the British government is placing on the visit, which takes place amid tensions between Britain and its traditional closest ally, the United States, over President Donald Trump's unpredictable approach to trade and defence.

Britain wants closer economic and trade ties with China to help boost its economy after Starmer pledged to improve living standards through investment in public services and the economy. But the strategy has drawn fierce criticism from some British and U.S. politicians.

Starmer's government recently approved China's contested plans to build a mega-embassy in the heart of London, rejecting objections from some politicians who said the new building would make it easier for China to conduct spying operations.

Some UK and Chinese officials had told Reuters that the visit to China was conditional on the embassy being approved

China was Britain's fourth-largest trading partner with trade totalling around 100 billion pounds in the 12 months to the end of the second quarter in 2025, according to government data.

Among those travelling with Starmer to China as part of the business delegation will be Brendan Nelson, the chairman of HSBC, Europe's biggest bank, another source familiar with the plans told Reuters. HSBC declined to comment.

A revamped UK-China CEO Council is also set to be unveiled next week, with representatives from companies including AstraZeneca, HSBC and Jaguar Land Rover expected to participate, Reuters reported this week.

But the visit comes at a sensitive moment for relations between European leaders and the United States because of Trump's claims that the United States needs to take control of Greenland because China poses a threat in the Arctic.

In a speech at Davos, Trump made clear his disdain for European leaders , their immigration policies, regulations and their unwillingness to give him Greenland, which he insists America must own for its security.

Starmer laid the foundations for his trip last month when he said Britain needed to take a "more sophisticated" approach to its relationship with China, saying bilateral ties had "blown hot and cold" for years.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 13:43:56 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/EF2M46YV3BJUXNKIFYH5QRBX3Q.jpg?auth=acf4eb392d3b57418f80b42ddf56316fb040609430c36c3a3f0e9c17df985ca7&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iranian cleric says Iran may target US investments in region if attacked</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iranian-cleric-says-iran-may-target-us-investments-region-if-attacked-2026-01-23/</link><description>DUBAI, Jan 23 (Reuters) - An influential Iranian cleric warned on Friday that Iran may target U.S.-linked investments in the region in retaliation for any U.S. attack on the Islamic Republic, Iranian news agencies reported.

President Donald Trump said on Thursday that the United States had an "armada" heading toward Iran but hoped he would not have to use it, as he renewed warnings to Tehran against killing protesters or restarting its nuclear programme.

"The one trillion dollars you have invested in the region is under the watch of our missiles," said Mohammad Javad Haj Ali Akbari, a leader of prayers that are held on Fridays in Tehran before a large gathering. He did not specify which investments he was referring to.

Separately, Iran's top prosecutor Mohammad Movahedi denied that Iran had called off 800 executions of people arrested in recent nationwide protests, as Trump has said .

"This claim is completely false, No such number exists, nor has the judiciary made any such decision," Movahedi was quoted as saying by the judiciary's news agency Mizan.

Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi told Fox News last week "There is no plan for hanging at all" by Iran, when asked about the anti-government protests.

The U.N. Human Rights Council is to hold an emergency session on Friday to discuss the "alarming violence" used in Iran against protesters, while a group of states will call on United Nations' investigators to document alleged abuses for future trials.

Rights groups say thousands, including bystanders , were killed during the unrest, which represented the biggest challenge to Iran's clerical government since 2022.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 13:44:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/NLFKOCTGABPFXDQSQYE6DJ337Q.jpg?auth=3a0fc89766425565e6e6f6e7bcad415f91fe485beaf69efc53cbfeade12c1df9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Stars of fashion and film bid farewell to haute couture 'emperor' Valentino</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/stars-fashion-film-bid-farewell-haute-couture-emperor-valentino-2026-01-23/</link><description>ROME, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Valentino , Italy's haute couture "emperor", was laid to rest in Rome on Friday, with the distinctive red he championed in his collections echoed in splashes of crimson among the black-clad mourners.

The biggest names in fashion - including Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Maria Grazia Chiuri - gathered in the Basilica of Santa Maria degli Angeli, a church designed by Michelangelo and built on the ruins of ancient Roman baths.

Valentino's co-founder Giancarlo Giammetti, dressed in a sharply tailored black satin suit, and the designer's last partner, Bruce Hoeksema, accompanied the plain wooden coffin as it entered the church, drawing applause from the crowds outside.

"Through him, I discovered beauty, a beauty that followed us throughout our lives, that has kept us busy. We met when we were kids, we dreamed the same dreams, we managed to realise some of them, I would even say many of them," Giammetti said in his eulogy.

In an improvised speech, Hoeksema said: "Valentino, you were the person I spoke to, not the person I spoke about. You were beside me when words were not needed. Life was not always perfect, but it was real. One day at a time, for more than 40 years."

Mourners included Vogue's Global Editorial director Anna Wintour, actors Anne Hathaway and Elizabeth Hurley, American socialite Olivia Palermo and Valentino's current creative director Alessandro Michele and his predecessor Pierpaolo Piccioli.

Valentino's Chief Executive Riccardo Bellini, French billionaire Francois-Henri Pinault, Antoine Arnault, the eldest son of LVMH (LVMH.PA) , opens new tab chairman Bernard Arnault, and Rachid Mohamed Rachid, CEO of Mayhoola, also attended.

The couturier who built one of Italy's most celebrated fashion houses died on Monday at his home in Rome, aged 93.

Hundreds gathered outside and inside the basilica, famed for the red of its marbled walls and columns - darker than Valentino red.

White flowers framed the altar and a black-and-white photo of Valentino stood next to his coffin.

There were flashes of red among the pews - hats, scarves, bright carmine coats and a woollen shawl.

More than 10,000 people paid their respects to Valentino on Wednesday and Thursday as he lay in state in Rome's Piazza Mignanelli, next to his fashion house's historical headquarters and a stone's throw from the city's iconic Spanish Steps.

Kainerugaba, best-known to many Ugandans for his fiery social media posts, helped his father to election victory last week by ordering a crackdown on opponents and cutting the internet , said sources familiar with the matter.

Having repeatedly threatened to kill opposition leader Bobi Wine , who says the vote was rigged and is in hiding, Kainerugaba boasted on Friday that 30 "terrorists" from Wine's party had been killed and 2,000 "hooligans" arrested. There was no immediate response from the party.

In the run-up to the vote , security forces disrupted opposition rallies, detaining supporters and sometimes opening fire.

Adding to accounts from a business source and a security official, Andrew Mwenda, a close adviser to Kainerugaba, told Reuters he had played a critical role in the four-day internet blackout, saying it was to prevent any sabotage.

Kainerugaba personally mobilised the police and army to target "roughnecks and ruffians" supporting the opposition National Unity Platform party led by popstar-turned-politician Wine, Mwenda added.

"He's number one in security in this country," Mwenda said.

Kainerugaba could not be reached and spokespeople for the government, military and presidency did not respond to requests for comment on the internet blackout, crackdown or succession plans.

Kainerugaba, who attended Britain's prestigious Sandhurst military academy and is an admirer of Mao Zedong and Fidel Castro, first announced in 2023 that he wanted to be president after his father, saying he was "tired of waiting forever".

Since then, he has sidelined critics within the ruling party and military, retiring rival officers and boosting pay to secure soldiers' loyalty.

Museveni has never commented in public about who will follow him, beyond saying his party will make the decision.

Though Kainerugaba's presidential ambitions have previously sparked concern in Museveni's inner circle, his role in securing the election victory has strengthened his position, the security official and business source said.

A handover from father to son would not be without risks of a backlash in the East African country, which has a $65 billion economy and enjoyed decades of stability under Museveni.

Kainerugaba does not speak to journalists and has a reputation for late-night social media posts – including threats to behead Wine and castrate another opposition leader in 2025 and invade Kenya in October 2022.

Both he and his father apologised for the threat to a neighbouring nation, and Kainerugaba has said some of his posts are meant to be ironic.

His erratic style has displeased some in the older generation of Uganda's political and military elite.

But his position as security czar and prospective future leader looks stronger than ever, according to five people with close knowledge of the matter, two of whom are involved in talks about the transition.

"At this point, it's hard to think of anyone outside the family who could challenge him," said Kristof Titeca, a Uganda expert and professor at the University of Antwerp.

Kainerugaba grew up in exile in Tanzania, Kenya and Sweden before his father took office in 1986. He returned home to lead the Special Forces Command, an elite unit often described as an army within the army.

His swift rise and frequent interjections in politics have drawn some criticism but seldom serious sanction.

"There (are) people who are in the military who are not happy with General Muhoozi's behaviour ... either expressing interest in the presidency for himself or praising his father or insulting his father's rivals," said Frederick Golooba-Mutebi, a Ugandan researcher and analyst.

"It would seem as if there are laws that apply to other military officers, but those laws don't apply to the president's son."

In 2022, Museveni and his younger brother Salim Saleh, who serves as a special presidential adviser, did warn Kainerugaba about his posts, two business sources told Reuters, citing family members. Saleh did not reply to a request for comment.

Despite his intimidating public profile, three sources who have met Kainerugaba say he is thoughtful and strategic in person. "When you talk to him outside the confines of Twitter, he is a different person," said political commentator Charles Onyango-Obbo.

Mwenda said most of Kainerugaba's incendiary posts were in fact jokes. Kainerugaba enjoyed "a glass or two of whisky" but did not abuse alcohol, he added.

If Museveni dies in office, the vice president is meant to take over temporarily and hold an election. Saleh is expected to play a kingmaker role on behalf of the family, several sources told Reuters.

"Nobody is safe in Uganda ... in a country where a military general will consume their whisky and wish somebody death," Wine told Reuters this week from an unknown location, in a clear allusion to Museveni's son.

Veteran ruling party politicians have made no secret of their disquiet over the prospect of a Kainerugaba takeover, but their influence is waning.

All but two members of the ruling National Resistance Movement's 14-member central executive committee were replaced last year, and current members are more broadly supportive of Kainerugaba, said academic Titeca.

Kainerugaba has overseen increases in salaries of rank-and-file soldiers, in some cases by over 300%, while also personally announcing promotions and retirements and launching an anti-corruption drive.

Kainerugaba's strong relationship with Rwanda's President Paul Kagame, whom he refers to as "Uncle Paul", has fuelled speculation that he might ask Kagame for help should he be challenged, according to sources.

Mwenda said the friendship went back decades and was clearly an advantage. "If I was asked for an ally, he (Kagame) is the first person I would go to." A spokesperson for Rwanda's government did not respond to requests for comment.

On the streets of Uganda, where the average national age is just 16, many condemn the idea of a family handover.

"Uganda is not a kingdom, we won't allow it. If they think they can put the son in place of the father they are wrong," 23-year-old Fahad said in the capital Kampala.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 13:45:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LBSCKMZVJ5N7RFQOOVL4CT7REI.jpg?auth=9ed989e7cc15dad9599a0478487d784ee97c48863d62212cc386ae1878ba43f7&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>‘Secret’ ICE memo allows agents to forcibly enter homes without a judge’s warrant</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260123-secret-ice-memo-allows-agents-forcibly-enter-homes-without-judge-warrant</link><description>Over the decades, it has become common knowledge in immigrant communities across the country to not open the door for federal immigration officers unless they show a warrant signed by a judge. The Supreme Court has long held that the Constitution’s Fourth Amendment against unreasonable search and seizure prohibits the government’s forced entry into someone’s home.

As a result, immigration officers have been forced to adapt by making arrests in public, which often requires long hours of surveillance outside homes as they wait to nab someone walking to the street.

But an internal Immigration and Customs Enforcement memo obtained by The Associated Press states immigration officers can forcibly enter people’s homes without a judge’s warrant, marking a dramatic shift that could upend the legal advice given to immigrants for decades.

“Every American should be terrified by this secret ICE policy,” Democratic US Senator Richard Blumenthal warned.

The shift comes as President Donald Trump’s administration dramatically expands immigration arrests nationwide under a mass deportation campaign that is already reshaping enforcement tactics in cities such as Minneapolis.

Since coming to the United States 30 years ago from Mexico, Fernando Perez said US immigration officers have stopped by his home numerous times, but he has never once answered the door.

“There are rules and I know them,” said Perez, speaking in a mix of English and Spanish in a Home Depot parking lot where he has routinely sought work as a day labourer from contractors and people renovating their homes.

Perez said officers in the past would knock, wait and then move on.

“But if they are going to start coming into my home, where I am paying the rent — they are not paying the rent — that’s the last straw,” he said.

Most immigration arrests have been carried out under administrative warrants, documents issued by immigration authorities that authorise an arrest. Traditionally they do not permit officers to enter private spaces without consent. Only warrants signed by independent judges have carried that authority.

It is unclear how broadly the memo’s directive has been applied in immigration enforcement operations. AP witnessed ICE officers ramming through the front door of a Liberian man’s home in Minneapolis on January 11 with only an administrative warrant, wearing heavy tactical gear and with their rifles drawn.

Democratic US Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut is demanding congressional hearings on the ICE memo and calling on Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem for an explanation.

“Every American should be terrified by this secret ICE policy authorising its agents to kick down your door and storm into your home,” Blumenthal said in a news release.

Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens wrote for the court in 1980 that the “physical entry of the home is the chief evil against which the wording of the Fourth Amendment is directed”.

For years, people have managed to evade arrest by skipping work and outings for days until agents move on. A senior ICE official once likened the surveillance experience to watching paint dry.

In July, the AP observed as immigration officers saw a Russian man enter his home in Irvine, California. They gave up when he did not leave after three hours. They waited longer for a Mexican man who never emerged from his house in nearby El Monte, though they caught up with him two days later at a convenience store.

ICE has tried what the agency called “knock and talks” to get people to answer the door by casually asking residents to step outside to answer a few questions, according to a 2020 lawsuit in which a federal judge found the practice illegal. In one case, they told a woman they were probation officers looking for her brother.

More often, immigration officers simply play the waiting game — a pace that is not conducive to Trump fulfilling his promise of mass deportations .

Since shortly after ICE was created in 2003, advocacy groups and immigrant-friendly state and local governments have diligently spread the word that people should not open their doors for immigration officers unless they can show a warrant signed by a judge.

They have held know-your-rights trainings for communities, passed out flyers and posted videos on social media to teach immigrants how to protect themselves.

Ahilan Arulanantham, co-faculty director of the UCLA Law School’s Center for Immigration Law and Policy who has held such trainings, called the memo “quite disturbing”,

“Know-your-rights trainings have included that information for decades and even people who are only minimally aware of their rights learn that because it’s sort of the first and foundational elements of Fourth Amendment law,” he said. “They know to ask officers to slide the warrant under the door so they can see if it was signed by a judge or is an administrative warrant.”

In the predominantly Latino city of Santa Ana, where ICE agents were seen roaming the streets in recent days, several residents who did not want to give their names said they were well aware of that right. Jesus Delgado, a father of three, said the local elementary school sent out information to parents about what to do if ICE comes to your door.

“They send us bulletins, to not answer the door, to not answer any questions,” he said.

Another man said he learned that from TikTok.

Trump’s border czar Tom Homan has been highly critical of groups providing the information.

“They call it ‘know-your-rights,’” he said last year on CNN. “I call it ‘how to escape arrest.’”

The memo says immigration officers can forcibly enter homes and arrest immigrants using solely a warrant signed by an immigration official if they have a final order of removal.

Officers must first knock on the door and share who they are and why they are at the residence, and they can only go into the home after 6am and before 10pm. The people inside must be given a “reasonable chance to act lawfully”. But if that does not work, the memo says, they can use force to go in.

Law enforcement and legal experts warn if more immigration officers barge into homes, everyone could be put at greater risk.

With stand-your-ground laws, people in many states have the right to shoot intruders, which could lead to officers being shot, or agents opening fire on someone coming at them with a baseball bat or other item they grab in the heat of a moment, Arulanantham said. ICE records often contain wrong addresses, which could further lead to confrontations and agents busting into homes of US citizens.

Arulanantham said agents’ aggressive tactics have been building since the Supreme Court lifted a lower court’s order in September that barred federal agents in the Los Angeles area from indiscriminately stopping people because of their race, language, job or location.

“This would just be another step down that path,” he said. “Obviously it will be more significant because it suggests you’re not safe even in your own house.”</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 13:46:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/9b424b8e-f858-11f0-bd13-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26021767982109.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UK hits back after Trump claims NATO troops avoided front lines in Afghanistan</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260123-britain-hits-back-after-trump-claims-nato-troops-avoided-afghan-front-line</link><description>Britain said US President Donald Trump was "wrong to diminish" the role of NATO troops in Afghanistan , as a claim by the US president that they did not fight on the front line sparked outrage.

In an interview with Fox News aired on Thursday, Trump appeared unaware that 457 British soldiers died during the conflict in the South Asian country following the September 11 attacks on the United States.

"They'll say they sent some troops to Afghanistan," Trump told the US outlet, referring to NATO allies.

"And they did, they stayed a little back, a little off the front lines," he added.

Trump also repeated his suggestion that NATO would not come to the aid of the United States if asked to do so.

In fact, following the 9/11 attacks, the UK and a number of other allies joined the US from 2001 in Afghanistan after it invoked NATO's collective security clause.

As well as British forces, troops from other NATO ally countries, including Canada , France , Germany , Italy , Denmark and others also died.

"Their sacrifice and that of other NATO forces was made in the service of collective security and in response to an attack on our ally," Prime Minister Keir Starmer 's official spokesman said.

"We are incredibly proud of our armed forces and their service and sacrifice will never be forgotten," he added.

Care Minister Stephen Kinnock earlier said he expected Starmer would bring the issue up with Trump.

"I think he will, I'm sure, be raising this issue with the president ... He's incredibly proud of our armed forces, and he will make that clear to the president," he told LBC Radio.

"It just doesn't really add up what he said, because the fact of the matter is the only time that Article 5 has been invoked was to go to the aid of the United States after 9/11," he added in an interview with Sky News.

Defence Minister John Healey said NATO's Article 5 has only been triggered once.

"The UK and NATO allies answered the US call. And more than 450 British personnel lost their lives in Afghanistan," he said.

The troops who died were "heroes who gave their lives in service of our nation", he added.

Lucy Aldridge, whose son William died at the age of 18 in Afghanistan, told The Mirror newspaper that Trump's remarks were "extremely upsetting".

Emily Thornberry, chair of parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee, denounced them as "so much more than a mistake".

"It's an absolute insult. It's an insult to 457 families who lost someone in Afghanistan. How dare he say we weren't on the front line?" the Labour Party politician said on the BBC's Question Time programme on Thursday evening.

According to official UK figures, 405 of the 457 British casualties who died in Afghanistan were killed in hostile military action.

The US reportedly lost more than 2,400 soldiers.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 13:46:21 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/e7057d56-f85e-11f0-9bb8-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/000-93T77KF.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Kyiv zoo battles to keep animals warm as city shivers through power crisis</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/kyiv-zoo-battles-keep-animals-warm-city-shivers-through-power-crisis-2026-01-23/</link><description>KYIV, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Staff at Kyiv's zoo are toiling around the clock to keep Tony the gorilla and other animals warm as Russian air strikes target Ukraine's energy infrastructure amid freezing winter temperatures.

Kyiv's Mayor Vitali Klitschko repeated his appeal on Friday to citizens to seek temporary shelter outside the city amid fears of further strikes. That is not an option for 51-year-old Tony, however, or the zoo's other long-suffering residents.

"You can tell people to go to the countryside but I can't say that to Tony," said zoo chief Kyrylo Trantin of Ukraine's oldest gorilla.

"He doesn't have a grandmother in the countryside... where he could stay."

Five times a day, staff deliver firewood to a constantly burning stove to keep the primate's cage at a comfortable 20 degrees Celsius.

Repeated Russian air attacks on Ukraine's energy system in recent weeks have thrown millions of people in Kyiv and other cities into sometimes lengthy periods of darkness and cold.

Emergency outages, worsened by temperatures as low as -18 degrees Celsius (-0.4 degrees Fahrenheit), have also disrupted water supplies.

At the zoo, generators rumble day and night to provide warmth to the animals, which include horses, bison and an elephant.

Staffer Viktoriia Sluzhenko said the zoo keeps enough water reserves to cover the elephant's need of 150 litres per day.

"We constantly fill the tanks so that we can survive in autonomous mode for three days," she said.

The responsibility of keeping other living creatures alive takes a heavy toll on staff also preoccupied with their own survival, said Trantin, as Russia's war nears its four-year mark with no signs of abating.

"Every day is a battle for warmth and power," Trantin added.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 14:26:33 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/TCP7OLEVSVLN5EXUH2AZMVYAWQ.jpg?auth=0dcddacb4ca4a107aec93b4a6ca53daf9bfb7e2981c6c64c9705b508c71d8525&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>France probes link between two baby deaths and milk formula</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/france-probes-link-between-two-baby-deaths-milk-formula-2026-01-23/</link><description>PARIS, Jan 23 (Reuters) - French investigators are examining the deaths of two infants who had consumed baby formula products that were subject to a precautionary recall earlier this month, the French health ministry said on Friday.

One of the babies, who died in the town Pessac in southwestern France, had been fed with Guigoz powder milk made by Swiss group Nestle (NESN.S) , opens new tab and an investigation was ongoing into the possible cause of the death, the Bordeaux prosecutor said.

The ministry said there was no evidence so far that the deaths were linked to the baby formula products.

Nestle and the privately owned French group Lactalis this month recalled batches of infant milk sold in France due to possible contamination with cereulide, a toxin that can cause nausea and vomiting.

Reuters could not immediately establish what infant formula the second baby had consumed.

Nestle said it was taking note of the ongoing investigations.

"As stated by the authorities, at this stage nothing indicates any link between these tragic events and the consumption of our products," it said in an email to Reuters.

Lactalis said it had not received any reports from the health authorities.

"Two reports of infant deaths have been brought to the attention of the health authorities, involving children who were reported to have consumed the infant formula affected by the recalls. To date, no causal link has been scientifically established," the health ministry said in a statement.

"Further analyses are underway and these cases are being investigated by the relevant public prosecutors," it added.

The launch of an inquiry is a standard procedure after the suspicious death of a baby.

The offices of the public prosecutor in Angers, western France, where the other death occurred did not respond to Reuters' request for comment.

Lactalis, the world's largest dairy group, recalled baby milk products in 18 countries and Nestle in dozens. Another French group, Danone (DANO.PA) , opens new tab , blocked a batch of infant formula specifically manufactured for the Singaporean market.

All three companies said the steps were precautionary.

The French farm ministry said on Wednesday the results of a first judicial inquiry were expected in the coming 10 days. It said its investigations had identified an oil rich in arachidonic acid, or ARA, that was produced by a Chinese supplier as the source of the contamination.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 14:26:49 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/JKGZDBXQX5KWLGQP7ETMQYOYC4.jpg?auth=cc46ad92ffcb2a1dc780e4e12d60f835d28462f86f245272f327fe01079c23c2&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>U.S., in control of oil dollars, heaps pressure on Iraq over Iranian influence</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-control-oil-dollars-heaps-pressure-iraq-over-iranian-influence-2026-01-23/</link><description>DUBAI/WASHINGTON, Jan 23 - Washington has threatened senior Iraqi politicians with sanctions targeting the Iraqi state — including potentially its critical supply of oil revenue sourced via the Federal Reserve Bank of New York — should Iran-backed armed groups be included in the next government, four sources told Reuters.

The warning is the starkest example yet of U.S. President Donald Trump's campaign to curb Iran-linked groups' influence in Iraq, which has long walked a tightrope between its two closest allies, Washington and Tehran.

The U.S. warning was delivered repeatedly over the past two months by the U.S. Charges d'Affaires in Baghdad, Joshua Harris, in conversations with Iraqi officials and influential Shi'ite leaders, including some heads of Iran-linked groups via intermediaries, according to three Iraqi officials and one source familiar with the matter who spoke to Reuters for this story.

Harris and the embassy did not respond to requests for comment. The sources requested anonymity to discuss private discussions.

Since taking office a year ago, Trump has acted to weaken the Iranian government, including via its neighbor Iraq.

Iran views Iraq as vital for keeping its economy afloat amidst sanctions, and has long using Baghdad’s banking system to skirt the restrictions, U.S. and Iraqi officials have said . Successive U.S. administrations have sought to choke that dollar stream, placing sanctions on more than a dozen Iraqi banks over the past years in an effort to do so. It has never curtailed the dollar flows from the New York Fed to the Central Bank of Iraq.

"The United States supports Iraqi sovereignty, and the sovereignty of every country in the region. That leaves absolutely no role for Iran-backed militias that pursue malign interests, cause sectarian division, and spread terrorism across the region," a U.S. State Department spokesperson told Reuters, in response to a request for comment.

The spokesperson did not answer Reuters questions about the sanction threats.

Trump, who bombed Iran's nuclear program in June, threatened to again intervene militarily in the country during protests last week.

The dire assessment followed a remark by Energy Minister Denys Shmyhal on Thursday that the country's energy system had endured its most difficult day since a widespread blackout in November 2022, when Russia began attacking the power grid.

Moscow has stepped up strikes in recent weeks, further damaging already battered infrastructure and leaving large swathes of the population without power and heating during a cold snap.

Several power generation facilities are undergoing emergency repairs as a result of the combined attacks, Ukrenergo said on the Telegram messaging app.

"The equipment is operating at the limits of its capabilities," it said, adding that power blocks were carrying a "tremendous" overload due to earlier damage from Russian strikes.

President Volodymyr Zelenskiy declared an energy emergency last week.

Ukrenergo said it hoped repairs would be completed in "the near future", which would enable a return to planned outages.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 14:54:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LVLLLK7WSVL3NKS7UKBGJN7O54.jpg?auth=49b18a4f57b3383fcf97de82a1ab1f8820ff595dce05d5d072132eb48efa3eb4&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Canadian ex-Olympic snowboarder turned alleged drug kingpin arrested, NBC News reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/canadian-ex-olympic-snowboarder-turned-alleged-drug-kingpin-arrested-nbc-news-2026-01-23/</link><description>Jan 23 (Reuters) - Ryan Wedding, a Canadian former Olympic snowboarder suspected of becoming a cocaine smuggling kingpin, has been arrested, NBC News reported on Friday, citing two law enforcement officials familiar with the U.S. investigation.

Maxim Timchenko, CEO of DTEK, said Russia - which launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine almost four years ago - had been waging an "energy terror" campaign since October 2025, hitting power stations and overwhelming air‑defence systems.

The capital Kyiv and surrounding regions are among the most affected, authorities say, and Kyiv's mayor urged residents to leave temporarily if they have somewhere else to go.

"We need an energy ceasefire. A ceasefire on the energy assets,” Timchenko said. “How can you talk about peace and (keep) attacking people, and knowing that people are freezing? How can these things go in parallel?”

Ukraine has endured two weeks of temperatures between minus 15 and minus 20 degrees Celsius, he said, with Russia striking gas transportation, storage and production facilities.

Russia says it is targeting military and energy infrastructure used in the interests of Ukraine's armed forces.

"We are close to a humanitarian catastrophe," Timchenko said. "People get power for 3-4 hours, then a 10- to 15-hour break. We have apartment blocks without heat for weeks already."

He said Ukraine was holding on thanks to gas imports, including from the United States, as attacks had forced gas, coal and hydropower plants to run below capacity.

DTEK has lost 60–70% of its generating capacity and suffered damage worth hundreds of millions of dollars, he said.

Timchenko said rebuilding the energy sector would cost $65–70 billion, citing World Bank estimates, and in many cases would require entirely new assets.

"We are talking rather about building a new energy system in Ukraine rather than just reconstruction," he said.

U.S. asset manager BlackRock has emerged in recent days as the main force behind a U.S.-Ukrainian plan to help design a reconstruction plan for the country.

Ukraine must accelerate construction of decentralised generation, said Timchenko, including new solar projects, green parks and storage. Decentralisation means the assets will be more difficult to hit by drones and missiles, he said.

"We cannot count on a peace deal being signed. We need to start preparing today," he said, adding that Ukraine must stock critical equipment and strengthen air defences.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 15:27:31 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/T6MIOKF3KFIMTPZA3PEYMYEFRE.jpg?auth=205acc87ea1b112bac205107f1a1957c5ee57154bc733a8766c3f2d6fae5aa96&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Spain's deadly rail accidents prompt maintenance investment debate</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/spains-deadly-rail-accidents-prompt-maintenance-investment-debate-2026-01-23/</link><description>MADRID, Jan 23 (Reuters) - A series of accidents in one week on Spain's railways, including one of the deadliest in Europe , has left the country reeling and put the spotlight on whether investment to maintain the network is keeping pace with surging passenger demand.

Nearly 40 million passengers used a high-speed train in Spain in 2024, almost double the 2019 number and pushing the overall use of Spain's railway system to a record 549 million, according to data from the competition authority.

However, the high usage on Europe's largest high-speed rail network means more wear and tear, and data, reports and experts point to a focus on expanding the system, rather than on investment in maintenance, which is lower than in other large European countries.

"Spain's high-speed rail is dying from its own success. It's under greater strain, and it's starting to break down," said Salvador Garcia-Ayllon, a professor at Universidad Politecnica de Cartagena.

A high-speed collision in the southern Andalusia region last Sunday killed 45 people, while two days later a driver was killed and four passengers seriously injured after a containment wall fell on the track after heavy rains near Barcelona derailing a commuter train.

A second train also derailed near Barcelona due to a rock on the line, while a fourth collided with a crane arm in southeastern Spain, causing minor injuries to six passengers.

Preliminary findings from the accident in Andalusia showed a fracture in the rail appeared to have occurred before the train derailed, rail accident investigating body CIAF said on Friday.

"I accept and acknowledge that there should be a debate on whether it is necessary to increase the amount allocated to maintenance," Transport Minister Oscar Puente said in his first press conference after the accident.

"What I do ask is that it be separated from the accident," which occurred on a stretch of track that was renovated last May and inspected on January 7.

European Commission data shows Spain's maintenance investment in its roughly 4,000 km (2,485 miles) of high-speed lines has lagged large European peers, despite an unmatched drive to expand the network.

Spain spent an average of about 1.5 billion euros ($1.76 billion) a year from 2018 to 2022 on its high-speed network, more than any other country.

However, the vast majority went to new infrastructure with only some 16% earmarked for maintenance, renewal and upgrades.

That compares with between 34% to 39% spent by France, Germany and Italy, whose networks are far less extensive, according to the Commission data.

Maintenance spending on Spain's high-speed network needs to increase to 150,000 euros per km from the current 110,000 euros, according to estimates by Jose Trigueros, president of the Association of Roads and Civil Engineers, who said the maintenance budget also needs to be higher for conventional lines.

The main Spanish train drivers' union SEMAF called a three-day nationwide strike to protest against what it said is "the constant deterioration of the railway system" and to demand guarantees of safety and maintenance.

In an August letter to state rail infrastructure operator Adif, which was seen by Reuters, SEMAF had warned of severe wear and tear on several lines, including the stretch where the two trains crashed on Sunday.

"It is a vicious circle. If there are defects in the track, they are transmitted to the train, and defects in the train are also transmitted to the track," Diego Martin, the union's general secretary, told Reuters.

Problems such as deterioration and breaks in the rails increased from 440 in 2015 to 716 in 2024, according to official data. Accidents, including derailments, also rose in the same period to 57 from 42.

The government said that infrastructure issues and accidents on the Spanish network are proportionally below the EU's average and in line with countries such as Germany and France.

The government also pointed to a significant increase in investment. Spending on railway infrastructure has tripled and maintenance per km has increased by 58% to 71,000 euros last year since 2018, when the government of Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez took office.

But a 2024 annual report into Spanish infrastructure by Fundacion BBVA and Ivie showed that the investment was still well below levels before Spain's financial crisis that began in 2008, when adjusted for inflation.

Gross investment in rail infrastructure in 2024 was less than a third of the roughly 11 billion euros at its 2009 peak, the report said.

The decline since 2009 was so steep that starting in 2012 it was not enough to cover depreciation, namely keeping existing facilities in adequate condition, said Matilde Mas, an Ivie researcher who worked on the report.

Investment only returned to a steady rate of increase in 2021.

Like a Ferrari, Spain's world-class rail system needs regular upkeep, said Garcia-Ayllon.

"The expensive thing about a Ferrari is not just buying it, it's maintaining it," he said.

Mangione, 27, is accused of fatally shooting UnitedHealthcare (UNH.N) , opens new tab CEO Brian Thompson on a sidewalk in midtown Manhattan. Public officials condemned the shocking assassination, but Mangione became a folk hero of sorts to some Americans who decry steep healthcare costs and insurance practices.

He has pleaded not guilty to murder, stalking and weapons charges and will appear in custody at Friday’s hearing before U.S. District Judge Margaret Garnett in Manhattan.

Mangione’s lawyers argue prosecutors with the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York should be barred from using evidence found in Mangione’s backpack -- including a 9-millimeter pistol, silencer, and journal entries -- because police illegally searched it without a warrant.

Prosecutors have argued that police officers in Altoona, Pennsylvania did not need a warrant because they had lawfully arrested Mangione for providing fake identification and were legally permitted to search the bag for dangerous items before transporting it.

Garnett has ordered an Altoona Police Department officer to testify at Friday’s hearing about the department’s standard procedures for securing, safeguarding and inventorying a person’s property when they are arrested in a public place.

Mangione’s lawyers are separately asking Garnett to throw out an indictment against Mangione over purported legal deficiencies, or block prosecutors from seeking the death penalty over alleged violations of Mangione’s constitutional rights.

Garnett has scheduled jury selection for early September.

Mangione has pleaded not guilty to murder and other charges in a separate case brought by the office of Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg.

The judge overseeing that case is also weighing a request by Mangione’s lawyers to suppress evidence from the backpack. A trial date has not been set.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 15:52:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/O7JR67IXNZP25ENCPZPFSNBAYM.jpg?auth=ff328ee48bcb1c28bf14c7d547a679a60a6953f8d5f5542dbcf0d9ba2a8376be&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US targets Iran's 'shadow fleet' over crackdown on protesters</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-targets-irans-shadow-fleet-over-crackdown-protesters-2026-01-23/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 23 (Reuters) - The United States on Friday imposed sanctions on nine vessels of what is known as the shadow fleet and eight related firms, the U.S. Treasury Department said in a statement, as Washington sought to escalate pressure on Iran over the recent killing of protesters.

The Treasury said the vessels and their respective owners or management firms, which include entities based in India, Oman and the United Arab Emirates, have collectively transported hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of Iranian oil and petroleum products to foreign markets.

"Today’s sanctions target a critical component of how Iran generates the funds used to repress its own people. As previously outlined, Treasury will continue to track the tens of millions of dollars that the regime has stolen and is desperately attempting to wire to banks outside of Iran," Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in the statement.

Rights groups say thousands of people, including bystanders, were killed during the unrest in Iran, which they describe as the biggest crackdown since Shi'ite Muslim clerics took power in the 1979 revolution.

Trump had repeatedly threatened to intervene against Iran over the recent killings of protesters there, but protests dwindled last week and President Donald Trump's rhetoric regarding Iran has eased.

The shadow fleet refers to ships that carry oil that is under sanctions. They are typically old, their ownership opaque and they sail without the top-tier insurance cover needed to meet international standards for oil majors and many ports.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 15:52:56 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/NYUKZY7QWNJU7M6KYFUN2GRGWQ.jpg?auth=104e1826870dbdc45f1d854b011aa0a793bf2c7cedcd320dc89fe0ee14c6d93c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Italy's willingness to cooperate with the US remains firm, PM says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/italys-willingness-cooperate-with-us-remains-firm-pm-says-2026-01-23/</link><description>ROME, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said on Friday Rome's willingness to cooperate with the United States remains firm.

"ICE OUT!" was the message of fliers posted on businesses' doors, referring to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency on Friday, a frigid day in snowy Minneapolis with temperatures well below freezing. "NO WORK. NO SCHOOL. NO SHOPPING."

More than 300 bars, restaurants, museums, shops and other local businesses were shuttering for the day, according to the Minnesota Star Tribune. No school districts were shutting down, but schools in the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul offered remote-learning options, the Star Tribune reported.

A march in downtown Minneapolis on Friday afternoon was intended by organizers to be the largest show of opposition yet to the federal government's surge, which Mayor Jacob Frey and other Democrats have likened to an invasion.

Trump, a Republican, launched the Minnesota crackdown in response to fraud allegations against some members of the state's large Somali American community. He has called Somali immigrants "garbage" and said they are to be removed from the country as part of his effort to expel more immigrants, including some admitted into the country to seek asylum and other lawful residents, than any of his predecessors.

Minnesota residents have responded with anger, making noise in the streets day and night with whistles and musical instruments. Some agents and protesters have yelled obscenities at each other, and agents have deployed tear gas and flash-bang grenades to scatter crowds. The Trump administration says some protesters have harassed agents and obstructed their work.

The numerous Fortune 500 companies that call Minnesota home - mostly based in the Minneapolis area - have refrained from public statements about the immigration raids. Minneapolis-based Target (TGT.N) , opens new tab , which has come under fire in the last year for retreating from its public commitment to diversity policies, has faced more criticism for not speaking out about activity at its stores. State lawmakers have pressed the company for details of its guidance to employees if and when ICE officers show up at stores.

The company declined a request for comment. Reuters also contacted Minnesota-based UnitedHealth, Medtronic, Abbott Laboratories, Best Buy, Hormel, General Mills, 3M and Fastenal. None immediately responded to requests for comment.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 16:32:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/EGACUQP5IFKPFJYV7AKTWUPMCM.jpg?auth=6207cf0c99b1e13ee3dac73082c07bec12947175fa9ee81bae8269e79a0e09f9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Merz says Berlin cannot accept Trump's Board of Peace plan in current form</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/merz-says-berlin-cannot-accept-trumps-board-peace-plan-current-form-2026-01-23/</link><description>ROME, Jan 23 (Reuters) - German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said on Friday he would be ready to join U.S. President Donald Trump's Board of Peace initiative for the sake of Gaza but could not accept the plan in its current form.

Backed by the US, the Kurds have long spearheaded efforts by the West to fight against the Islamic State (IS) group .

The Kurdish-led armed group, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), in 2012-2013 established its governance over swathes of territory in the north and northeast of the country that became known as the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria, or Rojava (meaning “west” in Kurdish).

But since the fall of dictator Bashar al-Assad , Syria’s new leadership has formed its own alliance with Washington and pushed the Kurds to give up their aspirations of autonomy.

Violent clashes with government forces in January saw the Kurds driven out from the city of Aleppo . They later evacuated Raqqa and Deir Ezzor .

The SDF, which previously controlled around 30 percent of Syria’s territory, has been pushed back to strongholds along the Turkish border in al-Hasakah, Qamishli and Kobane and handed over governance of prisons holding thousands of IS group members.

“The original purpose of the SDF as the primary anti-ISIS force on the ground has largely expired, as Damascus is now both willing and positioned to take over security responsibilities, including control of ISIS detention facilities and camps,” US ambassador to Syria Tom Barrack wrote on X , using an alternative acronym for the IS group.

Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa has now given the Kurds until January 24 to propose a plan for the peaceful integration of Rojava into the Syrian state.

Are the Kurds' gains in autonomy and sovereignty over the last few years now disintegrating?

Adel Bakawan, director of the European Institute for Studies on the Middle East and North Africa (EISMENA) and author of " La Décomposition du Moyen-Orient. Trois ruptures qui ont fait basculer l'Histoire ” (“The Decomposition of the Middle East: Three Breakdowns that Changed History”) explains.

FRANCE 24: Why have Syria’s Kurds been cornered so successfully by Sharaa?

During the Syrian civil war from 2011-2014, around 105 different groups were fighting, sometimes against each other.

This is when Daesh [also known as the Islamic State group] emerged from a split with al Qaeda . The United States and Europe chose to train and support the Kurds so that they could lead the fight against Daesh.

In doing so, the SDF advanced as far as Raqqa and Deir Ezzor – zones controlled by Arab tribes.

When Sharaa took power on December 8, 2024, it was thanks to his network in the Gulf: Saudi Arabia , Qatar and Turkey .

When he visited Riyadh, [Saudi leader] Mohammed bin Salman convinced [US President] Donald Trump to normalise relations with Syria, lifting sanctions and integrating it into the international coalition against Daesh.

The SDF no longer held the card of fighting against Daesh, and when the new Syrian state was integrated into the international coalition, the Kurds also had to hand over control of prisons holding thousands of Daesh leaders and militants.

Next, the Americans asked the Arab tribes that were integrated in the Kurd’s autonomous administration in north-east Syria to cut their ties with the SDF and to join Sharaa’s new army. The Kurds could not wage war against their former allies and the Syrian army, so the cities they were holding fell very quickly.

Finally, the Kurds lost control of the oil and gas fields that had financed their economy, and dams that were very important for geostrategy and geopolitics.

What room for manoeuvre do the Kurds have now?

They don’t have much leverage, except through Iraqi Kurdistan, with whom they have had disagreements throughout the 13 years of Rojava’s governance.

Thanks to strong international lobbying, Donald Trump picked up the telephone to tell Sharaa not to enter Rojava, the historic Kurdish territory.

Kurdish fighters have now left Aleppo and Raqqa. Clashes there did not spark a war – although the Kurds do still have a very powerful army. It’s a trained and armed ideological organisation, which will not surrender. And that is a means of exerting pressure.

What does the future hold for Rojava? Is it the end of the Kurds' dream of their own state?

We are entering into a grey area. It was predictable that the US would drop the Kurds, and we foresaw that. The Kurds in Rojava have also been abandoned by Israel – even though Israel has helped the Druze .

Israel will not intervene to defend the Kurds against the Syrian army now that Israel and Syria are normalising their relations.

It’s an existential question. In 2017, as they were coming out of a war with Daesh, the Iraqi Kurds played a major role in toppling the caliphate in Mosul and organised a referendum on independence for Iraqi Kurdistan.

Iraq’s Kurds voted 93 percent in favour, but the international community was fiercely opposed, and all the territories were recovered.

In 2019, when the Syrian Kurds were at the height of their powers in Afrin, a very strategic location for them, the Americans gave the green light for pro-Turkish militia organisations to occupy the city. It was a tragic blow for the Kurds.

Is it the end of the dream of independence? There are 50-60 million Kurds, making them the largest people in the Middle East without their own state. How can you stabilise and secure the Middle East when you have 60 million people that have been betrayed and abandoned?

If the international community wants to secure and stabilise the region there must be a Palestinian state and a Kurdish state.

And as the dream of independence has become fragile in Rojava, it has become much more plausible in Iraqi Kurdistan.

What impact will this have on Turkey and its peace process with the Kurdistan Workers’ Party ( PKK )?

[PKK leader] Abdullah Ocalan sent a letter to the group from prison asking it to disband, put down its weapons and stop demanding Kurdish independence, federalism, autonomy and even decentralisation.

Its goal is now to fight for a democratic society in Turkey.

The Turks believe this applies to not only the PKK in Turkey but also its branches in Iraq , Syria and Iran – but Abdullah Ocalan has not clearly stated a position on this.

Turkey has strongly encouraged and supported Sharaa’s offensive into territory controlled by the Kurds, while asking that he integrates the Kurds into the new Syria.

But for Turkey to implement its grand strategy across the Middle East, it needs to foster a relationship of “ eternal brotherhood ” with the Kurds.

Turkey, 20 years ago, did all it could to undermine the regional government in Kurdistan. Today its greatest ally in the region is the Kurdistan regional government in Iraq.

The West has for years relied on the Kurds to fight Daesh. Can the Syrian army really take over this fight?

Sharaa has renounced his former radical beliefs. He is pragmatic and knows how the international arena works. A Qatari communication firm has been helping him with everything from the choice of his suits to trimming his beard.

What interests me is his militant base that must now wage war against Daesh, the Kurds, the Alawites and the Druze.

Sharaa abandoned al Qaeda for Daesh and created its Syrian branch with authorisation from the caliph Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi . And his militant base has absolutely not changed.

When I analyse videos, accounts and speeches on the ground I don’t really see a big difference between the Daesh of 2014 and 2019. Their entire lives are shaped by radical ideology.

For example, they still associate the Kurds with pigs and heretics who must be killed. It’s exactly the same ideology as before.

Personally, I think that the international community will regret transferring the fight against Daesh from the SDF to Hayat Tahrir al-Sham [HTS, the Islamist rebel group directed by Sharaa during the war]. How can he control his militant base?

Beyond this, the new Syrian army, which has been entrusted with the fight against Daesh, is not homogenous.

There were around 500 armed groups fighting against Bashar al-Assad. Their loyalty ranges from the Syrian state, to Turkey, to Saudi Arabia. So, it’s a very, very risky gamble.

While many people at the event told Reuters they thought some of Trump's positions on global issues, such as demands that Europe spend more on its own security, had merit, they were deeply offended by the way he and his team presented them.

"It was kind of overwhelming. It was the full Trump show we got here," said Conradin Cramer, head of the cantonal government of the Swiss city of Basel following Trump's address on Wednesday to the World Economic Forum's annual meeting.

"He was very outspoken against Europe, against European values, and that was frightening for me," Cramer told Reuters.

Business leaders were also nervous, with two U.S.-based bankers admitting at the start they were worried about a full-blown trade war developing that would hit business sentiment.

Several participants said that by some measures, this was one of the most eventful meetings in five decades of the WEF, which had labelled this year's event "A Spirit of Dialogue".

Trump struck a Greenland deal on the sidelines with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and oversaw the signing of his new Board of Peace , drawing several world leaders to Davos.

The president and other U.S. officials also said they were close to a peace deal in Ukraine, which came into focus on Thursday when President Volodymyr Zelenskiy travelled to Davos.

President Vladimir Putin's envoy Kirill Dmitriev also held talks with U.S. officials on the sidelines, the first Russian official to come to Davos since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022.

Several participants told Reuters that the annual meeting -- the first since WEF founder Klaus Schwab's departure last year -- had been a win for BlackRock CEO Larry Fink.

A spokesperson said Schwab was not available for comment.

Fink, who is also WEF co-chair, used his influence to attract big names including billionaire Elon Musk, who made his Davos debut as a last-minute addition to the agenda.

Trump said Fink turned everything he touched to gold.

Moderators in some sessions appeared to avoid tough questions and the agenda largely skirted issues that the Trump administration has opposed. The programme featured four sessions that referenced climate change, whereas in 2022 there were 16.

Trump spoke for more than an hour, well over his allotted time on the agenda, and by the time he sat down for a moderated question-and-answer session a small but steady trickle of delegates were already leaving the room.

Several participants said that while Trump loomed large, business did get done at Davos, with executives meeting clients and customers and discussing issues ranging from geopolitics and trade to stablecoins and artificial intelligence.

Francesco Ceccato, CEO of Barclays in Europe, said the meeting had a "mixture of geopolitics that can't be ignored".

But there had also been "a lot of really interesting dialogue" around AI and related issues such as investment risk and energy needs, Ceccato told Reuters.

The Trump agenda permeated many of the discussions.

U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick drew sharp reactions when he slammed Europe at a Fink-hosted dinner, which European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde walked out of .

The next night at a Bank of America soiree, Lutnick held court with CEO Brian Moynihan, said a source familiar with the event at 'Goals House', where British finance minister Rachel Reeves played chess and Marcus Mumford performed live, including an acoustic version of Bruce Springsteen's 'I'm on Fire'.

As usual at the parties and meetings around Davos, attendees gossiped and traded rumours, although some triggered anxiety.

Early on in the week, one circulated that mobile and internet networks would be shut down when Trump arrived in town.

As it turned out, both phones and internet worked fine.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 17:26:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ZWGW5WZQEFOWFCC5QJVVGYWDHE.jpg?auth=dbffd4941dff070c188d85cc3566dae5ef2c8ebc73e4f323f5d8adb50f9a16f0&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>EU concerned about Trump 'concentration of powers' over 'Board of Peace', document says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/eu-concerned-about-trump-concentration-powers-over-board-peace-document-says-2026-01-23/</link><description>BRUSSELS, Jan 23 (Reuters) - The European Union’s foreign policy arm has raised questions about U.S. President Donald Trump’s broad powers over his new Board of Peace, according to an internal document seen by Reuters.

Trump has urged world leaders to join his Board of Peace initiative aimed at resolving conflicts globally, but many Western heads of government have been reluctant to take part .

In a confidential analysis dated January 19 and shared with the EU’s member countries, the European External Action Service expressed worries about a concentration of power in Trump’s hands.

The Board of Peace's charter “raises a concern under the EU’s constitutional principles” and “the autonomy of the EU legal order also militates against a concentration of powers in the hands of the chairman,” the bloc’s diplomatic service wrote.

The document also says the new Board of Peace “departs significantly” from the mandate that was authorized by the United Nations Security Council in November and solely focused on the Gaza conflict .

The new board, which the U.S. president launched on Thursday , is chaired for life by Trump and is set to start by addressing the Gaza conflict and then be expanded to deal with other conflicts. Member states are limited to three-year terms unless they pay $1 billion each to fund the board's activities and earn permanent membership.

"Once this board is completely formed, we can do pretty much whatever we want to do. And we'll do it in conjunction with the United Nations," Trump said, adding that the U.N. had great potential that had not been fully utilised.

After European leaders met to discuss the transatlantic relationship on Thursday evening, European Council President Antonio Costa told reporters: "We have serious doubts about a number of elements in the charter of the Board of Peace, related to its scope, its governance and its compatibility with the United Nations charter.”

Costa said that the EU was “ready to work together with the United States on the implementation of the comprehensive Peace Plan for Gaza, with a Board of Peace carrying out its mission as a transitional administration, in accordance with the United Nations Security Council Resolution 2803”.

Several EU countries, including France and Spain , have already said they would not be joining the board.

In its analysis, the EU’s diplomatic service said that “the provision that a Member State’s choice about the level of its participation needs the approval of the chairman constitutes an undue interference with the organisational autonomy of each member”.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 17:26:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/EDTAIJS6XFP6JJDKHQTC22YG4Y.jpg?auth=978b586a078995fa8775ac7a3b86386209d53e30fbbc2e3aab243d039078d91d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>French Navy diverts suspected Russian shadow fleet tanker 'GRINCH' to Marseille-Fos port</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/french-navy-diverts-suspected-russian-shadow-fleet-tanker-grinch-marseille-fos-2026-01-23/</link><description>MARSEILLE, France, Jan 23 (Reuters) - The French navy has diverted the Grinch oil tanker it detained on Thursday towards the port of Marseille-Fos for further investigation, a source close to the investigation told Reuters on Friday.

The navy had intercepted the tanker, which had left the Russian port of Murmansk in early January, on suspicion of operating under a false flag and belonging to the "shadow fleet" that enables Russia to export oil despite sanctions.

The ship was sailing under a Comoros flag.

The interception was on high seas in the western Mediterranean, between the southern coast of Spain and the northern coast of Morocco, the French maritime police said in a statement on Thursday. It added that navies of other countries, including Britain, supported the operation.

The office of the prosecutor of Marseille, which handles matters related to maritime law and is investigating the case, said on Friday that the ship had been diverted, but did not specify where to.

The EU has imposed 19 packages of sanctions against Russia, but Moscow has adapted to most measures and continues to sell millions of barrels of oil to countries such as India and China, typically at discounted prices.

Much of the oil is carried by what is known as a shadow fleet of vessels operating outside of the Western maritime industry.

In October, France detained another sanctioned tanker, the Boracay, off its west coast and released it after a few days.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 17:28:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/DIVQV4GHBZN35BPI5AS7JCFNJA.jpg?auth=97202f4a642e5f53762490730102879e250368a1ccd4c0d37b9ae4b533bd9d60&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Spanish prosecutors drop abuse case against Julio Iglesias</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/spanish-prosecutors-drop-abuse-case-against-julio-iglesias-2026-01-23/</link><description>MADRID, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Prosecutors at Spain's High Court have shelved a preliminary investigation into singer Julio Iglesias, saying on Friday that the court lacked jurisdiction as the alleged crimes were abroad and the accusers did not reside in the country.

Rights group Women's Link Worldwide had filed the complaint on January 5 on behalf of two women said to have worked in Iglesias' Caribbean residences over a 10-month period in 2021, based on an investigation by U.S. broadcaster Univision and Spanish outlet elDiario.es.

The accusations included human trafficking for forced labour and servitude, sexual assault and violations of workers' rights. Iglesias described them as "completely false" in various social media posts.

Attempts by Reuters to contact representatives of Iglesias, 82, have gone unanswered. His record label Sony has declined to comment on the case.

The prosecutor's office said in a filing seen by Reuters that the High Court was unable to try Iglesias as the alleged crimes were in the Dominican Republic and Bahamas, adding that prosecution could still be sought in those two countries.

In addition, the alleged victims were not Spanish and did not reside in Spain, it said, citing Supreme Court jurisprudence that limited the legal principle of universal jurisdiction.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 17:28:12 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Rubio says Haiti transitional council must be dissolved by Feb 7</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/rubio-says-haiti-transitional-council-must-be-dissolved-by-feb-7-2026-01-23/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 23 - U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Friday that Haiti's Transitional Presidential Council (CPT) must be dissolved by February 7, as he backed Prime Minister Alix Didier Fils-Aimé in a phone call with the Haitian leader, State Department spokesperson Tommy Pigott said in a statement.

Here's what we learned:

Europe learned the value of standing up to Trump . His claim to Greenland crossed all of its red lines on territorial sovereignty and Europe's resistance, possibly helped by the ensuing fall on financial markets, was seen as one reason he backed off.

But Europe's trust in the transatlantic relationship with Washington has been badly rattled, and its leaders are looking at how to act faster when the next crisis occurs.

"There are efforts to advance European decision-making. We are probably too slow," one European Union official said.

Many European leaders and executives said they found the Trump administration's approach offensive and rude, even as some said the U.S. president had raised legitimate issues.

Ukraine was at first overshadowed during Davos, but as Trump announced a deal on Greenland, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy flew in for talks.

A peace deal appears elusive, despite U.S., Ukrainian and Russian officials speaking of progress and Zelenskiy said territorial issues were still unresolved.

In another sign of the influence of the Trump administration on the agenda, Russian President Vladimir Putin's envoy Kirill Dmitriev landed in Davos for talks with U.S. officials on Tuesday - the first Russian official to visit Davos since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022.

Dmitriev held talks at the USA House, without attending the Forum itself.

Leaders openly debated not just whether Trump might strike Iran, but what would come after. Would the regime crumble? And if it did, who would own the fallout? Trump's unpredictability once again became a defining feature of the event.

U.S. threats on the eve of the meeting to impose tariffs on European allies for resisting Trump's ambition to acquire Greenland inflamed trade tensions and reinforced concerns among some CEOs that Europe can no longer rely on the U.S.

"When you talk to CEOs today, what do they want? Stability, predictability, and the rule of law. I would say it's in short supply," Canadian Finance Minister François-Philippe Champagne said during a debate on tariffs.

Trump's gambit added fuel to arguments of those advocating for countries and companies to diversify commerce away from an increasingly protectionist U.S. and to trade more with each other.

Financial services firms hoped for increased business activity and growth this year, as they contended with potential disruption from U.S. policy, geopolitics, artificial intelligence and financial technology.

JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warned that a proposal to cap credit card interest rates would amount to economic disaster, while other bankers said they were trying to shape the administration's policy on affordability.

Crypto industry executives talked up stablecoins and blockchain technology's potential to disrupt finance. Some bankers said they are experimenting with the new technology, while others remained wary.

Meanwhile, the macroeconomic outlook, questions about the U.S. Federal Reserve's independence and fears about bubbles in AI and other assets weighed on investors' minds.

The tech industry came to Davos in full force, with rare appearances by Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Nvidia's Jensen Huang.

AI startup Anthropic set up office space on Davos' main drag for the week, aiming to grow its enterprise sales. And unlike the scepticism of late 2025, executives said they were putting concerns that the market overvalued AI companies behind them.

While jobs would disappear, they said new ones would spring up. AI would be an excuse to justify layoffs, not necessarily the cause, two business leaders told Reuters.

But union leaders feared AI would destroy jobs and lead to more inequality, with some demanding regulation and training.

Big Oil returned to Davos with a vengeance after a year of Trump's presidency, as he orders a pause on wind parks and tells U.S. companies to drill for more oil at home and abroad.

U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright told a panel that global oil production needs to more than double to meet rising energy demand, challenging widespread analysts' views that demand may peak in the next two decades.

Wright also said Europe and the U.S. state of California were wasting too much money on green energy investments. The Trump administration is radically changing the narrative and the oil industry likes it, one oil executive said.

But breaking ranks with Trump on renewable energy, Elon Musk said the U.S. could produce enough solar power to meet all of its electricity needs, including booming demand from the proliferation of Big Tech's power-hungry data centers.

"You could take a small corner of Utah, Nevada or New Mexico - a very small percentage of the area of the U.S. - to generate all of the electricity that the U.S. uses," he added.

"Unfortunately, the tariff barriers for solar are extremely high and that makes the economics of deploying solar artificially high," Musk said.

The world breathed a sigh of relief after Trump spoke of no military solution to his demands for Greenland. But some executives set their hopes on increased European and U.S. defence spending, including construction projects and hiring.

Trump also talked about a secret sonic weapon that he said was used during the capture of Venezuela's Nicolas Maduro.

Russia and China will have to go back to the drawing board, Trump said. Russian secret services are looking into it, the Kremlin said.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 17:50:04 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4YJKUNRDURJEPKV5ZSB2KSFUEQ.jpg?auth=8876dac4a9d2ad294b1cba969438a4ea8be368a9bb62c9c7af806bce821502cd&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Lawsuit challenges Trump ending Ethiopians' temporary legal status</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/lawsuit-challenges-trump-ending-ethiopians-temporary-legal-status-2026-01-23/</link><description>BOSTON, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Immigrant rights advocates have filed a lawsuit seeking to block U.S. President Donald Trump's administration from ending temporary protections from deportation that had been granted to thousands of Ethiopians living in the United States.

Three Ethiopian nationals, along with the non-profit African Communities Together, allege in a lawsuit , opens new tab filed in Boston federal court on Thursday that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security is unlawfully putting over 5,000 people at risk of losing their temporary protected status after February 13.

They say that while Ethiopia remains a country in a humanitarian crisis, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem unlawfully terminated the Ethiopians' legal status with just 60 days' notice based on an unconstitutional animus, or ill will, against non-white immigrants. Ethiopia's population is predominantly Black.

DHS did not respond to a request for comment.

The case is the latest in a series of lawsuits challenging the Trump administration's efforts to curtail protections from deportation extended to citizens of numerous countries through grants of TPS.

Under federal law, TPS is available to people whose home countries have experienced natural disasters, armed conflicts or other extraordinary events. It provides eligible migrants with work authorization and temporary protection from deportation.

Numerous lawsuits have been filed challenging the administration's moves to end similar protections for nationals from countries, including Syria , Venezuela , Haiti , Nicaragua and South Sudan , leading to court rulings that have at times slowed or halted the Trump administration's efforts to strip migrants of their legal status.

The latest lawsuit was filed after DHS said on December 12 it was ending TPS for Ethiopia, saying conditions in the African nation no longer posed a serious threat to people returning safely to it and that TPS was "never meant to be a ticket to permanent residency."

Former Democratic President Joe Biden's administration granted Ethiopians already in the United States that status beginning in 2022, citing the need to protect citizens fleeing armed conflict in their home nation.

The Ethiopian military and allies, including troops from neighboring Eritrea, had been battling forces from the northern region of Tigray in a conflict that killed thousands and displaced millions of people.

While that civil war formally ended later in 2022, the Biden administration extended TPS for Ethiopians in mid-2024, citing armed conflict in another region, Amhara , which is ongoing.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 18:38:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/PG7LMET3BROIFKHSJ53X4INAQE.jpg?auth=989e94e7d9e0d3faa8fd482748b250bfedae837e6f6143a5ee5d7487d546f7f2&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Turkish court rejects bid by Erdogan rival to overcome block to his presidential run</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/turkish-court-rejects-bid-by-erdogan-rival-overcome-block-his-presidential-run-2026-01-23/</link><description>ISTANBUL, Jan 23 (Reuters) - A Turkish court rejected on Friday a lawsuit from jailed Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu challenging the cancellation of his university degree, his legal team said, in a further blow to his plans to run for the presidency in the next election.

Imamoglu, who is President Tayyip Erdogan's main political rival, has been since last March, pending trial on corruption charges. He received a separate prison sentence in July for insulting and threatening the city’s chief prosecutor.

Without a university degree, Imamoglu cannot stand as a candidate for president. His legal team told Reuters that he would appeal against Friday's court ruling.

His jailing has been criticised by Imamoglu's opposition Republican People's Party (CHP), other opposition parties, some Western leaders and rights groups as an anti-democratic move aimed at eliminating an electoral threat to Erdogan.

Imamoglu himself has denied all the accusations against him, saying they are politically motivated. Erdogan's government denies political pressure on the courts and says the judiciary is independent.

Istanbul University said last March it had annulled Imamoglu’s degree, days before the opposition picked him as its presidential candidate in the next election, which is scheduled to take place in 2028.

Imamoglu has said the university's decision was illegal and outside its jurisdiction.

In a post on X, CHP Vice Chair Burhanettin Bulut said the court's dismissal of the diploma case amounted to a political decision that showed the judiciary was being used against rivals.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 18:38:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/XCWZW2KYJVLE5M2JRXCWZFNJXU.jpg?auth=45e9423c5bfaac4c5a191a128321f134af10b7dd20f4ed4c24220b89eaf0f41d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Prince Harry says sacrifices by NATO troops in Afghanistan deserve 'respect' after Trump comments</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/prince-harry-says-sacrifices-by-nato-troops-afghanistan-deserve-respect-after-2026-01-23/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Britain's Prince Harry said in response to comments from U.S. President Donald Trump that NATO troops stayed off the front line in Afghanistan, that "sacrifices" made in the conflict by NATO forces "deserve to be spoken about truthfully and with respect".

"We are the ones who appointed Didier Fils-Aime in November 2024. We are the ones who worked with him for a year, and it is up to us to issue a new decree naming a new prime minister, a new government and a new presidency," Transitional Presidential Council (CPT) member Leslie Voltaire told a press conference.

The CPT, which sacked its first prime minister six months into the job, was appointed to oversee a move towards Haiti's first election in a decade, but this was repeatedly pushed back due to worsening insecurity amid conflict with powerful gangs.

It acts as the country's top executive body.

Five of nine CPT members have signed a resolution to remove Fils-Aime, several of those members have said. However, it has yet to be published in the country's official gazette, a necessary step before the decision becomes legally valid.

Voltaire spoke alongside fellow CPT member Edgard Leblanc Fils, who said the plan was to replace Fils-Aime within a maximum of thirty days. Voltaire said there would be a "pause" to allow political groups to find an acceptable solution for the political succession.

Washington has issued several strong warnings against Fils-Aime's removal, saying it would take firm action against politicians it deems corrupt and that the CPT must be dissolved when their mandate ends on February 7.

No official plan has been put forward for the succession, but Haiti's U.N. envoy on Thursday signaled that a prime minister could continue to head the country after the CPT's term is up.

Speaking to Radio Kiskeya on Thursday, CPT member Louis Gerard-Gilles, who also supported the ouster, said he could be replaced by Finance Minister Alfred Metellus, a public sector veteran and former IDB consultant.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 19:26:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ANOMMERXHZO53EAKP7HXV43DKM.jpg?auth=bd479b76c93083d6500a5da294115e8d9fab254a8c00c94b63c78386aa14d1ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Kosovo detains 109 after vote tampering probe forces recount</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/kosovo-detains-109-after-vote-tampering-probe-forces-recount-2026-01-23/</link><description>PRISTINA, Jan 23 (Reuters) - More than 100 people have been detained on suspicion of tampering with votes from Kosovo's December 28 election , prosecutors said, amid investigations that have triggered a recount that could delay the formation of a new government.

The inquiries are not expected to overturn the victory of incumbent Prime Minister Albin Kurti's party , as prosecutors said the suspects were accused of switching votes between candidates on individual party lists - not between different parties - under the proportional representation system.

But they were seen as a severe embarrassment for the young country which aims to join the European Union.

Kurti's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Bedri Hamza, head of the country's second biggest movement, the Democratic Party of Kosovo, called the discrepancies "deeply concerning".

The Kosovo Election Commission said it was launching initial investigations two weeks ago after checks on videos from some counting centres showed irregularities.

On Monday, it ordered a total vote recount, saying problems had been found in multiple locations.

On Friday, the Chief Prosecutor in the southern town of Prizren, Petrit Kryeziu, said 109 suspects had been detained on suspicion of changing votes there to favour certain candidates on lists drawn up by individual parties.

The suspects were officials, known as election commissioners, chosen to count votes by the parties under Kosovo's electoral system. Some were suspected of taking bribes, and officials from all four major parties must have been involved, Kryeziu added.

"It would have been impossible for these votes to be altered if there had been no compromise from the commissioners to do this from all four largest parties," Kryeziu said during a press conference.

“Now we have cooperative witnesses who have explained the methods of pressure used on them and some have revealed details of who took and who offered bribes to them,” Kryeziu added.

Similar arrests are expected in other towns, officials told Reuters.

“The manipulation of votes for candidates for MPs is a big embarrassment for Kosovo," political commentator Ilir Deda said. "It has eroded public trust in the electoral processes."

On Friday, the election commission said it had recounted more than half of the votes, and so far only one candidate had lost his seat to another candidate from the same party as a result.

Most of the candidates who are said to have benefited from the additional votes have denied any wrongdoing.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 19:27:12 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/34ZPXV37NFO5LEOXZTL4AEQIBU.jpg?auth=a7a6b1a0261dc224797714c2dcfba592215f392edfeeb40cf76c7470d94de171&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'Dangerous' winter storm to sweep US with snow, ice and deadly cold</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260123-catastrophic-ice-storm-set-to-sweep-across-us-over-weekend</link><description>A massive winter storm was set to drop a hazardous mix of freezing rain and heavy snow on some 160 million Americans starting Friday, threatening "catastrophic" icy conditions.

Multiple US states had declared states of emergency as meteorologists said the storm system forming off the California coast would soon begin its march across much of the continental US, covering a wide swath of the country's middle including the Rockies and Plains.

It could bring "catastrophic ice accumulation", the National Weather Service said, and could result in "long-duration power outages, extensive tree damage, and extremely dangerous or impassable travel conditions".

The storm was expected to linger for days, shifting into the heavily populated mid-Atlantic and northeastern states while crippling daily life and ushering in a frigid air mass across wide areas of the country.

More than 1,500 weekend flights had already been cancelled, according to the tracker Flightaware, including many in Texas .

State officials there vowed the power grid that failed during a deadly winter storm five years ago and left millions without power was prepared this time around.

The southern state's Republican Governor Greg Abbott told journalists Thursday that "there is no expectation whatsoever that there's going to be any loss of power from the power grid" which he said "has never been stronger, never been more prepared and is fully capable of handling this winter storm".

Meanwhile in New York state, Democratic Governor Kathy Hochul warned of extreme cold that could make even short trips outdoors dangerous, urging people to stock up now, avoid unnecessary travel and stay inside.

She emphasised risks ranging from hypothermia and heart attacks while shoveling to power outages, while stressing precautions like protecting pipes, using heaters safely and checking on vulnerable neighbours.

Hochul told reporters the state is fully mobilised, with thousands of utility workers, plows and emergency crews on standby to keep roads clear, restore power and protect those most at risk.

"Five or six minutes outside could literally be dangerous for your health," she said, adding that "hypothermia can settle in quickly, frostbite can settle in".

The storm is set to usher in frigid temperatures and dangerous winds that could last a week in some areas. As of Friday morning, parts of the Upper Midwest were already experiencing wind chills forecast to hit in the range of -48C.

The brutal storm system is the result of a stretched "polar vortex," an Arctic region of cold, low-pressure air that normally forms a relatively compact, circular system but sometimes stretches into a more oval shape, sending cold air spilling across North America.

Scientists say the increasing frequency of such disruptions of the polar vortex may be linked to climate change , though the debate is not yet settled and natural variability also plays a role.

But US President Donald Trump – who scoffs at climate change science and has rolled back green energy policies – wasted no time in questioning how the cold front fit into broader climate shifts.

"Record Cold Wave expected to hit 40 States. Rarely seen anything like it before. Could the Environmental Insurrectionists please explain – WHATEVER HAPPENED TO GLOBAL WARMING???," the Republican leader posted on his platform Truth Social.

State officials were more focused on the immediate threats the powerful storm posed to residents, with at least 14 states from the south to the northeast as well as Washington, DC declaring states of emergency.

Political leaders across the country were encouraging people to stock up on food and dry goods, prepare emergency first aid and supply kits and keep their vehicle gas tanks full to prevent fuel lines from freezing.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 19:27:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/4d378ac0-f88b-11f0-8eb8-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP5598506934977103.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Relatives of Argentine prisoners in Venezuela ask Vatican to intervene for release</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/relatives-argentine-prisoners-venezuela-ask-vatican-intervene-release-2026-01-23/</link><description>BUENOS AIRES, Jan 23 (Reuters) - The families of two Argentines detained in Venezuela on Friday appealed to the Vatican to intervene, urging it to help speed the release of their loved ones as Caracas has begun freeing some detainees.

The wife of Nahuel Agustín Gallo, a national security officer arrested on Dec 8, 2024, and the wife of German Giuliani, a lawyer imprisoned since May 2025, delivered a formal petition to the Catholic Church in Buenos Aires, calling for urgent action by the Holy See.

"There are still many innocent people missing, many who need to be released," said Alexandra Gomez, Gallo's wife. "These piecemeal releases only wear down the families," she added.

Gomez said her husband had been "forcibly disappeared in Venezuela for 411 days."

In a letter seen by Reuters, addressed to Pope Leo and Cardinal Pietro Parolin, relatives appealed to "the humanitarian sensitivity and the permanent commitment of the Holy See to the defense of human dignity, freedom and fundamental rights."

The families also demanded immediate steps to safeguard the physical and psychological well-being of the detainees.

The women were joined by relatives and friends of Venezuelan political prisoners who demonstrated outside with photographs of the detained, national flags and placards reading "They took them alive, we want them back alive" and "Political prisoners are not bargaining chips.

"We were glad they received us," said Virginia Rivero, wife of Giuliani. "But it felt a bit lukewarm. There were things they perhaps didn’t know."

Venezuela's interim authorities have begun releasing political prisoners and other detainees, though many still remain behind bars amid ongoing political tension.

The wave of releases comes as Caracas seeks to ease domestic pressure and signal a possible thaw with Washington following heightened U.S.–Venezuela confrontations.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 20:28:33 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LNCHSESDOZMZDLMHGFBS4NWWSE.jpg?auth=126d388efe7dc5207cb752357c66ef86c19d8b8232fb0b76802ace4ea48b0e91&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ivory Coast president appoints brother as vice prime minister</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/ivory-coast-president-appoints-brother-vice-prime-minister-2026-01-23/</link><description>ABIDJAN, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Ivory Coast President Alassane Ouattara reshuffled his cabinet on Friday, maintaining most senior ministers while appointing his brother, Defence Minister Tene Birahima Ouattara, to the newly created role of vice prime minister, which he will hold alongside his defence portfolio.

The move elevates the younger Ouattara within the government hierarchy, while most key portfolios remained unchanged, signaling continuity rather than a comprehensive overhaul.

The reshuffle follows Ouattara's re-election in October and his party's victory in December's legislative elections, securing a parliamentary majority .

Ouattara, 84, a former deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund, has led the country since 2011 and has said that he intends to prepare the ground for a new generation of political leaders during his tenure.

The changes come as Ivory Coast, the world's largest cocoa producer, seeks to build on nearly 15 years of sustained economic growth that has made it among the region's fastest-growing economies.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 20:30:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/F4RBG4PNFJPN7MDATI4DA6FQUI.jpg?auth=25082a7213b26e6de336d61907fce8172e89a213b11b7e91ad5c82b20f841b58&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Turkey says Syria ceasefire should hold during Islamic State prisoner transfers to Iraq</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/turkey-says-syria-ceasefire-should-hold-during-islamic-state-prisoner-transfers-2026-01-23/</link><description>ANKARA, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Turkey's foreign minister said the current ceasefire in Syria should remain in place while Islamic State prisoners are transferred to Iraq, saying this would limit security risks.

French couple Jacques and Jessica Moretti's bar, Le Constellation, in the ski resort of Crans-Montana, caught fire early on January 1 as party-goers celebrated.

Forty people, mostly teenagers, were killed in the blaze, and 116 others were injured.

The Morettis are under criminal investigation, facing charges of manslaughter by negligence, bodily harm by negligence and arson by negligence.

Prosecutors believe the fire started when revellers raised champagne bottles with sparklers attached close to sound insulation foam on the ceiling of the bar's basement level.

Investigators are analysing whether the foam met safety standards, and whether the bar's fittings, fire safety equipment and emergency exits were all in order.

Jacques Moretti had been held in custody since January 9, while his wife has remained at liberty, under certain restrictions.

But he was cleared for release on bail of 200,000 Swiss francs ($250,000).

Jean-Luc Addor, a lawyer for the relatives of a teenager killed in the tragedy, said it was "a scandal and a disgrace to the victims and their families".

The Compulsory Measures Court in Wallis canton said in a statement it had duly "lifted the detention in custody" at a hearing on Friday.

Instead, it ordered "standard measures ... designed to counter the risk of flight" – namely a ban on leaving Switzerland , the surrender of identity and residence documents and reporting daily to a police station.

The bail was paid by a close friend, the statement said.

A statement from the Morettis's lawyers said the couple "will continue to respond to all requests from the authorities. Their thoughts remain with the victims of this tragedy".

Lawyers for victims' families were taken aback by the decision.

Christophe De Galembert, representing a bereaved father, said it was an "unexpected and shocking decision".

Romain Jordan, a lawyer for several victims' families, told AFP: "My clients note that, once again, no consideration has been given to the risk of collusion and the disappearance of evidence – a risk that greatly concerns them and compromises the integrity of the investigation."

Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani called it a "real affront" to the victims' families. Six Italians were among those killed.

"We will strengthen our support and solidarity with the parents of the victims of this extraordinary tragedy. We will continue to work together to ensure that the Swiss authorities ascertain the truth, and responsibility for what happened," he said on X.

The bar's owners were formally questioned for a second time this week, with both facing 10 hours of questioning.

They will face a further round of questioning at a date yet to be fixed, prosecutors said.

Around 70 of the injured were still in hospital in Switzerland and abroad, Swiss authorities and hospitals said.

Patients were sent to specialist burns facilities around Switzerland and in neighbouring France , Germany and Italy , as well as Belgium .

According to sources contacted by AFP between Wednesday and Friday, around 26 people were still in Swiss hospitals this week: 12 in Zurich, 10 in Lausanne, two in Geneva and two in Wallis.

Switzerland's Federal Office for Civil Protection said on Thursday that 44 victims – Swiss and foreign – were still in hospitals abroad.

The picture is constantly changing, with patients moving between hospitals for different stages of their treatment, and some patients being readmitted.

Some are still in intensive care and some remain in a serious condition.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 20:50:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/4a738e4a-f888-11f0-b984-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/ebd425b7f8973e95cf85a4a4875f4438c7e3526c.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UN rights council steps up scrutiny of Iran crackdown as NGO puts death toll past 5,000</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260123-un-rights-council-steps-us-scrutiny-of-iran-after-death-toll-surpasses-5-000</link><description>The UN Human Rights Council decided Friday to deepen its scrutiny of Iran over its crackdown on protests that left thousands dead , including children, amid demands it end its "brutal repression".

The 47-member body voiced alarm about "the unprecedented scale of the violent crackdown on peaceful protests by security forces" in Iran .

With 25 votes in favour, seven opposed and the rest abstaining, it decided to extend and broaden the mandate of independent investigators gathering evidence towards ensuring accountability for rights violations in the country.

"A climate of fear and systematic impunity cannot be tolerated," Iceland 's ambassador Einar Gunnarsson said as he presented the text to the council before the vote. "Victims and survivors deserve truth, justice and accountability."

Stressing the need for "accountability", the adopted text extends the mandate of a special rapporteur on Iran for another year.

It also extended for two years the work of a separate fact-finding mission set up in November 2022, following Iran's crackdown on a wave of protests sparked by the death in custody of a Kurdish-Iranian woman named Mahsa Amini .

The resolution empowers the investigative body to probe "allegations of recent and ongoing serious human rights violations and abuses, and crimes perpetrated in relation to the protests".

The vote came at the end of an urgent session of the rights council, requested by Britain, Germany , Iceland , Moldova and North Macedonia , but harshly criticised by Iran.

In his opening remarks to the council, UN rights chief Volker Turk described how security forces used "live ammunition" against protesters, decrying that "thousands" had been killed, including children.

"I call on the Iranian authorities to reconsider, to pull back, and to end their brutal repression, including summary trials and disproportionate sentences," he said.

"I call for the immediate release of all those arbitrarily detained by the Iranian authorities, and I call for a complete moratorium on the death penalty."

His comments were broadly echoed during the rights council special session.

"There must be accountability for the dire events of the past weeks, and justice must be done for all those who were killed, injured or detained only for exercising their human rights and for voicing legitimate demands," the European Union representative Michele Cervone d'Urso told the gathering.

Iranian ambassador Ali Bahreini however slammed Friday's meeting as "posturing" and "a pressure tool against Iran". His colleague Somayeh Karimdoost described the resolution as "a thoroughly unbalanced biased and politically motivated text".

Watch more Iran's regime cannot 'hold its power just through terror', activist says

A number of countries also came to Iran's defence, accusing the council of being "politicised" and showing "double standards".

Cuban ambassador Rodolfo Benitez slammed the session as an "act of supreme cynicism", while China 's ambassador Jia Guide said Beijing "opposed interference in other countries' internal affairs on the pretext of human rights".

Turk's office and NGOs tracking the toll from the crackdown on the biggest protests in Iran in years have said their task has been impeded by a now two-week internet shutdown.

Giving their first official toll from the protests, Iranian authorities on Wednesday said 3,117 people had been killed since the massive demonstrations erupted late December.

But the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency on Friday put the number of deaths at more than 5,000, warning the confirmed figures were likely to be far lower than the actual toll.

Another NGO, Norway-based Iran Human Rights, has warned the final toll risks reaching the scale of 25,000.

The protests have now largely halted, but while "the killing in the streets of Iran may have subsided ... the brutality continues", Turk warned.

"I am deeply concerned by contradictory statements from the Iranian authorities about whether those detained in connection with the protests may be executed," Turk said.

He pointed out that Iran "remains among the top executioner states in the world", with at least 1,500 people reportedly executed there last year.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 21:25:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/c784292e-f885-11f0-9194-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/15b75a3b5557ca5042c8ae1658c6b52d53f3adf1.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>South Korea Prime Minister Kim holds talks with US VP Vance in Washington, Yonhap says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/south-korea-prime-minister-kim-holds-talks-with-us-vp-vance-washington-yonhap-2026-01-23/</link><description>SEOUL, Jan 24 (Reuters) - South Korean Prime Minister Kim Min-seok, who is visiting the United States, held talks with U.S. Vice President JD Vance in Washington, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported on Saturday.

The US initially drafted a plan to end the conflict that was heavily criticised in Kyiv and western Europe for being too close to Russia's line, while later proposals were criticised by Moscow for floating the idea of European peacekeepers.

Ahead of Friday's talks, which are set to continue on Saturday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said territory remained the key issue – with Moscow having said it is not dropping its demand that Kyiv pull out of its eastern Donbas region.

After the first day of talks, Ukraine's chief negotiator Rustem Umerov posted on social media that the meeting had focused "on the parameters for ending Russia's war and the further logic of the negotiation process", adding that meetings were scheduled for Saturday.

The UAE foreign ministry said in an earlier statement the talks were scheduled to last two days and were "part of ongoing efforts to promote dialogue and identify political solutions to the crisis".

Trump met Zelensky at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday and US envoy Steve Witkoff later held talks with Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin .

The Emirates meeting took place as thousands of people in Kyiv were without heating in sub-zero temperatures due to Russian strikes.

The European Union , which has sent hundreds of generators, accused Moscow of "deliberately depriving civilians of heat".

Kyiv said Russian strikes had killed three people on Friday in the Kharkiv region and four people – including a father and his five-year-old son – overnight in the east.

While diplomacy to end Europe's worst conflict since World War II has gained pace, Moscow and Kyiv appear deadlocked over the issue of territory.

Hours after Putin met Witkoff – and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner – in Moscow, the Kremlin said its maximalist demand that Kyiv withdraw from the eastern Donbas region still stood.

"Russia's position is well known on the fact that Ukraine, Ukrainian armed forces, have to leave the territory of the Donbas," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.

"This is a very important condition," he added.

Kyiv , which still controls around 20 percent of the eastern region, has rejected such terms.

Both sides say the fate of territory in Ukraine's east is one of the main outstanding issues in the search for a settlement to a war that has killed tens of thousands, displaced millions and decimated eastern Ukraine.

"The Donbas is a key issue," Zelensky – who said he and Trump had agreed on post-war security guarantees in Davos – told reporters on Friday, ahead of the talks.

Later in a post online, he added: "It is necessary that not only Ukraine has the desire to end the war and achieve full security, but that a similar desire somehow emerges in Russia as well."

Russian and Ukrainian negotiators are last known to have met face-to-face in Istanbul last summer, in talks that ended only in deals to exchange captured soldiers.

The Abu Dhabi meeting is the first time they have faced each other to talk about the Trump administration's plan.

Putin has repeatedly said Moscow intends to get full control of eastern Ukraine by force if talks fail.

After the Russia-US talks in the Kremlin, Putin aide Yuri Ushakov insisted Moscow was "genuinely interested in resolving" the war diplomatically.

But he added: "Until that happens, Russia will continue to achieve its objectives ... on the battlefield."

Trump has in the past pressured Ukraine to agree to terms that Kyiv sees as capitulation.

Trump repeated on Wednesday his belief that Putin and Zelensky were close to a deal.

"I believe they're at a point now where they can come together and get a deal done. And if they don't, they're stupid – that goes for both of them," he said.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 22:21:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/1c46c954-f894-11f0-a316-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-23T193143Z-913083105-RC217JA1H0DX-RTRMADP-3-UKRAINE-CRISIS-RUSSIA-EMIRATES-TALKS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US military says it struck vessel in eastern Pacific, killing two</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us-military-says-it-struck-vessel-eastern-pacific-killing-two-2026-01-23/</link><description>Jan 23 (Reuters) - The U.S. Southern Command said on Friday it carried out a strike on a vessel in the eastern Pacific, killing two people.

Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said the two injured in the capital were in serious condition and being treated in hospital. He said there had been strikes in two districts on either side of the Dnipro River bisecting the capital.

"Kyiv is under a massive enemy attack," Klitschko wrote on the Telegram messaging app.

Ukraine's air force said both drones and missiles had been deployed in the assault on the capital.

Tymur Tkachenko, head of Kyiv's military administration, reported drone strikes in at least three districts, sparking fires in at least two locations.

Kyiv has endured two mass overnight attacks since the New Year, knocking out power and heating to hundreds of residential buildings. Emergency workers were still engaged in restoring services to residents, with overnight temperatures dipping to -13 Celsius (9 Fahrenheit).

In Kharkiv, a frequent Russian target 30 km (18 miles) from the border, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said Russian drones had attacked several districts, injuring 11 people.

Writing on Telegram, he said drones had struck a dormitory for displaced people, a hospital and a maternity hospital.

The latest attacks occurred after negotiators from Ukraine, Russia and the United States completed the first of two days of talks in the United Arab Emirates devoted to working towards a resolution of the nearly four-year-old war.</description><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 01:44:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KET2DBDIQJJN5DH6PJAESZQSWY.jpg?auth=c62ad3ad450dd18f437b5e93885c35c13362432d5910d1d44304dd1a3f1ea8f1&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran will treat any attack as 'all-out war against us,' says senior Iran official</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-will-treat-any-attack-all-out-war-against-us-says-senior-iran-official-2026-01-24/</link><description>Jan 23 (Reuters) - Iran will treat any attack "as an all-out war against us," a senior Iranian official said on Friday, ahead of the arrival of a U.S. military aircraft carrier strike group and other assets in the Middle East in the coming days.

"This military buildup - we hope it is not intended for real confrontation - but our military is ready for the worst-case scenario. This is why everything is on high alert in Iran," said the senior Iranian official, speaking on condition of anonymity.

"This time we will treat any attack - limited, unlimited, surgical, kinetic, whatever they call it - as an all-out war against us, and we will respond in the hardest way possible to settle this," the official said.

U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday that the United States had an " armada " heading toward Iran but hoped he would not have to use it, as he renewed warnings to Tehran against killing protesters or restarting its nuclear program.

"If the Americans violate Iran's sovereignty and territorial integrity, we will respond," said the Iranian official. He declined to specify what an Iranian response might look like.

"A country under constant military threat from the United States has no option but to ensure that everything at its disposal can be used to push back and, if possible, restore balance against anyone who dares to attack Iran," the official said.

The U.S. military has in the past periodically sent increased forces to the Middle East at times of heightened tensions, moves that were often defensive. However, the U.S. military staged a major buildup last year ahead of its June strikes against Iran's nuclear program.</description><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 01:44:31 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/RU7CKG57WVIMRL55GBOTJ333DI.jpg?auth=b35a3109e9443f0a7e5c5f515bdbe253ea6d8e4a233f9f1fc1f76255b0ac799a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Safety fears hamper New Zealand rescue work after landslide</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/safety-fears-hamper-new-zealand-rescue-work-after-landslide-2026-01-24/</link><description>SYDNEY, Jan 24 (Reuters) - New Zealand rescuers seeking six missing people after a landslide hit a busy campground on the country's North Island were hampered overnight due to a partial landslide in the search area, authorities said on Saturday.

Two teenagers are among those missing after heavy rains triggered Thursday's landslide at Mount Maunganui on the island's east coast, bringing down soil and rubble at the site in the city of Tauranga, crowded with families on summer holidays. No deaths resulting from the natural disaster have been reported.

Fire and Emergency New Zealand said on Saturday that 35 rescue workers, assisted by heavy machinery, were removing debris at the site after a partial slip in a section of the search area around 6 p.m. local time on Friday.

"Personnel have not searched that area since for their safety, but it is being continuously reassessed," fire and emergency official Megan Stiffler said in a statement.

Heavy rain forecast in the area on Saturday could present further challenges for rescuers, including having "to withdraw from the slip area for their safety", she said.

The authorities on Friday said rescue efforts could take several days due to the scale of the landslide and risks at the site.

No signs of life have been detected from the rubble since voices initially heard by first responders on Thursday, police have said. The youngest of the missing is aged 15.

Prime Minister Christopher Luxon visited the site on Friday and met affected families. "They are grieving incredibly hard, and I know that New Zealand grieves with them," he said.

The heavy rain this week unleashed another landslide in the neighbouring suburb of Papamoa, killing two.</description><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 01:44:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/PXU2ZMI7RNPRHJXOZAIFQNMP3Q.jpg?auth=985deb2fa1ba15aa8715d1dbbdc433d8ee285f16f3c7002bd45e72aa5b5c1a8f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump says US VP headed to Azerbaijan, Armenia next month</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-says-us-vp-headed-azerbaijan-armenia-next-month-2026-01-24/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 23 (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President JD Vance will travel to Azerbaijan and Armenia next month, President Donald Trump said on Friday, months after the two countries signed a peace agreement in Washington.

Trump said Vance will travel to the countries to "advance the Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity," a peace agreement he struck between the two countries in August.

"We will strengthen our strategic partnership with Azerbaijan, a beautiful Agreement for Peaceful Nuclear Cooperation with Armenia, Deals for our Great Semiconductor Makers, and the sale of Made in the U.S.A. Defense Equipment, such as body armor and boats, and more, to Azerbaijan," he wrote on social media platform Truth Social.

The August deal followed nearly four decades of war between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the mountainous region of Nagorno-Karabakh.

Under the agreement , the countries relinquished all claims to each other's territory and are required to refrain from using force against one another and pledge to respect international law.

Trump on Friday thanked the leaders of the two countries for upholding the agreement, saying there was now "Prosperity and Peace."

Earlier this week, Armenia announced it will integrate its energy systems with Azerbaijan to facilitate the import and export of electricity as part of a U.S.-backed project.</description><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 01:44:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/GQIKDJK6RZJTDDLUOU7KOJ4QUE.jpg?auth=73532debc15c36fbbbeeb0d79153adb0f32128ee84516767af0262ac99a800af&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US to host meeting of Western Hemisphere defense chiefs Feb 11</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us-host-meeting-western-hemisphere-defense-chiefs-feb-11-2026-01-24/</link><description>Jan 23 (Reuters) - Top defense officials from 34 countries will meet in February to discuss common security priorities in the Western Hemisphere, the U.S. military said on Friday, just weeks after it deposed Venezuela's leader.

The climb, organised by Netflix (NFLX.O) , opens new tab for live broadcast, has been rescheduled for Sunday morning in Taipei, the streamer said on its X account.

"Safety remains our top priority, and we appreciate your understanding," it added.

The top of Taipei 101 was obscured by cloud on Saturday morning, with intermittent rain showers.

The 508 metre (1,667 feet) Taipei 101, which dominates the city's skyline and is a major tourist attraction, was the tallest building in the world from 2004 to 2010, a crown currently held by the Burj Khalifa in Dubai.

Taipei 101 has been scaled before.

In 2004, French climber Alain Robert, dubbed "Spiderman" for his ropeless ascents of some of the world's highest skyscrapers, climbed the building, in a time of four hours with a safety rope.</description><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 03:27:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/XHIWAO5BHZKI3DJQIYPJ6ICRXE.jpg?auth=77b5037b9907b608a42ada2c23ae6907446dd9831836e40824cb519e6404dff0&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Chinese lantern festival lights up for Lunar New Year</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinese-lantern-festival-lights-up-lunar-new-year-2026-01-24/</link><description>ZIGONG, China, Jan 24 (Reuters) - In southwest China’s Sichuan province, the annual Zigong International Lantern Festival kicked off on Friday, showcasing the centuries-old art of illuminated lanterns on a grand scale.

This year’s Lunar New Year falls on February 17, marking the start of the Year of the Horse in the Chinese zodiac. Lanterns are a traditional feature of Lunar New Year celebrations in China, symbolising good fortune and guidance.

On opening night, crowds gathered to view more than 200 handmade lanterns depicting animals, mythological figures and scenes from ancient China.

“When I was a child, my parents took me to the Zigong Lantern Festival almost every year,” said Huang Ye, 32. “For us Zigong natives, the lantern festival is simply part and parcel of our Lunar New Year celebrations. Now, I bring my child to see the lanterns.”

Organisers said it took about 1,200 workers several weeks to produce the lanterns, some of which stretch for hundreds of metres.

One 210-metre-long display, titled “Magical China,” was inspired by an ancient legend and featured a giant mythical bird-fish hybrid known as Kunpeng.

Another, themed on the “Legend of Mulan” and extending for 180 m (591 feet), depicted the story of the female warrior and included a herd of galloping horses, a reference to this year’s zodiac animal.

Lanterns at the festival were made using a variety of materials, including straw, chillies and recycled medicine bottles.</description><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 03:27:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HZVHA53SONIMDHWHUGPBU5XXBY.jpg?auth=0b10f2fd2ba3ec274836f081be444269f6ccf343c7dd7ac4387f609864acefe4&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Players, fans brace for extreme heat at Australian Open</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/players-fans-brace-extreme-heat-australian-open-2026-01-24/</link><description>MELBOURNE, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Players sweated under a blazing sun and fans lathered themselves with sunscreen at the Australian Open on Saturday as temperatures rose toward an expected 40 degrees Celsius (104 F) at Melbourne Park.

Play started an hour earlier to take advantage of the relative cool of the morning but conditions were already stifling as women's defending champion Madison Keys entered centre court for her third-round match at 10:30 a.m. (2330 GMT).

Used to hot conditions in Florida, the American needed only 75 minutes to complete a straightforward 6-3 6-3 win over unseeded Czech Karolina Pliskova.

"I was excited by the heat," she said on court after booking a fourth-round matchup with fellow American and friend Jessica Pegula, the sixth seed.

Pegula wrapped up her early match at Margaret Court Arena even quicker than Keys, taking down Russian Oksana Selekhmeteva 6-3 6-2.

"I didn't have to kind of kill myself today," said Pegula, also based in Florida.

"Luckily today everything worked out pretty well."

Amanda Anisimova, who also lives in Florida, beat compatriot Peyton Stearns 6-1 6-4 and the U.S. Open runner-up made sure the contest was wrapped up quickly, claiming victory in just 71 minutes.

"Just the fact that we had so many outdoor courts in the summer, it was always so hot, I hated training in the summer," Anisimova said.

"But you know what? At least it paid off a little bit. It's just great to be playing out here even when it's so hot, it's nice to have a challenge."

The Australian Open operates under an extreme heat policy that considers air temperature, radiant heat, wind speed and humidity to assess playing conditions, allowing officials to delay or suspend matches when thresholds are exceeded.

The tournament's five-point Heat Stress Scale was at 3.4 in the early afternoon when men's defending champion Jannik Sinner was playing American Eliot Spizzirri in the second match at Rod Laver Arena.

When it reaches four points, players can take longer breaks between sets. Five points means the suspension of matches on outside courts and closing the roofs of the main showcourts.

Organisers warned fans to bring hats, drink plenty of water and make use of misting fans scattered around Melbourne Park.

Sydney resident Sarah Gellatly covered herself in sunscreen from one of the dispensers just outside the Melbourne Park gates.

She said players would be concerned about battling each other during the hottest part of the day.

"It's really hot but if you're a player that's touring around the world every day, then they're used to the heat," she told Reuters.

Melbourne resident Mat Vonarx and his partner had the cheap "ground pass" tickets which give access to the outside courts and said they were ready to handle whatever the weather threw at them.

"We knew it was going to be very hot today but it's the tennis," Vonarx told Reuters on his first visit to the Grand Slam. "We're ready for it, we've brought plenty of water and we're good to go."

Vonarx said the players would just have to tough it out.

"It's going to be tough for any sport in this condition but they're professionals, they're going to do what they need to do to complete the game," he said.</description><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 03:27:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/EAR3UGBNIRLJNAN2TONJONZQ3Q.jpg?auth=3684229dc5b9b17bf8d9cacc53b5942e99acb17bc350719e658e8d3e2b82ed6a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Journalist Hunter S. Thompson took own life, Colorado investigators affirm</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/journalist-hunter-s-thompson-took-own-life-colorado-investigators-affirm-2026-01-24/</link><description>Jan 23 (Reuters) - A comprehensive case review into the 2005 death of author-journalist Hunter S. Thompson, including autopsy records, has affirmed authorities' original conclusion that he took his own life, the Colorado Bureau of Investigation said on Friday.

The review, conducted after the writer's widow, Anita Thompson, raised questions about the official suicide ruling, found no "new physical evidence, facts, or circumstances to support a conclusion different from the 2005 investigation," the CBI said.

The reexamination corroborated the original determination of the Pitkin County Sheriff's Office that Thompson died from a self-inflicted gunshot to his head at his Owl Creek farm retreat near Aspen in February 2005. He was 67.

In an apparent suicide note written days before his death but published months later by Rolling Stone magazine, his literary springboard, Thompson lamented the onset of old age and physical limitations, then concluded, "Relax -- this won't hurt." The note, scrawled in black marker, was titled, "Football Season is Over."

Friends and family had said at the time that Thompson, whose "gonzo" style of journalism eschewed any pretense of objectivity and established the hard-living writer as a counter-culture icon, had been in pain from a hip-replacement, back surgery and a recently broken leg.

Those close to him also had said that Thompson, a longtime gun enthusiast, had contemplated taking his own life for years.

But Anita Thompson, now 54, contacted Pitkin County Sheriff Michael Buglione with "new concerns and potential information" related to the original investigation into her husband's death, prompting the sheriff to request reopening the case in July 2025, the CBI said in a statement announcing its findings.

"While we have always believed the original investigation was conducted properly, we recognized the importance of an independent review for the Thompson family," Buglione wrote in the statement. "CBI's conclusions reaffirm the original findings and, we hope, provide reassurance and clarity."

Most of the original physical evidence and photographs from the 2005 probe have been disposed of, according to the CBI.

But state investigators reviewed autopsy and other law enforcement records from the case, re-examined the scene, and interviewed a number of people, including Anita Thompson, her late husband's son, Juan Thompson, and his ex-daughter-in-law, Jennifer Thompson. The original lead detective and the county coroner also were interviewed.

"The modern trajectory analysis and scene reconstruction conducted in 2025 - which was based on the intact bullet defect - was consistent with the original PCSO investigation, the autopsy report and the observations of original investigators," the CBI said.

In a statement carried by other news media outlets, Anita Thompson said she was grateful to the CBI for its "thorough" review, adding, "This allows all of us who loved Hunter to move forward with a clean conscience."

Hunter Thompson was best known for his book "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas," adapted from a two-part article written for Rolling Stone in late 1971, chronicling his drug-fueled misadventures in Nevada while ostensibly covering a motorcycle race in the desert.

The book became the basis for a 1998 Hollywood adaptation, starring Johnny Depp as Thompson's alter-ego, Raoul Duke. The writer was also caricatured as Uncle Duke in the comic strip "Doonesbury," right down to his signature aviator glasses and cigarette holder.

The New York Times reported earlier this month that his widow went to authorities with suspicions about her husband's demise after hearing of rumors from a relative that his death had been staged to appear as a suicide.</description><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 04:13:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Seven dead, 82 missing in Indonesian landslide, disaster agency says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/seven-dead-82-missing-indonesia-landslide-agency-says-2026-01-24/</link><description>JAKARTA, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Seven people have died and 82 are missing after a landslide hit in Indonesia's West Java province, Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency said on Saturday, amid reports of heavy rain in the area.

"The number of missing persons is high, we will try to optimise our search and rescue efforts today," Abdul Muhari, the agency spokesperson, told Reuters.

Nico Antic, 12, was attacked on Sunday as he and friends were jumping off rocks in Vaucluse, around 9 km (5.5 miles) from Sydney's central business district. He was pulled from the water by friends and taken to hospital with severe injuries to both legs.

"We are heartbroken to share that our son, Nico, has passed away," the family said in a statement. "Nico was a happy, friendly, and sporty young boy with the most kind and generous spirit. He was always full of life and that’s how we'll remember him."

Dozens of beaches, including in Sydney, were closed this week after four shark attacks in two days, as heavy rains left waters murky and more likely to attract the animals.

In September, a surfer was killed by a large shark at Sydney's Long Reef beach.

Australia averages 20 shark attacks a year, fewer than three of them fatal, according to data from conservation groups. Those numbers are dwarfed by drownings on the country's beaches.</description><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 05:23:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/NVN62P3KVVPKVF36KNL2XEJTAA.jpg?auth=128b3f7e2e8ce21f450b956174b7c76ff1e4d1482329171240afe82ad5e9535c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US judge extends deportation protections for migrants from Myanmar</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/us-judge-extends-deportation-protections-migrants-myanmar-2026-01-24/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 23 (Reuters) - A federal judge ordered , opens new tab President Donald Trump's administration on Friday to delay its termination of the "Temporary Protected Status," or TPS, for Myanmar while a lawsuit challenging the termination continued.

The order by U.S. District Judge Matthew Kennelly in Chicago blocks the Trump administration from ending deportation protections for about 4,000 Myanmar nationals living in the U.S.

The judge said that U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's decision to end Temporary Protected Status for immigrants from Myanmar lacked a genuine basis. Kennelly postponed the effective date of the government's action, which was to be Monday, and scheduled a February 6 hearing in the case.

The Trump administration had no immediate reaction to the order.

The Trump administration said in November it was ending temporary legal status for citizens of Myanmar in the U.S., arguing they could safely return to the war-torn Southeast Asian country while citing the military junta's elections as evidence of an improving situation.

The United Nations, many Western countries and human rights groups have called the ongoing election a sham. The U.S. State Department's most recent human rights report said there were "significant human rights issues" in Myanmar.

The Trump administration's move had sparked concern for individuals who might be forced to return to Myanmar, which has been in political turmoil since the military seized power in a 2021 coup, ousting a civilian government and sparking a nationwide armed resistance.

"The Court cannot discern a genuine basis for the Secretary's action in the record and finds it more likely that the decision to terminate TPS was not actually rooted in the reasons cited in the notice," the judge wrote.

"It is more plausible that TPS was terminated to effectuate the Secretary's broader goal of curtailing immigration and eliminating TPS generally, not on her evaluation of changed conditions in Burma," the judge added.

"The termination of TPS for Burma appears to have occurred without a review of conditions in that country, much like the administration's termination of other TPS designations."

Trump has pursued a hardline immigration policy since taking office in 2025, including an aggressive deportation drive that has been widely condemned by human rights advocates. Trump has cited domestic security reasons for his actions.

A series of lawsuits have challenged his administration's efforts to curtail protections from deportation extended to citizens of numerous countries through grants of TPS.

Under federal law, TPS is available to people whose home countries have experienced natural disasters, armed conflicts or other extraordinary events. It provides eligible migrants with work authorization and temporary protection from deportation.

Court rulings have at times slowed or halted the Trump administration's efforts to strip migrants of their legal status.</description><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 05:23:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/MKHQFHJG5NKMJC4I55DZLLUWCY.jpg?auth=b57b1505c6f07e873108ee87992438da8e1460aa322db65ffe312de60649ea74&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Karachi mall inferno came after ignored warnings, delayed response</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/karachi-mall-inferno-came-after-ignored-warnings-delayed-response-2026-01-24/</link><description>KARACHI, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Muhammad Imran did not take the fire seriously at first, thinking it was another small spark at the Karachi mall that would be quickly extinguished by fellow shop owners.

But smoke seeped through ducts and blackened the air in seconds. The lights went out soon after and phone flashlights turned useless, people could no longer see their own hands, he said.

Imran, who has diabetes and has undergone heart surgery, managed only a few steps before nearly giving up. "It felt like doomsday," he said. "You couldn't see the person next to you."

The blaze would rage for nearly two days and reduce Gul Plaza, a multi-storey complex of 1,200 family-run shops selling children's clothes, toys, crockery and household goods, to ash.

At least 67 people were killed, with 15 still missing and feared dead, police official Asad Ali Raza said, in the January 17 blaze, the Pakistani port city's largest in over a decade.

Imran's escape from the inferno, along with more than a dozen others who spoke to Reuters, was hampered by locked doors, poor ventilation, and crowded corridors. When they eventually got out, the survivors watched Gul Plaza crumble as rescue efforts faced delays and poor resources.

Police said the fire appeared to have started at an artificial flower shop and may have been caused by children playing with matches. They added that all but three of the 16 exits were locked , which was routine practice after 10 p.m.

Documents reviewed by Reuters showed Gul Plaza, located on a major artery in Karachi's historic city centre and built in the early 1980s, had violated building regulatory standards for over a decade, with authorities warning the situation was dire in the last review two years ago.

Gul Plaza's management did not respond to repeated requests for comment.

Records from the provincial Sindh Building Control Authority showed court cases filed over Gul Plaza's lack of safety compliance in 1992, 2015 and 2021, as well as records of unauthorised construction.

The files reviewed by Reuters do not detail the outcomes of those cases, including whether fines were imposed or whether violations were fully remedied. SBCA did not respond to queries on enforcement action taken.

A Nov. 27, 2023, survey by the fire department, 
 covering more than 40 commercial buildings in the area, cited inadequate firefighting equipment, blocked escape routes, faulty alarms, poor emergency lighting and a lack of fire safety training for occupants and staff.

A follow-up audit by the fire department in January 2024 placed Gul Plaza among buildings that failed to meet regulations, with inspectors marking key safety categories, including access to firefighting equipment, alarm systems and electrical wiring conditions, as "unsatisfactory".

Separately, documents describing inspections by Karachi’s Urban Search and Rescue teams in late 2023 and early 2024 that were reviewed by Reuters also showed Gul Plaza was among several markets and commercial buildings flagged for deficiencies in one or more fire safety categories.

"Young boys were crying. People were panicking," Imran said, when they were confronted by locked exits.

Others smashed doors and locks as they moved through the darkness, holding hands and forming human chains to avoid getting lost.

With no way down, they ran to the roof, where 70 people, including families and children, were trapped for nearly an hour, survivors said. The smoke was even worse there, funnelled upward by the building's design, making it impossible to see even the neighbouring buildings.

Then the wind changed.

A sudden gust pushed the smoke aside, revealing Rimpa Plaza next door. Young men crossed first, found a broken ladder and began ferrying people across one by one.

"I was the last to leave. I wanted to make sure everyone was safe," Imran said. An ambulance from the Edhi Foundation charity was waiting on the other side.

Many survivors said the response by the fire brigade was delayed and inadequate. Imran and other shop owners said they had escaped from the building and watched Gul Plaza turn into a molten inferno as the first firefighters arrived.

The first emergency call came at 10:26 p.m. from a teenager, with two fire vehicles reaching the site within 10 minutes and classifying the blaze as a Grade 3 fire, "the highest category for an urban area", said a provincial government spokesperson Sukhdev Assardas Hemnani.

A citywide emergency was declared by 10:45 p.m., triggering the mobilisation of resources from across Karachi, he said.

Shopkeepers said the first engine soon ran out of water and left to refill but Hemnani said those allegations were inaccurate.

Firefighters used "water, foam, chemicals and sand", he said, adding the blaze was difficult to control because the building contained more than 50 gas cylinders and flammable material such as perfumes, generator fuel and car batteries.

Many of the shops were stocked to the brim because of the holy month of Ramadan in February-March, Pakistan's biggest shopping season.

The first fire truck was not delayed, Hemnani said, but later arrivals were slowed by heavy traffic on a busy Saturday night and a crowd of over 3,000 people that had gathered outside the mall.

The fire department did not respond to requests for comment.

Survivors said many of the missing were shop employees and traders who tried to help others escape — or went back inside looking for family members.

Abdul Ghaffar, a toy store employee who had worked in Gul Plaza for two decades, said one of his cousins was among those still unaccounted for after helping others flee.

His cousin's mobile phone voice message, in which he can be heard apologising to his family, was circulated widely on social media.

"He was helping people escape," Ghaffar said. "That's how he died." Three other relatives remain missing, he said, with the family still waiting for identification through DNA testing.

The internet and communication blackouts that accompanied the regime’s recent crackdown on protests have left him reliant on messages providing the barest, essential facts.

"To be honest, I couldn't talk to all of them," explained the 37-year-old, who now lives in France. "I am not aware of the situation of all of them, but I just heard that we are safe. We are still alive."

The situation this time in Alavi’s hometown of Saqqez in Iran’s Kurdistan province appeared to be a lot calmer than during the previous wave of anti-regime protests. Saqqez is also the hometown of Jina Mahsa Amini , whose death in police custody in September 2022 sparked the "Women, Life, Freedom" movement.

Alavi, like many townspeople, attended the young Kurdish woman’s funeral in Saqqez and joined the first protest that sparked a nationwide opposition movement. Months later, the high-school English teacher in a local school was forced to flee after spending two weeks in prison for participating in the protests that put Saqqez in the international spotlight.

The situation this time in his hometown was different, Alavi explained.

"The protests were very limited in some of the Kurdish areas this time," he said. “Maybe they were afraid of the huge suppression, which we see is happening in other cities."

While the 2022-2023 protests spread from the Kurdish periphery to the centre, the latest demonstrations erupted in the country’s commercial beating heart: Tehran’s Grand Bazaar, where merchants on December 28 voiced their frustration over the currency crisis , igniting another nationwide flame of discontent.

The contrast between the birthplaces of the "Women, Life, Freedom" movement and the latest protests could not be starker. Saqqez, a highland town in the Zagros Mountains straddling the borders of Iran, Iraq and Turkey, is more than 600 kilometres and a world away from the Grand Bazaar, the symbolic seat of the bazaaris , a socially conservative class of merchants who have been loyal to the Islamic Republic for nearly half-a-century.

Iran’s Kurds , in contrast, have historically opposed the theocratic rulers in Tehran and have borne the brunt of brutal regime crackdowns since the 1979 Islamic Revolution .

If the residents of Saqqez and the surrounding areas did not take to the streets en masse this time because they feared a repeat of the repression they experienced after the 2023 protests, they were unfortunately proved right.

In its latest crackdown, Iranian security forces, for the first time, used automatic or semi-automatic machine guns on crowds in the heart of Tehran, according to Amnesty International . Such lethal, military grade arms were previously used in the Kurdish provinces during the crackdown following Amini’s death , the London-based human rights group revealed at a press conference on Thursday.

The scorched-earth levels of bloodshed and brutality once confined to the ethnic margins have reached the nation’s centre. That does not bode well for stability inside Iran, the region, and for the country’s majority and minority groups.

A vast country of around 92 million people, Iran shares land borders with seven countries and is home to an ethnically diverse population with some communities sharing kinship ties across national frontiers.

Ethnic Persians, making up around 50 percent of the population, are the majority and are based predominantly in the central region. The country is also home to Azerbaijanis, the largest minority group estimated at between 16 to 24 percent, followed by Kurds (between 10 to 16 percent) and a mosaic of smaller ethnic groups such as the Lurs, Arabs, Baluch and other Turkic groups.

Spread across the borders of Iran, Iraq, Syria and Turkey, the Kurds have a long, painful history of discrimination and suppression campaigns by regimes based in power centres far from their regions.

In Iran, Kurdish groups oppressed by the former shah were initially hopeful when the Islamic Revolution ousted the Pahlavi dynasty, but their hopes were quickly dashed once the Shiite regime took power. Since a 1979 rebellion in the northwest was brutally crushed, Kurdish parties with different acronyms and ideologies, most calling for federalism, a few with armed wings, have opposed the regime in Tehran.

For more than four decades, the state pursued a “what happens in the northwest stays in the northwest” position, with state and semi-official Persian language media informing audiences that security forces were battling “terrorists” and “separatists” in the Kurdish badlands.

That was until this month, notes Shukriya Bradost, a Middle East security expert who has studied the history of Iran’s Kurds.

In its latest crackdown on protesters across the country, the regime "used the same military weapons in Tehran and sadly, other central, Persian-majority provinces that they use every time in the Kurdish regions", she said. "After 47 years, the Persian cities feel the pain of the Kurdish regions."

The toll from the latest crackdown has been staggering. On Thursday, the Iranian state finally released official figures, putting the death toll at 3,117, including 2,427 "martyrs" defined as security force members or innocent bystanders. The remaining 690 dead were described as "rioters" backed by the US.

Human rights groups have put the figure far higher . Norway-based NGO Iran Human Rights says it has verified the deaths of more than 3,400 protesters and warned the true figure could be "between 5,000 and 20,000".

The public anti-regime demonstrations in many Kurdish areas this year did not draw the kind of crowds that took to the streets in the "Women, Life, Freedom" rallies. But the region did see a number of smaller protests, which were brutally suppressed.

Protests in the Kurdish-majority western province of Kermanshah in the first week of January faced harsh repression, with human rights groups such as Amnesty International verifying videos of security officials arresting protesters amid loud gunshots while the injured and dead lay on the streets. "Kermanshah feels like a war zone," said one wounded protester. "It’s a field of bullets."

In Malekshahi, a county in Ilam, another Kurdish-majority province, security forces fired live ammunition into a crowd of unarmed protesters and then stormed a hospital, "seeking to remove the bodies of those killed and forcibly take injured protesters out of the hospital", reported Hengaw , a Norway-based Kurdish human rights group.

Following the protests in Kermanshah and Ilam, seven Kurdish political parties got together to issue a joint call for a general strike on January 8. Other ethnic minority provinces – such as Baluchestan in the southeast near the Pakistan border and the Azerbaijan-majority states in the north – joined the strike call.

"More than 50 cities and towns joined the strike,"  Bradost said. "That was a huge success for the Kurdish parties, to show how much influence they have and how easily and effectively they can mobilise people."

By channelising the public anger in a strike call, the Kurdish parties not only helped kept their people off streets that had turned into killing fields. They also acknowledged the economic grievances of the bazaaris and all Iranian citizens by targeting the regime where it hurt most.

Iran’s ethnic minorities tend to be cohesive and have leadership structures, such as leftist parties and civil society institutions among the Kurds, and religious and community elders among the Baluchis. The Kurds, in particular, can play an important role in bringing political change, Bradost maintains.

"If there needs to be a powerful, mobilised force against the Iranian regime, these forces are Kurdish forces and the Kurdish regions," she said. "The Iranian opposition can use this as an opportunity to unite behind the Kurdish region, because these regions are the most mobilised region in the country."

One of the major problems confronting the Iranian opposition is the absence of a legitimate, or charismatic, leader who can unite disparate groups.

Reza Pahlavi , the US-based son of the deposed shah, has emerged as a potential leader, with the overseas Persian-language channels positioning the 65-year-old as an alternative to the Islamist regime. During the recent demonstrations in Iran, several protesters chanted the former crown prince’s name, according to witness accounts. But there were also chants of "No shah, no mullahs" – particularly in Iranian universities.

Pahlavi’s close ties to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is also a divisive issue – particularly after last year’s 12-Day War, which saw Israeli strikes targeting military infrastructure, killing civilians, but failing to bring down the regime, which simply increased its repression for ordinary Iranians.

For many Kurds, whose parents and ancestors suffered brutal discrimination under the Pahlavi monarchs, the California-based, Persian elite crown prince is a hard sell as a leadership figure.

A month after the June 2025 Israel-Iran war , Pahlavi’s team in exile released an "emergency phase" plan. But while the 169-page document featured the term "territorial integrity" several times, there was no mention of "federalism", a critical issue for Iran’s Kurds.

Whether it’s the Islamic regime or an old-new shah, the discourse of the Persian elites at home or abroad sounds dismayingly familiar for many Iranian Kurds.

“They've been brainwashed that all Kurds are separatists,” Bradost said. “When you use the term federalism, it’s viewed as separatism, against your territorial integrity.”

Just days after security forces unleashed a crackdown on protesters, the Iranian military this week targeted an Iranian Kurdish opposition party headquartered in neighbouring Iraq.

The Kurdistan Freedom Party (PAK) on Wednesday said the Iranian regime targeted one of the Kurdistan National Army's headquarters "using missiles and drones”, referring to an armed group that operates under its authority.

“We were prepared for this news, that the regime will attack Kurdish bases in Iraqi Kurdistan. There’s always this scenario,” Bradost said, noting that one of the regime’s main goals was to “distract the attention of protesters to the Kurdish party, to tell Iranians that the Kurds are separatists and that Iranian territorial integrity is in danger”.

A history of mobilisation spanning nearly a century has seen the formation of several Iranian Kurdish parties. In the past, some have fought each other. This was primarily during the 1990s, a brutal period for Kurds in Turkey and Iraq, which had ramifications for Iranian Kurdish parties as Tehran tried to leverage the factional fighting in a bid to maintain control in the Kurdish areas and extend its regional influence.

The oldest Iranian Kurdish party, the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan (KDPI) traces its roots to the 1946 Republic of Mahabad, a short-lived, self-governing Kurdish state in northwestern Iran that has symbolic weight among the Kurds.

While the KDPI seeks Kurdish rights within a federal Iranian state, other parties have armed wings based in the mountainous Kurdish areas of northeastern Iraq. The PAK, which was founded in Iran in 1991, for instance, includes fighters who took part in battles in Iraq against the Islamic State (IS) group .

Another party, the Kurdistan Free Life Party (PJAK), is the Iranian branch of the Turkey-based Kurdistan Workers’ Party ( PKK ), which is considered a terrorist group by Ankara, Washington and Brussels, but whose Syrian arm nonetheless joined the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) forces in the fight against the IS group in Syria.

The Kurds have been called “the world’s largest ethnic group without a state” for more than a century. But the international community has been largely unsuccessful in working with, or putting pressure on, regional capitals to address the root causes of the Kurdish problem across borders.

In Syria, the recent fighting between Kurdish SDF fighters and government forces under Turkey-backed interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa is just the latest example of the international diplomatic failure to negotiate a resolution to the Kurdish issue.

From his new home in France, Alavi sees new players and administrations playing new geopolitical games in the region – and that provides no grounds for optimism.

At a recent Iranian opposition demonstration outside the European Parliament in Strasbourg, Alavi saw some participants wave Israeli flags, which dismayed him.

“There are people who don’t like that, you know,” the mild-mannered former school teacher said.

Many Middle East experts say Israel over the past two years has sought to position itself as a champion of the region’s minorities – such as Syria’s Druze community – to weaken neighbouring states for its own security interests. While many Iranians oppose the Islamic regime’s “axis of resistance” support for the Palestinian cause at the cost of the welfare of their own countrymen, not all support Israel. Pahlavi’s outreach to Netanyahu has split an already divided opposition.

US President Donald Trump’s changing discourse on Iran has added to the unease for many in the Iranian opposition. The president’s initial threats to intervene against Tehran dwindled last week with the protests inside Iran.

As a populace reeling with the killings, shutdowns and surveillance struggled to find and bury their dead, Trump claimed he had stopped executions of prisoners, toning down his intervention rhetoric. On Thursday, he was back on the verbal offensive, telling reporters the US has “an armada ... heading in that direction, and maybe we won't have to use it".

“I can understand that people who are inside the country, who have no hope, who are seeing a huge massacre, are asking Trump to come to help us because they're killing us,” Alavi said.

“But we can see what's happening now is not a good situation. We’re completely stuck between two forces, none of them are very acceptable ... I don't know what to say,” he continued, sounding defeated after anxious weeks of watching the killings from afar and trying to crack the communications blackout to get news about his family.

“The biggest thing is feeling guilty. I see that with almost all my Iranian friends all over the world, we’re all feeling guilty for not being there.”</description><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 06:34:31 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/63efb734-f862-11f0-b8fd-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/main-cap.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US military to prioritise homeland defence, limit support for allies</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260124-us-military-to-prioritise-homeland-defence-limit-support-for-allies</link><description>The US military will prioritize protecting the homeland and deterring China while providing "more limited" support to allies in Europe and elsewhere, a Pentagon strategy document released on Friday said.

The 2026 National Defense Strategy (NDS) marks a significant departure from past Pentagon policy, both in its emphasis on allies taking on increased burdens with less backing from Washington, and its softer tone on traditional foes China and Russia .

"As US forces focus on homeland defense and the Indo-Pacific, our allies and partners elsewhere will take primary responsibility for their own defense with critical but more limited support from American forces," the strategy said.

The previous NDS -- released under President Donald Trump 's predecessor Joe Biden -- described China as Washington's most consequential challenge and said that Russia posed an "acute threat."

The new document however urges "respectful relations" with Beijing -- while making no mention of US ally Taiwan , which China claims as its territory -- and describing the threat from Russia as a "persistent but manageable" one affecting NATO 's eastern members.

Both the Biden and Trump strategies say homeland defense is important, but their descriptions of the threats facing the US differ significantly.

The Trump administration's NDS takes aim at the past administration for neglecting border security, saying this led to a "flood of illegal aliens" and widespread narcotics trafficking.

"Border security is national security," and the Pentagon "will therefore prioritize efforts to seal our borders , repel forms of invasion, and deport illegal aliens," it said.

Biden meanwhile focused on China and Russia, saying they posed "more dangerous challenges to security and safety at home" than even the threat of terrorism .

The 2026 NDS also includes no mention of the dangers of climate change -- which Biden's administration had identified as an "emerging threat."

Like Trump's national security strategy, which was released last month, the NDS elevates Latin America to the top of the US agenda.

The Pentagon "will restore American military dominance in the Western Hemisphere. We will use it to protect our Homeland and our access to key terrain throughout the region," the NDS said.

The document called that the "Trump Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine," a reference to the declaration two centuries ago by the then-young United States that Latin America was off limits to rival powers.

Since returning to office last year, Trump has repeatedly employed the US military in Latin America, ordering a shocking raid that captured Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro and his wife, as well as strikes on more than 30 alleged drug-smuggling boats that have killed more than 100 people.

Trump's administration has provided no definitive evidence that the sunken vessels were involved in drug trafficking , and international law experts and rights groups say the strikes likely amount to extrajudicial killings as they have apparently targeted civilians who do not pose an immediate threat to the United States.</description><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 06:34:33 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/228c4f00-db70-11f0-96fc-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/fdda9edcabb8546f111b3c09adfad7a48fc79335.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran says two Islamic State‑linked men executed for 2023 bus bombing</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-says-two-islamic-statelinked-men-executed-2023-bus-bombing-2026-01-24/</link><description>Jan 24 (Reuters) - Iran executed two men for the 2023 bombing of a bus carrying pilgrims, identifying them as linked to Islamic State, the judiciary’s Mizan news agency reported on Saturday.

Dozens of eateries, attraction sites and other businesses shuttered as part of a day of coordinated action to defy the weeks-long federal immigration operation underway in Minnesota.

Images of an apparently terrified pre-schooler, Liam Conejo Ramos, being held by immigration officers who were seeking to arrest the boy's father have rekindled public outrage at the federal crackdown, during which an agent shot and killed a US citizen.

The superintendent of Columbia Heights Public Schools, where Ramos was a preschool student, said the child and his Ecuadoran father, Adrian Conejo Arias -- both asylum seekers -- were taken from their driveway as they arrived home on Tuesday.

Ramos was then used as "bait" by officers to draw out those inside his home, superintendent Zena Stenvik added.

One protester, who declined to be named, told AFP he was marching "because if we don't fight, we don't win. If we don't fight, fascism wins."

The local man held a sign reading "five-years-old, dude," a reference to Ramos.

Thousands of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents have been deployed to the Democratic-led city, as President Donald Trump presses his campaign to deport undocumented immigrants across the country.

On a visit to Minneapolis on Thursday, Vice President JD Vance confirmed Ramos was among those detained. But he argued that agents were protecting him after his father "ran" from officers.

"What are they supposed to do? Are they supposed to let a five-year-old child freeze to death?" he said.

UN human rights chief Volker Turk called on US authorities to end the "harmful treatment of migrants and refugees."

Arias, the father of the boy, was at a Texas detention facility, according to an ICE database that does not list the whereabouts of under-18s.

Border Patrol senior official Gregory Bovino defended his officers' treatment of Ramos, telling reporters Friday: "I will say unequivocally that we are experts in dealing with children."

ICE commander Marcos Charles said Friday "my officers did everything they could to reunite him with his family" and alleged that Ramos's family refused to open the door to him after his father left him and ran from officers.

They would be detained "pending their immigration proceedings," he added after alleging they entered the United States illegally and were "deportable."

Ramos's teacher, whose name was given as Ella, called him "a bright young student."

In Minneapolis, where temperatures touched -23C (-9F) on Friday, protesters wrapped in hats, gloves and scarves chanted "ICE out" as part of a broader anti-ICE day of action.

Separately, protesters picketed outside Minneapolis-St. Paul airport over the facility's use for deporting those swept up in immigration raids.

Methodist pastor Mariah Furness Tollgaard said in a statement that 100 members of clergy were arrested and charged with trespassing and disobeying a peace officer on Friday, while demonstrating at the airport.

"As a faith leader in Minnesota, my tradition teaches that every person bears the image of God and is worthy of dignity and safety, and in this moment, all people of faith and moral conscience must stand up," she said.

Former US vice president Kamala Harris said she was "outraged" by Ramos's detention and called him "just a baby."

Ramos is one of at least four children detained in the same Minneapolis school district this month, administrators said.

Minneapolis has been rocked by increasingly tense protests since federal agents shot and killed US citizen Renee Good on January 7.

An autopsy concluded that the killing was a homicide, a classification that does not automatically mean a crime was committed.

The officer who fired the shots that killed Good, Jonathan Ross, has neither been suspended nor charged.

Marc Prokosch, the lawyer for Ramos and his father, said they followed the law in applying for asylum in Minneapolis, a sanctuary city where police do not cooperate with federal immigration authorities.

Children have been caught up in immigration enforcement under both Republican and Democratic administrations.

Minnesota has sought a temporary restraining order for the ICE operation in the state which, if granted by a federal judge, would pause the sweeps. There will be a hearing on the application Monday.</description><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 07:24:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/a906eb48-f8ef-11f0-aa7d-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26023860167783.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Live: One killed in Kyiv as Ukraine and Russia to hold second day of direct talks in UAE</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260124-live-ukraine-and-russia-to-hold-second-day-of-direct-talks-in-uae-one-killed-in-kyiv</link><description>‍Nearly ​6,000 ⁠buildings in Ukraine's capital city Kyiv ​were ‍left ​without heat after ​an overnight Russian attack, Mayor Vitali Klitschko said.

Zhang is a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee and vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC), while Liu is chief of staff of the CMC Joint Staff Department, according to the ministry.

Zhang, 75, is widely seen as President Xi Jinping's closest military ally and one of just a few leading officers with combat experience. He is one of two vice-chairmen of the CMC, China's supreme armed forces command organisation.

The military was one of the main targets of a broad corruption crackdown ordered by Xi in 2012. That drive reached the upper levels of the military in 2023 when the Rocket Force was targeted.

Eight top generals were expelled from the ruling Communist Party on graft charges in October 2025, including the country's number two general, He Weidong. He had served under Xi and alongside Zhang on the Central Military Commission.

Two former defence ministers were also purged from the party in recent years for corruption. The crackdown is slowing procurement of advanced weaponry and hitting the revenues of some of China's largest military firms.</description><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 08:27:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/AFVNNV53KNI4VHHTOBGMHXHQHE.jpg?auth=d05c84bac0a1a425c5871aba72476ee1283b73f3a4a1685271f234a886c5622a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Nearly 6,000 buildings in Kyiv without heat after Russian attack</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/nearly-6000-buildings-kyiv-without-heat-after-russian-attack-2026-01-24/</link><description>KYIV, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Nearly 6,000 buildings in Ukraine's capital city Kyiv were left without heat after an overnight Russian attack, Mayor Vitali Klitschko said.

Dutch airline KLM also halted flights until further notice to cities in the Middle East and would not fly through the airspace of several countries in the region, including Iraq and Iran , according to the Netherlands ' state broadcaster.

President Donald Trump said on Thursday that a US "armada" was heading toward the Gulf and that Washington was watching Iran closely, even after downplaying the prospect of imminent military action and saying Tehran appeared interested in talks.

The airline added it was "constantly monitoring the evolution of the geopolitical situation in the territories served and overflown by its aircraft" to ensure "the highest level of safety and security" for its flights.

"Air France is monitoring the situation in real time and will provide further updates on its flight schedule," the French airline said.

KLM told Dutch public broadcaster NOS on Friday that it had suspended flights until further notice to Tel Aviv, Dubai, Dammam and Riyadh and would not fly through the airspace of Iraq, Iran, Israel and several countries in the Gulf.

The airline did not disclose the reason for the suspensions and said it was in touch with Dutch authorities, according to NOS.

Neighbouring Turkey, as well as some officials in Syria, said late on Friday that the deadline could be extended.

Government troops have seized swathes of northern and eastern territory in the last two weeks from the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces in a rapid turn of events that has consolidated President Ahmed al-Sharaa's rule.

Sharaa's forces were approaching a last cluster of Kurdish-held cities in the northeast earlier this week when he abruptly announced a ceasefire, giving the SDF until Saturday night to come up with a plan to integrate with Syria's army.

As the deadline approached, SDF forces also reinforced their defensive positions in the cities of Qamishli, Hasakeh and Kobane for a possible fight, Kurdish security sources told Reuters.

Syrian officials and SDF sources said it was likely the Saturday deadline would be extended for several days, possibly up to a week.

"Extending the ceasefire for a little longer may come onto the agenda," said Hakan Fidan, the foreign minister of Turkey, which is the strongest foreign backer of Sharaa's government and sees the SDF as an arm of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK.

The possible showdown in northern Syria is the culmination of rising tensions over the last year.

Sharaa, whose forces toppled longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad in late 2024, has vowed to bring all of Syria under state control - including SDF-held areas in the northeast.

But Kurdish authorities who have run autonomous civilian and military institutions there for the last decade have resisted joining up with Sharaa's Islamist-led government.

After a year-end deadline for the merger passed with little progress, Syrian troops launched an offensive this month.

They swiftly captured two key Arab-majority provinces from the SDF, bringing key oil fields, hydroelectric dams and some facilities holding Islamic State fighters and affiliated civilians under government control.

The U.S. has been engaging in shuttle diplomacy to establish a lasting ceasefire and facilitate the integration of the SDF - once Washington's main partner in Syria - into the state led by its new U.S.-favoured ally, Sharaa.

Senior officials from the United States and France, which has also been involved in talks, have urged Sharaa not to send his troops into remaining Kurdish-held areas, diplomatic sources told Reuters.

They fear that renewed fighting could lead to mass abuses against Kurdish civilians. Government-affiliated forces killed nearly 1,500 people from the Alawite minority and hundreds of Druze people in sectarian violence last year, including in execution-style killings.

Amid the instability in the northeast, the U.S. military has been transferring hundreds of detained fighters from the Islamic State group from Syrian prisons across the border into Iraq.

Iraq's Foreign Minister Fuad Hussein told the EU's foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, in a phone call on Saturday that Baghdad should not bear the "security and financial burdens" of the transfer of IS prisoners alone, the Iraqi foreign ministry said in a statement.

Turkey's Fidan, speaking on broadcaster NTV late on Friday, cited these transfers as possibly necessitating an extension to the Saturday deadline.</description><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 08:51:21 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5IYAYBULIJNHPOHKTQAWCCXZLE.jpg?auth=205e6ae73f70be7992956d2c6099af2074390c964aed78a37d3a8254425eca9f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukraine's foreign minister says Putin 'cynically' attacked during Abu Dhabi talks</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/ukraines-foreign-minister-says-putin-cynically-attacked-during-abu-dhabi-talks-2026-01-24/</link><description>KYIV, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Ukraine's foreign minister accused Russian President Vladimir Putin on Saturday of "cynically" ordering a massive missile strike while delegations from Ukraine, Russia and the U.S. were in Abu Dhabi for Washington-brokered peace talks.

"This barbaric attack once again proves that Putin's place is not at the board of peace, but at the dock of the special tribunal," Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha wrote on X.

Russia launched waves of air strikes against Ukraine's two largest cities Kyiv and Kharkiv early on Saturday, with one person killed and at least 23 injured. Ukraine's air force said Russia had launched 375 drones and 21 missiles in the strikes, which once again targeted energy infrastructure, knocking out power and heat for large parts of the capital.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy had said on Friday that it was too early to draw conclusions from the first day of meetings in Abu Dhabi, and he had urged Russia to show it was ready to end the war. The talks were expected to resume for a final day on Saturday morning.

Ahead of the talks, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Friday that Russia had not dropped its insistence on Ukraine yielding all of its eastern area of Donbas - Ukraine's industrial heartland grouping the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk.

Russian President Vladimir Putin's demand that Ukraine surrender the 20% it still holds of Donetsk - about 5,000 sq km (1,900 sq miles) - has proven a major stumbling block to any deal.

Zelenskiy refuses to give up land that Russia has not been able to capture in four years of grinding, attritional warfare. Polls show little appetite among Ukrainians for territorial concessions.

Russia says it wants a diplomatic solution but will keep working to achieve its goals by military means as long as a negotiated solution remains elusive.

Before Saturday's strikes, Kyiv had already endured two mass overnight attacks since the New Year that knocked out power and heating to hundreds of residential buildings. Ukraine's deputy prime minister said on Saturday that 800,000 people in Kyiv - where temperatures were around -10 Celsius - had been left without power after the latest Russian attack.</description><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 09:23:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/NFLXCKARHNL2RPX772TADMVO7U.jpg?auth=7a3852b1a29835f66b8019a58cd41171bf324a4e6afec6a5016fa6a165938d45&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Suicide bombing at Pakistan wedding kills 7, police say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/suicide-bombing-pakistan-wedding-kills-7-police-say-2026-01-24/</link><description>DERA ISMAIL KHAN, Pakistan, Jan 24 (Reuters) - The death toll from a suicide bombing at a wedding near the Afghan border rose to seven on Saturday, police said, as Pakistan struggles to deal with a rising wave of militant attacks.

The bombing tore through a building housing members of a peace committee during a wedding ceremony on Friday in northwestern Pakistan's Dera Ismail Khan district, said police official Muhammad Adnan.

The committees are made up of local residents and elders and supported by Islamabad as part of its efforts to counter Islamist militants in the regions along the Afghan border.

The four, who were among nearly a dozen people hurt in the attack, died in hospital, Adnan added.

Three people were confirmed dead on Friday.

No group has claimed responsibility for the bombing.

The Pakistani Taliban, also known as Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, which operates on both sides of the Afghan border, has labelled peace committee members as traitors.

The Pakistani Taliban is an umbrella group of several Sunni militant groups, which has been fighting against the state since 1997.

Their stated goal is to replace Pakistan's system of governance with their strict brand of Islamic laws.

Islamabad has accused the Afghan Taliban of allowing the Pakistan group to plan its attacks from Afghanistan. Kabul denies the charge, saying the militancy is Pakistan's domestic problem.</description><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 09:42:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Hungary's opposition taps energy expert to lead foreign policy ahead of vote</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/hungarys-opposition-taps-energy-expert-lead-foreign-policy-ahead-vote-2026-01-24/</link><description>BUDAPEST, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Hungary's opposition leader Peter Magyar, whose Tisza party leads most polls ahead of an April 12 election, has tapped international energy expert Anita Orban to be in charge of foreign policy.

Magyar's centre-right Tisza party is ahead of nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban's Fidesz in most polls, though many voters remain undecided ahead of the election that will be highly consequential in Europe.

Anita Orban, unrelated to the prime minister, earned her PhD degree from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy in Boston in 2007 and is the author of the book  "Power, Energy and the New Russian Imperialism" published in 2008.

Between 2010 and 2015, she was an envoy for energy security in Viktor Orban's government, during his second, 16-year, spell in power, and has since worked in London in senior positions in the LNG sector and, most recently, at the Vodafone Group.

She joins Magyar's team a week after he appointed former Shell (SHEL.L) , opens new tab executive Istvan Kapitany to a senior economy role.

"Anita Orban is an experienced diplomat ... with insight and experience in diplomacy, foreign and energy policy and also about the decision-making of international companies," Magyar said in a statement on Saturday.

Magyar, a former government insider, has told Reuters he would keep Hungary firmly anchored in the European Union and NATO if he wins elections and would strive for "pragmatic relations" with Russia.

His Tisza Party swept into Hungarian politics in 2024, mounting the most serious challenge to Orban since he came to power in 2010.

Magyar has said he would unlock billions of euros in frozen EU funds to boost the economy, after a rule of law dispute with Brussels led to Hungary losing access to the funds under Orban.</description><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 09:43:04 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/M6V7ORONRFPWNNOUUBVFOZHFO4.jpg?auth=c94e48fa00b3b8324da16042ac474a19a551fe34addb55150f73df46af5ddf08&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>More than 8,000 flights cancelled as severe winter storm hits much of the US</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260124-more-than-8-000-flights-cancelled-as-severe-winter-storm-us</link><description>More than 8,000 flights across the US set to take off over the weekend have been cancelled as a major storm expected to wreak havoc across much of the country bears down, threatening to knock out power for days and snarl major roadways.

Roughly 140 million people were under a winter storm warning from New Mexico to New England. The National Weather Service forecast warns of widespread heavy snow and a band of catastrophic ice stretching from east Texas to North Carolina.

Forecasters say damage, especially in areas pounded by ice, could rival that of a hurricane.

By Friday night, the edge of the storm was sending freezing rain and sleet into parts of Texas while snow and sleet were falling in Oklahoma. After sweeping through the South, the storm was expected to move into the Northeast, dumping about a foot (30 centimetres) of snow from Washington through New York and Boston, the weather service predicted.

Governors in more than a dozen states sounded the alarm about the turbulent weather ahead, declaring emergencies or urging people to stay home.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told residents on the social media platform X that the state Department of Transportation was pretreating the roads and told residents, “Stay home if possible.”

More than 3,400 flights were delayed or canceled Saturday, according to the flight tracking website FlightAware. More than 5,000 were called off for Sunday.

Angela Exstrom was supposed to fly back to Omaha, Nebraska , from a trip in Mexico, but she learned her Saturday flight out of Houston had been cancelled. So instead, she is going back via Los Angeles.

“If you live in the Midwest and travel in the winter, stuff can happen,” she said.

Utility companies braced for power outages because ice-coated trees and power lines can keep falling long after a storm has passed.

The Midwest saw wind chills as low as minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 40 Celsius), meaning that frostbite could set in within 10 minutes.

In Bismarck, North Dakota, where the wind chill was minus 41 (minus 41 Celsius), Colin Cross was bundled up Friday in long johns, two long-sleeve shirts, a jacket, hat, hood, gloves and boots as he cleaned out an empty unit for the apartment complex where he works.

“I’ve been here awhile and my brain stopped working,” Cross said.

The storm has been a popular topic of discussion for days at Saint Paul Mini Market in Baltimore.

“Every single person that walks in talks about the storm,” said owner Ayaz Ahmed.

“Somehow, this time around, they did a good job letting people know that here’s a storm coming their way, and everybody knows about the storm, but how to deal with that is another thing,” Ahmed said.

The federal government put nearly 30 search and rescue teams on standby. Officials had more than 7 million meals, 600,000 blankets and 300 generators placed throughout the area the storm was expected to cross, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

President Donald Trump said via social media on Friday that his administration was coordinating with state and local officials and “FEMA is fully prepared to respond”.

After the storm passes, it will take a while to thaw out. Ice can add hundreds of pounds to power lines and branches and make them more susceptible to snapping, especially if it's windy.

In at least 11 Southern states from Texas to Virginia, a majority of homes are heated by electricity, according to the US Census Bureau.

A severe cold snap five years ago took down much of the power grid in Texas , leaving millions without power for days and resulting in hundreds of deaths. Abbott vowed that will not happen again, and utility companies were bringing in thousands of employees to help keep the lights on.

Churches moved Sunday services online, and the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville, Tennessee, decided to hold its Saturday night radio performance without fans. Carnival parades in Louisiana were cancelled or rescheduled.

Philadelphia announced schools would be closed Monday. Superintendent Tony B. Watlington Sr. told students, “It’s also appropriate to have one or two very safe snowball fights.”

Some universities in the South canceled classes for Monday, including the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the University of Mississippi's main campus in Oxford.

At the University of Georgia, in Athens, sophomore Eden England stayed on campus to ride things out with friends, even as the school encouraged students to leave dorms and go home because of concerns about losing power.

“I’d rather be with my friends,” England said, “kind of struggling together if anything happens”.</description><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 10:24:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/c212895c-f904-11f0-8f5a-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26023605674347.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Immigration raids in Minnesota fuel grassroots Somali activism</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/immigration-raids-minnesota-fuel-grassroots-somali-activism-2026-01-24/</link><description>MINNEAPOLIS, Jan 24 (Reuters) - When immigration agents began aggressive operations in Minneapolis last month, Kowsar Mohamed started knocking on doors, fielding late-night calls and mobilizing other Somali Americans into an ad-hoc response team. Many feared they were being singled out, a worry that revived memories of the state surveillance and arbitrary authority they thought they had left behind when they resettled in the United States.

More than 100 volunteers now patrol south Minneapolis, distribute "Know Your Rights" guides and escort frightened elders — part of a sweeping grassroots effort to counter what many describe as constitutionally suspect raids that are destabilizing Minnesota’s roughly 80,000‑strong Somali community, one of the country’s largest refugee populations.

"You would never fathom that people would just pluck you off the streets ... and say, 'Prove to me that you're a citizen,'" Mohamed said, referring to reports of aggressive tactics by the agents. "It's not that we never thought it was impossible. We just believed the Constitution was going to protect us from this level of interrogation."

The deployment of 3,000 federal agents — ordered by Republican President Donald Trump — has intensified accusations from Democrats and local leaders that he is targeting a politically influential community ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, deepening fears that the operations amount to intimidation aimed at suppressing Somali voter turnout.

Trump, who has described Somalis as "garbage" who should be thrown out of the country, has said the operations are necessary to combat crime, though many of those arrested have no criminal charges or convictions. He has also cited a fraud scandal around the theft of federal funds for social-welfare programs in Minnesota to justify sending agents into the state, many of them from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Democrats and community leaders accuse the agents of harassing peaceful protesters, racial profiling and searching houses without warrants. Minneapolis has been on edge since the fatal shooting of 37-year-old Renee Good by an immigration agent on January 7.

"A lot of community members escaped war and this administration is triggering another war zone," said Abdulahi Farah, co-chair of the Somali American Leadership Table, an advocacy group formed in response to hate crimes and political attacks on Somalis. He said Trump's history of racist rhetoric against Black and other immigrants of color has emboldened far-right activists and had a destabilizing effect on small businesses and citizens' general sense of safety.

Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to Reuters that immigrants who are served administrative warrants or I-205 removal orders "have had full due process and a final order of removal from an immigration judge."

In Cedar-Riverside, a normally bustling Somali neighborhood lined with restaurants, boutique shops and convenience stores, business owners say activity is noticeably quieter since immigration agents arrived there last month.

"It's been really slow,” said Rashid Jama, a grocery store manager in the neighborhood, also known as the West Bank. "A lot of our suppliers are Latino and they’re scared to come to work.”

The efforts of Mohamed, a third-year doctoral student at the University of Minnesota, are part of a broader wave of grassroots initiatives to push back by filming arrests, planning peaceful protests and accelerating voter outreach.

Some Somali Americans fear the raids are a bid to suppress voter turnout before midterm elections in November, according to over a dozen grassroots organizers, local officials and residents interviewed by Reuters.

"It's signaling that if we get rid of them, if we scare them, they're not going to come out to vote in the 2026 midterm election. We know that's the target," said Farah, whose group is partnering with other grassroots organizations to train people on priorities like opposing ICE raids as well as broader issues like affordability.

Mosques and neighboring community centers are now turning into political education hubs in Minnesota, local leaders said.

Civil rights advocates and scholars say the Minneapolis immigration operations echo past crackdowns in Black and Latino neighborhoods, fueling fears of political scapegoating, said political science professor Christina Greer at Fordham University.

Somali American voters have largely supported Democrats since refugees began resettling in the U.S. in the 1990s, before becoming more politically active in the 2000s. U.S. Representative Ilhan Omar is the community's most high-profile member and a frequent target of racist attacks from Trump.

Asked about that and tactics of agents decried by residents, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said in a statement to Reuters that immigrants “who fail to contribute to our economy, rip off Americans and refuse to assimilate into our society should not be here.”

Minnesota Republican Party Chairman Alex Plechash denied the raids were politically driven, calling the charge “categorically false” but said complaints about aggressive tactics warrant review.

Some Somali community leaders say mobilizing voters will be a priority in the months ahead.

"The power we have is to vote," said Abdullahi Kahiye, 37, who said he became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2024. "ICE and whoever is trying to terrorize the Somali community will not succeed."</description><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 11:18:42 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/R3UEVLXPOFO3HGNLXBHXKGS5YQ.jpg?auth=e2e325f7d53e33314a3ad500e68f6a456d54c9dc2fc247250449c87010aa67ef&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Exclusive: US presses Bolivia to expel suspected Iranian spies, harden approach to militant groups, sources say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/us-presses-bolivia-expel-suspected-iranian-spies-harden-approach-militant-groups-2026-01-24/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 24 (Reuters) - The United States is pushing Bolivia to kick suspected Iranian spies out of the South American country and designate Tehran's elite Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps as a terrorist group, according to two sources with direct knowledge of the matter.

Washington also wants the government in La Paz to designate Lebanese armed group Hezbollah and Palestinian militant organization Hamas - both of which the United States considers to be proxies of Tehran - as terrorist organizations, said the sources, who requested anonymity to discuss sensitive conversations.

The private diplomatic push comes amid a broader U.S. effort to deepen its geopolitical influence in Latin America and diminish that of its adversaries in the region.

Following an operation earlier in January to capture Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, U.S. officials quickly pushed the government of interim President Delcy Rodriguez to curtail economic and security cooperation between Caracas and Tehran, according to a separate source familiar with the matter. For years, Venezuela and Iran had been steadfast allies.

Asked for comment, the Bolivian foreign ministry said that "there is still no completely defined position regarding this matter." The State Department did not respond to a request for comment, while the Iranian mission to the United Nations declined to comment.

Bolivia, a landlocked country of 12 million people located in the heart of South America, would at first glance seem to be an unlikely venue for a proxy struggle between major world powers. Some current and former U.S. officials, however, said the nation has become an important base for Iran's diplomatic and intelligence operations throughout the continent.

In part, that is because of what U.S. officials have described as a permissive counterintelligence environment, as well as the nation's central location bordering several other nations, some of which have allegedly been the victim of attempted Hezbollah plots in recent years.

Rick de la Torre, a retired senior CIA officer and former Caracas chief of station, said Iran's base of diplomatic and intelligence operations in Latin America was Venezuela. However, Bolivia and Nicaragua - where an authoritarian government has cool relations with Washington - have served as Tehran's "secondary nodes" in the region in recent years.

"(Bolivia's) value to Tehran was the permissive political climate, lighter scrutiny and central geography," de la Torre said.

"In practice, the pattern you see across Latin America is Iran and Hezbollah using the most permissive jurisdictions as hubs, then projecting quietly into more capable or higher-value states nearby."

Evo Morales, Bolivia's leftist president from 2006 to 2019, deepened ties to Iran over the course of his presidency, including on defense and security-related matters, arguing both nations were united in the fight against U.S. imperialism.

Morales and leftist President Luis Arce, who governed from 2020 until late last year, were widely seen by U.S. officials as unreceptive to potential efforts to distance La Paz from Tehran. Now, however, U.S. officials believe they have a unique opportunity following the October election of centrist Rodrigo Paz, whose presidency marks an end to two decades of near-continuous rule by the leftist MAS party.

Paz's government, which has inherited significant economic turmoil and a fractious legislature, has sought to repair ties with Washington, while encouraging private investment. U.S. officials have publicly welcomed Paz's election, and in December the U.S. made Bolivia available for grant funding administered by the Millennium Challenge Corporation, an independent U.S. agency.

The sources said the Iran-related push in Bolivia is part of a broader U.S. campaign in the region. In September, U.S. ally Ecuador designated the IRGC, Hamas and Hezbollah as terrorist organizations, while Argentina designated Iran's Quds Force last week. The U.S. advocated for both moves, the sources said.

The IRGC has served as an elite military force loyal to Iran's Supreme Leader since the 1979 Iranian Revolution, while the Quds Force is an IRGC branch responsible for overseas operations.

While the current push to drive a geopolitical wedge between Iran and Latin America is not new, there are signs the effort is ramping up. A delegation including State Department and intelligence officials traveled to La Paz this month in part to discuss the potential terrorist designations, the sources said.

U.S. officials have also discussed pushing for terrorist designations in Chile, Peru and Panama, the officials added, though it is not clear they have yet discussed the matter with counterparts in those countries. Hezbollah operatives have been present in all of those nations, U.S. officials have alleged, and all have U.S.-aligned presidents or presidents-elect.

The Panamanian foreign ministry said it had not discussed the issue with U.S. officials. The Chilean foreign ministry declined to comment, while the Peruvian foreign ministry did not respond to a request for comment.

Among the most recent high-profile IRGC operations in the region was an alleged assassination plot targeting the Israeli ambassador to Mexico, which was foiled last year by Mexican security services. The plot, which was first reported by Axios in November, was orchestrated in part by an undercover Quds Force officer stationed in Caracas, one of the sources said.

Lebanon-based Hezbollah, which is closely allied with Tehran, has long operated in Latin America, often generating revenue for its global operations by participating in illicit smuggling networks and occasionally orchestrating terrorist attacks.

Still, while U.S. officials broadly hold that Hezbollah maintains a permanent presence in Latin America, there is significant debate within the intelligence community regarding how robust that presence is.

Some have characterized the group's fundraising operations in the region as well-organized and hierarchical, while others argue that some financial activities ascribed to Hezbollah are in fact a function of donations and remittances from Latin America's sizeable Lebanese diaspora that make their way to Hezbollah-linked individuals by happenstance.

"In my view, Hezbollah leadership does not micromanage every criminal scheme," said de la Torre, the retired CIA officer, "but it does authorize and benefit from a global facilitation architecture that includes Latin America."</description><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 11:40:44 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Sudan's women face 'world's worst' sexual violence amid brutal conflict, minister says</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/africa/20260124-women-facing-world-worst-sexual-violence-sudan-conflict</link><description>Women are the main victims of abuse in Sudan 's war, facing "the world's worst" sexual violence and other crimes committed with impunity, a rights activist turned social affairs minister for the army-backed government said.

The Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have been locked in a brutal conflict since April 2023 that has killed tens of thousands of people, displaced around 11 million and been marked by widespread sexual violence.

Sulaima Ishaq al-Khalifa said abuses against women routinely accompanied looting and attacks, with reports of rape often perpetrated as "the family witnessed" the crime.

"There is no age limit. A woman of 85 could be raped, a child of one year could be raped," the trained psychologist said at her home in Port Sudan.

The longtime women's rights activist, recently appointed to the government, said that women were also being subjected to sexual slavery and trafficked to neighbouring countries, alongside forced marriages arranged to avoid shame.

Khalifa said sexual violence has been reported on both sides, but she insisted it is "systematic" among the RSF, who she says use it "as a weapon of war" and for the purposes of "ethnic cleansing".

Her ministry has documented more than 1,800 rapes between April 2023 and October 2025 – a figure that does not include atrocities documented in western Darfur and the neighbouring Kordofan region from late October onwards.

"It's about... humiliating people, forcing them to leave their houses and places and cities. And also breaking... the social fabrics," Khalifa said.

"When you are using sexual violence as a weapon of war, that means you want to extend... the war forever", because it feeds a "sense of revenge", she added.

A report by the SIHA Network, an activist group that documents abuses against women in the Horn of Africa , found that more than three-quarters of recorded cases involved rape, with 87 percent attributed to the RSF.

The United Nations has repeatedly raised alarm over what it describes as targeted attacks on non-Arab communities in Darfur , while the International Criminal Court ( ICC ) has opened a formal investigation into " war crimes " by both sides.

Briefing the UN Security Council in mid-January, ICC deputy prosecutor Nazhat Shameem Khan said investigators had uncovered evidence of an "organised, calculated campaign" in El Fasher – the army's last stronghold in Darfur captured by the RSF in late October.

The campaign, Khan added, involved mass rapes and executions "on a massive scale", sometimes "filmed and celebrated" by the perpetrators and "fuelled by a sense of complete impunity".

Darfur endured a brutal wave of atrocities in the early 2000s, and a former Janjaweed commander – from the militia structure that later evolved into the RSF – was recently found guilty by the International Criminal Court of multiple war crimes, including rape.

"What's happening now is much more ugly. Because the mass rape thing is happening and documented," said Khalifa.

RSF fighters carrying out the assaults "have been very proud about doing this and they don't see it as a crime", she added.

"You feel that they have a green light to do whatever they want."

Watch more Half of all Sudanese children not in education due to civil war

In Darfur, several survivors said RSF fighters "have been accusing them of being lesser people, like calling them 'slaves', and saying that when I'm attacking you, assaulting you sexually, I'm actually 'honouring' you, because I am more educated than you, or (of) more pure blood than you".

Women in Khartoum and Darfur, including El-Fasher, have described rapes carried out by a range of foreign nationals.

These were "mercenaries from West Africa , speaking French, including from Mali, Burkina Faso , Nigeria , Chad , as well as Colombia and Libya" – allegedly fighting alongside the RSF, Khalifa added.

Some victims were abducted and held as sexual slaves, while others were sold through trafficking networks operating across Sudan's porous borders, said Khalifa.

Many of these cases remain difficult to document because of the collapse of state institutions.

In conservative communities, social stigma also remains a major obstacle to documenting the scale of the abuse.

Families often force victims into marriage to "cover up what happened", particularly when pregnancies result from rape, according to the minister.

"We call it a torture operation," she said, describing "frightening" cases in which children and adolescent girls under 18 are forced into marriage.</description><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 11:44:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/157330a6-e8a7-11f0-bb30-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/4d2cdc9b2f7347c0c3594407405aaf3cbd667950.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US envoys in Israel to discuss future of Gaza, sources tell Reuters</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-special-envoys-israel-discuss-future-gaza-sources-tell-reuters-2026-01-24/</link><description>JERUSALEM, Jan 24 (Reuters) - U.S. envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner were in Israel on Saturday to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, mainly to discuss Gaza, two people briefed on the matter said, as local authorities reported further violence in the enclave.

The U.S. on Thursday announced plans for a "New Gaza" rebuilt from scratch, to include residential towers, data centres and seaside resorts.

The project forms part of President Donald Trump's push to advance an October ceasefire between Israel and Palestinian militant group Hamas that has been shaken by repeated violations.

The Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza said on Saturday that Israeli fire had killed three people, including two children, in two separate incidents in the northern Gaza Strip.

Since the beginning of the war, the death toll in Gaza now stands at 71,654 people, with 481 deaths since the October ceasefire, according to Health Ministry data.

A spokesperson for the Israeli prime minister's office confirmed that the meeting was planned but did not provide further details.

Gaza has been reduced to rubble in the war that was triggered by an attack by Hamas on southern Israel on October 7, 2023 that killed 1,200 people, according to Israeli tallies.

The head of a transitional Palestinian committee backed by the U.S. to temporarily administer Gaza, Ali Shaath, said on Thursday that the Rafah border crossing - effectively the sole route in or out of Gaza for nearly all of the more than 2 million people who live there - would open next week.

Israel wants to restrict the number of Palestinians entering Gaza through the border crossing with Egypt to ensure that more are allowed out than in, three sources briefed on the matter said ahead of the border's expected opening.

The border was supposed to have opened during the initial phase of Trump's plan to end the war.

Earlier this month, Washington announced that the plan had now moved into the second phase, under which Israel is expected to withdraw troops further from Gaza, and Hamas is due to yield control of the territory's administration.

The Gaza side of the crossing has been under Israeli military control since 2024.</description><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 12:41:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/MI3KYONQWNJ57B3VXHXU6YYL5M.jpg?auth=3f524c71477b9bdb83d60751fa1180048c645f559962cab058b8ad8e81ab5043&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Italy protests, recalls ambassador to Switzerland after New Year's bar fire suspect released</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/italy-protests-recalls-ambassador-switzerland-after-new-years-bar-fire-suspect-2026-01-24/</link><description>ROME, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Italy formally protested on Saturday the release on bail of the owner of a Swiss bar engulfed in a deadly New Year's Day fire and recalled its ambassador to Switzerland, as the court's decision came under criticism in both countries.

Jacques Moretti and his wife Jessica, owners of Le Constellation bar in Crans-Montana, are under investigation for negligent homicide and other crimes linked to the blaze that killed 40 people and injured more than 100, many of them teenagers.

Jacques Moretti was detained on January 9 but released on bail on Friday.

Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni overnight called his release "an affront to the memory of the victims of the New Year's Eve tragedy and an insult to their families".

Six of those killed in the bar blaze were Italian as were 10 of the injured.

A government statement on Saturday said Meloni and Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani instructed Italy's ambassador to immediately contact the chief prosecutor in Switzerland's Valais canton to convey Italy's "strong indignation" over Moretti's release.

It added that the court had taken the decision despite the seriousness of the alleged crime, the risk of flight and the possibility of evidence being compromised.

"The whole of Italy is clamouring for truth and justice, and is calling for respectful measures to be taken in the wake of this disaster, which take full account of the suffering and expectations of the families," the statement said.

Meloni and Tajani also ordered Ambassador Gian Lorenzo Cornado to return to Rome to determine what further action to take, it said.

A Swiss Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesperson was not immediately available for comment.

Moretti was released under a bail arrangement that included a 200,000 Swiss franc ($256,377) payment and an order to report daily to a police station.

Lawyers for the victims of the fire and their families said they were struggling to understand the court order, adding that their clients were concerned about evidence disappearing.

The Morettis have both expressed grief over the tragedy and said they would cooperate with prosecutors.

In a statement following Jacques Moretti's release, their lawyers said they would both "continue to comply with all requests from the authorities".

The men, all British, were part of a "sophisticated and planned agreement" to go to the houses of the men, Shahzad Akbar and Adil Raja, at almost exactly the same time on December 24 and assault them, prosecutor Warren Stanier told Westminster Magistrates' Court.

Prosecutors say Akbar, a former adviser to jailed ex-Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan , was struck many times in the face after opening the door to his house in Cambridge, central England, to a masked man who had asked for him by name.

Meanwhile, two men called at the home of former army officer-turned YouTuber Adil Raja in Chesham, to the northwest of London, and tried to force entry. Raja, who was convicted in absentia in January of terrorism-related offences linked to online support for Khan, was not there at the time.

A week later two men, one of whom was suspected to have a firearm, are believed to have broken a window at Akbar's address and attempted to throw a burning rag inside. However, it did not cause any damage.

Police said because of the "highly targeted nature of the incidents", the investigation was being led by counter-terrorism offices.

Karl Blackbird, 40, is accused of two counts of conspiracy to assault and cause actual bodily harm while Chris McAulay, 39, faces a single count of the same charge. Doneto Brammer, 21, is charged with possession of a firearm, and conspiracy to commit arson.

The three men, who did not indicate a plea, were remanded in custody until their next appearance at London's Old Bailey Court on February 13.

Three other men have also been arrested in connection with the investigation but have either been released or not charged with any offence as yet.</description><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 13:33:21 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/R3ESFH2MZNKZFC4WPQE2KLBJQ4.jpg?auth=10cc3b77b038100043addd8d88cf9c1ac606472acac91592caf1f669df9fed8d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US to seek extradition of alleged leader of Ecuadorian drug trafficking gang from Spain, Ecuadorean official says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/us-seek-extradition-alleged-leader-ecuadorian-drug-trafficking-gang-spain-2026-01-24/</link><description>QUITO, Jan 24 (Reuters) - The United States filed charges against the alleged leader of the powerful Ecuadorean drug trafficking gang Los Lobos, paving the way for his direct extradition from Spain to the U.S., Ecuador's interior minister said.

Interior Minister John Reimberg said on X late on Friday that the U.S. Attorney's Office had initiated proceedings against Wilmer Geovanny Chavarria Barre, known as "Pipo," following what he described as "strategic and firm" international coordination.

Reimberg said the move showed that there were "no shelters, no borders and no impunity" for criminal leaders.

Chavarria was arrested in the Spanish city of Malaga in November in a joint operation of Ecuadorean and Spanish police, authorities said at the time. President Daniel Noboa announced his capture on November 16, calling it a key success in his government's efforts to combat powerful criminal gangs.

Los Lobos is one of Ecuador's largest drug trafficking groups and was designated a foreign terrorist organization by the United States in September, along with rival gang Los Choneros.

Ecuadorean authorities have accused Chavarria of overseeing drug routes linked to Mexico's Jalisco New Generation Cartel and of controlling illegal mining operations.

Officials have also said Chavarria faked his death, assumed a new identity and hid in Europe while continuing to order killings in Ecuador. Reimberg has previously said Chavarria was responsible for at least 400 deaths and directed criminal operations even while imprisoned between 2011 and 2019.

Noboa has pursued a hard-line security strategy, including deploying the military to confront gangs, as Ecuador faces its worst wave of violence in decades. Analysts say the arrest of gang leaders can fuel further bloodshed as rival groups fight for territory and influence.</description><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 14:22:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Uganda opposition leader says wife hospitalised after being choked by soldiers</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/uganda-opposition-leader-says-wife-hospitalised-after-being-choked-by-soldiers-2026-01-24/</link><description>NAIROBI, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Uganda's opposition leader Bobi Wine said on Saturday his wife had been taken to hospital after soldiers invaded their residence, partially undressed and choked her.

Wine, a pop star-turned-politician, was not at the property and is in hiding after he escaped a previous raid on his home last week hours before he was announced as the runner-up in the January 15 presidential election.

Overnight into Saturday, soldiers forcefully entered the opposition leader's home in the Magere suburb in Kampala's north, breaking down doors and beating up staff, Wine said in a post on X.

Ugandan military spokesperson Chris Magezi could not immediately be reached for comment.

Four-decade incumbent ruler Yoweri Museveni, 81, was declared winner of the vote with 71.6% against Wine's 24%. Wine rejected the results, alleging extensive fraud including ballot stuffing.

During the raid on the residence, Wine said, the soldiers held his wife Barbara Kyagulanyi at gunpoint, asking her to reveal his whereabouts.

"They grabbed my wife's phone, forced her to sit down, and ordered her to remove her password. She refused. They strangled her and insulted her," Wine said.

"They forcefully removed her blouse and took pictures... my wife was rushed to hospital where she remains admitted."

Uganda's military chief, Muhoozi Kainerugaba, who is also Museveni's son, has demanded that Wine surrender to police or he would be treated as a rebel, and has also issued death threats to him.

On Friday Kainerugaba also said authorities had killed 30 supporters of Wine's party National Unity Platform (NUP) and detained 2,000 others. Wine has not been accused of any crime.

Wine alleges that money, documents and other electronic gadgets were also taken during the raid.

On Thursday U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres expressed concern over the arrests and violence involving opposition figures and supporters.

Rights groups and opposition critics have long accused Museveni of using the military to maintain his grip on power. Ruling party officials deny the accusations, and say Museveni's long rule is due to popular support among the voters.</description><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 14:44:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5BJFJQ4QMBIHFFGDFB745GC2TM.jpg?auth=3bd56442db2bcf1fd20ab5524504a7d8ef9d09211dfaafd74a4b0e9a7c72c128&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Access road to Chile's Escondida, Zaldivar mines remains blocked amid contractor strike, sources say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/sustainable-finance-reporting/access-road-chiles-escondida-zaldivar-mines-remains-blocked-amid-contractor-2026-01-24/</link><description>SANTIAGO, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Striking contract workers employed by machinery contractor Finning resumed on Saturday a blockade of the access road to Chile's Escondida and Zaldivar copper mines, according to industry sources.

The oil is being refined in "various places" including Houston, he said.

The U.S. military has seized seven Venezuela-linked tankers since the start of Trump's month-long campaign to control Venezuela's oil flows.

Trump said on Tuesday that his administration had taken 50 million barrels of oil out of Venezuela, and was selling some of it in the open market.</description><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 14:44:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/URVBAJ2SLRLVRPCQNOPCC5YKFQ.jpg?auth=7ecc69fac66408e2297b4d665f584c93f719931d54819d56f63b17c69a949e15&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Turkish pro-Kurd DEM party warns of 'humanitarian tragedy' in siege on Syria's Kobane</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260124-turkish-pro-kurd-dem-party-warns-of-humanitarian-tragedy-in-siege-on-syria-s-kobane</link><description>Turkey 's pro-Kurdish DEM party on Saturday called for the blockade on the Kurdish-majority city of Kobane in northern Syria to be lifted immediately, warning of a "humanitarian tragedy".

The situation in Kobane had escalated from a crisis into a "deadly catastrophe", DEM said after sending a delegation to visit northeastern Syria which over the past week has been targeted by a major Syrian military offensive.

The Kurdish-held city, which is also known as Ain al-Arab, is surrounded by the Turkish border to its north and government forces on all sides.

It lies around 200 kilometres (125 miles) from the Kurds' stronghold in Syria's far northeast.

"Both the military and humanitarian siege on Kobane must be lifted as soon as possible," said DEM co-chair Tulay Hatimogullari.

Kurdish forces have withdrawn from areas near Kobane over the past week following pressure from the Syrian military as President Ahmed al-Sharaa seeks to extend his control across the country.

As the military offensive advanced, residents of surrounding villages flooded into Kobane, where they were now stranded, Hatimogullari said.

"Electricity has been cut off, the internet is cut off, water is cut off. This is a great humanitarian tragedy," she told a news conference.

"Guarantor countries must urgently carry out their responsibilities to lift the siege on northern and eastern Syria," she said referring to the US and western allies who for years have thrown their support behind the Kurdish-dominated SDF forces which have been forced out of the area.</description><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 14:44:49 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/c6f750e8-f92b-11f0-8560-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/000-93TU9KE.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Europe’s digital reliance on US Big Tech: Does the EU have a plan?</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260124-europe-s-digital-reliance-on-us-big-tech-does-the-eu-have-a-plan</link><description>In the digital era, almost every part of life – from communication to healthcare infrastructure and banking – functions within an intricate digital framework, led by a handful of companies operating mainly out of the United States. If the framework collapses, so do many of the essential services that allow society to function.

Transatlantic tensions have been steadily rising during US President Donald Trump’s chaotic first year back in the White House . Trump’s repeated demands for the Danish autonomous territory of Greenland and tariff threats have driven the EU to reassess its relationship with its long-time ally, who may not be as dependable as was previously thought. US cooperation with Europe isn’t just key for trade and diplomacy, it’s also essential to maintain a robust technological and digital frontier.

The bulk of European data is stored on US cloud services. Companies like Amazon, Microsoft and Google own over two-thirds of the European market , while US-based AI pioneers like OpenAI and Anthropic are leading the artificial intelligence boom. According to a European Parliament report , the EU “relies on non-EU countries for over 80 percent of digital products, services, infrastructure, and intellectual property”.

That dependency on a handful of providers has left the EU extremely vulnerable to sovereignty risks in its public and private sectors, to the point where technical issues, geopolitical disputes or malicious activity can have wide-reaching, disastrous effects.

With that fear in mind, EU lawmakers are pushing for alternatives to US Big Tech , and providing homegrown substitutes to Google , Open AI, Microsoft and others.

According to Johan Linåker, senior researcher at RISE Research Institutes of Sweden and adjunct assistant professor at Lund University, Europe’s complacency has led the bloc to a point where most of Europe runs on clouds provided by US Big Tech.

“Public sector and governments have been suffering by a comfort syndrome for decades. There’s a tradition of conservative procurement culture, risk aversiveness, and preference for status quo," he said.

“The difference now is that the geopolitical landscape adds a new dimension of risks to the palate – beyond lack of innovation and escalating license costs.”

Lawmakers are scrambling to make up for that complacency. In 2024, the European Commission appointed its first "technology sovereignty, security and democracy" chief, Henna Virkkunen, whose job it is to reduce dependency and formulate policies that will keep the EU digitally secure.

Lawmakers have also rallied behind the Eurostack movement, an initiative established in 2024 that aims to build an independent European digital infrastructure to limit the dependence of the European Union on foreign technology and US companies. It has lofty goals of cutting technological dependence, boosting industry competitiveness and driving innovation – all while committing to the EU’s sustainability goals.

However, an analysis by independent think-tank Bertelsmann Stiftung estimates that it will take roughly a decade and €300 billion for Eurostack to achieve its goal. A less conservative estimate by US trade group Chamber of Progress (which includes several US Big Tech companies) estimates that the full cost would be far higher at over €5 trillion.

Time and money – not will or talent – are the EU’s main problem.

“We have a brilliant pool of skillful and entrepreneurial minds, but they require beyond substantial investments and demand to fully leverage,” Linåker said. “Europe’s sovereignty hinges on its competitiveness and innovation.”

France , Germany , the Netherlands and Italy have also begun investing in open-source platforms. Open-source means that the technology – hardware or software – is available to be modified, reviewed, and shared.

“Essentially, the open-source piece of software is free to use," Linåker said. "In a public procurement you are free to point out the software explicitly and focus on buying the services needed for use. It provides a toolset for governments in growing their digital sovereignty and resilience, and increasingly recognised through upcoming strategies and legislation."

Certain websites like Switch to EU and european-alternatives.eu also provide lists of European or "European-friendly" digital substitutes that can replace US Big Tech: Mastodon can be an alternative to Elon Musk’s X, Switzerland’s Proton Mail can replace Gmail, etc. But habits are hard to break and these changes can only occur through a deliberate shift in mentality.

While that shift will be “massive”, according to Linåker, it must start somewhere.

“Policy-makers and governments need to lead by example by moving the public discourse and communication beyond incumbent platforms as X to options like Mastodon, which enables an open and federated infrastructure, not dependent on any single actor," he said. "But again, this is not an easy shift – although in practice it’s not that hard."

A few pioneering projects are taking digital sovereignty seriously and leading the way to making that change concrete.

The Swedish city of Helsingborg, for example, is testing how it’s public services would function in the event of a digital blackout. The German region of Schleswig-Holstein has gone a step farther: the regional government has substituted its Microsoft-powered computer systems with open-source alternatives, cancelling almost 80 percent of its Microsoft licenses . Although the system isn’t perfect, the Schleswig-Holstein administration hopes to phase out Big Tech almost entirely by the end of the decade.

“The regional government of Schleswig-Holstein proves the fact that one can create a sovereign digital infrastructure, while working with domestic and European vendors," Linåker said. "Myths regarding security and usability are no more. All of Europe should be pointing their eyes in their direction."

But weaning off US tech entirely will take its time.

“Decoupling is unrealistic and cooperation will remain significant across the technological value chain,” an EU digital strategy report draft reviewed by POLITICO in June 2025 said – which means the EU will, for now, continue to promote collaboration with the US and other tech players including China , Japan , India and South Korea .

The draft report's admission that untangling from the dominance of US tech companies is “unrealistic” only fuels fears about the EU’s reliance on their unpredictable transatlantic ally.

“If the plug gets pulled, consequences will be catastrophic. The likelihood is another question,” Linåker said. “Either way, policy makers and governments need to realise the risk is a fact, understand the potential consequences, and start treating digital infrastructure as a critical asset.”</description><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 14:44:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/16a8b99c-4965-11ef-a2ad-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP23156453868865.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Airlines reroute, cancel flights as tensions ramp up over Iran</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/airlines-reroute-cancel-flights-tensions-ramp-up-over-iran-2026-01-24/</link><description>Jan 24 (Reuters) - Airlines have been rerouting and cancelling some flights across the Middle East as tensions ramp up between Iran and the United States, with President Donald Trump saying on Thursday the U.S. had an "armada" heading towards Iran.

A senior Iranian official said on Friday Iran will treat any attack "as an all-out war against us", ahead of the arrival of a U.S. military aircraft carrier strike group and other assets in the Middle East in the coming days.

The European Union's aviation regulator recommended on January 16 that its airlines stay out of Iran's airspace as tensions flared over Tehran's deadly crackdown on protests and U.S. threats of intervention.

Airline KLM will avoid flying over large parts of the Middle East until further notice due to rising tensions there, the Dutch arm of airline group Air France KLM (AIRF.PA) , opens new tab said on January 24.

"As a precaution, given the geopolitical situation, KLM will not fly through the airspace of Iran, Iraq and Israel and will not fly over several countries in the Gulf region," a KLM spokesperson said.

Air France resumed its service to Dubai on January 24 after suspending it a day before, saying it was following the situation in the Middle East "in real time".

"Air France continuously monitors the geopolitical situation of the territories served and overflown by its aircraft," it said in a statement.

Lufthansa said on January 14 it would bypass Iranian and Iraqi airspace until further notice, and would only operate day flights to Tel Aviv and Amman between January 14 and January 19.

Some flights could be cancelled as a result of these actions, it added in a statement that day.

British Airways temporarily suspended flights to Bahrain on January 16 as a precautionary measure, saying it "continue(d) to keep the situation in the region under close review".

Flights to Bahrain were once again available on the BA website on January 24, and a spokesperson for the airline said all its flights were going ahead as scheduled.

Finnair (FIA1S.HE) , opens new tab said in a statement on January 16 it had stopped flying through Iraqi airspace, travelling to Doha and Dubai over Saudi Arabia instead.

The carrier had already been avoiding Iranian, Syrian and Israeli airspace for security reasons.

A Wizz Air (WIZZ.L) , opens new tab spokesperson said in January that the company avoided Iraqi and Iranian airspace.

"Therefore some westbound flights from Dubai and Abu Dhabi airports will have to make (refuelling and crew change) stops in Larnaca, Cyprus or Thessaloniki, Greece," the representative said.</description><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 15:43:58 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/MOQB6S7QMJOIBJSZPJTRF7DPUU.jpg?auth=26fa2121dfcfbb075acf1b5cedfd7ad336de4d8ca5e820b2076ba69c67725271&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Pakistan sentences human rights activist to 17 years over anti-state posts</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/pakistan-sentences-human-rights-activist-17-years-over-anti-state-posts-2026-01-24/</link><description>ISLAMABAD, Jan 24 (Reuters) - A Pakistani court on Saturday convicted a human rights activist and lawyer, Imaan Mazari and her husband on charges of anti-state social media posts, handing them sentences totalling 17 years, a court order said.

"The prosecution has been able to prove its case," said the court order seen by Reuters.

Mazari, a vocal critic of Pakistan's powerful military, and her husband were convicted on three counts and sentenced to five-year, 10-year and two-year jail terms that will run concurrently, the court said.

Mazari and her husband, Hadi Ali Chattha, who is also a lawyer, have previously denied the charges, saying they were being persecuted for raising their voice against disappearances of nationalist activists, which they blamed on the military, a charge the army denies.

Human rights groups have questioned the trial, raising concerns over shrinking space for civil rights, freedom of speech and political dissent in the nation of 240 million.

The charges under Pakistan's controversial cyber crime laws are linked to their social media posts from the period between 2021 and 2025, which the court said furthered the agenda of anti-state militants and portrayed the military as being involved in terrorism.

Responding to Saturday's court decision, Shireen Mazari, the activist's mother and a minister in the cabinet of jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan, said the conviction was illegal without giving defence a chance to present its case.</description><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 16:25:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump threatens Canada with 100% tariff over pending trade deal with China</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/trump-threatens-canada-with-100-tariff-over-possible-deal-with-china-2026-01-24/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 24 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Saturday he would impose a 100% tariff on Canada if it follows through on a trade deal with China and warned Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney that a deal would endanger his country.

"China will eat Canada alive, completely devour it, including the destruction of their businesses, social fabric, and general way of life," Trump wrote on Truth Social.

"If Canada makes a deal with China, it will immediately be hit with a 100% Tariff against all Canadian goods and products coming into the U.S.A."

Carney's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Canadian prime minister this month traveled to China to reset the countries' strained relationship and reached a trade deal with Canada's second-biggest trading partner after the United States. Immediately after Carney's China trip, Trump sounded supportive. "It's a good thing for him to sign a trade deal," Trump told reporters at the White House on January 16. "If you can get a deal with China, you should do that."

But U.S.-Canada tensions have grown in recent days following Carney's criticism of Trump's pursuit of Greenland.

Trump on Saturday suggested China would try to use Canada to evade U.S. tariffs. "If Governor Carney thinks he is going to make Canada a 'Drop Off Port' for China to send goods and products into the United States, he is sorely mistaken," Trump said, using a title for Carney that refers to Trump's past calls for Canada to become the 51st U.S. state .

If Trump makes good on Saturday's threat, the new tariff would greatly increase U.S. duties on its northern neighbor, adding pressure to Canadian industrial sectors such as metal manufacturing, autos and machinery.

Relations between Carney and Trump seemed relatively placid until the Canadian leader this week spoke out forcefully against Trump's pursuit of Greenland.

Carney subsequently at the World Economic Forum called on nations to accept that a rules-based global order was over and pointed to Canada as an example of how "middle powers" might act together to avoid being victimized by American hegemony.

Carney, during his speech in Davos, Switzerland, did not directly call out Trump or the United States by name. However, the prime minister argued that “middle powers must act together because if you are not at the table, you are on the menu."

Many world leaders and industry titans present at the Switzerland confab responded with a standing ovation.

Trump shot back in his own Davos speech and said Canada “lives because of the United States,” a statement that Carney rejected on Thursday.

"Canada and the United States have built a remarkable partnership in the economy, in security and in rich cultural exchange," Carney said in Quebec. "Canada doesn't live because of the United States. Canada thrives because we are Canadian."

Since then, Trump has dug in, revoking Canada’s invitation to his Board of Peace that he wants to deal with international conflicts and Gaza’s future.

After Carney’s election last year, Trump and Carney shared a congenial tone. "I think the relationship is going to be very strong,” Trump said at the time.

But Trump this month dismissed the mega trade deal between the United States, Canada, and Mexico — up for renegotiation in July — as “ irrelevant .”</description><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 16:26:33 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5SPUZGF6YVLCDLMGJ4GLBZNRDM.jpg?auth=7c09997878ef4d9507ffb2b4b0f8e6b57efe74eb3c909e91df3144e1f5a6682b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Minnesota governor says federal agents involved in shooting in Minneapolis</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/minnesota-governor-says-federal-agents-involved-shooting-minneapolis-2026-01-24/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Federal agents have shot another person in Minneapolis, said Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, who called for an immediate end to the Trump administration's immigration enforcement operations in the state.

That all changed less than two weeks later when Trump announced a special envoy to the vast island, Jeff Landry, who posted on social media that he would help "make Greenland part of the U.S." The appointment and the message stunned Copenhagen and blindsided senior U.S. officials across the administration who work on European and NATO issues, the sources said.

The exclusion of his own diplomats fit the pattern of Trump's foreign policy-making, which has veered wildly on a range of issues and has often been formulated without the national security officials who in other U.S. presidencies have helped steer policy.

Instead, the Trump administration's moves, which included an implied threat to seize Greenland, a plan for new tariffs on U.S. allies and a push to wring concessions from Denmark, which governs Greenland, appeared to be driven solely by Trump and a small group of close aides.

As Reuters reported this week, those aides included Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who proposed the idea of tariffs, and Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and others who tried to steer Trump away from considering military force.

In many ways it's an approach that works for Trump, given his suspicion of the Washington bureaucracy and desire to have his decisions implemented quickly. But the sudden announcements and surprise reversals that flow from it risk lasting damage to relations with key U.S. allies.

When asked to comment on various examples of White House moves that surprised the diplomats involved in cases including Greenland, Ukraine and Syria, White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly said people “who leak to Reuters” were not clued in on sensitive discussions, and that the achievements of Trump’s national security team spoke for themselves.

"The president was elected to implement America First foreign policy, and he has done so more effectively through his top-down approach,” Kelly said.

The danger in this centralized - and personalized - approach became clear over the past few weeks.

Transatlantic fury over Greenland escalated after a January 5 CNN interview by White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller. Asked whether the White House would, after the military operation in Venezuela two days before, rule out military action to acquire Greenland, Miller declined to answer directly.

Trump and officials in his administration appeared to double down on the possibility that the U.S. could use force in Greenland in interviews and on social media.

The comments sowed confusion and alarm in Washington and among U.S. allies.

On Capitol Hill, Democrats and Republicans grew anxious - the administration appeared to be yet again moving forward with a major military operation without consulting Congress first, two sources familiar with the matter said.

Lawmakers phoned Rubio and senior White House officials, laying out their concerns and advising the administration not to move forward, one of those sources said. Some Republican lawmakers also told administration officials that they feared a potential impeachment investigation over any military invasion of Greenland, the sources said.

This week, Trump brought down the tension, withdrawing his threat to impose tariffs on allies supporting Greenland and saying he had reached the outlines of a deal with NATO on the island's future.

Trump said he and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte had "formed the framework of a future deal with respect to Greenland and, in fact, the entire Arctic Region" during talks in Davos, Switzerland.

But military action was never seriously considered, according to two sources close to the administration.

Kori Schake, a former Pentagon and White House official with the American Enterprise Institute, said that with Trump’s threat to seize Greenland by force, the damage has already been done.

"Trump is so erratic with his threats, there's no way to establish that he won't turn right around and do it again. He has made the United States untrustworthy to our closest friends,” Schake said.

Asked for comment, including about Miller's remarks, White House spokeswoman Kelly said: “If this deal goes through ... the United States will be achieving all of its strategic goals with respect to Greenland, at very little cost, forever."

Landry's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for the Danish embassy did not have a comment for this story.

Trump and his backers have insisted the U.S. needs Greenland to fend off threats from Russian and Chinese in the Arctic and that Denmark cannot ensure its security. But the United States already has a base on the island and the ability to expand its presence there under a 1951 treaty with Denmark.

Trump's practice of centralizing foreign policy decisions, relying on trusted aides and effectively sidelining experts, has been a consistent theme of his second term.

It happened several times during negotiations to end Russia's war in Ukraine . Most recently in the fall, a 28-point plan to end the war emerged from meetings between Trump's Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, his son-in-law Jared Kushner and Russian envoy Kirill Dmitriev, who heads the Russian Direct Investment Fund, one of Russia's largest sovereign wealth funds.

Many senior U.S. officials inside the State Department and on the National Security Council, who would typically be in the know about the evolution of such a plan, were not briefed on the process, two people familiar with the plan said at the time.

The approach has also been apparent in Washington's Syria policy.

In May, Trump met with Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa in Saudi Arabia in front of cameras, effectively granting U.S. support to the former Islamist militant, even as some in his administration had advised against it. His decision to lift all U.S. sanctions on Syria caught many U.S. officials off guard.

Since then, U.S. envoy Tom Barrack has been the main implementer of Syria policy with officials at the State Department and other parts of the administration having little room to make policy suggestions, according to three sources familiar with the process.

Communications between Barrack and the subject matter experts in Washington have not been frequent, sources added.

A State Department spokesperson said: "There is tremendous collaboration throughout President Trump’s administration, and there are dedicated public servants dutifully advancing key priorities. Then there are the anonymous sources whining to the press who clearly don’t have the judgment or temperament to implement President Trump’s agenda."</description><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 17:19:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/D4ZSGRAUDNM6TMRVWKC2XUV6EY.jpg?auth=2df80cae061e9b5ab9ad5fb4fe7dbe7b5f91eca9ad5cb6292410026ce84e34bb&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Man shot by US federal agents in Minneapolis immigration crackdown dies</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260124-us-federal-agents-carry-out-another-horrific-shooting-minneapolis-governor</link><description>A 51-year-old man shot Saturday by federal immigration officers in Minneapolis has died, a hospital record obtained by The Associated Press shows.

Trump provoked widespread anger in Britain and across Europe after he said European troops had stayed off the front lines in Afghanistan.

Britain lost 457 service personnel killed in Afghanistan, its deadliest overseas war since the 1950s. For several of the war's most intense years it led the allied campaign in Helmand, Afghanistan's biggest and most violent province, while also fighting as the main U.S. battlefield ally in Iraq.

"The GREAT and very BRAVE soldiers of the United Kingdom will always be with the United States of America!" Trump wrote on Truth Social. "In Afghanistan, 457 died, many were badly injured, and they were among the greatest of all warriors. It’s a bond too strong to ever be broken."

Trump's initial comments had provoked an unusually strong reaction from Starmer who has tended to avoid direct criticism of Trump in public.

The British leader's office issued a statement to say the prime minister had spoken to the president on Saturday about the issue.

"The prime minister raised the brave and heroic British and American soldiers who fought side by side in Afghanistan, many of whom never returned home," the statement said. "We must never forget their sacrifice, he said."

Veterans in Britain and elsewhere have been lining up to condemn the U.S. president's comments to Fox Business Network's "Mornings with Maria" on Thursday in which he said that the United States had "never needed" the transatlantic alliance and accused allies of staying "a little off the front lines" in Afghanistan.

Among them was King Charles' younger son Prince Harry, who served two tours in Afghanistan.

"Those sacrifices deserve to be spoken about truthfully and with respect," he said in a statement.</description><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 19:18:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/MECFYQRYSNI4BOXWKKUNORT3ZA.jpg?auth=db80bd58c78fed507236c908825d66a32474cb80975f2a67d6b5fe5c8d95f20d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UK's Starmer discusses need for enhanced security in Arctic in call with Trump</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/uks-starmer-discusses-need-enhanced-security-arctic-call-with-trump-2026-01-24/</link><description>Jan 24 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Keir Starmer spoke with U.S. President Donald Trump by telephone on Saturday, with the leaders discussing the need for bolstered security in the Arctic, 10 Downing Street said in a statement.

The move paves the way for negotiations aimed at forming a new government, which will need to navigate the delicate balance between U.S. and Iranian influence.

The new government must manage dozens of armed groups that are closer to Iran and answerable more to their own leaders than to the state, while facing growing pressure from Washington to dismantle those militias.

Under the Iraqi constitution, parliament elected a speaker and two deputies on December 29 at its opening session, and must then choose a new president within 30 days. The president will in turn task the largest parliamentary bloc with forming a government.

The Shi'ite political alliance, the Coordination Framework, said in a statement that Maliki was picked "based on his political and administrative experience and his role in managing the state".

Maliki, a senior figure in the Shi'ite Islamist Dawa Party, previously served two terms as Iraq's prime minister from 2006 to 2014, a period marked by sectarian violence, a power struggle with Sunni and Kurdish rivals, and growing tensions with the U.S.

He stepped down after Islamic State seized large parts of the country in 2014 but has remained an influential political player, leading the State of Law coalition and maintaining close ties with Iran-backed factions.

He remains a potent force in Iraqi politics despite longstanding accusations that he fuelled sectarian strife and failed to stop Islamic State from seizing large areas of the country a decade ago.</description><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 19:19:04 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'It's time to start doing something.' Despite risks of violence, Minnesotans step up to take on ICE</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/its-time-start-doing-something-despite-risks-violence-minnesotans-step-up-take-2026-01-24/</link><description>MINNEAPOLIS,  Jan 24  (Reuters) - When Fabiola, a single mother and naturalized U.S. citizen from Latin America, first learned of the fatal shooting of Renee Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent, she said she was heartbroken and terrified.

Then she joined the thousands of other Minnesotans who have volunteered to track ICE agents since Good was killed - despite her fears for herself and her son Asher, who is seven.

“I do feel scared, but at the same time, I know I have to take care of my people too,” she said.

Activists say they have been overwhelmed by new volunteers - despite the potential for violence - since Good was killed by ICE agent Jonathan Ross.

Federal agents on Saturday shot dead a Minneapolis resident, the second person since the Trump administration surged 3,000 immigration enforcement officials to the city.

Fabiola, who has lived in the U.S. for 20 years and owns a construction company, never knew Good. The mother of three was fatally shot when she stopped her car during an immigration enforcement action, just blocks from Fabiola's home.

DHS did not respond to requests for comment on the risks to observers in Minnesota, but officials say federal agents respond with gunfire when they fear for their lives. Kristi Noem, the DHS secretary, and other Trump administration officials have described the protesters and observers as "anti-ICE" and "far left" agitators.

Fabiola and Asher now blow their whistles when they spot immigration agents on their way to school. She taught Asher how to identify federal agents by their uniforms, and made him memorize his grandparents' phone numbers in case she is detained.

Fabiola, who declined to share her last name for fear of retribution, has also started delivering food to people afraid to leave their homes. And she regularly stops by the makeshift memorial to Good.

“She’s got kids, and her kids don’t have their mom now," Fabiola said. "If something happened to me, where is my boy going to go?”

Vice President JD Vance said during a visit to Minneapolis on Thursday that Good was trying to ram Ross with her car. Analyses of bystander video by Reuters and other outlets show Good's wheels were turned away from Ross, and that his legs were clear of the vehicle when he shot her.

At least five organizations offer training on how to monitor ICE actions, warn immigrants of their presence and document the use of force against detainees and protesters. Online training for one of those groups has been hitting maximum capacity of 1,000 within hours, said Kate Wegener, an immigration attorney who leads the trainings.

“We were fearful that attendance would be lower after her death, but it was the complete opposite,” she said.

The sessions typically offer safety tips: stay at least eight feet from federal agents; follow orders given by officers and keep one's distance when driving behind convoys of agents.

Some of the observers are hyper-aware of the risks. Janet, a resident of a Minneapolis suburb who declined to share her last name out of fear of doxxing, said she has written letters to friends and family to be opened if she's killed.

Minnesota authorities at state and local levels have encouraged the observers. Governor Tim Walz has urged residents to take out their phones and document federal agents.

The observers, often identified by their fluorescent green vests and whistles looped around their necks, are now an increasingly common sight along busy roads and residential neighborhoods when the heavily armed, masked federal agents dressed in tactical gear are deployed.

The community pushback has had some effect. Border Patrol Chief Gregory Bovino on Wednesday said the city presented a “difficult operating environment” for enforcement agents.

Organizers compared the level of engagement to the surge of activism following the police killing of George Floyd in 2020.

On a recent day, two new volunteers, a married couple, straddled their bikes next to a busy intersection on the lookout for ICE agents. Snow gathered on their jackets and frost clung to their eyelashes.

“I kind of woke up to what was happening when Renee Good was killed – I knew bad things were happening, but hadn't realized quite how bad it was yet,” said Aaron, who is 41 and works in marketing. He declined to share his last name out of fear of retribution. “And then when that happened, it was like, it's time to start doing something.”

Earlier that day, he said he had adjusted his six-mile run to cover neighborhoods where residents had reported ICE sightings near schools.

Pushing back against immigration enforcement carries risk. The immigration observers have been teargassed and arrested. State authorities said Friday they were compiling data on arrests but it was not immediately available.

For Patty O’Keefe, a 36-year-old non-profit worker, those risks underline the importance of the observers.

"They wouldn't be working so hard to intimidate us and utilizing all those resources if we weren't actually being successful in gumming up the works of their operation or slowing them down,” O’Keefe said.

Earlier this month, as she was following ICE agents in her car, she said five federal agents shattered her car window, handcuffed her, and put her in an unmarked SUV. She said ICE agents photographed her, insulted her and held her for eight hours in a Minneapolis detention center before she was released without charge.

DHS did not respond to a request for comment on O'Keefe's account of the incident, and Reuters was unable to determine independently what occurred.

She said she now struggles with anxiety - but will continue volunteering.

"I'm just stubborn, and I'm not wanting to give in to the fear."

Many residents speak about Good with a sense of reverence, describing her as an inspiration.

On the street where she was killed, dozens of people defied dangerously cold weather to add to the mounds of bouquets, stuffed animals and electric candles glowing through the snow at a makeshift memorial.

“She gave her life for us,” Fabiola said. “Her soul is in heaven, and she protects us.”</description><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 20:23:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/I2UR6TS3MBOHRI6WBNTNFAVI74.jpg?auth=2e291bcf066664ff5626da28051edbefa0082be97fcd169f5c9c7d7a9010e785&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>World Health Organization says it regrets US decision to withdraw</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/world-health-organization-says-it-regrets-us-decision-withdraw-2026-01-24/</link><description>Jan 24 (Reuters) - The World Health Organization (WHO) said it regrets that the U.S. has officially withdrawn from the U.N. health agency and it hopes Washington returns to active participation in the future.

The U.S. left the organization on Thursday after a year of warnings that doing so would hurt public health in the U.S. and globally.

President Donald Trump's administration has criticized the way the WHO handled the COVID-19 pandemic. Trump has said the WHO had failed to act independently from the "inappropriate political influence of WHO member states" and that the agency required "unfairly onerous payments" from the U.S. that were disproportionate to the sums provided by other, larger countries, such as China.

WHO said it stands by its response to the "unprecedented global health crisis" brought about by the pandemic, adding that "the systems we developed and managed before, during and after the emergency phase of the pandemic, and which run 24/7, have contributed to keeping all countries safe, including the U.S."</description><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 21:40:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HY5W5LMNKJKL3JSZRQT6Q6GGFI.jpg?auth=291af0011a53c63a354cce6dbdd695b3074fc21d4110ade726c728a1f1aa4e93&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump threatens 100% tariffs on Canadian goods over pending China trade deal</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260124-trump-threatens-100-tariffs-on-canadian-goods-over-pending-china-trade-deal</link><description>US President Donald Trump on Saturday warned Canada that if it concludes a trade deal with China , he will impose a 100 percent tariff on all goods coming over the border.

Relations between the United States and its northern neighbour have been rocky since Trump returned to the White House a year ago, with spats over trade and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney decrying a "rupture" in the US-led global order.

During a visit to Beijing last week , Carney hailed a "new strategic partnership" with China that resulted in a "preliminary but landmark trade agreement" to reduce tariffs – but Trump warned of serious consequences should that deal be realised.

If Carney "thinks he is going to make Canada a 'Drop Off Port' for China to send goods and products into the United States, he is sorely mistaken," Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.

"China will eat Canada alive, completely devour it, including the destruction of their businesses, social fabric, and general way of life," he said.

"If Canada makes a deal with China, it will immediately be hit with a 100% Tariff against all Canadian goods and products coming into the USA ."

Trump insulted Carney by calling him "Governor" – a swipe referring to the US president's repeated insistence that Canada should be the 51st US state.

Trump this week posted an image on social media of a map with Canada – as well as Greenland and Venezuela -- covered by the American flag.

Canada's minister responsible for trade with the United States, Dominic LeBlanc, pushed back against Trump's latest threat.

"There is no pursuit of a free trade deal with China. What was achieved was resolution on several important tariff issues," he wrote on X.

The two leaders have sharpened their rhetorical knives in recent days, beginning with Carney's speech on Tuesday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, where he earned a standing ovation for his frank assessment of a "rupture" in the US-led global order.

His comment was widely viewed as a reference to Trump's disruptive influence on international affairs, although Carney did not mention the US leader by name.

Trump fired back at Carney a day later in his own speech, and then withdrew an invitation for the Canadian prime minister to join his "Board of Peace" – his self-styled body for resolving global conflict.

Initially designed to oversee the situation in postwar Gaza, the body appears now to have a far wider scope, sparking concerns that Trump wants to create a rival to the United Nations.

"Canada lives because of the United States. Remember that, Mark, the next time you make your statements," Trump said.

Carney shot back on Thursday: "Canada doesn't live because of the United States. Canada thrives because we are Canadian." He nevertheless acknowledged the "remarkable partnership" between the two nations.

Canada heavily relies on trade with the United States, the destination for more than three-quarters of Canadian exports.

Key Canadian sectors like auto, aluminium and steel have been hit hard by Trump's global sectoral tariffs, but the levies' impacts have been muted by the president's broad adherence to an existing North American free trade agreement.

Negotiations on revising that deal are set for early this year, and Trump has repeatedly insisted the United States doesn't need access to any Canadian products – which would have sweeping consequences for its northern neighbour.

Matthew Holmes, executive vice president of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, said in a statement that he hoped the two governments would "come to a better understanding quickly that can alleviate further concerns for businesses."

The village is near the town of Vovchansk, close to the Ukraine-Russia border, where Russian forces launched an incursion in May 2024.

Moscow's troops have in recent months tried to extend gains in the area despite Ukrainian resistance.

The General Staff of Ukraine's military, in a report late on Saturday, said Russian forces had launched six attacks on an area including Starytsya. But it made no acknowledgement that the village had changed hands.

Ukraine's DeepState military blog, which uses open-source reports to track the positions of both armies, made no mention of the village in a report on Friday, but said Russian forces "are continuing their pressure in the Vovchansk area."

The Russian Defence Ministry report said Moscow's troops had also carried out a massive strike overnight on Ukrainian long-range drone sites and energy facilities.

Reuters could not independently verify the battlefield reports.

Russian forces have been engaged in a slow drive westward through southeastern Ukraine , announcing the capture of new villages several times a week.

Most of its gains have been in the Donetsk region, but Russian forces have also applied pressure to Ukrainian defences in the Kharkiv region and in the Zaporizhzhia region to the south, which they partially occupy.</description><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 22:47:27 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Appeals court rejects Justice Department’s push to charge more people over Minnesota church demonstration</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/appeals-court-rejects-justice-departments-push-charge-more-people-over-minnesota-2026-01-24/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 24 (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court rejected the Justice Department's bid to charge five more people accused of disrupting a Minnesota church service this month, according to court documents made public on Saturday, revealing the lengths the Trump administration has gone to prosecute those involved in the demonstration.

The ruling by the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is the latest legal setback for the Justice Department as it pursues demonstrators who interrupted a service on Sunday in protest of a pastor's apparent connection to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. One judge involved in the case said the department's request appeared to be unprecedented.

A federal magistrate judge this week declined to approve arrest warrants for five proposed defendants, including former CNN anchor Don Lemon, who recorded the demonstration, citing a lack of evidence. The judge approved charges for three alleged leaders of the demonstration, but struck a proposed charge accusing them of physically obstructing a house of worship.

The case has drawn substantial attention as the Trump administration pursues a sweeping immigration crackdown in the state and administration officials have vowed to protect Christian services.

A Justice Department spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The three defendants — activists Nekima Levy Armstrong, Chauntyll Louisa Allen and William Kelly — were each charged with conspiracy against rights for allegedly intimidating and harassing parishioners, according to a criminal complaint. They have accused the Trump administration of retaliation over their protest.

The Justice Department first asked the chief trial judge and later the appeals court to immediately intervene and approve warrants for the five other proposed defendants, citing a risk of similar church disruptions.

The chief U.S. District Court judge in Minnesota, Patrick Schiltz, described the Justice Department's request as "unheard of in our district" and any other under the 8th Circuit, which covers seven U.S. states, according to a letter made public on Saturday.

All three judges on the 8th Circuit panel agreed not to intervene. One judge, Leonard Steven Grasz, wrote that he believed prosecutors had shown enough evidence to justify charges against the other proposed defendants, but that prosecutors have ways to get them approved other than through the appeals court.

The Justice Department can still ask a grand jury to approve charges against the demonstrators or seek to present additional evidence to the magistrate judge.</description><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 23:22:31 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CECJ53VF3FOLPAD36EQ2BS36C4.jpg?auth=ccbbf6a01a72c88cb50f4453d481a6397e2ae6949aaaa95e24f715e33dd3f9ad&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Canada's Carney to visit Australia in March</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/canadas-carney-visit-australia-march-2026-01-24/</link><description>SYDNEY, Jan 25 (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney will visit Australia in March, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on Sunday, as he backed a speech by his Canadian counterpart decrying powerful nations using economic integration as weapons and tariffs as leverage.

"My friend Mark Carney will visit Australia with an address to the parliament in March," Albanese said in remarks on Australian Broadcasting Corp television.

Albanese said he concurred with Carney's well-received Davos address that called on nations to accept the end of a rules-based global order and pointed to Canada as an example of how "middle powers" might act together to avoid being victimised by American hegemony.

"I agree with him," Albanese said, referring to the speech that drew criticism from U.S. President Donald Trump.

Carney's visit to Australia will come after the two allies in October deepened their relationship, signing an agreement to promote and strengthen cooperation and trade on critical minerals.</description><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 23:41:42 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BPPHPECAGNNQDABZ6SGBKWA6BI.jpg?auth=1e60f610a63ddb9fc7613589da382266d6205c0e42e5b92ce6b8a8767033349f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Final phase of Myanmar's election underway, military-backed party set to win</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/final-phase-myanmars-election-underway-military-backed-party-set-win-2026-01-25/</link><description>Jan 25 (Reuters) - Polling stations in Myanmar opened on Sunday for the final round of a general election in the war-torn country, with a military-backed party set to win and the junta chief expected to take on a political role after the widely criticised election.

The previous two phases of the election - held on December 28 and January 11 - have been marked by low voter turnout of around 55%, well below the turnout of about 70% recorded in Myanmar's 2020 and 2015 general elections.

Voters in 60 townships will cast their ballots, including in the major cities of Yangon and Mandalay, amid a civil war triggered by a coup that brought the military to power.

Although the United Nations, some Western governments and rights groups have derided the polls as a sham exercise to perpetuate the military's hold, the ruling junta has vowed it will transfer power to a new government, likely in April.

The military took control of the impoverished Southeast Asian nation in a dawn coup on February 1, 2021, ousting an elected civilian government led by Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi.

The 80-year-old politician remains in detention and, like several other opposition groups, her National League for Democracy has been dissolved by the junta, tilting the political playing field in favour of the military-backed party that is leading the polls.

Malaysia, which last year chaired the 11-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations, on Tuesday said the bloc had rejected an offer from Myanmar to send poll observers and would not endorse the election.

"Rather than resolving a crisis now in its fifth year, the vote is more likely to reinforce the military's hold on power, with little prospect of restoring domestic legitimacy or improving the country's standing with Western partners," said Kaho Yu, Principal Asia Analyst at risk intelligence company Verisk Maplecroft.

Fighting has continued through the election campaign and earlier voting in many parts of Myanmar, including air strikes around civilian areas in the border states of Rakhine, Shan and Kayin.

So far, the military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party has secured 193 out of 209 seats in the lower house and 52 out of 78 seats in the upper house, according to the election commission, leaving the party in a dominant position.

The USDP, which was formed in 2010 and governed the country for five years following the end of a previous military government, is chaired by a retired brigadier general and packed with other former high-ranking officers.

Myanmar's military, which has ruled the country for five of the past six decades, does not appear to have any real intention of withdrawing from its political leadership role.

"Regardless of how successive governments may change over time, Tatmadaw remains a steadfast institution that will continue to shoulder the responsibilities of national defence and security," said junta leader Min Aung Hlaing last week, referring to the Burmese term for the military.

The 69-year-old general has indicated he is considering appointing a successor as armed forces chief and will likely move into a fully political role, Reuters has reported .

While the junta has portrayed the election as a success despite the low turnout , residents of Myanmar's biggest cities have told Reuters of an atmosphere of fear, where many felt compelled to vote to avoid potential arrest or retribution.

The military has insisted the election is free of coercion and has public backing.

On the back of an election protection law , the junta has charged over 400 people for criticising and obstructing the election process, according to state media.</description><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 01:56:52 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WPXMPAPVQ5NOXJKWR2XSV7L5PU.jpg?auth=18a6d3382c04958b5a9fdc860fab2be843aeef4647a730840ab1f5caed2d1a9d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Deaths mount as Trump immigration push intensifies</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/deaths-mount-trump-immigration-push-intensifies-2026-01-25/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 24 (Reuters) - The fatal shooting of a man in Minneapolis on Saturday added to a mounting death toll in U.S. President Donald Trump’s intensifying immigration push this month, increasing scrutiny on the crackdown as backlash builds.

The incident was one of five shootings in January involving federal agents conducting immigration enforcement, including the fatal shooting of Minnesota woman Renee Good . At least six immigrants have died this month in federal immigration detention, an unusually rapid pace.

The Trump administration is dramatically ramping up immigration enforcement with $170 billion budgeted for immigration agencies through September 2029, a historic sum.

Minneapolis has become the focus of the Republican president’s crackdown this month, with some 3,000 agents deployed. Thousands of protesters took to the streets despite sub-zero temperatures on Friday to voice opposition to Trump’s enforcement and demand he withdraw the agents, which Minnesota officials have called an occupation.

Trump has argued the militarized operations are necessary to remove criminals from the U.S., but many of those arrested were picked up solely for possible civil immigration violations - the legal equivalent to a traffic violation.

Here is a closer look at the deaths from federal immigration enforcement and the often-conflicting accounts of what happened in each case.

The man killed in Minneapolis on Saturday was a U.S. citizen, identified in news reports as Alex Pretti, 37, a registered nurse and lawfully permitted gun owner.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said a Border Patrol agent fired at the man, who resisted agents' attempts to disarm him, but local leaders challenged that account.

In bystander videos verified by Reuters, agents are seen pepper spraying Pretti and other protesters as he films them with his cellphone. No weapon is visible. After multiple agents wrestle him to the ground, one draws his weapon and multiple shots can be heard.

The shooting followed Good’s death earlier this month, when U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer Jonathan Ross fired into her vehicle.

Within hours of that shooting, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem called Good a “domestic terrorist” who tried to ram the ICE officer with her car, although the department has not presented evidence of a link to terrorism. Video shows Ross fired as Good's car moved past him .

Federal agents have been involved in three other shootings this month during immigration actions.

The day after Good’s death, a U.S. Border Patrol agent shot and wounded a Venezuelan man and woman in Portland, Oregon, after what DHS called “a targeted vehicle stop.”

DHS said the driver, Venezuelan immigrant Luis Nino-Moncada, attempted to run over the agents before the agent fired, wounding Nino-Moncada and his passenger, a Venezuelan woman.

The Justice Department later charged Nino-Moncada with assaulting an officer. His passenger, Yorlenys Zambrano-Contreras, pleaded guilty this week to entering the U.S. illegally in 2023.

On January 15, an ICE agent shot Julio Cesar Sosa-Celis in the leg in Minneapolis after DHS said he fled authorities.

DHS said at the time that Sosa-Celis, a Venezuelan immigrant, and two other men hit an officer with a snow shovel and broom handle, prompting the shooting.

Court documents unsealed this week , opens new tab told a different story. An FBI affidavit said the ICE officers had scanned a license plate registered with a different person suspected of an immigration violation, leading them to chase the wrong person before the alleged assault and shooting.

At least six people have died in ICE detention centers since the start of 2026, following at least 30 deaths in ICE custody last year, a two-decade high.

The death of Cuban immigrant Geraldo Lunas Campos has received the most scrutiny after federal authorities provided shifting accounts of what happened.

ICE initially said Lunas died on January 3 at a Trump-era detention camp on the grounds of a U.S. military base in Texas after experiencing "medical distress."

After the Washington Post reported , opens new tab the death would likely be classified as a homicide by the El Paso County medical examiner, DHS issued a new statement saying Lunas tried to commit suicide and then resisted security officers and died.

The medical examiner released a report this week that found the death was a homicide due to "asphyxia due to neck and torso compression," the Post reported.

On January 14, two other immigrant detainees died: a Nicaraguan man found unresponsive in the military base site, called East Camp Montana, and a Mexican man found unresponsive in a Georgia detention center, according to ICE.

Both deaths remain under investigation, but ICE said the Nicaraguan man, Victor Manuel Diaz, was presumed to have committed suicide.

The other deaths occurred in Houston, Philadelphia, and Indio, California, ICE said.

Trump increased immigration detention to record levels, with 69,000 held as of early January, according to ICE statistics. Some 43% of the detainees picked up by ICE had no criminal charge or conviction, the figures showed.</description><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 01:57:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/FXUF2P2C5NJOJHI4574VTLYC2E.jpg?auth=ea4d0e28a1ca93b35125b914f3c4db22b59ea84bf961b23d39ea8fec2d9ec241&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Indonesia resumes search for 80 after landslide kills 10 in West Java</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/indonesia-resumes-search-80-after-landslide-kills-10-west-java-2026-01-25/</link><description>WEST BANDUNG, Indonesia, Jan 25 (Reuters) - Indonesian authorities resumed search-and-rescue efforts for 80 people missing after a landslide killed 10 in a residential area of West Java province.

The landslide early on Saturday was triggered by heavy rains starting the day before, which the weather agency warned could continue for a week in the province and several other regions.

Resident Dedi Kurniawan, 36, said it was the first big landslide he had witnessed in Pasir Langu village in a hilly area of the province about 100 km (60 miles) southeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.

"Sometimes we have only small floods from the nearest river, but this time (the landslide) came from the forest," he told Reuters.

Rescuers were hampered on Saturday as unstable terrain and rains hindered them from deploying heavy machinery, Kompas TV reported, citing authorities.

There were multiple reports of floods in West Java, including Jakarta. The floods have caused residents in heavily impacted areas to evacuate to higher ground or unaffected places.

The landslide occurred two months after cyclone-induced floods and landslides on the island of Sumatra killed 1,200 people, destroyed homes and displaced over a million residents.</description><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 03:57:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ZFKC462VLJL65NEBVHRQCMQDLA.jpg?auth=dc92301e5860b34a6aa4b81667fb8a8adc34812f332ac80a970d5007959b5edb&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Australian defence department chief to replace Kevin Rudd as US ambassador</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/australian-defence-department-chief-replace-kevin-rudd-us-ambassador-2026-01-25/</link><description>SYDNEY, Jan 25 (Reuters) - Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on Sunday named the country's defence department chief as the next ambassador to the U.S., after Kevin Rudd said he would step down following criticism from U.S. President Donald Trump.

"Mr Moriarty is I think an outstanding Australian public servant," Albanese said in remarks on Australian Broadcasting Corporation television.

Rudd, a former prime minister who made critical comments about Trump before becoming ambassador, said earlier this month that he would leave the role a year earlier than expected, finishing his posting in March. In October, Trump criticised Rudd during an event at the White House saying: "I don’t like you either, and I probably never will."

Six people, including two teenagers, are presumed dead after heavy rains triggered Thursday's landslide at Mount Maunganui on the island's east coast, bringing down soil and rubble at the site in the city of Tauranga, crowded with families on summer holidays.

Authorities have been working to identify the victims after human remains were found at the site on Saturday.

But a crack found at the site prompted recovery work to cease for the day on Sunday, said police Superintendent Tim Anderson.

"As a result of that, we've had to pull all our staff out," Anderson told reporters at Mount Maunganui, adding, "We've had to do that for the safety of everyone concerned."

He did not specify when work would resume, saying the authorities were taking it "day by day at the moment".

Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said on Saturday it was "devastating to receive the news we have all been dreading", after the rescue operation shifted to recovery.

"To the families who have lost loved ones - every New Zealander is grieving with you," Luxon posted on X.

The heavy rain this week unleashed another landslide in the neighbouring suburb of Papamoa, killing two.</description><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 04:55:32 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7Z3TIVJBWVNBJKBMTK6L3DDRHU.jpg?auth=3a3a3eaeee171dfd80b7b3c1371b500dcad81dd6402d60b8237ea2d0e99223c2&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>EU set to elevate ties with Vietnam amid trade disruptions, source says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/eu-set-elevate-ties-with-vietnam-amid-trade-disruptions-source-says-2026-01-25/</link><description>HANOI, Jan 25 (Reuters) - The European Union and Vietnam will elevate ties during a visit to Hanoi by the European Council President Antonio Costa on Thursday, an EU official said, as both sides seek to expand international partnerships amid disruptions from U.S. tariffs.

The visit comes on the heels of To Lam's re-appointment as Vietnam's top official, potentially making Costa the first leader of a major power to meet Lam since the ruling Communist Party on Friday appointed him for a new term as general secretary.

The elevation of ties to Vietnam's highest level has been planned for months and was delayed largely because of schedule complications, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymlty.

It would place the EU on the same tier as China, the U.S. and Russia among others, further expanding Vietnam's advanced partnerships, in line with the country's strategy of balancing big powers.

The European Council declined to comment. Vietnam's government did not respond to a request for comment.

These upgrades are largely symbolic, as they merely entail more frequent high-level meetings and usually no binding agreements.

Vietnam's relations with the United States worsened last year after the Trump administration imposed tariffs, despite the upgrade of bilateral ties inked by former president Joe Biden during a visit to Hanoi in late 2023.

The upgrade with the EU is expected to generate more cooperation in multiple fields, including research, technology, energy and critical minerals, according to a draft joint statement, the official said. Vietnam has significant but often little exploited deposits of rare earths, gallium and tungsten.

The Southeast Asian trade-reliant nation is a major link in global supply chains, especially for electronics, clothing and footwear. It has a string of free trade agreements with multiple partners, including with the European Union.

The EU has repeatedly criticised Vietnam's implementation of the free trade agreement, which has boosted Vietnam's surplus with the 27-nation bloc since it came into force in 2020. The EU deficit with Hanoi stood at 42.5 billion euros ($50.26 billion) in 2024.

EU officials accuse Hanoi of hampering EU imports with multiple non-tariff barriers, but Brussels has so far taken limited action to address the situation.

Also, facing tariffs from the United States, the EU has prioritised improving ties with economic partners and expanding trade agreements, including recently with South American nations of the Mercosur bloc.

The nomination of the former three-time conservative party lawmaker was initially interpreted as an attempt by the liberal president to integrate the nation's politics, but Lee Hye-hoon has been facing pressure to step down amid allegations of abusive remarks to colleagues and controversial property investments.

"Sick," Honnold said as he got to the top spire of Taiwan's tallest building after his 91-minute "free solo" ascent, which was organised and broadcast live by Netflix (NFLX.O) , opens new tab .

"What a beautiful way to see Taipei," he told reporters after his mission, which was postponed by a day due to wet weather.

The 508-metre (1,667-foot) Taipei 101, which dominates the city's skyline and is a major tourist attraction, was the tallest building in the world from 2004 to 2010, a crown currently held by the Burj Khalifa in Dubai.

The climb, with no safety equipment, took place with the full support and permission of Taipei 101 and the city government.

Honnold said he had once thought of climbing the structure without permission.

"But then out of respect for the building and respect for all the people on the team who'd allowed me access to look at it, I was like, well obviously I'm not going to poach this, I'm going to respect the people and just see if it ever comes together."

Executive Producer James Smith said it was rare for a building to trust a climber and allow such an event to take place, calling Taipei 101 "a real icon of this country".

Taiwanese politicians took to social media to thank Honnold and Netflix for putting Taiwan - more accustomed to featuring in global headlines for its semiconductor prowess or Chinese military threats - in the international spotlight with such a different perspective.

"Congratulations to the brave, fearless Alex for completing the challenge," President Lai Ching-te wrote on his Facebook page.

"Through Netflix's live broadcast cameras, the world didn't just see Taipei 101 - it also saw the warmth and passion of the Taiwanese people, and the beautiful hills and scenery of this land," he added.

This is not the first time Taipei 101 has been scaled.

In 2004, French climber Alain Robert, dubbed "Spiderman" for his ropeless ascents of some of the world's highest skyscrapers, climbed the building, though did so with a safety rope in a time of four hours.</description><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 06:33:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CAH2QDGNVRJA5AV3JLVQYVUWYU.jpg?auth=03fcbebb47db2dd8fd400404a9e085b732e6a4cbc05e22ef7b8bc2b987744e99&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Australian PM says Trump's comments on NATO troops 'completely unacceptable'</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260125-australian-pm-says-trump-s-comments-nato-troops-completely-unacceptable</link><description>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on Sunday that comments from US President Donald Trump lamenting the efforts of non-US troops in Afghanistan were "completely unacceptable".

Trump said in a Fox News interview that NATO sent "some troops" but "stayed a little back, a little off the front lines".

Trump appeared to be partially walking back his remarks on Saturday amid growing outrage from European and now Australian allies.

Speaking on the ABC's Insiders programme on Sunday morning, Albanese said Australian families of fallen soldiers would be "hurting" as a result of Trump's comments.

"Those 47 Australian families who will be hurting by these comments, they deserve our absolute respect, our admiration," Albanese said.

"The bravery that was shown by 40,000 Australians (who) served in Afghanistan, they were certainly on the frontlines in order to, along with our other allies, defend democracy and freedom and to defend our national interests," he added.

"They deserve our respect."

On Saturday, a day after British Prime Minister Keir Starmer condemned Trump's remarks as "appalling", Trump appeared to change his position -- at least as far as British troops were concerned.

"The GREAT and very BRAVE soldiers of the United Kingdom will always be with the United States of America!" Trump said on his Truth Social platform.

"In Afghanistan, 457 died, many were badly injured, and they were among the greatest of all warriors. It's a bond too strong to ever be broken."

Albanese referenced Trump's later comments, suggesting he also appreciated the Australian effort in Afghanistan.

"I think President Trump's comments overnight indicate a very different position. He's acknowledged the contribution," Albanese told the ABC, but added that Trump's previous comments were "entirely not appropriate. Completely unacceptable".

Albanese also announced Australia's next Ambassador to the United States, recommending Greg Moriarty for the job.

Earlier this month, Australia announced its ambassador to the United States, Kevin Rudd , would leave after a three-year tenure overshadowed by Trump's verdict on him: "I don't like you either."

Former Australian prime minister Rudd, who departs his post on March 31 to become president of the Asia Society think tank in New York , had sharply criticised Trump while he was out of office.

Trump expressed disdain for Rudd during a televised US-Australia meeting at the White House in October last year, prompting some Australian opposition calls for his posting to be ended.

Albanese said Moriarty was an "outstanding Australian public servant", and he had consulted with the Trump administration on his selection.</description><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 07:24:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/35947ffc-f9b9-11f0-96d7-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26003621877327.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>New wave of protests in Minneapolis after man is killed by federal agents</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260125-protesters-in-minneapolis-demand-ice-leave-after-man-is-killed-by-federal-agents</link><description>The killing of a US citizen by federal immigration agents on Saturday -- the second in Minneapolis this month -- sparked new protests and impassioned demands by local leaders for the Trump administration to end its operation in the city.

Federal agents shot dead Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old ICU nurse, while scuffling with him on an icy roadway, less than three weeks after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer shot and killed Renee Good, also 37, in her car.

The Trump administration quickly claimed, as it did after Good's death, that Pretti had intended to harm the federal agents, even as video of the incident appeared to contradict their account.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) pointed to a pistol and ammunition it said was discovered on Pretti.

"He was there to perpetuate violence," Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem told a briefing, while White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller referred to Pretti as an "assassin," in a post amplified on X by Vice President JD Vance .

However, as with Good's death, cell phone footage of the incident raised serious questions about the federal government's description of the incident.

Video aired widely by US media, which AFP has not verified, shows Pretti filming agents in the snow-lined street and directing traffic.

After an agent shoves a woman protester to the ground on the sidewalk, Pretti steps in between them and is sprayed in the face by a chemical irritant.

The agent then pulls Pretti to the ground and several officers struggle to detain him on the icy roadway.

Seconds later, as an officer apparently discovers and pulls a gun from Pretti's pants, agents open fire, also shooting his motionless body several times from a distance.

Pretti's parents in a statement circulated by US media called him a "kindhearted soul" and accused the Trump administration of telling "sickening lies" about their son.

Minnesota Governor Tim Walz called the shooting "horrific" and demanded state authorities lead the investigation.

"The federal government cannot be trusted to lead this investigation. The state will handle it, period," Walz told a news conference.

Federal authorities controversially blocked local investigators from jointly probing Good's death.

One Senate Republican on Saturday called for a joint investigation into the shooting.

"The events in Minneapolis are incredibly disturbing. The credibility of ICE and DHS are at stake," Senator Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican, wrote on X.

"There must be a full joint federal and state investigation. We can trust the American people with the truth."

Republican President Donald Trump meanwhile ratcheted up his war of words with Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, accusing the Democratic leaders of "inciting insurrection" with their rhetoric.

Trump had previously threatened to send troops to Minnesota by invoking the Insurrection Act.

As the president presses a sweeping campaign to deport undocumented migrants, thousands of ICE agents have been deployed to the Democratic-led city.

Public outrage was also rekindled earlier this week by the detention of a five-year-old boy as federal agents sought to arrest his father.

Frey at a news conference urged Trump to end the federal immigration operation, which has sparked sometimes violent demonstrations.

"This is a moment to act like a leader. Put Minneapolis, put America first in this moment -- let's achieve peace. Let's end this operation."

Police Chief Brian O'Hara said an "incredibly volatile scene" erupted after the shooting as protesters arrived, with local officials unable to secure the scene for investigation.

O'Hara told a later briefing that Minnesota National Guard troops would help secure a vehicle exclusion zone set up around the site.

Local resident Maria, 56, told AFP the situation in the city was "escalating."

"They're attacking and terrorizing our communities right now."

Hundreds of protesters gathered in a park in Minneapolis Saturday evening, despite bitterly cold temperatures in the northern US city.

The shooting comes a day after tens of thousands of people braved the cold to gather in downtown Minneapolis to voice opposition to the federal operation.

O'Hara said police believed the victim did not have any serious criminal background and was a "lawful gun owner with a permit to carry."

Some gun rights advocates -- often staunch supporters of the president -- have raised concerns after the Trump administration quickly linked Pretti's legal gun possession to an intent to do mass harm.

The Gun Owners of America (GOA) condemned a statement by Bill Essayli, a federal prosecutor in California , who had said on X: "If you approach law enforcement with a gun, there is a high likelihood they will be legally justified in shooting you."

"The Second Amendment protects Americans' right to bear arms while protesting -- a right the federal government must not infringe upon," GOA said in a statement.</description><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 07:24:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/c2016ade-f970-11f0-9313-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/0a20b64ac008f7acc606846637d05c3daf3978d9.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Crowds flock to Tokyo zoo to see pandas before they leave for China</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/crowds-flock-tokyo-zoo-see-pandas-before-they-leave-china-2026-01-25/</link><description>TOKYO, Jan 25 (Reuters) - Panda fans flocked to the Ueno Zoo in Tokyo on Sunday to say goodbye to its star attractions - two giant pandas, who will be sent back to China at the end of the month.

The departure of four-year-old twins Xiao Xiao and Lei Lei leaves Japan panda-less for the first time since 1972, prompting thousands to apply for lottery-assigned tickets to say goodbye.

"I've been coming since the parents of Xiao Xiao and Lei Lei were here," said 54-year-old finance-sector worker Machiko Seki. "It feels like one family's story is coming to an end."

While their move to China has been planned for some time, the pandas' coming absence has been viewed as a reflection of deteriorating China-Japan relations in recent months.

In November, Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said a hypothetical Chinese attack on Taiwan could bring about a Japanese military response. That triggered a furious response from Beijing, which claims sovereignty over the democratically-governed island.

Political tensions were not the focus of many zoo-goers on Sunday, when visitors were allowed one-minute windows to see the bears.

"The pandas have given me so much - energy, courage, healing," Seki said. "I wanted to come today to express my gratitude."

Even people who did not win tickets made the journey.

"Today, I didn't win the lottery for the panda viewing, so I can't see the pandas in person," said 49-year-old housewife Akiko Kawakami.

"I came here today because I wanted to breathe the same air as the pandas."</description><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 07:42:54 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/C3EQF45QVRISDDNHZTY3R6URG4.jpg?auth=aa5438621bb483c52d30e8ae334deaa4fb75030dfafe1082c6c5dedb0116c2c9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US storm leaves 230,000 without power, forces thousands of flight cancellations</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/thousands-flights-canceled-ahead-us-winter-storm-2026-01-24/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 25 (Reuters) - More than 4,000 flights were canceled in the U.S. on Saturday ahead of a monster winter storm that had already cut power to more than 230,000 customers as far west as Texas and threatened to paralyze eastern states with heavy snowfall.

Forecasters said snow, sleet, freezing rain and dangerously frigid temperatures would sweep the eastern two-thirds of the nation on Sunday and into the week.

Calling the storms "historic," President Donald Trump on Saturday approved federal emergency disaster declarations in South Carolina, Virginia, Tennessee, Georgia, North Carolina, Maryland, Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Indiana, and West Virginia.

"We will continue to monitor, and stay in touch with all States in the path of this storm. Stay Safe, and Stay Warm," Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social.

Seventeen states and the District of Columbia have declared weather emergencies, the Department of Homeland Security said.

"We do have tens of thousands of people in affected states in the South that have lost power," DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said on Saturday. "We have utility crews that are working to restore that as quick as possible."

The number of outages continued to rise. As of 2:44 a.m. EST (0744 GMT) on Sunday, some 230,000 U.S. customers had no electricity, the bulk of them in Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas, Tennessee and New Mexico, according to PowerOutage.com.

The Department of Energy on Saturday issued an emergency order authorizing the Electric Reliability Council of Texas to deploy backup generation resources at data centers and other major facilities, aiming to limit blackouts in the state.

On Sunday, the DOE issued an emergency order to authorize grid operator PJM Interconnection to run "specified resources" in the mid-Atlantic region, regardless of limits due to state laws or environmental permits.

The National Weather Service warned of an unusually expansive and long-duration winter storm that would bring widespread, heavy ice accumulation in the Southeast, where "crippling to locally catastrophic impacts" can be expected.

Weather service forecasters predicted record cold temperatures and dangerously cold wind chills descending further into the Great Plains region by Monday.

As of 10:21 p.m. EST, more than 4,000 U.S. flights scheduled for Saturday had been canceled, according to flight tracking website FlightAware. More than 9,400 U.S. flights originally set for Sunday also have been canceled.

Major U.S. airlines warned passengers to stay alert for abrupt flight changes and cancellations.

On Saturday, Delta Air Lines (DAL.N) , opens new tab continued to adjust its schedule and made additional cancellations in the morning for Atlanta and along the East Coast, including in Boston and New York City.

It added it was relocating experts from cold-weather hubs to support de-icing and baggage teams at several southern airports.

JetBlue (JBLU.O) , opens new tab said that as of Saturday morning it had canceled about 1,000 flights through Monday.

United Airlines (UAL.O) , opens new tab said its weather preparations included proactively canceling some flights in places with the worst weather.

U.S. electric grid operators on Saturday stepped up precautions to avoid rotating blackouts.

Dominion Energy (D.N) , opens new tab , whose Virginia operations include the largest collection of data centers in the world, said if its ice forecast held, the winter event could be among the largest to affect the company.

Noem, at a news conference about U.S. government preparations for the storm, warned Americans to take precautions.

"It’s going to be very, very cold," Noem said. "So we'd encourage everybody to stock up on fuel, stock up on food, and we will get through this together."</description><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 08:29:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/YSDVGYA2JJME5HXIJY5NQLLH5E.jpg?auth=a5d51ca46f69026b70d2ee2e8703fcfe3f08c7a65905d387c89c25a8a84cbed3&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Around 1,700 Kyiv apartment blocks still without heating after Russian strike</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/around-1700-kyiv-apartment-blocks-still-without-heating-after-russian-strike-2026-01-25/</link><description>KYIV, Jan 25 (Reuters) - Around 1,700 apartment buildings in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv were still without heating following a Russian missile and drone attack earlier this week, Kyiv Mayor Vitalii Klitschko said on Sunday.

Moscow has sharply intensified bombardments of Ukraine's energy system since it invaded its neighbour in 2022.

Russia launched a vast attack on Ukraine's energy system on Saturday, rocking Kyiv with explosions overnight, leaving 1.2 million properties without power countrywide during sub-zero winter temperatures.

"Russia’s main targets right now are our energy sector, critical infrastructure, and residential buildings," Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on X.

This week alone, he said Russia had launched more than 1,700 attack drones, over 1,380 guided aerial bombs and 69 missiles on Ukraine.

Every massive attack by Russia could have a devastating impact, said Zelenskiy, who on Sunday visited Lithuania.

"We are working with every leader to strengthen Ukraine. Everyone must clearly understand the threat coming from Russia," he said.

Deputy Prime Minister Oleksiy Kuleba said on Saturday that more than 3,200 of Kyiv's buildings were without heating late that evening, down from 6,000 in the morning.

"Since yesterday evening, utility workers and energy companies have restored heat supply to more than 1,600 buildings. They are continuing to work to restore services to the homes of Kyiv residents," Klitschko said on Telegram.

The large-scale attack on the Ukrainian capital took place just as Ukrainian, Russian and American negotiators were discussing options in Abu Dhabi for ending the war.</description><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 08:29:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/H3RZUALKO5MA3PVFVTH6MXVGMI.jpg?auth=ff3ee6180052b590b05852016310f83e507e0cdb000bf70ed711dd3a704382f4&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>What we know about Alex Pretti, the man shot dead by federal agents in Minneapolis</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260125-what-we-know-about-alex-pretti-the-man-shot-dead-by-federal-agents-in-minneapolis</link><description>Family members of Alex Pretti, the man killed by a US Border Patrol officer in Minneapolis on Saturday, said he was an intensive care nurse at a VA hospital who cared deeply about people and was upset by President Donald Trump ’s immigration crackdown in his city.

Alex Jeffrey Pretti, 37, was an avid outdoorsman who enjoyed getting in adventures with Joule, his beloved Catahoula Leopard dog who also recently died. He worked for the US Department of Veterans Affairs and had participated in protests following the January 7 killing of Renee Good by an Immigration and Customs officer.

“He cared about people deeply and he was very upset with what was happening in Minneapolis and throughout the United States with ICE, as millions of other people are upset,” said Michael Pretti, Alex’s father. “He thought it was terrible, you know, kidnapping children, just grabbing people off the street. He cared about those people, and he knew it was wrong, so he did participate in protests.”

Pretti was a US citizen, born in Illinois. Like Good, court records showed he had no criminal record and his family said he had never had any interactions with law enforcement beyond a handful of traffic tickets.

In a recent conversation with their son, his parents, who live in Colorado, told him to be careful when protesting.

“We had this discussion with him two weeks ago or so, you know, that go ahead and protest, but do not engage, do not do anything stupid, basically,” Michael Pretti said. “And he said he knows that. He knew that.”

The Department of Homeland Security said the man was shot after he “approached” Border Patrol officers with a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun. Officials did not specify if Pretti brandished the gun. In bystander videos of the shooting that emerged soon after, Pretti is seen with a phone in his hand but none appears to show him with a visible weapon.

Family members said Pretti owned a handgun and had a permit to carry a concealed handgun in Minnesota. They said they had never known him to carry it.

The family first learned of the shooting when they were called by an Associated Press reporter. They watched the video and said the man killed appeared to be their son. They then tried reaching out to officials in Minnesota.

“I can’t get any information from anybody,” Michael Pretti said Saturday. “The police, they said call Border Patrol, Border Patrol’s closed, the hospitals won’t answer any questions.”

Eventually, the parents called the Hennepin County Medical Examiner, who they said confirmed had a body matching the name and description of their son.

As of Saturday evening, the family said they had still not heard from anyone at a federal law enforcement agency about their son's death.

After seeing videos of top Trump administration officials suggesting their son was a “domestic terrorist” who attacked the officers who shot him, they issued a written statement describing themselves as both heartbroken and angry.

"The sickening lies told about our son by the administration are reprehensible and disgusting," the family's statement said. They added that videos showed Alex Pretti was not holding a gun when he was tackled by federal agents, but holding his phone with one hand and using the other to shield a woman who was being pepper-sprayed.

“Please get the truth out about our son. He was a good man,” they said.

Alex Pretti grew up in Green Bay, Wisconsin, where he played football, baseball and ran track for Preble High School. He was a Boy Scout and sang in the Green Bay Boy Choir.

After graduation, he went to the University of Minnesota, graduating in 2011 with a bachelor’s degree in biology, society and the environment, according to the family. He worked as a research scientist before returning to school to become a registered nurse.

Pretti’s ex-wife, who spoke to the AP but later said she didn’t want her name used, said she was not surprised he would have been involved in protesting Trump’s immigration crackdown. She said she had not spoken to him since they divorced more than two years ago and she moved to another state.

She said he was a Democratic voter and that he had participated in the wave of street protests following the killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer in 2020, not far from the couple’s neighbourhood. She described him a someone who might shout at law enforcement officers at a protest, but she had never known him to be physically confrontational.

She said Pretti got a permit to carry a concealed firearm about three years ago and that he owned at least one semiautomatic handgun when they separated.

Pretti lived in a four-unit condominium building about 2 miles (3.2 kilometres) from where he was shot. Neighbours described him as quiet and warmhearted.

“He’s a wonderful person,” said Sue Gitar, who lived downstairs from Pretti and said he moved into the building about three years ago. “He has a great heart.”

If there was something suspicious going on in the neighborhood, or when they worried the building might have a gas leak, he would jump in to help.

Pretti lived alone and worked long hours as a nurse, but he was not a loner, his neighbours said, and would sometimes have friends over.

His neighbours knew he had guns – he’d occasionally take a rifle to shoot at a gun range – but were surprised at the idea that he might carry a pistol on the streets.

“I never thought of him as a person who carried a gun,” said Gitar.

A competitive bicycle racer who lavished care on his new Audi, Pretti had also been deeply attached to his dog, who died about a year ago.

His parents said their last conversation with their son was a couple days before his death. They talked about repairs he had done to the garage door of his home. The worker was a Latino man, and they said with all that was happening in Minneapolis he gave the man a $100 tip.

Pretti’s mother said her son cared immensely about the direction the county was headed, especially the Trump administration’s rollback of environmental regulations.

“He hated that, you know, people were just trashing the land,” Susan Pretti said. “He was an outdoorsman. He took his dog everywhere he went. You know, he loved this country, but he hated what people were doing to it.”</description><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 10:23:26 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/0a200ada-f9cd-11f0-88fc-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26024696586709-1.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item></channel></rss>
