In power since 2010, eurosceptic Orban has struggled to revive Hungary's economy from an inflationary surge following Russia's February 2022 invasion of neighbouring Ukraine, with the economy mired in a three-year stretch of stagnation.

With Hungary still strongly reliant on Russian energy imports, President Donald Trump has granted Orban a one-year exemption from U.S. sanctions on Russian energy, staving off an energy price surge, which would have hit Hungary's economy hard.

The two leaders also discussed forms of financial assistance in November, although Trump last month rebuked Orban's claim that Washington had already agreed to provide Hungary a backstop worth up to $20 billion.

"I have requested a (financial) shield, but the type of assistance that would have been acceptable for both the U.S. and Hungary was not available," Orban told a press conference.

Orban is facing what could be the toughest challenge to his 16-year rule from a combination of Hungary's prolonged economic stagnation, a surge in the cost of living and an abuse scandal, which has triggered the rise of a strong opposition rival.

The veteran leader has launched tax cuts, wage hikes and cheap loans for homebuyers to shore up his poll standings at the cost of a higher budget deficit, inflationary risks and the slow decline in the European Union's largest debt pile outside the euro zone stalling.

When asked whether he could expect more help from Washington ahead of the election, likely to be in April, Orban said:

"Whether the American president or some high-ranking American leader will come to Hungary? This is likely, because in spring there will be political events in Hungary that high-ranking American leaders always attend."</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 13:42:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CN4QYNG7IFODFH5GJGEIL2EMOI.jpg?auth=9bb6ddd24880c963f4b7ef6440cdb00d93f91e6e3e7b6f2a935098d235be4ab2&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Syria, Israel resume U.S.-mediated security talks</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/syria-israel-resume-us-mediated-security-talks-2026-01-05/</link><description>Jan 5 (Reuters) - U.S.-mediated talks between Syria and Israel have resumed after an interruption of several months, Syria's state news agency SANA reported on Monday, with Damascus seeking withdrawal of Israeli troops from territory seized after the fall of Bashar al-Assad.

SANA, citing a Syrian government source, said the Syrian delegation was led by Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shibani and intelligence chief Hussein al-Salama. The resumption of the talks reflects a push by Damascus to reclaim what it describes as its non-negotiable national rights, the source said.

The discussions are focused on reviving a 1974 disengagement agreement that established a U.N.-monitored buffer zone between Israel and Syria after the 1973 Middle East war, SANA said.

Israeli troops advanced deeper across the border after Assad was toppled on December 8, 2024 by rebel fighters who assumed Syria's leadership. Israel has also intervened in what it calls missions to protect ethnic minority Druze in southwestern Syria.

Syria is seeking an Israeli withdrawal to positions held before Assad was toppled, and wants a reciprocal security framework guaranteeing its sovereignty and preventing interference in its internal affairs.

A Syrian official told Reuters last month that talks had been stalled since October, but that Syria expected a possible shift following a December 29 meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

The Syrian official said Damascus considered Israel's withdrawal from territory it took after Assad's fall to be a "red line" and that Syria had been asked to consider a phased withdrawal by Israeli troops.

"We're not going to legitimize an Israeli presence in Syria or the Golan Heights for that matter," the official said.

Under previous rounds of U.S.-mediated talks in Paris and Washington, Syria has pressed for a deal similar to the 1974 disengagement accord, which separated forces and maintained a ceasefire for decades, though formal peace was never achieved.

Syria's leadership has also sought an end to Israeli air strikes and incursions.

Israel has said it would conclude an agreement only on terms safeguarding its security interests, including demilitarisation of parts of southwestern Syria and protections for minority communities. It has yet to publicly commit to a full withdrawal to pre-2024 lines.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 13:42:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/IVQFLIYGO5M7VHS7JB7MEDOLLQ.jpg?auth=a75b43e7b2dd1b090ecfcf1fad6a3c61c16fca03322911c9f5db21f5d987b683&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Rome welcomed record 33.5 million pilgrims for Catholic Holy Year</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/rome-welcomed-record-335-million-pilgrims-catholic-holy-year-2026-01-05/</link><description>VATICAN CITY, Jan 5 (Reuters) - About 33.5 million pilgrims came to Rome in 2025 for the Catholic Holy Year, Vatican and Italian officials said on Monday, marking a record number of yearly visitors and a boon for local tourist shops, museums and restaurants.

Holy years, or jubilees, typically occur every 25 years and are considered a time of peace, forgiveness and pardon. Pilgrims to Rome can enter special "Holy Doors" at four Rome basilicas, and can see the pope at special audiences throughout the year.

Officials said the 3.7 billion euros ($4.32 billion) of state and European funds spent on overhauling tourist sites for the occasion had been worth the investment.

"The whole world has come to Rome," Archbishop Rino Fisichella, the Vatican's lead jubilee official, told a news conference. "The Jubilee has not been a losing investment but a driving force that has boosted ... overall growth."

The year, during which Catholics can also earn a special indulgence, or remission of sins, ends on Tuesday.

Visitors over the past 12 months came from 185 countries, officials said, with pilgrims from Italy, the United States, Spain, Brazil and Poland leading the pack.

Much of Rome has resembled one large construction site for the past two years as officials undertook some 3,200 construction projects for the jubilee, creating a new underpass near the Vatican, updating the subway system, and restoring the famed Trevi fountain.

"The Jubilee has been a driving force for the transformation of the city," Rome mayor Roberto Gualtieri told reporters.

Although they typically occur only once every quarter-century, a special Jubilee year is expected in 2033 as part of celebrations to mark 2,000 years since the death of Jesus.

Leo proposed in November that the year might also include a joint pilgrimage by him and other Christian leaders to Jerusalem, to visit the site of Jesus' crucifixion.

The last jubilee tourism record, made during the 2000 holy year, was 25 million.

The 2025 Jubilee was marked by an historical rarity not seen for 300 years. It was opened by one pope, Francis, and will be closed on Tuesday during a formal ceremony in St. Peter's Basilica by his successor, Leo.

Francis died in April after 12 years leading the 1.4-billion-member Church. The last jubilee held under two popes was in the year 1700, when Clement XI closed a holy year opened by Innocent XII.

Hundreds of Jubilee construction projects will continue in Rome beyond the end of the Holy Year.

The frenzy of work has infuriated some residents and left some visitors feeling short-changed because various tourist attractions were hidden behind scaffolding for many months.

Many renters in Rome were also left frustrated as the long-term rental market dried up as landlords sought to cash in on short-term rentals for pilgrims.

The Mexican leader added that Mexico is a sovereign country and is cooperating with the U.S. on drug trafficking and security.

Special Forces seized Maduro only eight months after the Russian president agreed a strategic partnership with his "dear friend", and Trump said the U.S. was taking temporary control of Venezuela, which has the world's biggest oil reserves .

Some Russian nationalists have criticised the loss of an ally and contrasted the swift U.S. operation with Russia's failure to take control of Ukraine in almost four years of war.

But on another level, what Russia casts as Trump's "piracy" and "regime change" in the United States' "backyard" is more tolerable for Moscow, especially if Washington becomes bogged down in Venezuela.

"Russia has lost an ally in Latin America," said a senior Russian source, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation.

"But if this is an example of Trump's Monroe Doctrine in action, as it seems to be, then Russia also has its own sphere of influence."

The source was referring to the Trump administration's desire to reassert U.S. dominance in the Western Hemisphere and revive the 19th-century Monroe Doctrine, which declared the area to be Washington's zone of influence.

A second Russian source said Moscow saw the U.S. operation as a clear attempt to gain control of Venezuela's oil wealth and observed that most Western powers had not openly criticised it.

Putin has been trying to stake out a Russian sphere of influence in former Soviet republics in Central Asia, the Caucasus and Ukraine in a push opposed by Washington since the Cold War ended.

Putin has not commented publicly on the U.S. operation in Venezuela although Russia's foreign ministry has urged Trump to release Maduro and called for dialogue. The ministry previously cast Trump's actions as modern-day piracy in the Caribbean.

Russian state media have depicted the operation as a U.S. "kidnapping", reported remarks by Trump on the U.S. having "sick" neighbours and referred to the U.S. capture of military leader Manuel Noriega in Panama on January 3, 1990.

"That Trump just 'stole' the president of another country shows that there is basically no international law - there is only the law of force - but Russia has known that for a long time," Sergei Markov, a former Kremlin adviser, told Reuters.

He said the modern-day Monroe Doctrine - which Trump suggested could be updated as the "Donroe Doctrine" - could be interpreted in different ways.

"Is the United States really ready to recognise Russia's dominance over the former Soviet Union, or is it simply that the United States is so strong that it will not tolerate any great powers even close to it?"

Alexei Pushkov, who chairs the commission on information policy in Russia's Federation Council, or senate, saw the U.S. operation in Venezuela as a direct implementation of the U.S. National Security Strategy, depicting it as an attempt to revive U.S. supremacy and gain sway over more oil reserves.

But he said it risked a return to "the wild imperialism of the 19th century and, in fact, reviving the concept of the Wild West - the Wild West in the sense that the United States has regained the right to do what they want in the Western Hemisphere."

"Will the triumph turn into a disaster?" he asked.

For Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping, having a U.S. president focused on - and potentially bogged down in - the Western Hemisphere would appear to be more than acceptable, given Russia's focus on Ukraine and China's on Taiwan .

But some Russian nationalists have criticised the loss of an ally so soon after Bashar al-Assad's fall in Syria, and compared the speed of the U.S. operation with the much slower pace of Russia's advances in Ukraine.

Russia's largest oil producer, Rosneft (ROSN.MM) , opens new tab , terminated operations in Venezuela in 2020 and sold its assets related to operations there to a company owned by Russia's government.

Jailed Russian nationalist Igor Girkin said the U.S. had shown in Venezuela how a great power should act when facing a potential threat and cast the U.S. operation as part of an attempt to cut oil flows to China.

"We've had another blow to our image - another country that counted on Russia's help did not get it," Girkin said.

"Having got bogged down up to our ears in the bloody swamp of Ukraine, we are practically incapable of anything else, especially since we cannot help Venezuela in another hemisphere that is right next door to the United States."</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 14:25:52 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BV42FG46URNNZDQMT7EHK4UAZE.jpg?auth=1bd4b42493ab5e9d4a45aa2aa5df541893f61a2cdc4b8828c27099304bcc64a8&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russian missile strikes damage energy infrastructure in Ukraine's Kharkiv, mayor says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-missile-strikes-damage-energy-infrastructure-ukraines-kharkiv-mayor-says-2026-01-05/</link><description>KYIV, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Russia carried out five missile strikes on Ukraine's second-biggest city Kharkiv on Monday, causing "very serious damage" to energy infrastructure, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said.

"This is not just an attack on facilities. It's an attack on heating, on water, on people's normal lives. They are trying to break us with fear and darkness," he said on Telegram, without specifying the targets that had been hit.

Kharkiv's regional prosecutors' office said in a statement that at least one civilian was injured in the attack.

In a separate strike in the eastern city of Dnipro, an enterprise owned by major U.S. agricultural producer Bunge (BG.N) , opens new tab was hit, causing a leak of 300 tons of sunflower oil, said Borys Filatov, the mayor.

"Public utilities workers are cleaning up, spreading sand and gravel," Filatov wrote on the Telegram messaging app, adding that the spill would close a major riverside road to traffic for two or three days.

Kharkiv, with over a million inhabitants, is located close to the border with Russia. The temperature was around minus 3 degrees Celsius (27°F) during the day on Monday and will drop at night. According to the local electricity supplier, prior to the latest attack residents received electricity for an average of 14-16 hours out of 24.

Since November, Russia has sharply increased both the number and intensity of attacks on Ukraine's energy system and logistics, plunging entire regions into darkness after large-scale missile and drone attacks.

A third of Ukraine's capital Kyiv was left without heating after a vast Russian attack in late December, after Ukraine's largest seaport, Odesa, was virtually cut off from power for several days following a series of attacks.

Russia also attacked stations that produced heat for Chernihiv and Kherson.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 14:27:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Macron says France ‘does not approve’ of method US used to overthrow Maduro</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260105-macron-says-france-does-not-approve-of-method-us-used-to-overthrow-maduro</link><description>French President Emmanuel Macron on Monday said he "neither supported nor approved" the US military operation to grab Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro , a government spokesman said.

His comment clarified an initial public reaction Macron made that Venezuelans "can only rejoice" at Maduro's overthrow.

That first reaction drew criticism from several political figures in France , some of whom saw the French president as kowtowing to US President Donald Trump .

It also contrasted with a reaction from French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot who on Saturday condemned the US operation – saying it undermined international law, while stressing that no solution to Venezuela 's crisis can be imposed from the outside.

On Monday, government spokeswoman Maud Bregeon reported Macron as telling cabinet ministers: "We defend international law and the freedom of peoples. The method employed is neither supported nor approved."

She said Macron added that, for Venezuela, "if there is to be a transition, then the 2024 winner must obviously play a central role in it".

That was in reference to Venezuelan presidential candidate Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia , who was widely considered the rightful victor of a 2024 presidential election.

Maduro, however, was proclaimed the winner, sparking deadly riots that were brutally repressed.

Maduro's vice president, Delcy Rodriguez, has taken over Venezuela's government as interim leader, and said she wants to discuss "cooperation" with Washington. The country's military has said it recognises her authority.

Trump says the US is now "in charge" of Venezuela . The White House on Sunday indicated it does not want regime change, just a pliant new Venezuelan government, even if filled with former Maduro associates.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 14:28:31 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/21ad66fa-ea25-11f0-8685-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25349479964109.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran's leaders struggle to end protests, US action in Venezuela stokes fears</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/irans-leaders-struggle-end-protests-us-action-venezuela-stokes-fears-2026-01-05/</link><description>DUBAI, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Iran's efforts to quell a wave of anti-government protests have been complicated by Donald Trump's threat to intervene on their side, a warning firmly underlined by the subsequent U.S. capture of Venezuela's Nicolas Maduro , officials and insiders said on Monday.

A day before U.S. special forces seized Maduro and his wife on January 3 and whisked them off to New York, the U.S. president warned in a social media post that if Iran's leadership killed protesters who have taken to the streets since December 28 the U.S. "will come to their rescue". At least 17 people have died so far.

Tehran's options have been limited by Trump's threats and a long-running economic crisis that deepened after Israel, joined by the U.S., launched strikes on the Islamic Republic in June in a 12-day war that pummelled several of Iran's nuclear sites.

"These twin pressures have narrowed Tehran's room for manoeuvre, leaving leaders caught between public anger on the streets and hardening demands and threats from Washington, with few viable options and high risks on every path," one Iranian official told Reuters.

The view was echoed by two other officials and a former Iranian official who remains close to Iran's decision makers. All of them asked not to be identified due to the sensitivity of the situation.

A second official said that, after U.S. action in Venezuela, some of the authorities feared Iran could be "the next victim of Trump's aggressive foreign policy".

Iran's economy has been hammered by years of U.S. sanctions, but its rial has been in freefall since last year's Israeli-U.S. strikes that mainly targeted nuclear sites, where the West says Tehran has been working on nuclear arms. Iran denies this.

The protests that erupted in Tehran and which have spread to some cities in western and southern Iran do not match the scale of unrest that swept the nation in 2022-23 over the death of Mahsa Amini, who died in the custody of Iran's morality police for allegedly violating the hijab law.

But, even if smaller, these protests have quickly expanded from an economic focus to broader frustrations, with some protesters chanting "Down with the Islamic Republic" or "Death to the dictator" - a reference to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei who has the final say in all state matters.

That presents a challenge for the authorities which have been trying to maintain and nurture the spirit of national unity that emerged during and after the Israeli-U.S. strikes.

A third official said worries were growing in Tehran that "Trump or Israel might take military action against Iran, like what they did in June."

Iran, which has for years allied itself with fellow oil producer Venezuela, which like Iran has suffered under years of U.S. sanctions, has condemned Washington's action in Caracas. It has also condemned Trump's statements about Iran.

Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei said such statements about "Iran's internal affairs amount, under international norms, to nothing more than incitement to violence, incitement to terrorism, and incitement to killing".

On Friday, Trump threatened to intervene if protesters faced violence, declaring, "We are locked and loaded and ready to go," though he offered no details on what actions he might take.

The protests threaten what has long been Khamenei's defining priority: preserving the Islamic Republic at any cost. In a sign of the leadership's concern, Khamenei on Saturday accused "enemies of the Islamic Republic" of fomenting unrest and warned that "rioters should be put in their place".

Authorities have attempted to maintain a dual approach to the unrest, saying protests over the economy are legitimate and will be met by dialogue, while meeting some demonstrations with tear gas amid violent street confrontations.

However, at least 17 people have been killed in a week, rights groups said on Sunday. Authorities have said at least two members of the security services had died and more than a dozen were injured in the unrest.

The country's clerical establishment is still coming to terms with the 2025 Israeli and U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear and military targets. The attacks, which killed top Revolutionary Guard commanders and nuclear scientists, were launched just a day before a planned sixth round of talks with Washington over Tehran's disputed nuclear program.

Negotiations have stalled since the June conflict, even as both sides insist they remain open to a deal.

Washington and its allies accuse Iran of using its nuclear program as cover to develop weapons capability, a charge Tehran denies, saying its ambitions are purely peaceful.

Economic grievances remain at the heart of latest unrest.

Widening disparities between ordinary Iranians and a privileged clerical and security elite, compounded by mismanagement, runaway inflation and corruption — factors even acknowledged by state media — have fuelled public anger.

Witnesses in Tehran, Mashhad and Tabriz reported a heavy security presence in main squares. "You can feel the tense atmosphere in Tehran, but life continues as normal," said Amir Reza, 47, a carpet shop owner in Tehran's Grand Bazaar.

President Masoud Pezeshkian has urged dialogue and promised reforms to stabilize the monetary and banking systems and protect purchasing power.

Starting January 10, the government will provide a monthly stipend of 10,000,000 rials per person (about $7) in non-cashable electronic credit for use in select grocery stores, the semi-official Tasnim news agency reported.

For lower-income households, whose monthly salaries barely exceed $150, the measure represents a modest but meaningful boost.

Israel has carried out repeated air strikes in Gaza since a U.S.-brokered deal took effect in October that halted most fighting. Israel says its strikes are aimed at preventing attacks or destroying militant infrastructure.

Gaza's health ministry says 422 Palestinians have been killed since the ceasefire took effect. Gaza militants have killed three Israeli soldiers during the same period.

Under the first phase of the deal, brokered by U.S. President Donald Trump, Israel has retained control of 53% of Gaza. Hamas agreed to release living hostages and hand over remains in exchange for the freeing of Palestinians detained by Israel.

The final hostage remains still to be handed over belong to an Israeli police officer killed on October 7, 2023 - the day Gazan militants invaded Israel, killing 1,200 and taking some 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.

Israel's offensive in Gaza has killed more than 71,000 Palestinians, most of them civilians, according to local health authorities. Most of the territory is in ruins, with the population of more than 2 million living mainly in makeshift homes or damaged buildings in areas where Israeli forces withdrew.

Earlier on Monday, a father and son in Gaza were killed in the collapse of their house which had been damaged in an earlier Israeli strike, authorities in Gaza said.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 15:48:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/NULNCCXFQBKSPMNVZ6KNJLRKOI.jpg?auth=e72741fa4f7d0d9f8a8911aad4bb5a0a88c67ab682883756a4d0c991bcbf9d8a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Denmark's prime minister says Trump is serious about wanting Greenland takeover</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/denmarks-prime-minister-says-trump-is-serious-about-wanting-greenland-takeover-2026-01-05/</link><description>COPENHAGEN, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said on Monday that she believes U.S. President Donald Trump is serious about wanting to take over Greenland, and that both Denmark and Greenland have clearly rejected his ambition.

“I am deeply concerned about the possible intensification of instability in the country, the potential impact on the region, and the precedent it may set for how relations between and among states are conducted,” Guterres said in a statement delivered to the council by U.N. political affairs chief Rosemary DiCarlo.

Guterres also said in the statement that he was concerned that the U.S. operation to capture Maduro in Caracas early on Saturday did not respect the rules of international law.

“I welcome and am ready to support all efforts aimed at assisting Venezuelans in finding a peaceful way forward,” he said in the statement.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 15:50:04 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HHJU5YIYWZOFNJ7BLYXJ2EHRWM.jpg?auth=7488f078e9bad4143d5c43989dbab0d37b2e9bce4dfa11faf8ba3d98f1c38544&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Switzerland freezes assets linked to Venezuela's Maduro after US arrest</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/switzerland-freezes-assets-linked-venezuelas-maduro-after-us-arrest-2026-01-05/</link><description>ZURICH, Jan 5 - Switzerland has frozen assets held in the country by Venezuela's Nicolas Maduro and associates, the Swiss government said on Monday, following his arrest by U.S. forces in Caracas and transfer to the United States.

A spokesperson for the Swiss Foreign Ministry said the order affects 37 people. The spokesperson said the ministry could not provide any details on the value of the assets in question.

The measure, effective immediately and valid for four years, aims to prevent an outflow of potentially illicit assets and comes in addition to existing sanctions imposed on Venezuela since 2018, the government said in a statement.

The asset freeze does not affect members of the current Venezuelan government, and Switzerland said it will seek to return any funds found to be illicitly acquired to benefit the Venezuelan people.

The government said the situation in Venezuela was volatile, with various outcomes possible in the coming days and weeks.

It said it was following the situation closely, and called for de-escalation and restraint, while also offering its good offices to find a peaceful solution.

"The Federal Council wants to ensure that any illicitly acquired assets cannot be transferred out of Switzerland in the current situation," it said.

The asset freeze was a precautionary measure and applied to Maduro and his associates as foreign politically exposed persons, the government said.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 16:29:31 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/FHVBK67CG5NWJALKIX4QYNVY2U.jpg?auth=ed17f12cf6f30e1898ab72cbc5fa7e571687edb0c85504bb05d93b45d461c3c6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Britain demands Elon Musk's Grok answers concerns about sexualised photos</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/britain-demands-elon-musks-grok-answers-concerns-about-sexualised-photos-2026-01-05/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Britain has demanded Elon Musk's social media site X explain how its AI chatbot Grok was able to produce undressed images of people and sexualised images of children, and whether it was failing in its legal duty to protect users.

Grok said on Friday lapses in safeguards had resulted in "images depicting minors in minimal clothing" on X, saying it was urgently fixing them.

British media regulator Ofcom said it was aware of "serious concerns" raised about the feature.

"We have made urgent contact with X and xAI to understand what steps they have taken to comply with their legal duties to protect users in the UK," a spokesperson said.

Grok said on Friday: "xAI has safeguards, but improvements are ongoing to block such requests entirely."

Creating or sharing non-consensual intimate images or child sexual abuse material, including sexual deepfakes created by artificial intelligence, is illegal in Britain.

In addition, tech platforms have a duty to take steps to stop British users encountering illegal content and take it down when they become aware of it.

The request comes after ministers in France reported X to prosecutors and regulators over the disturbing images, saying in a statement on Friday the "sexual and sexist" content was "manifestly illegal".</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 16:30:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WZUIN6NBUVJEFHFNMY2AU7TDQQ.jpg?auth=07385399c8e03bc163dc51202d900132d76ac75624f01c308a5b2f682299440b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>France asks airlines to cancel 15% of flights at Paris main airports after snowfalls</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/france-asks-airlines-cancel-15-flights-paris-main-airports-after-snowfalls-2026-01-05/</link><description>PARIS, Jan 5 (Reuters) - France's civil aviation authority on Monday asked airlines to cancel 15% of flights until later in the evening at Orly and Charles de Gaulle airports following heavy snowfalls in the French capital Paris.

The airlines are free to choose which flights they cancel so long as they reduce takeoffs and landings, a spokesperson told Reuters.

Airlines were asked to reduce flights until 2000 CET (1900 GMT) at Paris-Charles de Gaulle airport, and until 2330 CET (2230 GMT) at Paris-Orly.

The French transport ministry urged travellers to check if their flight was taking off before leaving home, and to go to the airport by public transportation rather than by car.

Meanwhile, Amsterdam Schiphol airport , one of Europe's busiest hubs, cancelled almost 500 flights on Monday morning and was closed to incoming traffic until 1200 GMT also because of snowfalls, news agency ANP reported.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 16:30:42 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CMAXOSYJVNNSVHUWY2GCDMVMBQ.jpg?auth=833521d89a12b5b9db39decbe7544bfbdfe2acedcd8e61fd7c36de5b0b9980fd&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>All 116 people wounded in Crans-Montana New Year's fire now identified</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260105-all-116-people-wounded-in-crans-montana-new-year-s-fire-now-identified</link><description>Swiss police announced Monday they had now identified all 116 people wounded in the devastating New Year bar blaze in Crans-Montana , with three-quarters of them still in hospital.

Four days on from the blaze that swept through Le Constellation bar in the Alpine ski resort town, everyone killed and injured has now been identified.

A total of 40 people were killed in the tragedy, all of whom had been identified by Sunday. The average age of those killed was 19.

"All 116 injured people have been identified. Eighty-three of them are still hospitalised," the Wallis cantonal police in southwest Switzerland said in a statement.

The total number of people injured in the disaster was revised downwards, with police having warned in the days following the tragedy that the tolls were likely to change.

"Initially, we reported 119 injured. In reality, three injured people admitted to the emergency room that night were mistakenly attributed to the event," the statement said.

Among those injured were 68 Swiss, 21 French, 10 Italians, four Serbs and two Poles, police said.

Nationals from Belgium, Portugal, the Czech Republic, Australia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Republic of Congo and Luxembourg were also among those hurt in the tragedy.

And there were four injured people with dual nationality, given as French-Finnish, Swiss-Belgian, French-Italian, and Philippine-Italian.

The Wallis police said no further information would be given on the identities of those injured, "out of respect for the families".

The most severely burned casualties have been airlifted to specialist burns centres in Switzerland and abroad.

The Swiss government said Sunday that 35 patients had been transferred to specialist clinics in neighbouring Germany, France and Italy, plus Belgium.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 16:32:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/30bbb2b2-e987-11f0-ac25-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-04T152628Z-50281374-RC2BUIA5XSF3-RTRMADP-3-SWITZERLAND-BLAST.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump’s risky gamble: Can the US 'run' Venezuela after Maduro's capture?</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260105-trump-risky-gamble-can-the-us-run-venezuela-maduro-capture</link><description>US President Donald Trump described the next steps following the shock military US action in Venezuela – dubbed “Operation Absolute Determination” – as a temporary phase pending a political transition.

He presented the run-up to this transition as simple and unequivocal: the United States would “run” Venezuela after the capture of Nicolas Maduro on Saturday.

But the US president did not provide details on how this US stewardship – which would be legally fragile – would be implemented. And while he left open the possibility of deploying US troops on Venezuelan soil, he did not specify whether their role would be to maintain order or protect the US oil companies that he said would soon be operating in the country.

"Toppling Maduro is likely to be the easy part for Trump," warned an analysis in The Washington Post . The paper nevertheless offered editorial support for the US operation.

Historically, US attempts to "run" foreign countries, either covertly or openly from Washington, have rarely succeeded. "In Latin America , US interventions have generally ended badly, such as Guatemala in 1954, where a US-backed coup led to decades of internal conflict," said Luca Trenta, a US foreign policy and security specialist at Swansea University in Wales. "Elsewhere, in Iraq and Libya , the American presence was also accompanied by a sharp rise in violence."

Many experts expressed scepticism that Trump might succeed where others had failed. "The statements made during the press conference [on Sunday] were not reassuring," said Rebecca Jarman, a Latin America security specialist at the University of Leeds. "The best-case scenario would have been a negotiated transition, perhaps some kind of diplomatic help in creating a structure that would lead to some sort of coalition. Instead, everything appears to rest on a show of force and the possible deployment of troops ."

Trump has ruled out Venezuelan Maria Corina Machado , the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize laureate , saying she lacked the stature to lead the country, despite her role as a former lawmaker and Venezuela’s leading opposition figure.

Anyone who ascends to the role will be walking a fine line.  "The problem is that the manner in which Maduro was removed will make the next opposition leader look like a US puppet," said Tom Long, a Latin America specialist at the University of Warwick.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio appears to have made his choice. He announced that the United States would cooperate with Delcy Rodriguez , Venezuela’s vice president, who was appointed by the Supreme Court on Saturday to serve as interim president.

But shortly after Rubio made his remarks, Rodriguez showed little willingness to align with Washington. "She was very clear in a press conference that actually, she simply wanted to get Maduro back because he was the legitimate president", Trenta said. Speaking on state television, Rodriguez urged national unity in response to what she called Maduro's "kidnapping" and insisted Venezuela would never become a "colony".

Rodriguez also arouses "a degree of mistrust within the US administration because some see her as appointed by Maduro and so unreliable", the expert added. She thus does not fit the profile of the total political reversal the United States would like to see in Venezuela.

"It would be wrong to assume the previous government disappeared with Maduro’s arrest," Long said.

But some experts argued she could play a stabilising role. "Her hostile rhetoric towards Washington is posturing, it’s unavoidable," Jarman said. Any other tone would have branded her a Washington stooge in the eyes of officials still in place in Caracas.

Jarman described Rodriguez as "not particularly ideologically bound" and, above all, "a careerist politician". She added that Rodriguez’s track record of running the Venezuelan intelligence services since 2018 means she is experienced in dealing with "antagonistic actors", an advantage in the eyes of Trump and Rubio.

Indeed, that skill could allow Rodriguez to maintain a fragile balance between US interests as well as those of the Venezuelan military and "non-state actors", including gangs, potentially sparing Washington the need to deploy troops.

It remains to be seen, however, if Rodriguez’s political skill will be enough to keep Venezuela under control. No one knows, for instance, how the country's powerful military could react. "At the moment, Defence Minister Vladimir Padrino Lopez and high-ranking officials are laying low," Jarman said. "They want to see what happens and how this all plays out before working out where best to invest their loyalty and their efforts."

"The army's appetite to defend Maduro himself is very limited, but its appetite to defend its turf is very high – especially its interests in natural resource extraction such as oil, or in drug trafficking ," she added.

The armed forces, therefore, appear to be waiting to see which entrenched interests they will be able to defend.

Experts also warned of the risk of internal divisions within the armed forces. "If splits emerge, tensions could quickly escalate, potentially leading to violence, chaos and conflict," Trenta said.

Such a scenario would be catastrophic for the population, who would bear the brunt of any escalation in violence. But the alternative is not a cure-all for Venezuelans, even if some welcomed the fall of Maduro, who Jarman notes "was very unpopular” in the country.

A short-term cooperation between Washington and Rodriguez could entrench the existing power structure, Jarman warned. “The ruling elites could tighten their grip on institutions and increase repression, this time without fear of being targeted by the United States,” she said.

Air traffic controllers for Athens airport were guiding planes toward the runway when the usual radio chatter suddenly vanished - replaced by a piercing whistle.

It quickly became clear that controllers had lost contact with most aircraft in Greek airspace, including dozens of incoming flights, according to two controllers and an aviation official on duty at the time.

Internet systems also appeared to fail across the board. Even the civil aviation authority's press office resorted to reading statements over the phone rather than sending by email.

The outage , which lasted several hours and affected most of Greece's airports, stranded thousands of travelers. Authorities have ruled out a cyberattack, but the cause remains unknown - and officials admit the systems didn't get fixed, they simply came back on their own.

"Suddenly communications went down. You could only hear a high-pitched whistle," said one controller, speaking on condition of anonymity. "The thing is, we don't know what caused it and how it ended. We want to find out the exact cause to ensure once and for all that this will not happen again."

Controllers managed to identify a couple of working radio frequencies in the tower, but not enough to maintain safe communication with pilots, a senior official said. Within half an hour, Greece took the unprecedented step of suspending flights into and across its airspace.

Air traffic controllers from across the region stepped in to help. A controller in a neighbouring country said most communication with Greece was done over the telephone because the usual radios were down.

"We had a black hole in Greek airspace," said aviation safety expert Faithon Karaiosifidis. "Imagine if it had happened in the summer at the peak of the tourist season. The chaos."

The incident has reignited calls to upgrade Greece's aviation infrastructure, which unions and experts say is outdated and underfunded after the country's 2009–2018 debt crisis.

The government insisted Monday that modernisation is underway and that current systems meet EU standards. The plan, which includes updating communication systems, is due for completion in 2028.

But last month, the European Commission referred Greece to the EU Court of Justice for failing to implement certain navigation procedures designed to boost safety in low-visibility conditions. It's unclear whether those measures would have made any difference on Sunday - but many worry reform is coming too late.

"This incident once again exposes the critical weaknesses of outdated and underfunded air traffic management infrastructure. Safety was maintained thanks to human expertise — but this cannot continue to compensate for systemic deficiencies," said Panagiotis Psarros, Chair of the Association of Greek Air Traffic Controllers.

Experts say the problems go beyond ageing equipment. Radios dating back to the 1990s remain in use, and staffing shortages persist despite a tourism boom that brings millions of visitors to Greece each year.

"The old technical equipment and the lack of personnel in air traffic controllers and electronic technicians ... create a bottleneck," said Karaiosifidis.

In September, unions protested by limiting flight arrivals they said exceeded permitted limits, causing delays. They have now threatened to do the same again.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 17:23:58 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/3WBX3SWRIFPALHASBUF6MFC5QQ.jpg?auth=f741b55a2d70ba863eeae3b83c7307b24c78b89d4e913344636dfc886a725b47&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US making preparations in case Trump decides to reopen embassy in Caracas, official says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/us-making-preparations-case-trump-decides-reopen-embassy-caracas-official-says-2026-01-05/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 5 (Reuters) - The United States is undergoing preparations in case President Donald Trump decides to reopen the U.S. embassy in Venezuela's capital Caracas, a senior State Department official said on Monday.

"As President Trump said, we are making preparations to allow for a reopening should the President make that decision," the official told Reuters.

Trump on Sunday said that the U.S. was thinking about reopening the embassy in Caracas.

Bloomberg first reported that the Trump administration is taking early steps to allow for the reopening of the American embassy in Venezuela.

The United States captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro in a raid early on Saturday and whisked him to New York to face drug-trafficking charges.

Trump has asserted that the U.S. will run Venezuela until such time as a "safe, proper and judicious transition" can be made, and he has made no secret of wanting to share in Venezuela's oil riches.

But it was unclear how the U.S. intends to run the country. The U.S. president's vow on Saturday to “run” post-Maduro Venezuela appears for now to be more an aspiration to exert outside control - or at least heavy influence - over the OPEC nation without deploying U.S. ground forces, which would have little public support at home.

But Trump said on Sunday that more military intervention was on the table. "If they don't behave, we will do a second strike," he said.

American oil companies will return to Venezuela and rebuild the sector's infrastructure, Trump told reporters on Air Force One on Sunday.

The far-left Volcano activist group claimed responsibility for the attack which also shut down mobile phone connections, cut heating during freezing weather, stopped trains and forced hospitals to switch to back-up generators.

"Left-wing terrorism is back in Germany with increasing intensity," Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt told the Bild newspaper in an interview.

Volcano, which says it is against the energy industry's use of fossil fuels, has claimed several attacks in Berlin and the neighbouring Brandenburg region.

"There will be talks which we have to have with the federal government about how we can better protect our critical infrastructure, especially in the area of the capital," Berlin mayor Kai Wegner told a news conference.

Germany and other Western powers have also been on the alert for sabotage attacks on power, communications and transport systems at a time of increasing geopolitical uncertainty.

A blaze early on Saturday destroyed a cable duct over a canal, cutting power in around 45,000 households and more than 2,000 businesses in the southwest of the city, including the prosperous areas of Zehlendorf and Wannsee.

Electricity has since been restored for some 14,500 households but full restoration is not expected until Thursday afternoon, Stromnetz Berlin, the city's network operator, said.

In 2024, the Volcano group claimed responsibility for a suspected arson attack on a power pylon near Tesla's car factory outside Berlin.

In its most recent annual report, the domestic intelligence agency said left-wing militancy was a growing danger and made explicit reference to the Volcano group.

Bernhard Büllmann, head of Stromnetz Berlin, said restoring electricity to areas still without power would be a complex operation involving high-tension lines that required specialist staff.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 18:36:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4IAMFFG4ORJL5HCGNYKEDUFDS4.jpg?auth=7b76ec77cdb55bb09a64b9169de3af2f9ced17d54d9c3cf5229594aafa3bc3b6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Who might be next: Countries in US crosshairs after Venezuela</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260105-maduro-ouster-who-next-us-trump-crosshairs-regime-change-cuba-greenland-iran</link><description>A day after the audacious – and successful – US military operation that removed Nicolas Maduro in Venezuela, Secretary of State Marco Rubio indicated in an interview that aired Sunday that Cuba might be next.

Asked directly whether Cuba was the administration's "next target", Rubio called the Cuban government "a huge problem".

"So is that a yes?" the interviewer pressed. "I think they're in a lot of trouble, yes," Rubio replied.

That same day, Trump renewed his calls for a US takeover of the Danish territory of Greenland, citing US security interests, and threatened military action in Colombia for its role in cocaine trafficking.

With such thinly veiled threats, Trump and co. are rattling friends and foes alike, spurring observers around the world to pose a pointed question: Who might be next?

Greenland's melting Arctic ice is creating new, potentially lucrative shipping routes while its land mass is mineral-rich. Its strategic location has also been identified as a potential Achilles' heel for NATO . Russia, China, the United States and Europe have already taken steps to bolster their military presence in the region.

Trump, for his part, tried to buy the semi-autonomous island from Denmark in 2019 during his first term.

“It’s so strategic right now. Greenland is covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place," Trump told reporters as he flew back to Washington from Florida on Sunday.

"We need Greenland from the standpoint of national security, and Denmark is not going to be able to do it.”

The operation in Caracas and Trump’s comments heightened concern in Copenhagen, with Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen stating unequivocally that Trump has "no right to annex" the territory.

She also reminded Trump that Denmark already provides the United States, a fellow member of NATO, broad access to Greenland through existing security agreements.

“I would therefore strongly urge the US to stop threatening a historically close ally and another country and people who have made it very clear that they are not for sale,” Frederiksen said.

Denmark signed onto a European Union statement on Sunday underscoring that “the right of the Venezuelan people to determine their future must be respected” even as Trump vowed the US would “run” Venezuela and pressed the country's acting president, former vice president Delcy Rodriguez, to toe the US line .

Trump mocked Danish efforts to boost Greenland’s national security posture on Sunday by saying the Danes had added “one more dog sled” to their arsenal.

Greenlanders and Danes were further rankled by a social media post from a former Trump administration official turned right-wing podcaster. Katie Miller – who is married to Trump deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, the anti-immigrant campaigner and architect of many of Trump's controversial deportation policies – appeared to threaten Denmark, a US ally. The post showed an illustrated map of Greenland in the colors of the Stars and Stripes accompanied by the caption: “SOON."

In a post responding to Miller, Ambassador Jesper Moller Sorensen, Denmark's chief envoy to Washington, called for the US to respect national borders. “And yes, we expect full respect for the territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Denmark,” he wrote.

During his presidential transition and in the early months of his return to the White House, Trump called for the US to assert control over Greenland and has pointedly not ruled out military force to take control of the Arctic island.

The issue had largely drifted out of the headlines in recent months. But Trump then put the spotlight back on Greenland less than two weeks ago when he said he would appoint Republican Governor Jeff Landry as special envoy to Greenland. The Louisiana governor responded that in his volunteer position he would help Trump “make Greenland a part of the US”.

The Trump administration's National Security Strategy , published last month, cited restoring “American preeminence in the Western Hemisphere” as a central goal, an aim underscored by the Venezuelan adventure.

Trump on Saturday cited the 19th-century Monroe Doctrine , which called on world powers – notably European colonists – to respect American hegemony in the region.

He also cited the doctrine's Roosevelt Corollary – the justification used to support Panama’s secession from Colombia, which helped secure the Panama Canal Zone for the US – as he made his case for a more assertive approach to the Western Hemisphere.

Trump even quipped that James Monroe's 1823 policy declaration could be renamed the “Don-roe Doctrine”.

Concern is thus simmering in Cuba, one of Venezuela’s most important allies and trading partners, fueled by Rubio's hints that the Cuban government might be the next to draw Washington's attention.

Rubio underscored the link between the two countries in his Sunday appearance on NBC's “Meet the Press”, saying Cuban officials were with Maduro ahead of his capture.

“It was Cubans that guarded Maduro,” Rubio said. “He was not guarded by Venezuelan bodyguards. He had Cuban bodyguards.” The secretary of state added that Cuban bodyguards were also in charge of “internal intelligence” in Maduro’s government, including “who spies on who inside, to make sure there are no traitors”.

The Cuban government said in a statement read on state television on Sunday evening that 32 officers were killed in the US military operation that toppled Maduro.

Trump said the Cuban economy, battered by years of a US embargo, is in tatters and will slide further now with the ouster of Maduro, who provided the Caribbean island with subsidized oil. “It's going down,” Trump said of Cuba's economy. “It's going down for the count.”

US-Cuba relations have been hostile since the 1959 Cuban revolution.

As he made his way back to Washington on Sunday evening, Trump also put Venezuela's neighbour Colombia and its leftist president, Gustavo Petro, on notice.

In a back-and-forth with reporters, Trump said Colombia is “run by a sick man who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States”.

The administration imposed sanctions in October on Petro, his family and a member of his government over accusations of involvement in the global drug trafficking.

Trump began his pressure campaign on Maduro by ordering dozens of lethal strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats travelling from Venezuela in the Caribbean. He eventually expanded the operations to target suspected vessels in the eastern Pacific originating from Colombia.

In September the United States added Colombia, the top recipient of US assistance in the region, to a list of nations failing to cooperate in the drug war for the first time in almost 30 years. The designation led to a slashing of assistance to the country.

“He’s not going to be doing it for very long,” Trump said of Petro on Sunday. “He has cocaine mills and cocaine factories. He’s not going to be doing it.”

Asked whether he might order the US to conduct an operation against Colombia, Trump replied vaguely: “It sounds good to me.”

Iran has long been allied to Venezuela, using Caracas to bypass US sanctions and trading oil for gold. The " ghost fleets " operating off the coast of Venezuela are suspected of carrying sanctioned Russian and Iranian oil to global markets, circumventing sanctions.

Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah militants also have economic ties to Venezuela , raising money through narcotics. According to the Atlantic Council think tank, the Maduro regime and Hezbollah have exploited the status quo "to turn Venezuela into a central hub for the convergence of transnational organized crime and international terrorism".

Leaders in Tehran are likely to see the fall of Maduro as an indication that Trump is likely to pursue regime change if he deems it's in the US interest, and will not just stop at curtailing Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile programs, noted Raz Zimmt, head of the Iran and Shiite Axis research program at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv, in comments to the Times of Israel .

Moreover, events in Venezuela could indicate that Trump would not oppose Israeli efforts at regime change in Tehran despite his previous dissembling. Hosting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House last week, Trump dismissed the idea, telling reporters : “I’m not going to talk about an overthrow of a regime.”

But amid reports of widespread Iranian protests just a few days later, Trump returned to more bellicose rhetoric.

“If Iran shots [sic] and violently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue," he posted on Truth Social in the wee hours of January 2. “We are locked and loaded and ready to go,” he said before adding his customary sign-off: “Thank you for your attention to this matter!”</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 18:37:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/3dcbbc5a-ea26-11f0-8e3e-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/Trump-Rubio-Maduro-next.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Snow and ice cause travel disruption in France, UK and Netherlands</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260105-snow-and-ice-cause-travel-disruption-in-france-uk-and-netherlands</link><description>Some of the winter's coldest weather so far hit travel in Britain, France and the Netherlands on Monday, closing roads, grounding flights and forcing train cancellations, including on Eurostar, just days after a power outage caused major disruption.

Eurostar , which links the UK to the European mainland, told passengers travelling between London and the Netherlands to postpone their journeys, as services could not operate beyond Brussels due to the Dutch weather.

Rail traffic through the Channel Tunnel had only resumed on New Year's Eve, after an electricity failure stranded thousands of passengers and even trapped some for a night on a powerless train.

"Due to expected adverse weather conditions, the traffic is suspended in the Netherlands today," Eurostar said in a live service update, urging travellers affected not to turn up to the station.

Six trains between London St Pancras International and Paris Gare du Nord were cancelled, with most others delayed, the timetable indicated.

British railway authorities meanwhile deployed snowploughs in Scotland to try to clear tracks hit by heavy snow, which reached up to 52 centimetres (20 inches) on Monday morning in Tomintoul, near Inverness in northeast Scotland .

NS Dutch railways said services were severely disrupted on Monday, especially in the Amsterdam region, and fewer trains would run in some parts of the country on Tuesday.

The UK's Met Office issued fresh weather warnings for Monday and Tuesday for snow and ice for Scotland, Northern Ireland and parts of northern England and said cold weather health alerts for all English regions would remain in place until Friday.

The disruption follows a cold snap in recent days in the UK.

Temperatures dropped to a low of -10.9C in the high hills of Shap in Cumbria, northwest England, on Sunday night.

"Overnight into Tuesday temperatures will once again fall below freezing for much of the country, with the lowest temperatures over lying snow possibly dipping to -12C," the Met Office said.

A total of 212 schools were closed in Northern Ireland on Monday, the authorities said, with dozens of schools also shut in Scotland, Wales and northern England.

Flights were cancelled at airports including Liverpool in northwest England, Aberdeen and Inverness in northeast Scotland, and Belfast in Northern Ireland.

At France's major Paris airports of Charles de Gaulle and Orly, heavy snowfall forced airlines to reduce their flights by 15 percent.

Some 250 snowploughs were on standby at the two airports, French Transport Minister Philippe Tabarot told a press conference, adding there would likely be "cancellations and some delays".

At Schiphol, the main international airport of the Netherlands, some 700 flights were cancelled -- more than half of those scheduled to take off or land on Monday.

Reduced traffic was expected for the rest of the day, the airport authorities said, with wintry weather forcing further cancellations in the coming days.

In Paris, snow and ice disrupted the bus network on Monday afternoon and roads, particularly in the northwest Normandy region as well as in the French capital, were badly affected with long rush-hour tailbacks.

Weather service Meteo France issued an orange alert for snow and ice for much of northwest France, including Paris, on Monday evening – the second-highest warning.

It forecast sub-zero temperatures into the evening and overnight, with the mercury barely above freezing into Tuesday.

In Scotland, the police cautioned road users not to try to drive through closed roads because of the treacherous conditions.

The UK's roadside assistance provider, the AA, said there had been a 40 percent spike in callouts compared to a typical Monday.

Belfast Zoo remained closed due to the weather conditions on Monday, while snow, ice or low temperature warnings were in place across neighbouring Ireland.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 19:20:42 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/cb446318-ea56-11f0-ab3c-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/000-89NX74R.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Delcy Rodriguez formally sworn in as Venezuela's interim president</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/delcy-rodriguez-formally-sworn-venezuelas-interim-president-2026-01-05/</link><description>Jan 5 - Venezuela's vice president and oil minister Delcy Rodriguez was formally sworn in on Monday as the country's interim president, as U.S.-deposed President Nicolas Maduro appeared in a New York court on drug charges, after the Trump administration removed him from power in a dramatic weekend military action.

Rodriguez, a 56-year-old labor lawyer known for close connections to the private sector and her devotion to the ruling party, was sworn in by her brother Jorge, who is the head of the national assembly legislature.

Also sworn in on Monday were 283 lawmakers elected last May. Just a small number of are classed as opposition - most of the opposition, especially the faction directed by Nobel Prize winner Machado, boycotted the contest.

The two-day poll showed 65% of Republicans back the military operation ordered by Republican President Donald Trump, compared to 11% of Democrats and 23% of independents.

U.S. forces swooped into Caracas before dawn on Saturday in a deadly raid that yielded the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, who the U.S. military turned over to federal authorities for prosecution on charges involving alleged drug trafficking.

The Reuters/Ipsos poll, conducted on Sunday and Monday, showed significant support among Republicans for a foreign policy that includes exerting influence over nearby countries.

Some 43% of Republicans said they agreed with the statement: "The United States should have a policy of dominating affairs in the Western Hemisphere," compared with 19% who disagreed. The rest said they were unsure or did not answer the question.

The poll, which surveyed 1,248 U.S. adults nationwide, showed Trump's approval rating at 42%, the highest rating since October and up from 39% in a December poll. The poll, which was conducted online, had a margin of error of about 3 percentage points.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 19:42:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/37TCBCR6PZMWVJCXXWMTZGIOKU.jpg?auth=687041e210cd3e8f28f2c3d664d9b39632efbfdf0e94a1e74047dac1ec085d2e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Assange's lawyer Barry Pollack to fight Maduro's US narcotics charges</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/assanges-lawyer-barry-pollack-fight-maduros-us-narcotics-charges-2026-01-05/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Barry Pollack — the Washington lawyer who represented WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange — will defend toppled Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro in a U.S. drug case that could test immunity claims for foreign leaders and the legality of his capture.

Pollack appeared with Maduro on Monday as he pleaded not guilty in Manhattan federal court days after Maduro and his wife were seized in a U.S. military raid.

Defending Assange gave Pollack a taste of cases steeped in global intrigue and with consequences for America’s standing in the world. The case tested whether U.S. law could criminalize the publishing of sensitive information.

Assange faced U.S. Espionage Act charges for WikiLeaks’ mass release of secret U.S. documents, including diplomatic cables and accounts of military actions in Iraq and Afghanistan.

After months of negotiations, he pleaded guilty to a single count of conspiring to obtain and disclose classified defense information.

The unusual 2024 deal Pollack struck let Assange walk out of a British prison, enter his plea in the U.S. territory of the Northern Mariana Islands before returning to his native Australia.

POLLACK SAYS HE WILL CHALLENGE MADURO'S 'MILITARY ABDUCTION'

Maduro pleaded not guilty on Monday to a four-count indictment accusing him of leading a conspiracy to funnel cocaine into the United States, including by working with armed guerrilla groups, drug cartels and international gangs.

At Maduro's arraignment in Manhattan federal court on Monday, Pollack said he anticipated extensive legal wrangling over what he termed Maduro's "military abduction," signaling the defense will argue Saturday's operation was unlawful .

Pollack may also claim that Maduro is immune from criminal charges as the head of a foreign government. Pollack did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

"The United States has an extraordinary view of what its worldwide jurisdiction is," Pollack told the legal site Lawdragon in an interview last year about the Assange case.

Both arguments face legal hurdles.

The U.S. has not recognized Maduro as Venezuela's leader since 2019, after Maduro claimed victory in an election the U.S. and other countries deemed fraudulent. U.S. courts have generally declined to dismiss prosecutions based on claims a defendant was brought to the U.S. unlawfully.

Pollack, a partner at the Harris St. Laurent &amp; Wechsler law firm, also previously represented a former Central Intelligence Agency officer who was convicted of sharing classified information with a reporter.

He secured an acquittal for a former Enron Corp executive who faced charges tied to the energy company's collapse in 2001.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 19:43:19 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/6BYKJPMBJRKGHP2PYZ4DC7D3EI.jpg?auth=ec5d26143c5adb809576a747fb51acaf52da2854547e59206c95125440e34e20&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Greenland is not comparable to Venezuela, prime minister says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/greenland-is-not-comparable-venezuela-prime-minister-says-2026-01-05/</link><description>COPENHAGEN, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Greenland hopes to improve relations with the United States and can't be compared to Venezuela, the Arctic island's Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen told a press conference on Monday.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 19:44:04 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ZYDRNAPY4BNE7BRUZQCT75PPOA.jpg?auth=ce887505c2bf65d22ddf66fd64eda0d5944962869f55f766c5c650e8dbbabd73&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>At least nine soldiers killed in ambush attack in Nigeria's Borno state, sources say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/least-nine-soldiers-killed-ambush-attack-nigerias-borno-state-sources-say-2026-01-05/</link><description>MAIDUGURI, Nigeria, Jan 5 (Reuters) - At least nine Nigerian soldiers were killed and several others injured when their convoy struck a landmine and came under fire in Borno state in northeastern Nigeria, two security sources said on Monday.

The attack took place on Sunday near Bindundul village, about 20 kilometres (12 miles) from Kareto, an area where Islamic State West Africa Province fighters operate freely and often set up checkpoints, according to a military source from the Damasak brigade.

"The terrorists planted a mine that our soldiers stepped on. Unfortunately, about nine soldiers died instantly, while five others were seriously injured," said Abba Kaka Tuja, a member of the Civilian Joint Task Force involved in the rescue operation.

He added that an armoured vehicle was destroyed when the mine detonated, followed by sporadic gunfire from militants.

The soldiers were traveling from Maiduguri to Damasak, the headquarters of Mobbar Local Government Area, when the attack occurred around 1600 GMT, Tuja said.

Military officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Nigeria’s northeast, where ISWAP fighters and Boko Haram have intensified attacks in recent months, targeting military convoys and civilians, is the country’s most conflict-prone region.

Other areas are also tense.

The Brazilian Presidency did not provide further details about Saturday's call.

According to a source from Brazil's government, Lula called Rodriguez to confirm reports he had seen in the media regarding the U.S. military action that removed Maduro from power in Venezuela.

Many Venezuelans said they were still processing the events of Saturday, when a military operation rocked the capital Caracas and other areas, and expect a prolonged period of political and economic uncertainty.

Mariela Gonzalez, 52, the owner of a beauty and makeup business in the northwestern city of Barquisimeto, said that she had chatted with other shopkeepers via WhatsApp and opted to reopen on Monday after closing over the weekend.

"We're afraid, but we can't let ourselves be paralyzed," Gonzalez said.

U.S. President Donald Trump has said the U.S. will "run" Venezuela pending a political transition, while also threatening more military action if a new interim government led by Maduro's former vice president does not cooperate with Washington's demands.

After a spike of panic-buying at the weekend, customer traffic was slower than usual on Monday, said store employees.

"We are open because we have to work and also because there are perishable foods that can spoil. However, people are only coming to buy the basics," said Rosendo Linarez, 38, a supermarket manager in Barquisimeto.

In Venezuela's second-largest city of Maracaibo, in the western state of Zulia, drivers of taxis and buses estimated that over a third of their colleagues were staying home out of fear and for lack of clients.

"There are very few passengers, and a tense calm," said Marielys Urdaneta, a 41-year-old driver, who said she showed up to work because she needed the income. "I went out of necessity ... fear or not, you have to eat," she said.

Douglas Sanchez, who sells snacks from a kiosk in Caracas, agreed.

"You feel anguish, desperation, all of that, but (we) have to go out and work, go out and make our little bit of money to buy food and things. Because if you don't go out to work, you don't have anything," he said.

Daniel Morillo, 30, who migrated to Peru five years ago, was visiting his hometown of Maracaibo for the Christmas holidays. After the events of the weekend he said he was planning to cut his trip short, using his remaining funds to buy medicine and food for his parents.

"I thought I would leave sad just because of the goodbye to my parents ... not with this knot in my chest for leaving them in this uncertainty," Morillo said.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 21:22:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/PN3FR334SRP5BHYEV6OTXQMYV4.jpg?auth=b2bc6a95625c63a1fb448667dfee6a8d88acaddcf83e8e72d59695b58f33c888&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Colombia to continue to work with US on drug trafficking, government says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/colombia-continue-work-with-us-drug-trafficking-government-says-2026-01-05/</link><description>BOGOTA, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Colombia will continue to work with the United States in fighting drug trafficking using Washington's intel and technology, two officials from the South American nation said on Monday.

Aliyev, interviewed by Azeri television channels, said Azerbaijan had been in contact with Donald Trump's U.S. administration with a list of questions about the operation of a peacekeeping force in Gaza.

"We prepared a questionnaire of more than 20 questions and provided it to the American side. No participation in peacekeeping forces is envisaged," Aliyev said.

"I am not considering participation in hostilities outside Azerbaijan at all."

An Azeri government source had said last November that Azerbaijan would provide no troops for such an operation unless there was a complete halt to fighting between Israel and the militant group Hamas.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 21:45:19 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/F7ESATXU3FJRNIMGFZXOV6GJLE.jpg?auth=71e05f9fa7a1c085d58f7506e7b3716d7645c5a482882c129b4365eb930c8276&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>North Korea's Kim inspects memorial for soldiers who died in Russia mission</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/north-koreas-kim-inspects-memorial-soldiers-who-died-russia-mission-2026-01-05/</link><description>SEOUL, Jan 6 (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and his daughter Ju Ae on Monday inspected the construction of a memorial for North Korean troops who died fighting overseas, state media KCNA reported on Tuesday.

Under a mutual defence pact with Russia, in 2024 North Korea sent some 14,000 soldiers to fight alongside Russian troops in Ukraine, where more than 6,000 of them were killed, according to South Korean, Ukrainian and Western sources.

Kim described the dead soldiers as "heroes ... who sacrificed themselves without hesitation", saying "no one in the world can overcome such an army that is absolutely loyal to the orders of the party".

He took part in tree-planting for the memorial with Ju Ae, who wore a red muffler while shoveling earth with her father, KCNA photos showed.

Meanwhile, a photo exhibition detailing North Korea's progress under Kim opened in Pyongyang as the country gears up for a key party congress to be held soon, KCNA said.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 22:48:39 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/R55HLVWOHRMADFD23UMZSO47AQ.jpg?auth=632e47ec82134d70a9a0b046c413616d8aae42d3dff1be78abc5f529dd820fad&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Central African Republic President Touadera wins re-election, results show</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/central-african-republic-president-touadera-wins-re-election-provisional-results-2026-01-05/</link><description>BANGUI, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Central African Republic President Faustin-Archange Touadera has won a third term in office, securing an outright majority in the presidential election held on December 28, provisional results from the electoral commission showed on Monday.

The 68-year-old mathematician who took power a decade ago was seeking a third term after a constitutional referendum in 2023 scrapped the presidential term limit.

He campaigned on his security record in the chronically unstable nation after enlisting help from Russian mercenaries and Rwandan soldiers. He also signed peace deals with several rebel groups this year.

The results announced on Monday showed Touadera received 74.6% of the vote, while former prime minister Anicet-Georges Dologuele received 14% and former prime minister Henri-Marie Dondra received 3.65%.

The main opposition coalition, known by its French acronym BRDC, boycotted the election, saying it would not be fair.

Even before the results were announced, Dologuele and Dondra had cast doubt on their credibility, calling separate press conferences to denounce what they described as election fraud.

Dologuele, the runner-up in the 2020 election, told a press conference on Friday that there had been "a methodical attempt to manipulate" the outcome.

"The Central African people spoke on December 28," Dologuele said. "They expressed a clear desire for change."

The Constitutional Court has until January 20 to adjudicate any challenges and declare definitive results.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 23:22:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KBCNPGHFSZJK7J23RURLZN54JQ.jpg?auth=496f3c420086c9e73d25c2117b568e35a7161a5af398f2b918f1f75bf5530dc3&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Magnitude 6.2 quake strikes western Japan</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/magnitude-62-quake-strikes-western-japan-2026-01-06/</link><description>TOKYO, Jan 6 (Reuters) - An earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 6.2 hit western Japan on Tuesday, the Japan Meteorological Agency said.

US President Donald Trump ’s special envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner will attend the Paris meeting, the latest in a US-led push to end the Russian invasion, which began four years ago next month.

French President Emmanuel Macron is hosting the meeting of the so-called “coalition of the willing” on Tuesday to discuss security guarantees as part of a proposal to end the war between Ukraine and Russia.

The overnight Russian strikes triggered a fire at a private medical clinic in the capital, killing one person and wounding three others, the authorities said.

Emergency services released images of rescuers removing people on stretchers from a gutted building.

“Doctors and nurses were forced to evacuate the wounded under fire,” Ukraine’s Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko said on X.

“It was a terrible night for us,” Margaryta Maliovana, the clinic’s CEO, told AFP.

“One person died. A young man, 30 years old, was killed,” she said, adding that there were 26 patients in the clinic at the moment of the strike.

The pre-dawn attack also killed a man in his 70s in the neighbouring city of Fastiv, the Kyiv regional governor said.

The strikes caused power outages in the area, with backup systems activated to maintain water and heating supplies, the official said, as temperatures dropped to -8C.

Russia launched a total of 165 drones and at least nine missiles overnight, the Ukrainian air force said.

European leaders are in Paris on Tuesday, seeking a breakthrough on a plan to end the fighting that Kyiv says is “90 percent” ready.

“This week, we will be working with our European and American partners to ensure that Ukraine has the assistance it needs,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Monday.

To lay the groundwork, security advisers from 15 countries, including Britain, France and Germany, as well as representatives from NATO and the European Union, gathered in Kyiv over the weekend.

US envoy Witkoff joined the talks virtually, a Ukrainian official told AFP, though the United States ’ large-scale military attack on Venezuela earlier in the day overshadowed proceedings.

Another preparatory meeting between chiefs of staff is scheduled for Monday.

Diplomatic efforts to end Europe’s deadliest conflict since World War II have gained pace in recent weeks, though both Moscow and Kyiv remain at odds over the key issue of territory in a post-war settlement.

Russia, which occupies around 20 percent of Ukraine, is pushing for full control of the country’s eastern Donbas region as part of a deal.

But Kyiv has warned that ceding ground will embolden Moscow and said it will not sign a peace deal that fails to deter Russia from invading again.

On Monday, Russia said it had seized the village of Grabovske in Ukraine’s north-eastern Sumy region, from where Kyiv had last month accused Moscow of forcibly relocating dozens of residents.

Bombarded daily and losing ground, Ukraine has responded with its own drone attacks launched towards Russian territory, targeting in particular energy infrastructure that funds the war effort.

Trump on Sunday dismissed claims by Moscow that Kyiv had launched a drone at one of Russian President Vladimir Putin ’s residences.

“I don’t believe that strike happened,” Trump said in response to a reporter’s question aboard Air Force One. Kyiv has also rejected the accusation.

Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, triggering a conflict that has killed tens, if not hundreds, of thousands, devastated eastern Ukraine and forced millions to flee their homes.

Putin has vowed to press on with his military campaign if his hardline demands are not met at the negotiating table.

Russia in 2025 gained the most ground on the battlefield since the first year of its offensive, according to AFP analysis.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 01:47:08 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/570fe164-dee1-11f0-bee9-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25353746236838.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US scraps universal child vaccine guidance, drawing expert concern</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260106-us-scraps-universal-child-vaccine-guidance</link><description>The United States ended on Monday its longstanding guidance that all children receive vaccines against flu and three other diseases, a sweeping change that advances one of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s long-term goals.

Public health experts warn the latest rollback could lead to preventable hospitalisations and deaths.

The action, which removes the recommendation for rotavirus, influenza, meningococcal disease and hepatitis A, and states that parents should consult healthcare providers under what it calls shared clinical-decision-making, was approved by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Acting Director Jim O’Neill without the agency’s usual outside expert review. It advances Kennedy’s campaign to pare back childhood vaccinations.

Last month, President Donald Trump urged the US to “align with other developed nations” by reducing the number of shots for children.

Trump said the new schedule was "rooted in the Gold Standard of Science" and aligns the United States with other developed nations. In a post on his Truth Social platform, the president congratulated Kennedy and other health officials on the change.

"Many Americans, especially the 'MAHA Moms', have been praying for these COMMON SENSE reforms for many years. Thank you for your attention to this matter!" he wrote, referring to Kennedy's Make America Healthy Again movement.

Kennedy, a prominent vaccine critic, has previously led efforts to drop universal recommendations for COVID-19 and hepatitis B shots for children, citing links to autism that scientists have repeatedly debunked.

Vaccine experts decried the changes they said put American children at risk.

Dr Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, said there should have been public discussion on the risks and benefits of the potential impact of dropping the recommendations.

Dr Sean O'Leary, chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said other developed countries face different disease risks and have different healthcare systems than the United States. Unlike the US, which depends on private healthcare, most countries provide basic universal healthcare that is paid for by the government.

"Any decision about the US childhood vaccination schedule should be grounded in evidence, transparency and established scientific processes, not comparisons that overlook critical differences between countries or health systems," he said.

For the change in policy, two leading officials of the Department of Health and Human Services, Martin Kulldorff and Tracy Beth Hoeg, reviewed vaccine protocols in 20 other developed countries — all of which have universal healthcare — and made the recommendations to change the US schedule, the agency said.

In a report, HHS wrote that the level of risk varies by disease and child.

The vaccine schedules of the 20 reviewed countries show that the flu shot is recommended universally in four countries and a shot against hepatitis A is universal only in Greece. The rotavirus shot is recommended for all children in 17 of the 20 countries and shots against meningococcal disease are recommended in 16.

Each of the four vaccines prevents diseases that once caused unnecessary hospitalizations and death in children, said Dr Jesse Goodman, a Georgetown University professor and former FDA chief scientist.

Flu shots can help prevent pediatric deaths from flu, which killed 288 children in the 2024–25 season, according to the CDC. Hepatitis A, which infects the liver, usually resolves on its own but can lead to hospitalisation and lifelong liver damage.

Rotavirus, which causes severe diarrhoea and dehydration, used to send tens of thousands of children to the hospital each year, but vaccines have made this extremely rare, Goodman said.

While meningitis, a bacterial infection of the brain, is rare in children, some 15% of those infected do not respond to antibiotics and die, he said. "If you can safely prevent it, it makes total sense."

The updated recommendations maintain immunisations for 11 diseases , including measles, mumps, and varicella, while categorizing others as either targeted for high-risk groups or subject to the shared-decision-making category, HHS said.

Insurance providers will continue covering immunisation costs regardless of the category, senior HHS officials told reporters on a call.

The new schedule also recommends US children receive a single dose of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, rather than a two-dose course. Recent studies have concluded that a single dose is not inferior to the longer course and noted the World Health Organization also backs a single-dose schedule.

Merck, which makes Gardasil, the only US-approved HPV vaccine, was not immediately available for comment. The drugmaker has said that since there is not sufficient data for the US FDA to license the shot as a single-dose regimen, the CDC's recommendations should be in line with the agency's approval.

Merck recorded $2.4 billion in US Gardasil sales in 2024.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 01:47:10 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/5ae2ee6a-c674-11f0-820b-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25324542716106.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukraine's allies meet with aim to make security pledges concrete</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/ukraines-allies-meet-with-aim-make-security-pledges-concrete-2026-01-06/</link><description>PARIS, Jan 6 (Reuters) - Ukraine's allies meet in Paris on Tuesday, seeking to finalise as much as possible their contributions to future security guarantees to reassure Kyiv in the event of a ceasefire with Russia, diplomats and officials said.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy will be joined by more than 27 leaders in the French capital, along with senior U.S. negotiators Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, as part of broader efforts to put together a common Ukrainian, European and American position that could then be taken to Russia.

Talks to bring the almost four-year conflict to an end have accelerated since November. However, there have been few signals Russia would be willing to accept current proposals on the table, with the issue of territory remaining a key obstacle to negotiations and fighting between the two sides showing no signs of abating.

Ahead of Tuesday's meeting diplomats said military officials, including the head of Ukraine's general staff, were in Paris to put concrete commitments on paper so that leaders could provide political backing. Until now, military pledges have largely been vague.

According to a note sent to the 35 invited delegations and reviewed by Reuters, the meeting will focus on securing contributions to a multinational force for Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire, in coordination with Ukraine and with U.S. support.

The hosts also aim to agree contributions for a wider set of security guarantees for Ukraine, including binding commitments if it is attacked again. Efforts will be made to ensure that planning by the so-called "Coalition of the Willing" contributing countries will be coordinated with the negotiating positions of Ukraine, the U.S. and Europe.

The note also suggests agreeing next steps to increase support for Ukraine and pressure on Russia should Moscow refuse to engage in meaningful negotiations.

"We have reached agreement on the operational details of the security guarantees," a French presidency official told reporters ahead of the summit. "We will explain how they are structured and the need for a long-term commitment from everyone involved."

A senior European official said the hope was that firming up the coalition's guarantees would also help cement U.S. commitments, which have been broadly outlined in bilateral discussions with Ukraine.

In his evening address to the nation on Sunday, Zelenskiy said the meetings in Europe should become one more contribution to Ukraine's defence and bring closer efforts to end the war.

"Ukraine will prepare for both scenarios: diplomacy, which we are pursuing, or further active defence if pressure from partners on Russia proves insufficient. Ukraine wants peace," he said.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 03:40:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/JVCO6ZGT55OBZGUT5AQQZXLOVQ.jpg?auth=86a54ad5204733386094d81cfebafad47adcb0b8ca890fee56b65c3290ecbf57&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Flash floods in Indonesia's North Sulawesi kill 14, four still missing</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/flash-floods-indonesias-north-sulawesi-kill-14-four-still-missing-2026-01-06/</link><description>JAKARTA, Jan 6 (Reuters) - At least 14 people were killed after being swept away by flash floods in Indonesia's North Sulawesi, an official said on Tuesday, as the search for the missing continued.

Heavy rain early on Monday triggered flash floods on the island of Siau, located in the region of Siau Tagulandang Biaro, said Nuriadin Gumeleng, a spokesperson for the local rescue agency.

Sixteen rescuers have been deployed to search for four people who remain missing on Tuesday, Gumeleng told Reuters, adding that 18 people had been injured so far.

"We continue to collect data from local residents in case there are more missing people," he said.

As of Tuesday, main roads in the affected areas were still covered by rocks, debris and thick mud, Gumeleneg said.

At least 444 people have been evacuated to local schools and churches after the flash floods, the country disaster mitigation agency spokesperson Abdul Muhari said in a statement.

Authorities have deployed excavators to clear roads that have been blocked by the debris and mud, he said.

The floods also destroyed hundreds of houses and government buildings, North Sulawesi governor Yulius Selvanus said.

The flash floods took place in the peak of the wet season in Sulawesi island, as forecast by Indonesia's weather agency.

The islands of Java, Sulawesi, Maluku, and Papua are expected to experience their peak wet seasons over January and February this year, bringing more risks of floods, the weather agency had said.

Rain in other parts of Indonesia like Sumatra and Borneo reached its peak in November and December last year.

Last November, cyclone-induced floods and landslides killed more than 1,000 people in Sumatra , with hundreds still missing.

"Actually, I spoke with President Trump on October 10, the same day the (Noble Peace) Prize was announced, (but) not since then," Machado said on Fox News' "Hannity" program.

She was awarded the prize for her fight against what the Norwegian Nobel Committee called a dictatorship.

Machado - widely seen now deposed Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro 's most credible opponent- left Venezuela last month to travel to Norway to accept the award, and hasn't returned since.

"I'm planning to go as soon as possible back home," she told Fox News when asked about her plans to return to Venezuela.

The interview was Machado's first since the U.S. launched strikes on Venezuela on Saturday and captured its president.

She welcomed the U.S. actions as "a huge step for humanity, for freedom and human dignity."

Venezuela's vice president and oil minister Delcy Rodriguez was sworn in as interim president on Monday, but Washington's move over the weekend has left many to wonder about the future leadership of the South American country.

Trump on Saturday dismissed the idea of working with Machado, saying "she doesn't have the support within or the respect within the country."</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 03:41:32 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/L6HYQKEB5NJP3KLEM2FBTN76XI.jpg?auth=359a6a06e3a5ddf01e0b199b8897c9a184911394646153ecd098c69e0d8fa044&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US Republicans insist no 'endless war' looms in Venezuela</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-republicans-insist-no-endless-war-looms-venezuela-2026-01-06/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 5 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump does not plan to occupy or nation-build in Venezuela, Republican U.S. lawmakers said on Monday after attending a briefing by top officials on the administration's policy toward the South American nation.

"We do not have U.S. armed forces in Venezuela, and we are not occupying that country," Republican House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana told reporters after the classified session with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and other senior officials.

"If anybody wants to use the term nation-building, or anything like that, it doesn't look like anything anybody has seen under President Trump," said Representative Brian Mast, the Republican chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.

"They are not the protracted war administration," Mast told reporters after the briefing, which lasted more than 2-1/2 hours, when asked how he would reassure Americans they did not face another 'endless war,' like the 20-year conflict in Afghanistan.

Trump sent U.S. troops into Caracas early on Saturday to seize Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, who pleaded not guilty earlier on Monday to narcotics charges.

Maduro's capture rattled world leaders, left officials in Caracas scrambling to regroup and angered some U.S. Democrats, who said Rubio and other Trump administration officials had lied to them by insisting they were not planning regime change in Venezuela.

Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Senate's Democratic leader, told reporters Monday's briefing had been extensive but posed more questions than it answered.

"Their plan for the U.S. running Venezuela is vague, based on wishful thinking and unsatisfying," he said.

Schumer said he had not received assurances that Trump would not do the same thing in other countries. Republicans also left open that possibility. "There's absolutely a continual plan to use the United States military to protect the homeland of the United States of America," Mast said.

The Senate is due to vote as soon as this week on whether to block further military action against Venezuela without congressional approval, a resolution co-sponsored by Schumer.

Republicans insist the weekend operation did not require congressional approval because it was very short and involved "law enforcement" to bring Maduro to court in New York.

Members of Congress, including some Republicans as well as Democrats, have long accused presidents of seeking to sidestep the Constitution's requirement that Congress, not the president, approve anything other than brief and limited military action needed to defend the United States.

Republicans have defeated repeated attempts to pass similar war powers resolutions since Trump four months ago sent U.S. forces to the Caribbean, where they have been firing missiles at vessels Washington says are carrying drugs.

Trump's administration accuses Maduro of overseeing a cocaine-trafficking network that partnered with violent groups including Mexico’s Sinaloa and Zetas cartels, Colombia's FARC rebels and Venezuela's Tren de Aragua gang.

"I am innocent. I am not guilty. I am a decent man. I am still president of my country," Maduro, 63, said through an interpreter, before being cut off by US District Judge Alvin Hellerstein in Manhattan federal court.

Maduro's wife Cilia Flores also pleaded not guilty. The next court date was set for March 17.

Dozens of protesters, both pro- and anti-Maduro, gathered outside the courthouse before the half-hour hearing.

Hours later in Caracas, Maduro's vice president, Delcy Rodriguez, was sworn in as Venezuela's interim president with words of support for Maduro but no indication she would fight the US move.

A recent US intelligence assessment determined Rodriguez would be best positioned to lead a temporary government in Maduro's absence, finding that opposition figures such as Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Corina Machado or onetime presidential candidate Edmundo Gonzalez would struggle to gain legitimacy, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the classified report.

While many anti-Maduro activists had assumed this would be their moment, Trump appeared to have sidelined the Venezuelan opposition for now. Instead, he has suggested Rodriguez was willing to work with Washington.

In Caracas, senior officials from Maduro's 13-year-old government remain in charge of the South American oil producer of 30 million people, alternating between spitting defiance and possible cooperation with the Trump administration.

The intelligence assessment concluded that Rodriguez was among the few Venezuelan leaders capable of maintaining order, along with the interior and defense ministers, in a government dominated by ideological opponents of the US, the Wall Street Journal said.

Rodriguez's brother, Jorge Rodriguez, was reappointed president of the overwhelmingly pro-Maduro National Assembly on Monday. He pledged "to use all procedures, forums and spaces" to bring Maduro back.

Trump told NBC News the US was not at war with Venezuela. Rather, "we're at war with the people that sell drugs," he said.

The US would need to help address the South American country's problems before any new elections, Trump said, calling a 30-day timeline for a vote unrealistic.

"We have to fix the country first. You can’t have an election. There’s no way the people could even vote," Trump told NBC.

Maduro is accused of overseeing a cocaine-trafficking network that partnered with violent groups including Mexico ’s Sinaloa and Zetas cartels, Colombian FARC rebels and Venezuela's Tren de Aragua gang.

He faces four criminal counts: narco-terrorism, cocaine importation conspiracy and possession of machine guns and destructive devices.

Maduro has long denied the allegations, saying they were a mask for imperialist designs on Venezuela's rich oil reserves. Trump has made no secret of wanting to share in Venezuela's oil riches. US oil companies' shares jumped on Monday, fueled by the prospect of access to those vast reserves.

While world leaders and US politicians grappled with the extraordinary seizure of a head of state, the United Nations Security Council debated the implications of the raid, which was condemned by Russia, China and leftist allies of Venezuela.

UN chief Antonio Guterres raised concerns about instability in Venezuela and the legality of Trump's strike, the most dramatic US intervention in Latin America since the 1989 Panama invasion. US Special Forces swooped into Caracas by helicopter on Saturday, shattered Maduro's security cordon and dragged him from the threshold of a safe room.

On Monday morning, Maduro – his hands zip-tied – and his wife were escorted by armed guards in tactical gear from a Brooklyn detention center to a helicopter bound for the Manhattan federal court. Shackled at the ankles and wearing orange and beige prison garb, Maduro listened to an interpreter through headphones as Judge Hellerstein summarised the charges.

Hellerstein asked Maduro to stand and confirm his identity. He replied in Spanish.

The judge told the couple of their right to inform the Venezuelan consulate of their arrests.

Prosecutors say Maduro has been involved in drug trafficking from the time he began serving in Venezuela's National Assembly in 2000 to his tenure as foreign minister and subsequent 2013 election as the late President Hugo Chavez 's successor.

Maduro lawyer Barry Pollack said he anticipated voluminous and complex litigation over what he called his client's "military abduction." He said Maduro was not requesting his release but may later.

Flores' lawyer, Mark Donnelly, said she sustained significant injuries including severe bruising on her ribs and asked that she be provided X-rays and a physical evaluation.

Federal prosecutors in New York first indicted Maduro in 2020 as part of a long-running narcotics trafficking case against current and former Venezuelan officials and Colombian guerrillas. An updated indictment made public on Saturday added some new details and co-defendants, including Flores.

The US has considered Maduro an illegitimate dictator since he declared victory in a 2018 election marred by allegations of massive irregularities.

Experts in international law have questioned the legality of the raid, with some condemning Trump's actions as a repudiation of a rules-based international order.

American oil companies will return to Venezuela and rebuild the sector's infrastructure, Trump told reporters on Air Force One on Sunday.

"We're taking back what they stole," Trump said. "We're in charge."

Trump said then that the administration had tipped off US oil companies about the operation, but in the NBC interview he said: "The oil companies were absolutely aware that we were thinking about doing something. But we didn’t tell them we were going to do it."

He added that the US may subsidize the rebuilding of the country's oil infrastructure by US majors, a project he said could be completed in less than 18 months.

CBS News, citing two unnamed sources, said representatives of oil majors Exxon Mobil, ConocoPhillips and Chevron Corp would meet with Energy Secretary Chris Wright on Thursday.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 03:42:03 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/d5d37160-ea98-11f0-90e9-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26005726470968-1.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Irish PM aims for deeper trade talks with China in Beijing</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/irish-pm-aims-deeper-trade-talks-with-china-beijing-2026-01-06/</link><description>BEIJING, Jan 6 (Reuters) - Ireland's Prime Minister Micheal Martin is set to have more in-depth talks on trade with China's No. 2 official on Tuesday, working to strengthen strategic ties with the world's second-largest economy amid frosty China-European Union relations.

Martin's scheduled meeting with Chinese Premier Li Qiang forms part of his five-day trip that he said would include "a significant economic dimension", a clip posted on the Irish Taoiseach's X handle on Monday evening showed.

The Irish leader was seen in the clip telling media that he would discuss with Li in "greater detail" trade issues such as beef exports and China's recently imposed tariffs on dairy, a day after a summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping.

"I discussed obviously the situation in terms of Irish beef exports into China, the tariff situation in respect of dairy products," Martin said, adding that Xi "undertook to engage with Chinese officials in respect of those specific issues."

Martin described his meeting with Xi on Monday as a "warm and constructive engagement", covering a range of issues including bilateral and EU-China ties.

"On a broader level, I think the President was keen that Europe and China would have a broader framework to govern trade into the future," he said.

Xi had told Martin during the meeting that China and the EU should "bear the long-term picture in mind", according to state news agency Xinhua.

Ties between China and the EU have been tense since the EU imposed levies on Chinese electric vehicle imports in 2024. China has since retaliated with a series of measures including the latest tariffs on EU dairy products .

Last week, China also set import quotas and additional tariffs on beef imports from this year, a move affecting global exporters of the meat into the Asian country.

The first Taoiseach to visit China since 2012, Martin has recently downplayed the Irish intelligence agency's portrayal of China as a "hostile state actor", preferring instead to adopt a long-term and strategic understanding of China.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 04:40:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/Z7BUYXXK6VIQXMW2WCX3AWWKTQ.jpg?auth=f1288f8087e343eee996cb63f8012469d73af86e984ca154d073a662addb228f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Over a dozen media workers detained in Venezuela, says national press association</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/over-dozen-media-workers-detained-venezuela-says-national-press-association-2026-01-06/</link><description>Jan 5 (Reuters) - More than a dozen media workers were detained on Monday while covering events in the Venezuelan capital Caracas, including a march in support of ousted President Nicolas Maduro and the swearing-in of the country's new legislature, the South American nation's press association said.

All 14 of those detained were later released, the press association (SNTP) said on X, though one was a foreign journalist who was deported.

SNTP said that those detained included 11 people working with international media outlets and one with a national outlet.

Reuters was unable to independently confirm all of the detentions.

Venezuela's information ministry, which handles all contact with the government, did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the detentions. Venezuela's Ministry of Communications also did not respond to requests for comment.

The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and CNN did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Reuters also did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The press detentions come after the U.S. military detained Maduro in an overnight operation this weekend. On Monday the deposed leader pleaded not guilty to narcoterrorism charges in a New York court.

His vice president, Delcy Rodriguez, has since taken the reins as interim leader.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:25:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/EVZGV7BHVBLYRLK3G4QX4I5TDY.jpg?auth=7b052cfb286afc2bb66dc7cc44db4b05182bc966d0c3ef0cb8ba6268d5c52052&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Dutch train traffic halted due to snow and ice</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/dutch-train-traffic-halted-due-snow-ice-2026-01-06/</link><description>AMSTERDAM, Jan 6 (Reuters) - Snow and ice continued to disrupt traffic in the Netherlands on Tuesday halting all trains and forcing the cancellation of hundreds of flights.

The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology, also known as Phivolcs, raised the alert to level three on a five-level scale, which means magma is pushing up inside the volcano and forming a lava dome at the summit.

Phivolcs urged residents within the 6-km no-go zone to evacuate because of risks like lava flows, falling rocks, and other hazards.

Mayon is the most active of 22 volcanoes in the Philippines, having erupted more than 50 times in the last four centuries. Its last magmatic eruption was in June 2023 when it spewed lava and noxious gases.

The most destructive eruption came in February 1841 when lava flows buried an entire town and killed 1,200 people.

The Philippines lies on the "Ring of Fire", a belt of volcanoes circling the Pacific Ocean that is also prone to earthquakes.

Phivolcs urged civil aviation authorities to advise pilots to avoid flying near Mayon's summit because ash from a sudden eruption can be hazardous to aircraft.

Since January 1, 2026, PHIVOLCS has recorded 346 rockfalls and 4 volcanic earthquakes, compared to 599 rockfalls in November–December 2025.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 07:29:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China, South Korea to carry out cultural exchanges in orderly manner, Beijing says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-south-korea-carry-out-cultural-exchanges-orderly-manner-beijing-says-2026-01-06/</link><description>BEIJING, Jan 6 (Reuters) - China and South Korea agreed to carry out cultural exchanges in an orderly manner, the Chinese foreign ministry said on Tuesday, when asked if Beijing would welcome South Korean culture exports in the future.

Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, made their first appearance in Hellerstein's Manhattan courtroom on Monday, pleading not guilty to narco-terrorism and other charges.

Maduro was indicted in 2020 in a sprawling drug trafficking case that has been before Hellerstein for nearly 15 years and has already seen the conviction of Venezuela 's former intelligence chief, Hugo Armando Carvajal.

A graduate of Columbia University law school, Hellerstein served as a lawyer in the US Army from 1957 to 1960 before entering private practice.

He was nominated by former president Bill Clinton in 1998 to be a district court judge for the Southern District of New York .

During his lengthy career, Hellerstein has presided over several civil cases stemming from the September 11, 2001 al Qaeda attacks on New York and Washington.

He has also tangled at times with US President Donald Trump , rejecting a request by the president to have his New York hush money case moved to federal court.

Hellerstein also blocked the Trump administration last year from deporting alleged Venezuelan gang members without a court hearing.

In September, he sentenced tech start-up highflier Charlie Javice to more than seven years in prison after she was convicted of defrauding JPMorgan Chase on a $175 million deal.

A decades-old border dispute between the Southeast Asian nations erupted into military clashes several times last year, with fighting in December killing dozens of people and displacing around one million on both sides.

The two countries agreed a fragile truce on December 27 , ending three weeks of clashes.

"Cambodia has violated the ceasefire" on Tuesday morning, the Thai army said in a statement, accusing Cambodian forces of firing mortar rounds into Thailand's Ubon Ratchathani province.

One soldier was wounded by shrapnel, it added.

The Thai army said in a later statement that the Cambodian side had contacted a Thai military unit and claimed "there was no intention to fire into Thai territory", adding "the incident was caused by an operational error by Cambodian personnel".

The Thai military said it warned Cambodian forces to exercise caution, stressing if a similar incident occurred, Thailand may need to retaliate.

Cambodia's defence ministry spokeswoman Maly Socheata said two Cambodian soldiers were injured, one severely, on Tuesday morning in Cambodia's Preah Vihear province, which sits opposite Thailand's Ubon Ratchathani.

While Cambodian forces were performing "organisation and orderliness" duties, "an explosion occurred from a pile of garbage", she said, resulting in the two injured soldiers being hospitalised.

Socheata did not mention the strike alleged by Thailand, but said both nations' border coordination teams had consulted on the incident involving the Cambodian soldiers and addressed the matter.

The explosion occurred in a frontier region known as the Emerald Triangle, Socheata added where the borders of both countries and Laos meet.

In May, a Cambodian soldier was killed in a firefight with Thai troops in the area, reigniting the border conflict.

Thailand's Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said his government had lodged a protest with Phnom Penh, stating "the truce was violated".

"At the military-to-military level, we have been told the incident was an accident, but we are seeking clarification on how responsibility will be taken," Anutin told reporters in Bangkok.

Charnvirakul added that Thailand had the "capability to respond" to Cambodia, which is vastly outgunned by its neighbour.

The nations' long-standing conflict stems from a dispute over the colonial-era demarcation of their 800-kilometre (500-mile) border, where both sides claim territory and centuries-old temple ruins.

Under the December truce, Cambodia and Thailand pledged to cease fire, freeze troop movements and cooperate on demining efforts along their border.

On December 31, Bangkok released 18 Cambodian soldiers held since July when border clashes that month killed dozens of people.

Thailand's foreign ministry said their release was "a demonstration of goodwill and confidence-building".

Phnom Penh said last week it remained "hopeful" that their return would "significantly contribute to building mutual trust".

The United States, China and Malaysia had brokered a truce to end the fighting between Cambodia and Thailand in July, but that ceasefire was short-lived.

On Saturday, one week after the December truce went into effect, Cambodia called on Thailand to pull out its forces from several border areas Phnom Penh claims as its own.

The Thai military has rejected claims it had used force to seize Cambodia territory, insisting its forces were present in areas that had always belonged to Thailand.

While the two nations agreed late last month to stop fighting, they still need to resolve the demarcation of their disputed border.

Cambodia's defence ministry said in a statement Tuesday that Phnom Penh had proposed a bilateral border committee meeting with Thai counterparts to be held in Cambodia's Siem Reap province this month.

Bangkok has said previously that meetings to discuss border surveying and demarcation may need to be held by Thailand's next government, following elections scheduled for February 8.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 09:27:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/c8a78fcc-ead3-11f0-a772-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25361164510579.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Maduro opponent Machado vows to return to Venezuela, wants election</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/maduro-opponent-machado-vows-return-venezuela-wants-election-2026-01-06/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 6 (Reuters) - Venezuela's main opposition leader Maria Corina Machado has vowed to return home quickly, praising U.S. President Donald Trump for toppling her enemy Nicolas Maduro and declaring her movement ready to win a free election.

"I'm planning to go back to Venezuela as soon as possible," said Machado, 58, a lawyer and mother-of-three who escaped from Venezuela in disguise in October to receive the Nobel Peace Prize, which she dedicated to Trump.

"We believe that this transition should move forward," she told Fox News in an interview late on Monday. "We won an election (in 2024) by a landslide under fraudulent conditions. In free and fair elections, we will win over 90% of the votes."

Machado said she had not spoken to Trump since October 10, when the Nobel award was announced. He has said the United States needs to help address Venezuela's problems before any new elections, calling a 30-day timeline for a vote unrealistic.

"We have to fix the country first. You can’t have an election. There’s no way the people could even vote," Trump told NBC.

In the interview, her first since Maduro was captured by the U.S. at the weekend, Machado did not give her location or any more details on plans to repatriate to Venezuela, where she is wanted for arrest and Socialist Party loyalists remain in power .

To the disappointment of opposition activists and the large diaspora - one in five Venezuelans have left during an economic implosion under Maduro and his predecessor Hugo Chavez - Trump has given little indication of backing Machado.

The opposition, some international observers and many U.S. allies say the opposition was cheated of victory in the 2024 election, from which Machado was banned and an ally stood instead, but Trump has said she lacks support in Venezuela.

The U.S. administration appears so far to be hoping to work with interim President Delcy Rodriguez , a diehard Maduro ally who has denounced his "kidnapping" while also calling for cooperation and respectful relations with Washington.

"Delcy Rodriguez, as you know, is one of the main architects of torture, persecution, corruption, narco-trafficking," Machado said. "She's a main ally and liaison of Russia, China, Iran, certainly not an individual who could be trusted by international investors and she's really rejected by the Venezuelan people."

Machado, who has galvanised an often fractured and demoralised opposition in the last few years, was fulsome in her praise of Trump, saying she would give him the Nobel prize personally.

"He has proven to the world what he means. January 3rd will go down in history as the day justice defeated a tyranny," she said of Saturday's raid on Venezuela.

"I do want to say today on behalf of the Venezuelan people how grateful we are for his courageous vision, the historical actions he has taken against this narco-terrorist regime ... It's a huge step towards a democratic transition."

With the largest oil reserves in the world and the U.S. as its main ally, Venezuela would become the energy hub of the Americas, restore rule of law, open markets, bring exiles home and provide security to foreign investment, Machado promised.

For now, however, Trump has been told by the CIA that Rodriguez and other senior officials from Maduro's government are the best bet to maintain stability, sources said.

They have ordered the arrest of anyone who collaborated with the seizure of Maduro and, in a sign of the nervous atmosphere in Venezuela, 14 media workers were briefly detained covering events in Caracas on Monday.

Footage verified by Reuters showed shots being fired into the night sky in Caracas, which a Venezuelan official said came from police to deter unauthorised drones.

"There was no confrontation, the entire country remains completely calm," vice minister of communications Simon Arrechider told reporters in a message.

Maduro, 63, pleaded not guilty on Monday to narcotics charges, He said he was a "decent man" and still president of Venezuela while standing in a Manhattan court shackled at the ankles and wearing orange and beige prison garb .

His wife Cilia Flores, who was also captured, pleaded innocent. They are next due in court on March 17.

Maduro is accused of overseeing a cocaine-trafficking network with international drug cartels and faces four criminal counts: narco-terrorism, cocaine importation conspiracy and possession of machine guns and destructive devices.

He has long denied the allegations, saying they were a mask for imperialist designs on Venezuela's oil reserves.

Venezuela has the world's largest reserves - about 303 billion barrels, mostly heavy oil in the Orinoco region. But the sector has long been in decline from mismanagement, under-investment and U.S. sanctions, averaging 1.1 million bpd output last year, a third of its output in the 1970s.

Maduro's vice president, Rodriguez, has been sworn in as interim leader as officials in Caracas waver between angry defiance and potential cooperation with Trump, who has threatened another military strike if they displease him.

Trump's actions, the biggest U.S. intervention in Latin America since the 1989 invasion of Panama, have brought condemnation from Russia, China and Venezuela's leftist allies. Legal experts have questioned its validity and many allies have urged adherence to international laws and dialogue.

Trump has said the U.S. is now in charge of Venezuela and will help revive its oil industry with the help of private companies.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 10:24:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/D37QWXG4AVKCJJVMLKZAJI5IDI.jpg?auth=fbfe4c142e7c5512354ce7973ea8bd701be6847d8aef4119c4a587120533ccd9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>No safety inspections at site of Swiss bar fire since 2019, mayor says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/no-safety-inspections-done-site-swiss-bar-fire-between-2020-25-says-mayor-2026-01-06/</link><description>GENEVA, Jan 6 - No safety inspections were carried out since 2019 at the Swiss bar that burst into flames at New Year, killing 40 people, the mayor of the town of Crans-Montana said on Tuesday.

"We are profoundly sorry. We did not have an indication that the checks had not been done," Crans-Montana Mayor Nicolas Feraud told reporters on the absence of fire checks between 2020-2025.

The mayor added that the sound-proof foam used in the bar "Le Constellation" was considered acceptable at the time.

Prosecutors have said that the fire that spread rapidly in the early hours of January 1 was likely caused by sparkling candles igniting the ceiling of the bar's basement.

All sparkler candles have now been banned inside venues, said the mayor at the press conference.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 10:25:08 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4BLMEVFPKZPFRP2CZOHBSQMPDM.jpg?auth=f108ef0dfbdddbbf38a0e47b05b575b4c127cb291344d92cc20bf4f7edf7f075&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Pope Leo, closing Catholic Holy Year, urges kindness to foreigners</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/pope-leo-closing-catholic-holy-year-urges-kindness-foreigners-2026-01-06/</link><description>VATICAN CITY, Jan 6 (Reuters) - Pope Leo closed the Catholic Church's Holy Year on Tuesday by sealing shut the special "Holy Door" in St. Peter's Basilica and urging Christians worldwide to help those in need and treat foreigners with kindness.

Leo, who has made care for immigrants a central theme of his early papacy, said at a Vatican ceremony that the record 33.5 million pilgrims who visited Rome during the Holy Year should have learned not to treat humans as mere "products".

"Around us, a distorted economy tries to profit from everything," said the pope. "After this year, will we be better able to recognise a pilgrim in the visitor, a seeker in the stranger, a neighbour in the foreigner?"

Holy years, or jubilees, typically occur every 25 years and are considered a time of peace, forgiveness and pardon. Pilgrims to Rome can enter special "Holy Doors" at four Rome basilicas, and can attend papal audiences throughout the year.

At 9:41 a.m. (0841 GMT) on Tuesday, Leo, dressed in gold-trimmed robes, pulled shut the special bronze door at St. Peter's, officially ending the year.

The next jubilee is not expected before 2033, when the Church may have a special one to mark 2,000 years since the death of Jesus.

Vatican and Italian officials said on Monday that pilgrims to Rome for the 2025 jubilee came from 185 countries , with Italy, the United States, Spain, Brazil and Poland leading the pack.

The 2025 jubilee was marked by an historical rarity not seen for 300 years. It was opened by one pope, Francis, and closed by his successor, Leo.

Francis died in April after 12 years leading the 1.4-billion-member Church. The last jubilee held under two popes was in the year 1700, when Clement XI closed a holy year opened by Innocent XII.

Leo, who has pledged to keep Francis' signature policies such as welcoming gay Catholics and discussing women's ordination , echoed the late pope's frequent criticisms of the global economic system on Tuesday.

Leo, the first U.S. pope, lamented that the markets "turn human yearnings of seeking, travelling and beginning again into a mere business."</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 10:25:19 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/32HIYYETORKJPFG6FNQERXZ4AE.jpg?auth=2c1ac84944aea09dffc675bcd06985e920d8e4d75eff59580e73cd16f4a6082d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Former Uvalde school officer accused of failing to act against shooter who killed 19 students, two teachers</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/former-uvalde-school-officer-accused-failing-act-against-shooter-who-killed-19-2026-01-06/</link><description>Jan 6 (Reuters) - One of the first police officers on the scene of the 2022 attack at a Texas elementary school that killed 19 students and two teachers is now the first to stand trial, accused of failing to act as the gunman continued one of the deadliest mass killings targeting students in U.S. history.

Opening arguments were to begin Tuesday in the trial of Adrian Gonzales, 52, who was a member of the school district police force. Hundreds of officers from local, state and federal agencies waited 77 minutes before entering a classroom where the gunman was holed up. Teachers and children made lengthy calls to 911 emergency services, saying they were in the room with the gunman and surrounded by bodies.

Gonzales was charged in 2024 with 29 counts of child endangerment, according to his indictment, which said that he "failed to engage, distract, and delay the shooter" and that he also failed "to follow his active shooter training to respond to gun fire by advancing toward the gun fire."

Each count carries the possibility of two years in prison. Gonzales has pleaded not guilty. Gonzales' attorney, Nico LaHood, has said that his client showed up to help children, and that he did in fact help many evacuate.

Pedro "Pete" Arredondo, the former chief of the Uvalde schools police and the person who investigators say was the officer in charge of the scene, faces 10 counts of the same charge. His trial has not yet been scheduled.

State and federal investigations into the shooting found that officers left the 18-year-old gunman alone inside the classroom with children while weighing how to confront him.

By the time a tactical team led by Border Patrol officers stormed in, the toll had reached among the worst in the history of a country known for high-profile school shootings.

Debates between proponents of gun control measures and defenders of the constitutional right to bear arms have resulted in few restrictions on firearms in the United States compared to other industrialized nations.

Former U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland, in remarks made while presenting the federal report on Uvalde in 2024 , said that "lives would have been saved" had the police immediately confronted the gunman.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 10:25:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/6EH5QJBDIBLIBERK2RQKM5H5OA.jpg?auth=f9be34713ee46540414f5a76bdfccbdef6142de2f051ea2bd3d53fab9dc94eca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Tourists on remote Yemeni island stranded after Saudi, UAE rift</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/tourists-remote-yemeni-island-stranded-after-saudi-uae-rift-2026-01-06/</link><description>DUBAI, Jan 6 - When the United Arab Emirates withdrew its troops from Yemen last week under a deadline from Saudi Arabia, it also left behind the remote Yemeni island of Socotra and the roughly 600 tourists who had flown in but could no longer fly out.

Air traffic at the island's main airport came to a halt as a deepening crisis between the UAE and Saudi Arabia translated into fresh conflict on Yemen's mainland, where the two Gulf powers now back opposing groups in the country's civil war .

“Nobody has any information and everyone just wants to go back to their normal lives," said Aurelija Krikstaponiene, a Lithuanian who travelled to Socotra over New Year's Eve.

She was meant to fly back to Abu Dhabi on Sunday, but now may find herself having to travel through Jeddah in Saudi Arabia instead, as Emirati control over the island wanes.

Socotra, which lies more than 300 km (186 miles) south of Yemen's coast, and until recently was mainly accessible by air via the UAE, has been a haven of tranquillity through the years of conflict on the mainland.

For tourists, it offers magical beaches and unique flora, such as its renowned Socotra dragon blood tree. It sits in the Gulf of Aden, alongside a shipping route leading to the Red Sea.

But Socotra came under effective UAE control in 2018 when Emirati military transport planes first landed on the island.

The tanks and troops that unloaded were part of the UAE's push to extend its sway over the region's waters, including the Bab al-Mandab Strait between the Horn of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.

A major oil producer and business hub, the UAE has in the past decade pursued an assertive foreign policy, carving its own sphere of influence in the Middle East and beyond, often using its financial clout to serve its interests.

"Socotra functions like an unsinkable aircraft carrier sitting at the heart of the Bab al-Mandab system, in the middle of the trade corridor that links Europe, Asia and Africa," said Andreas Krieg, associate professor at King's College London.

"Even without firing a shot, an actor with reliable access to the island gains important leverage: to observe, to potentially intercept and project influence."

Less than eight years on, that plan is being derailed by the severest public rift the UAE has had with its fellow Gulf ally and oil-power Saudi Arabia.

The two Gulf countries have navigated many differences in the past, from geopolitcs to oil output, but this latest fallout has brought their disagreements out in the open.

Saudi Arabia has been carrying out airstrikes to aid Yemeni government troops against UAE-backed southern separatists, the same ones who run Socotra.

UAE troops were not initially welcome when they first landed in 2018, with the Saudi-backed Yemeni government accusing Abu Dhabi of seizing the island's ports and airports.

But the UAE exerted control through the separatist Southern Transitional Council (STC) which now finds itself in direct confrontation with the Saudi-backed government forces on mainland Yemen. The STC seeks autonomy for southern Yemen, and ultimately independence, from the more heavily populated north.

The STC is still in control of the island today but the airport is no longer under Emirati control, two airport sources told Reuters. The facility remains shut.

Yemeni airlines said late on Monday it would operate a flight to Jeddah on January 7, a sure sign that control of the airport has shifted.

"On an island where air access often becomes the decisive gateway, influence over connectivity translates into influence over everything else, including security presence, local governance, and commercial life," Krieg said.

The UAE did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether all of its troops had left the island. One source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters the troops left last month.

Saudi Arabia's government media office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on control of the airport.

“We have a limited amount of cash, and most people will run out in two or three days," Maciej, a Polish tourist who is part of a group of 100 others, told Reuters.

"There are no payment terminals or ATMs here and bank transfers are also inoperable. Everything relies on cash. When it runs out, we'll be sleeping rough and relying on food aid from local residents," he said, adding that he was not warned about the probability of conflict when he booked his trip.

With the Emirati presence since 2018 came money poured into infrastructure projects through the Sheikh Khalifa Foundation humanitarian organisation, bringing electricity, safe water and cooking gas to Socotra.

The UAE also renovated the main airport, adding new buildings, two hangars and a modern navigation system for the control towers.

The once sleepy island turned into a niche tourist destination where travellers looking for terrain off the beaten track could book packages solely through Abu Dhabi to experience the island's beaches and wildlife.

Many did not factor in the risk of proximity to turmoil in Yemen, one of the world's worst humanitarian disasters.

Socotra, which is closer to Somalia than it is to Yemen, had so far been isolated from the civil war that has ravaged the mainland for over 10 years.

But this latest flare-up may not spare its peace.

Still, Romanian Bianca Cus is trying to enjoy the remainder of her time on the island until a flight comes in.

"I am enjoying each day on the island, just as I did before we found out that we would be staying longer," she said.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 10:25:42 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/MYG4LZHAPFOVPIOGMGPSKCKEDE.jpg?auth=5589291ba4e33fcabe2fa0b9b58e1bbbdcabfbef2202e6c6ed1b2a003c68e074&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Malaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, in hospital after hip fracture</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/malaysia-ex-pm-mahathir-100-hospital-after-hip-fracture-2026-01-06/</link><description>KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 6 (Reuters) - Malaysian 100-year-old former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad has been admitted to hospital after suffering a hip fracture following a fall at his residence early on Tuesday, his office said.

The centenarian, widely credited for transforming Malaysia into an industrial nation during his first stint as premier from 1981 to 2003, has a history of heart problems and has been in and out of hospital in recent years, including for bypass surgeries.

He was last admitted to hospital for fatigue following a picnic celebration for his 100th birthday last July.

Mahathir was prime minister over two separate stints, with the first lasting 22 years.

The ministry said the two Palestinian mobile operators - Jawwal and Ooredoo - and Swedish infrastructure firm Ericsson (ERICb.ST) , opens new tab signed management agreements that were approved by Israel on Sunday.

Palestinian cellular providers launched high-speed data services in the occupied West Bank based on 3G in 2018, narrowing a technological gap with Israel after a lengthy Israeli ban on the operation of local 3G networks.

The ministry said its approval came as part of a 2022 framework deal between Israel and the Palestinian Authority aimed at allowing 4G and 5G cellular technologies. The agreement was delayed by the Gaza war, according to Israeli media, which also said the process to upgrade to 4G would take up to six months.

The Palestinian providers compete with Israeli cellular firms, which operate faster on much faster 5G mobile frequencies.

Israel is in the process of shutting down older 2G and 3G technologies and has advised the public to equip themselves with devices that support 4G and 5G.

In Gaza, however, only 2G networks are available.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 11:20:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ET6UMJHEF5P3NDG3CA2H2MDWFA.jpg?auth=963a2b1978a08f67331c28f5e9f4c2dc0fc8d80e24cc2ea060ab0b905592b6f7&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US House Democrats holding January 6 riot forum on Trump election 'threats'</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-house-democrats-holding-january-6-riot-forum-trump-election-threats-2026-01-06/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 6 (Reuters) - Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives will mark the fifth anniversary of a deadly attack on the U.S. Capitol by supporters of President Donald Trump with an unofficial hearing that will probe "ongoing threats" to elections and public safety.

Democrats, as the minority party in Congress, do not have the power to set the legislative agenda, but they can hold informal events to highlight their proposals and criticize Republicans.

"We will examine ongoing threats to free and fair elections," House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said in a statement announcing the forum. He said it also will look into Trump's pardons of more than 1,500 people who were criminally charged with participating in the January 6 violence.

The Trump administration has sought states' voter registration lists, leading to fears the information could be misused. Trump has urged states to abandon mail-in ballots and has hinted at running for a third presidential term in 2028, which would violate the U.S. Constitution.

The January 6, 2021 riot, a failed attempt by thousands of Trump supporters to overturn Trump's 2020 defeat by Democrat Joe Biden, sent lawmakers running for their lives and injured about 140 law enforcement officers.

Four people died during the chaos, including a Trump supporter who was shot dead by police. One police officer, who was attacked by protesters, died the following day. Four other police officers subsequently died by suicide.

Trump insisted the election was stolen from him through fraud, even though he lost a series of court cases challenging the election result.

Some Republicans blamed far-left activists for the attack, and party lawmakers set up a new committee last year to "uncover the full truth" from that day.

“True accountability requires focusing on facts, not selective storytelling for partisan gain," the chairman of the subcommittee, Barry Loudermilk, said in reference to the Democrats' hearing.

Also on Tuesday, Enrique Tarrio, a former leader of the Proud Boys far-right militant group who was found guilty of helping to plan the riot, has announced a "patriotic and peaceful march" to honor the memory of protesters who died that day. He received a 22-year sentence for seditious conspiracy but was subsequently pardoned by Trump.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 11:20:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/335557FVUJJSHEUOWYHLOB22UU.jpg?auth=ae61eee01192e8535c65c1ac07aaf1ef9452edc01cf880948bd38335736c11a0&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Mexico condemns attack on Venezuela while seeking to avoid its fate</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/mexico-condemns-attack-venezuela-while-seeking-avoid-its-fate-2026-01-06/</link><description>MEXICO CITY, Jan 6 (Reuters) - In the wake of the U.S. attack on Venezuela , the Mexican government has found itself traversing the most delicate balancing act since President Donald Trump began his second term: strongly condemning the operation while doubling down on bilateral cooperation lest Mexico find itself in Trump’s crosshairs next.

On Saturday, hours after the elite U.S. special forces captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife in their home, Trump floated the prospect of U.S. military action inside Mexico, saying drug cartels are “running” the country and that “something is gonna have to be done with Mexico.”

The weekend’s events clearly rattled Mexico’s President Claudia Sheinbaum . She started her daily morning press conference on Monday reading from a document that detailed Mexico’s position on Venezuela.

“We categorically reject intervention in the internal affairs of other countries,” she said. “The history of Latin America is clear and compelling: intervention has never brought democracy, never generated well-being, nor lasting stability.”

Sheinbaum’s comments rank among her sharpest criticisms of Washington since Trump took office and are among the strongest rebukes in the region of Maduro’s ouster.

Security analysts said Sheinbaum’s fierce condemnation of the attack signaled that she would not tolerate similar actions against drug traffickers in Mexico. The U.S. Justice Department has charged Maduro with crimes related to drug trafficking, terrorism and weapons; he pleaded not guilty in a New York courthouse on Monday and declared himself "a prisoner of war."

But behind the scenes, Mexico City is likely to move even closer to Washington in the wake of the Venezuela attack, hoping that increasingly tight bilateral security cooperation will stave off U.S. aggressions, Mexican officials and security analysts said.

"Increasing joint security cooperation and strengthening Mexico's own fight against the cartels will be key to avoiding unilateral U.S. military intervention," said a Mexican security official who spoke on condition of anonymity.

Security analysts say the attack on Venezuela significantly elevated the stakes for Mexico City by signaling just how far Trump is willing to go to assert U.S. dominance in Latin America.

“It served as a warning to the entire region,” said Mexican security analyst Carlos Perez Ricart. “(Sheinbaum) is walking a very fine line: declaring a firm stance against intervention but also doing the only thing Mexico can do with such an asymmetrical power dynamic: continue to cooperate with the U.S.”

Over the last year, Sheinbaum has successfully traversed this political tight rope, defending Mexico's sovereignty while placating Washington with two mass expulsions to the U.S. of alleged high-level cartel operatives and undertaking a year-long military offensive against the Sinaloa Cartel.

Such actions have drawn praise from top U.S. officials.

“I think that the ongoing bilateral investigations and cooperation has been moving in the right direction,” said Derek Maltz, who served as acting administrator of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration at the beginning of Trump’s second term. He said he doesn’t anticipate U.S. military action in Mexico in the near future.

David Mora, a senior analyst with the International Crisis Group, said he expected to see the Mexican government engage in joint military operations with the U.S., something it hasn’t done to date. “Pressure on Sheinbaum will increase.”

LAW OF THE JUNGLE

As the fallout over Venezuela continues, officials in Mexico weighed the possibility - however remote - of a military attack. While few believe Washington would target Mexican leadership as it did with Maduro, even a unilateral move against drug cartels would deliver a severe blow to the government, undermining its authority and violating the sovereignty it has vowed to defend.

“It would be an international catastrophe,” said Mexican Congressman Alfonso Ramirez Cuellar, a close ally of Sheinbaum’s, who said that he didn’t think Washington would go so far because of the two countries’ close relationship on security and trade, and Mexico’s “strong disposition to collaborate and cooperate” with the U.S. "The world can't live in the law of the jungle."

Analysts, including Perez Ricart, said they thought U.S. attention would turn to other Latin American countries before Mexico, after Trump criticized the leadership of Colombia and Cuba on Sunday.

The Mexican security official agreed.

"Until we see (attacks in) Colombia and Cuba, then we’ll know that we're next," the official said.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 11:20:21 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/EI4PK36HWBKVFL6ROLDPYCRYZA.jpg?auth=09116e109e6540a164114f6859e070b9f8014ce450be50dc3013ea9a260be3ff&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>World is less safe after US action in Venezuela, says UN Human Rights Office</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/world-is-less-safe-after-us-action-venezuela-says-un-human-rights-office-2026-01-06/</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 11:20:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>AI dominates CES 2026 as annual Las Vegas tech trade show kicks off</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/ai-dominates-ces-2026-as-annual-las-vegas-tech-trade-show-kicks-off</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 11:21:10 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/74b33a08-eaef-11f0-812d-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/capture-2118707930695cec3620ae60-75061477.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Central African President leads provisional results in controversial election</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/central-african-president-leads-provisional-results-in-controversial-election</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 11:21:12 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/1b6afe4a-ea90-11f0-8f22-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25362450874462.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Algeria and DR Congo go head to head in one of AFCON's last round of 16 clashes</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/algeria-and-dr-congo-go-head-to-head-in-one-of-afcon-s-last-round-of-16-clashes</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 11:21:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/8ac53940-ea6d-11f0-bb50-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/000-89D4778.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Final pilgrims cross Holy Door as Vatican claims Jubilee success</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/final-pilgrims-cross-holy-door-as-vatican-claims-jubilee-success</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 11:21:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/b28d7e30-eaed-11f0-b671-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/capture-1828210257695ce942715d14-57882319.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Worries that Venezuela crisis could shift US focus away from Ukraine amid key talks</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/worries-that-venezuela-crisis-could-shift-us-focus-away-from-ukraine-amid-key-talks</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 11:21:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/fbdc0d7c-e0b1-11f0-b357-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/Zelensky-Witkoff.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Rights groups say at least 25 dead in Iran protests</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/rights-groups-say-least-25-dead-iran-protests-2026-01-06/</link><description>DUBAI, Jan 6 (Reuters) - At least 25 people have been killed in Iran during the first nine days of protests that started in the bazaar of Tehran over the plunging value of the currency and soaring inflation, according to rights groups.

The protests have spread to some cities in western and southern Iran but do not match the scale of unrest that swept the nation in 2022-23 over the death of Mahsa Amini, who died in the custody of Iran's morality police for allegedly violating the Islamic Republic's strict dress code.

However, even though smaller, these protests have quickly expanded from an economic focus to broader frustrations, with some protesters chanting against the country's clerical rulers.

Iran also remains under international pressure, with U.S. President Donald Trump threatening on Friday to come to the aid of protesters in Iran if security forces fired on them. In response, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed not to "yield to the enemy".

Hengaw, a Kurdish Iranian rights group, put the death toll at 25, including four people under 18. It said more than 1,000 people had been arrested. HRANA, a network of rights activists, said at least 29 had been killed, including two law enforcement agents, in addition to 1,203 arrests, as of January 5.

Reuters has not been able to independently verify the numbers. Iranian authorities have not given a death toll for protesters, but have said at least two members of the security services have died and more than a dozen have been injured in the unrest.

"While drawing a distinction between protesters and rioters, law enforcement has dealt with strength against rioters by arresting them on the scene or later following identification by intelligence units," Iran's police chief Ahmadreza Radan was quoted by state media on Tuesday as saying.

"I pledge that we will deal with the last of these rioters. It is still time for those who were deceived by foreign services to identify themselves and draw on the Islamic Republic’s greatness."

HRANA said that during the protests, slogans have gone beyond economic demands and included criticism of governance and calls for justice. Protests have so far occurred in 27 provinces out of 31 and expanded to smaller cities, it said.

Authorities have acknowledged economic hardships but accused networks linked to foreign powers of "pushing economic protests toward chaos and disorder", with the judiciary chief pledging to have no mercy toward "rioters".

President Masoud Pezeshkian has urged dialogue and promised reforms to stabilise the monetary and banking systems and protect purchasing power.

The government has announced a subsidy reform, removing preferential currency exchange rates for importers in favour of direct transfers to Iranians to boost their purchasing power for essential goods. The measure will come into force on January 10.

The central bank chief was also replaced on December 29.

The rial fell further to 1,489,500 on Tuesday, representing a 4% fall since the protests started.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 11:41:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/OF2RYJRB6ZPB5NJEKB4XKLD3HU.jpg?auth=461f52864b619be8b834871e45181199a26d854fdc812d58504cc32a9b4679cd&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israeli foreign minister visiting Somaliland, sources say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-foreign-minister-visiting-somaliland-sources-say-2026-01-06/</link><description>NAIROBI/JERUSALEM, Jan 6 (Reuters) - Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar is on a visit to Somaliland in East Africa, where he is due to meet the semi-autonomous region's president later on Tuesday, according to a senior Somaliland official.

A second source briefed on the visit confirmed the foreign minister was in Somaliland, without providing further details. The Israeli foreign ministry did not immediately respond when asked if the foreign minsiter was in Somaliland.

The visit comes 10 days after Israel formally recognised the self-declared Republic of Somaliland as an independent and sovereign state, a move that sparked criticism from Somalia, which has long opposed Somaliland's bid to secede.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 11:41:27 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5ZF7VNKVR5OXTAJCMUJPP2WYWU.jpg?auth=d6ef7a909cadafa0b4df469890bf2d73c19b38d71032327fc5776d2ecf46fcb7&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Slovenia's president calls parliamentary election for March 22</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/slovenias-president-calls-parliamentary-election-march-22-2026-01-06/</link><description>Jan 6 (Reuters) - Slovenia's President Natasa Pirc-Musar signed a decree on Tuesday calling a regular parliamentary election for March 22, according to a statement from the president's office.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 11:41:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/6MGIWUXIAFL2HNCPYWXFVGNMDY.jpg?auth=c33cf951a744cdf46289ecd54e14abb767135fbae2c495ea76df6775bce07e64&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Maduro pleads "not guilty" as he faces drug trafficking charges in the US</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/maduro-pleads-not-guilty-as-he-faces-drug-trafficking-charges-in-the-us</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 11:42:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/c4072f3c-eaf0-11f0-8eb7-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260106-120134-120320-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>European leaders back Denmark in face of renewed US interest in Greenland</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/only-greenland-denmark-can-decide-their-future-european-leaders-say-joint-2026-01-06/</link><description>COPENHAGEN, Jan 6 (Reuters) - Leaders from major European powers expressed support for Denmark and Greenland on Tuesday in a joint statement, saying the Arctic island belongs to its people, following renewed interest by U.S. President Donald Trump in taking over the Danish territory.

"Greenland belongs to its people. It is for Denmark and Greenland, and them only, to decide on matters concerning Denmark and Greenland," said the statement by leaders of France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, Britain, and Denmark.

The leaders said that security in the Arctic must be achieved collectively with NATO allies, including the United States.

"NATO has made clear that the Arctic region is a priority and European Allies are stepping up," the statement said. "We and many other Allies have increased our presence, activities and investments, to keep the Arctic safe and to deter adversaries."

Trump has said repeatedly he wants to take over Greenland and told The Atlantic magazine on Sunday: "We do need Greenland, absolutely. We need it for defence."

A U.S. military operation at the weekend which led to the capture of Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro has further rekindled concerns among Washington's NATO allies that Greenland might face a similar scenario.

Greenland, the world's largest island with a population of 57,000 people, is not an independent member of NATO but is covered by Denmark's membership of the Western military alliance.

The island's strategic location between Europe and North America makes it a critical site for the U.S. ballistic missile defence system. Its mineral wealth also aligns with Washington's ambition to reduce reliance on Chinese exports.

Greenland's Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said on Monday that his government was seeking to strengthen ties with the United States and that citizens should not fear an imminent U.S. takeover.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 12:45:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7O5AAB6PGJL45KE3WSUNM2X4H4.jpg?auth=3249739d42dda3975a8cd27765727b9da3679073b8e79460da66ebe9dda42d7d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ruling coalition in eastern German state collapses</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/ruling-coalition-eastern-german-state-collapses-2026-01-06/</link><description>BERLIN, Jan 6 (Reuters) - The centre-left premier of the eastern German state of Brandenburg said on Tuesday he would run a minority government pending talks to form a new majority after the coalition with the far-left Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW) collapsed.

The political turbulence in Brandenburg, the region around the capital Berlin, is unlikely to have any immediate impact on conservative Chancellor Friedrich Merz's national coalition.

But it underlines the volatility in German politics, notably in eastern Germany, ahead of a series of state and local elections this year. The elections, including two in eastern states, could see the already weakening support for the traditional centre-right and centre-left parties in Merz's coalition further eroded.

Brandenburg Premier Dietmar Woidke said repeated disagreements with the BSW made further cooperation impossible. He ruled out new state elections and said he would seek talks with the centre-right Christian Democratic Union - Merz's party - to see whether a new coalition could be formed to succeed the one formed with BSW in November 2024.

In the meantime, he would run the government with his existing ministers, including Finance Minister Robert Crumbach, whose decision to quit the BSW triggered the crisis.

The BSW, formed as a breakaway from the Left party, the successor to the old East German Communist Party, combines left-wing economic policies with calls for immigration restrictions and opposition to military support for Ukraine.

But it has struggled to contain infighting over leadership and strategy, and Wagenknecht, a former co-leader of the Left, herself stepped down as party leader last year.

As well as Crumbach, who accused BSW members of refusing to accept the responsibilities of government, two other BSW state lawmakers resigned, leaving the coalition without a majority.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 12:46:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/J7RMCARKTVKYZIVAIZILDJFAYE.jpg?auth=e4202c06f7e88a91351d6cdae0aa3918299abde59936762bebdcf98ad587e844&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>At least nine Nigerian soldiers killed in bomb blast</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/at-least-nine-nigerian-soldiers-killed-in-bomb-blast</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 12:47:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/99be6d38-eafc-11f0-9be2-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/capture-1850478582695d02439e0f87-71255327.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Buy a king's cake, win a car: French tradition with a twist</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/buy-a-king-s-cake-win-a-car-french-tradition-with-a-twist</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 12:47:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/5f289e18-eaf3-11f0-919e-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260106-111308-111413-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Capture of Maduro by US means Russia, Iran and China lose key ally</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/capture-of-maduro-by-us-means-russia-iran-and-china-lose-key-ally</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 12:47:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/0f56ad42-eaf5-11f0-ba5a-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/capture-1052902815695cf59ceb08b3-14102670.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Who are the key figures in Maduro's trial?</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/who-are-the-key-figures-in-maduro-s-trial</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 12:47:43 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/3c88cadc-ead4-11f0-9818-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/2023-06-27T221052Z-2002262556-RC2YR1ARPQ24-RTRMADP-3-USA-TRUMP-NEW-YORK.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Kyiv allies meet in Paris to discuss security guarantees for Ukraine</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/kyiv-allies-meet-in-paris-to-discuss-security-guarantees-for-ukraine</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 12:47:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/2ee4df88-eaf2-11f0-80ee-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260106-120810-121339-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Swiss officials admit safety inspections lapse at bar where 40 died in NYE fire</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260106-swiss-officials-admit-safety-inspections-lapse-bar-where-40-died-nye</link><description>Swiss authorities admitted Tuesday that fire safety inspections had not been carried out for the past five years at a bar where 40 people died in a New Year blaze.

The inferno at Le Constellation in the Swiss Alpine ski resort of Crans-Montana in southwest left 116 people injured , of whom 83 are still in various hospitals. Most of those killed were teenagers.

Prosecutors have said they believe the fire started when people celebrating the New Year raised champagne bottles with sparklers attached, setting light to sound-insulating foam on the ceiling of the basement bar.

Although inspections including fire safety were conducted in 2016, 2018 and 2019, "periodic inspections were not conducted between 2020 and 2025. We bitterly regret this," Crans-Montana mayor Nicolas Feraud told a press conference, five days on from the disaster.

The law requires the municipal fire department to conduct annual inspections in establishments open to the public, he said, admitting that he did not know why the visits had not been carried out.

In a statement, the municipality said it discovered the failure after going through documents sent to the Wallis canton prosecutor's office.

"The courts will determine the influence that such a failure had in the chain of events leading up to the tragedy. The municipality will assume full responsibility as determined by the courts," the statement said.

The council said it would commission a specialist external agency to inspect all public establishments and would ban pyrotechnic devices indoors.

"The municipality of Crans-Montana remains fully committed to supporting the victims of this tragedy and their families and loved ones, who are constantly in its thoughts," the statement said.

"It will continue to do everything in its power to ensure that such a tragedy never happens again."

French couple Jacques and Jessica Moretti owned and managed Le Constellation, which was crammed with young partygoers when the blaze erupted at around 1:30am on Thursday.

A criminal investigation has been opened against the pair. They are charged with manslaughter by negligence, bodily harm by negligence and arson by negligence.

Le Constellation was established in 1967. Reports in the municipal files reference a capacity limit of 100 people on the ground floor and 100 in the basement, Tuesday's statement said.

According to photos taken by the owners in 2015 during renovations that the municipality said "did not require a permit", the sound insulation foam had been stuck on the ceiling since then.

A video filmed by a member of the public, screened Monday by Swiss broadcaster RTS, showed that the danger was known years ago.

"Watch out for the foam!", a bar employee said during 2019 New Year's Eve celebrations, as champagne bottles with sparklers were brought out.

"The security chiefs who inspected this bar (between 2015 and 2020) should probably have been more careful," admitted Feraud, who ruled out resigning for the time being.

"I will carry this burden and the sorrow of all these families for the rest of my life," he concluded, visibly shaken.

The most severely burned survivors have been airlifted to specialist burns centres in Switzerland and abroad.

The average age of those killed was 19. Eight of the dead were aged under 16.

While the majority of those killed were Swiss, nine French and six Italian nationals were among the dead.

"This tragedy could have been avoided" and "should have been avoided through prevention and common sense," Gian Lorenzo Cornado, Rome's ambassador to Switzerland, said Monday.

Switzerland has declared a national day of mourning for Friday.

A memorial ceremony honouring the victims is planned in Martigny, down the Rhone valley from Crans-Montana, with French President Emmanuel Macron expected to attend.

All church bells in Switzerland were to toll at 2:00pm (1300 GMT). A moment of silence is also planned.

Italy and France last month dashed hopes for a December deal, saying they were not ready to support it until farmer fears of an influx of cheap commodities from Mercosur, such as beef and sugar, were resolved.

All 27 EU agriculture ministers have been invited to the meeting at the Commission, the EU presidency holder Cyprus said on Tuesday, although it was not clear yet how many would attend.

European commissioners for agriculture, trade and health are expected to give reassurances over future funding for farmers under the EU's Common Agricultural Policy, including a 6.3 billion euro ($7.4 billion) crisis fund in the next EU budget.

The Commission's move to merge regional cohesion funds and CAP money in the next seven-year budget alarmed farming nations.

In a letter to Cyprus's president and the head of the European Parliament on Tuesday, Commission President Ursula von der Leyen proposed accelerating 45 billion euros of support to farmers and reiterated that the 2028-2034 budget would guarantee them 293.7 billion euros.

The Commission will also review import controls, including permissible maximum levels of pesticide residues, two EU diplomats said.

"It is a critical moment to discuss demands from farmers," one of the diplomats said.

The EU executive, supported by EU-Mercosur proponents such as Germany and Spain, is seeking to garner the broad majority of 15 EU members representing 65% of the EU population required to authorise the EU signature, possibly as early as January 12.

They say the accord, which has been 25 years in the making and would be the EU's largest in terms of tariff reductions, is vital to boosting exports hit by U.S. import taxes and to reduce reliance on China by securing access to critical minerals.

With Poland and Hungary opposed to the deal and France critical, the position of Italy will be a key determinant of whether the deal can be signed. A vote is expected on Friday.

The Commission had held discussions with member states over the past two weeks and the bloc was on track to sign the agreement soon, a spokesperson for the executive said.

Italy is not opposed to the deal, two Italian sources told Reuters on Tuesday, but wanted assurances - notably on reciprocity - so that imported farm products meet EU health and environmental standards. These were due to be discussed on Wednesday.

A second EU diplomat said Italy was not yet fully on board.

One of the sources added that price floors for rare earths would be a point of discussion, among other critical mineral topics.

G7 countries, except Japan, are heavily or exclusively reliant on China for a range of materials from rare earth magnets to battery metals. In June last year, the G7 agreed on an action plan to secure their supply chains and boost their economies.

Officials began discussing price floors last year to make investments in critical minerals outside China economically viable. The United States was the first to set a minimum price in a contract for domestic rare earths supplies last year.

KLM said its 25 de-icing trucks have been in continuous use in Amsterdam, its main hub, consuming around 85,000 litres per day of the mixture of heated water and glycol it uses to clear departing aircraft of snow and ice before take off.

"Since Friday KLM has been de-icing aircraft at Schiphol around the clock using de-icing fluid delivered daily," the Dutch arm of airline group Air France-KLM (AIRF.PA) , opens new tab said.

"Due to a combination of extreme weather conditions and delays in supply from the provider, stock levels are running low. This challenge is currently widespread across Europe," it added.

KLM said employees had been sent to its supplier in Germany to pick up more de-icing fluid, and it could not give a specific timeframe for when it might run out if stocks are not replenished.

"We are doing everything we can to prevent it," KLM spokesperson Anoesjka Aspeslagh said.

Schiphol airport, meanwhile, said it still had ample supplies of a different type of de-icing fluid it uses to remove ice and snow from runways.

KLM cancelled at least 300 flights on Tuesday to and from Amsterdam, where it is the largest operator.

Winter conditions are expected to continue in the coming days in the Netherlands, with heavy snowfall and strong winds predicted for Wednesday morning.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 15:25:48 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/VRI37E7VENJLVPXVC7URRZBVEU.jpg?auth=0d244e88689ffb480e9adce239aa04406af950d3bbeaf0e7dc8760c9b5872602&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israel's main airport receives passenger boost from Gaza ceasefire</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israels-main-airport-receives-passenger-boost-gaza-ceasefire-2026-01-06/</link><description>JERUSALEM, Jan 6 (Reuters) - Passenger traffic at Ben Gurion International Airport near Tel Aviv rose 33% in 2025, the Israel Airports Authority reported on Tuesday, reflecting the return of foreign carriers after many airlines halted flights during the two-year Gaza war .

A U.S.-brokered ceasefire in October gave way to the resumption of flights to Israel by carriers who had not yet resumed routes to Tel Aviv. In December, the number of passengers rose 59%.

In all of 2025, passenger traffic at Israel's main air gateway Ben Gurion reached 18.5 million, versus 13.9 million in 2024. The airport handled 21.8 million people in 2023, the year war broke out after the October 7 attacks by Hamas.

Flag carrier El Al Israel Airlines (ELAL.TA) , opens new tab , which did not halt flights during the war other than last June during a 12-day conflict with Iran, showed a 5% annual gain to 6.9 million passengers, though its market share slipped to 37% from 48%.

El Al has posted steep gains in revenue and profit as a result of the conflict, in which just a handful of carriers were operating.

Smaller rivals Israir (ISRG.TA) , opens new tab , with an 11% market share, and Arkia at 9% followed El Al.

Wizz Air (WIZZ.L) , opens new tab was the largest foreign carrier in Israel with 1.23 million passengers - double its 2024 level - for a 7% market share. Wizz is seeking to establish a hub in Israel.

Aegean, flydubai, Etihad, Lufthansa and United also posted large gains in the number of passengers last year.

Separately, Israel's Statistics Bureau said tourist numbers to Israel rose 38% in 2025 to 1.34 million, but remained below the 2023 level of 3.24 million. Outgoing tourism by Israelis grew 33% to 9.42 million last year.

The Gaza war broke out in October 2023. While the ceasefire halted most fighting, it has not stopped entirely.

Israeli strikes since the deal was struck have killed more than 400 Palestinians - most of them civilians, according to Gaza health officials - and Palestinian militants have killed three Israeli soldiers.

Both sides have accused one another of violating the deal's provisions.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 15:25:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/RHQXUJMVJ5LKDK7AY7UQJA7SEM.jpg?auth=38fa3c3180bf599765b9f3818cf8118db7e09c4be2c57b5526fcd3c76100f625&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Five die in weather accidents in France as cold snap grips Europe</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260106-five-die-in-weather-accidents-in-france-as-cold-snap-grips-europe</link><description>Below-freezing winter temperatures plunged swathes of Europe into a second day of travel chaos on Tuesday, with weather-related accidents leading to five deaths from the cold snap in France alone.

Three people died in accidents linked to black ice in southwestern France on Monday morning, authorities said, while a taxi driver died in hospital on Monday night after veering into the Marne river in the Paris region.

His passenger was still being treated for hypothermia, according to a police source, while another driver also lost his life east of Paris on Monday after a collision with a heavy goods vehicle.

Across the English Channel in Britain, the mercury plunged to -12.5C overnight in Norfolk, eastern England , while temperatures below -10C across the Netherlands brought trains to a standstill on Tuesday morning.

"Last night was the coldest night of the winter so far," Britain's Met Office said, with nearly all of the United Kingdom on alert for snow and ice and more snowfall expected.

Amsterdam's Schiphol airport, the Netherlands' main flight hub, saw a second day of weather-driven cancellations, with more than 400 flights grounded Tuesday and travellers facing huge queues at the airline counters.

Trains from the Dutch national railway operator NS only began rolling again after 10:00 am (0900 GMT), with services limited afterwards.

But planes got off the ground again from Liverpool in northwest England and Aberdeen in northeast Scotland , after the cold forced both airports to close on Monday.

More than 300 schools were shut in Scotland Tuesday, the national BBC broadcaster reported, with Scottish train services also severely disrupted.

"Tuesday will bring more severe snow and ice to the north of Scotland -- and with it, continued travel disruption and risks to people and communities," Scottish transport minister Fiona Hyslop warned late on Monday.

"It's important that people plan ahead, consider their travel plans and work from home if that's an option."

Several smaller French airports were closed on Tuesday, according to the transport ministry.

But the main Paris airports of Orly and Charles de Gaulle remained open with no flights cancelled.

In the French capital proper, Monday's snowfall had settled overnight across much of Paris's pavements, with pedestrians forced to navigate the treacherously icy streets and cobbles.

Tour guide Valeria Pitchouguina said the sight of Paris snowed under was "truly extraordinary", but the ice was complicating efforts to shepherd her groups up the steep steps to the picture-postcard district of Montmartre .

"When it's like that and snowy and icy, it's something else, it's less like climbing Montmartre and more like climbing Mont Blanc," Pitchouguina told AFPTV.

Construction and Transport Minister Janos Lazar urged Hungarians to only head out "if absolutely necessary".</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 15:26:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/16e0b5f0-eb0c-11f0-8f31-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/948a7b7d22e396cfd263bb9e8adbb4ab845a9309.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Colombian military must defend against potential US invasion, minister says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/colombian-military-must-defend-against-potential-us-invasion-minister-says-2026-01-06/</link><description>BOGOTA, Jan 6 (Reuters) - Colombia's foreign minister on Tuesday said the country's military must defend the country's territory and sovereignty in the event of a hypothetical U.S. invasion.

The comments follow reporting including from Reuters that Grok, prompted by users, was creating a flood of non-consensual images of women and minors in skimpy clothing.

Technology minister Liz Kendall said in a statement the content was "absolutely appalling" and urged the social media platform to act swiftly.

"No one should have to go through the ordeal of seeing intimate deepfakes of themselves online," Kendall said. "We cannot and will not allow the proliferation of these demeaning and degrading images, which are disproportionately aimed at women and girls."

"X needs to deal with this urgently."

X did not immediately respond to a request for comment following Kendall's statement.

X's Safety account said on Sunday that it removes all illegal content on the platform and permanently suspends accounts involved.

"Anyone using or prompting Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content," it said.

Asked about the subject recently, X told Reuters : "Legacy Media Lies."

Creating or sharing non-consensual intimate images or child sexual abuse material, including AI-generated sexual imagery, is illegal in Britain. Additionally, tech platforms must prevent British users from encountering illegal content and remove it once they become aware of it.

Musk has shrugged off concerns online, posting laughing emojis in response to edited bikini images of public figures.

OFCOM CONTACTS X, xAI OVER LEGAL DUTIES IN THE UK

On Monday, the European Commission said it was aware that X was offering a "spicy mode" and condemned the images as unlawful.

Also on Monday, Britain's media regulator Ofcom said it had made "urgent contact" with X and its AI arm xAI to understand what steps they were taking to comply with legal duties to protect UK users.

French officials have reported X to prosecutors and regulators, calling the content " manifestly illegal ," while Indian authorities have also demanded explanations.

U.S. regulators have yet to comment.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 15:48:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BBH6UACQQFNVVAQQ6SG5OKMBAY.jpg?auth=ad2d8a1b2af9a85eb649f6d96c50106c6b57c21f437b3fa50788b88116879f37&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Only Denmark and Greenland can decide on island's future, says Canada</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/only-denmark-greenland-can-decide-islands-future-says-canada-2026-01-06/</link><description>OTTAWA, Jan 6 (Reuters) - Only Denmark and Greenland can decide questions about the future of the Arctic island, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said on Tuesday when asked about U.S. threats of annexation.

Hours earlier, leaders from major European powers rallied behind Greenland, saying in a joint statement that the island belongs to its people.

Carney later met Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and "emphasised Canada's support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Denmark, including Greenland, which must be respected in accordance with international law", according to a statement from his office.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 15:48:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/OF7T4PORYNMAPH7YHJR7IOF5XQ.jpg?auth=f14b7f51bcd141a5b470910db86fed40d0fc42a9189d16e27c048a333fdd9a17&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>German minister says EU must take legal steps to stop Grok's sexualised AI photos</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/german-minister-says-eu-must-take-legal-steps-stop-groks-sexualised-ai-photos-2026-01-06/</link><description>BERLIN, Jan 6 (Reuters) - The EU Commission must take legal action to stop the "industrialization of sexual harassment" taking place on Elon Musk's social media platform X, Germany's media minister, Wolfram Weimer, told Reuters on Tuesday.

With his comments, Weimer joins a chorus of European leaders, including the EU Commission this week, raising concerns about the flood of sexually explicit content being created using X's built-in AI chatbot Grok.

"What we are currently observing on X looks like the industrialisation of sexual harassment," said Weimer about the images of women and children in very skimpy clothing generated in a Grok feature referred to as "spicy mode."

"It is now crucial that the EU Commission continues to enforce this (legal framework) as rigorously as it has already begun," said Weimer.

The DSA, which requires online platforms to do more to tackle illegal and harmful content, provides all the necessary tools to ensure consistent application of EU law, he said.

Online, Musk has dismissed the criticism, while Grok - which in an earlier model had praised Hitler and produced content with antisemitic tropes - has stated that it will examine gaps in its security measures and make improvements.

Both Musk and the U.S. government accuse Europeans of censorship and suppressing freedom of expression with their regulation, and Washington last month imposed visa bans on five Europeans combating online hate and disinformation.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 15:48:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/TS4T54EDPZPO3BSFC74SC3JXJY.jpg?auth=d389163daf641f8ef8c5dcc4d98f65e5faea9cbee24c23b52ecbfdbf31d75687&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Maduro's capture divides protesters in New York City</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/maduro-s-capture-divides-protesters-in-new-york-city</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 15:49:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/613aebea-eb0a-11f0-b140-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260106-143501-143651-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Explainer: Why is Somaliland strategically important?</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/why-is-somaliland-strategically-important-2026-01-06/</link><description>NAIROBI, Jan 6 (Reuters) - Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar met the president of Somaliland on Tuesday, 10 days after Israel became the first country to formally recognise the breakaway region in the Horn of Africa as an independent and sovereign state.

A Somaliland government source and a regional diplomat said other countries were preparing to follow suit and recognise Somaliland, despite an outcry from Somalia which says such moves threaten its sovereignty.

U.S. Senator Ted Cruz said in a post on X on Monday that recognising Somaliland was aligned with U.S. security interests , calling it "an ally that shares our values in a region vital to global trade and counterterrorism."

Somaliland, which declared independence from Somalia in 1991, occupies a strategic location at the juncture of the Indian Ocean and Red Sea, with its Berbera port giving access to some of the world's busiest shipping lanes.

Ships plying those routes have faced attacks by Yemen's Houthi militia , and analysts say countering that threat is part of Israel's move to recognise Somaliland and could lead to a military cooperation agreement between the two. Somaliland, however, has denied recognition allows for Israel to establish military bases there or for the resettlement of Palestinians from Gaza.

Landlocked Ethiopia, Africa's second most populous country, has also set its sights on Somaliland, announcing in 2024 a memorandum of understanding to lease an area around the Berbera port in exchange for Addis Ababa recognising the region's independence.

That deal prompted an angry response from Somalia, and drew the Mogadishu government closer to Egypt, which has quarrelled with Ethiopia for years over Addis Ababa's construction of a vast hydropower dam on the Nile River, and to Eritrea, another of Ethiopia's longtime foes .

Turkey has close ties with both Ethiopia and Somalia , training Somalia's security forces and supplying development assistance in return for a foothold on the key global shipping route. After talks mediated by Turkey, Ethiopia agreed in December 2024 to work with Somalia to resolve the dispute, but it is now rumoured to be readying to recognise Somaliland.

India has denied talk on X that it was also preparing to recognise Somaliland, although some analysts say it should do so to counter Chinese economic influence in the Horn of Africa, specifically Djibouti, as well as in Kenya and Tanzania.

The United Arab Emirates, which in 2020 normalised relations with Israel under the U.S.-brokered Abraham Accords , has carved its own sphere of influence in the region. It runs the Berbera port through Dubai's state owned company DP World, as well as Berbera's airport and a free-trade zone located between the port and the airport.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 16:30:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LXZLMX7RLNJAFOFUYFAGVRW4U4.jpg?auth=f3d43224b8cdc8d4d55fea2fbf5d5790dfe74d25be4fc5cdcd656704f266bd3e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Three killed in Aleppo attacks, Syrian government, SDF trade blame</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/three-killed-aleppo-attacks-syrian-government-sdf-trade-blame-2026-01-06/</link><description>Jan 6 (Reuters) - At least three people were killed and several others wounded in Syria's northern city of Aleppo, state news agency SANA said on Tuesday, citing Aleppo's health director, after deadly attacks for which Syrian government forces and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces traded blame.

Syria's defence ministry said in a statement that the SDF had continued its "escalation" by targeting army positions and residential areas in Aleppo.

The SDF denied its responsibility, saying that the casualties were caused by "indiscriminate" artillery and missile shelling by factions aligned with the Damascus government.

The violence came days after a meeting between senior officials from the SDF and the Damascus government on implementing a deal agreed nearly 10 months ago that aimed to fully integrate the semi-autonomous Kurdish region into the central Syrian government.

The agreement was meant to be implemented by the end of 2025 but the two sides have made little progress, each accusing the other of stalling or acting in bad faith.

The SDF is reluctant to give up autonomy it won as the main U.S. ally during the war, which left it with control of Islamic State prisons and rich oil resources.

Integrating the SDF into Syria's army would mend Syria's deepest remaining fracture, but failing to do so risks an armed clash that could derail the country's emergence from 14 years of war and potentially draw in Turkey, which has threatened an incursion against Kurdish fighters it views as terrorists.

As progress falters, several rounds of fighting have broken out. On December 22, Syrian government forces and SDF agreed to de-escalate in the northern city of Aleppo, after a wave of attacks that left at least two civilians dead and several wounded.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 16:30:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Gunfire heard near Al-Maashiq presidential palace in Yemen's Aden, witnesses say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/gunfire-heard-near-al-maashiq-presidential-palace-yemens-aden-witnesses-say-2026-01-06/</link><description>Jan 6 (Reuters) - Gunfire was heard in the vicinity of the Al-Maashiq presidential palace in the southern Yemeni port city of Aden, witnesses told Reuters on Tuesday.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 16:30:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/J2OT46IMSVO2LHG3HHCW3T5WGM.jpg?auth=1bb42dc711388997fd45b2f1aac58ca16ebd233c55b315fd77faa5f6343d7aff&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Brazil's Bolsonaro taken to hospital for tests after fall, head injury</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/brazils-bolsonaro-taken-hospital-tests-after-fall-head-injury-2026-01-06/</link><description>SAO PAULO, Jan 6 (Reuters) - Brazil's imprisoned former President Jair Bolsonaro was taken to hospital for tests on Tuesday after falling and hitting his head, his wife said in a social media post.

The office of the mayor of the town of Crans-Montana said the bar had no fire alarm, because it was not required for a venue of that size. Other questions remain about the fire that killed or injured people from all over the world.

Following are salient points of the investigation.

Twenty-one of the dead were from Switzerland, seven from France, six from Italy, and there was a Swiss-French dual national and a French-British-Israeli national. The remaining four were Romanian, Turkish, Belgian and Portuguese.

The dead included 26 teenagers. Six were 15 years old, while two were only 14.

The 116 injured included citizens of over a dozen countries. Most were Swiss. Twenty-one were from France, and 10 were Italian. Aside from four with French-Finnish, Swiss-Belgian, French-Italian, and Italian-Filipino dual citizenship, nationals of Belgium, Portugal, the Czech Republic, Australia, Luxembourg, Congo Republic, Serbia, Poland and Bosnia made up the rest.

Prosecutors believe sparkling candles ignited the ceiling of the basement of "Le Constellation" bar after witnesses reported seeing a staff member on the shoulders of a colleague carrying bottles with so-called fountain candles in them.

The basement ceiling was covered with foam soundproofing material deemed acceptable at the time of the bar's last safety check in 2019. Swiss law does not require authorities to verify such materials, but Crans-Montana mayor Nicolas Feraud said the courts must determine whether this should have been done anyway.

Feraud said the bar had an upstairs and a downstairs exit, with each floor intended to hold up to 100 people. He could not say whether the downstairs exit was working. That will be revealed by the investigation.

Residents of Crans-Montana said the bar was popular among school-age teenagers just starting to go out at night. In Switzerland, beer and wine can be consumed from age 16. The average age of those killed in the blaze was 19.

Swiss prosecutors have placed the bar's two French owners under criminal investigation on suspicion of three crimes: homicide by negligence, bodily harm by negligence and fire by negligence. They have not yet been formally charged and are not in custody.

If convicted of all three crimes, they could incur a maximum sentence of 4-1/2 years, according to Swiss lawyer Nicolas Rivard. If found to have known of the fire risk without taking preventative measures, they could face more severe charges carrying a sentence of at least five years, he said.

Class action cases do not exist in Switzerland. Families of the victims could seek compensation by joining the prosecutor's case as plaintiffs, lawyers said. Crans-Montana is trying to join the case as a party, but it has not been approved yet.

Switzerland's cantons have suspended plans to relax fire safety regulations. Crans-Montana has banned sparkling candles in its venues. Flags are flying at half-mast, and Friday will be a day of national mourning.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 16:30:39 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4SHNAC4HGBIYFKU3EHIFHZO4EA.jpg?auth=fd59e4bfd20688efff761f55d02b373ce1cbc898e0ec5436f745b81c173cd3a1&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia slams 'neocolonial threats' against Venezuela, backs new interim leader</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/russia-slams-neocolonial-threats-against-venezuela-backs-new-interim-leader-2026-01-06/</link><description>MOSCOW, Jan 6 (Reuters) - Russia on Tuesday welcomed the appointment of Delcy Rodriguez as Venezuela's interim president, calling it a step to ensure peace and stability in the face of "blatant neocolonial threats and foreign armed aggression".

"We firmly insist that Venezuela must be guaranteed the right to determine its own destiny without any destructive external interference," the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.

It did not refer by name to the United States. President Donald Trump on Saturday sent special forces to capture Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and bring him to the U.S., where he has pleaded not guilty to narcotics charges and insisted he remains the rightful leader of the country.

"We welcome the efforts undertaken by the official authorities of this country to protect state sovereignty and national interests. We reaffirm Russia's unwavering solidarity with the Venezuelan people and government," the Russian statement said, adding that Moscow would continue to provide "necessary support".

Maduro was the second close ally of Russia to be ousted in just over a year, following the toppling of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in December 2024.

But one senior Russian source told Reuters this week that if Trump was asserting a revived Monroe Doctrine of U.S. dominance in the Western Hemisphere, then Russia also had a right to its own sphere of influence .

Russia has been waging full-scale war in neighbouring Ukraine since February 2022, but is in talks with Trump's administration as the U.S. leader pushes for an end to the conflict.

President Vladimir Putin , who has taken care not to criticise Trump since his return to the White House a year ago, is keen to mend bilateral relations and revive economic ties between their two countries. Putin has yet to comment on Trump's removal of Maduro.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 16:30:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/YB4N75BUSVM25HYERDUTWYYNBM.jpg?auth=8e3121456fcc990864b61a4d2b7f57c9528a840cdc3870fa29c6433b89981785&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Explainer: Why is Somaliland strategically important?</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/why-is-somaliland-strategically-important-2026-01-06/</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 16:31:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Russia slams 'neocolonial threats' against Venezuela, backs new interim leader</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/russia-slams-neocolonial-threats-against-venezuela-backs-new-interim-leader-2026-01-06/</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 16:31:03 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Explainer: What is known so far about the Swiss bar fire that killed 40</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/what-is-known-so-far-about-swiss-bar-fire-that-killed-40-2026-01-06/</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 16:31:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Russia slams 'neocolonial threats' against Venezuela, backs new interim leader</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/russia-slams-neocolonial-threats-against-venezuela-backs-new-interim-leader-2026-01-06/</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 16:31:31 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>What is the "Coalition of the Willing" set to discuss with US envoys at key talks in Paris?</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/what-is-the-coalition-of-the-willing-set-to-discuss-with-us-envoys-at-key-talks-in-paris</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 16:31:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/d6924f40-eb06-11f0-9bfd-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-06T122310Z-1447465929-RC2NVIAOAQVU-RTRMADP-3-UKRAINE-CRISIS-COALITION-1.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Questions raised over legality of US operation in Venezuela</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/questions-raised-over-legality-of-us-operation-in-venezuela</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 16:31:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/09c23748-eb18-11f0-b499-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260106-164255-164449-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Replay: Watch Trump's address to House republicans and our analysis</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/replay-watch-trump-s-address-to-house-republicans-and-our-analysis</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 16:32:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/1f25a096-eb1a-11f0-86dd-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/capture-624027208695d33cacfe044-64961548.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Exiled Maduro opponent vows to return to Venezuela and slams interim leader</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/exiled-maduro-opponent-vows-to-return-to-venezuela-and-slams-interim-leader</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 16:32:03 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/ef91ade4-eafa-11f0-93de-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/2025-12-15T151553Z-1901097027-RC29EIAZQ1GH-RTRMADP-3-NOBEL-PRIZE-PEACE-MACHADO.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Is U.S. military operation in Venezuela a 'return to 19th century gunboat diplomacy'?</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/is-u-s-military-operation-in-venezuela-a-return-to-19th-century-gunboat-diplomacy</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 16:32:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/72e7664e-eb13-11f0-b857-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260106-130131-131002-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Last games of AFCON's round of 16 set to take place</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/last-games-of-afcon-s-round-of-16-set-to-take-place</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 16:32:08 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/11a337de-e29c-11f0-b3be-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/000-34J89NT.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US envoys join in 'Coalition of the Willing' talks for first time</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/us-envoys-join-in-coalition-of-the-willing-talks-for-first-time</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 16:32:10 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/c4c527a6-eb10-11f0-bddb-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260106-151949-152457-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump to House Republicans: If we don't win midterms, I will get impeached</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-house-republicans-if-we-dont-win-midterms-i-will-get-impeached-2026-01-06/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 6 (Reuters) -

"This child was struck by a bullet and apparently arrested during demonstrations in Naziabad (Tehran) around 8pm on January 4, 2026,” Maroofian wrote under a picture of missing 14-year-old Sogand Mansouri.

“She was wearing a grey jacket and no information about her condition or place of detention is available at the moment … If someone has news of her, absolutely please let us know.”

Living as a refugee in France since 2023, Maroofian, 25, was herself arrested in 2022 during the widespread protests triggered by the death of Mahsa Amini in custody.

Maroofian was detained for having interviewed Amini’s father after the young Kurdish-Iranian woman was arrested by the country’s morality police for allegedly wearing her headscarf improperly.

Through her contacts with those now taking to Iran’s streets, Maroofian has taken it upon herself to act as a public conduit for the latest wave of protests , which have sparked a crackdown by the Islamic Republic’s security forces.

A series of strikes against hyper-inflation by shopkeepers in Tehran and other major cities erupted on December 28. This latest social movement has since increasingly taken on a political character, with some crowds shouting slogans explicitly calling for the government’s fall.

The demonstrations have spread to the universities , and a number of young Iranians are now joining the protests daily. Teachers’ unions have reported that several high-schoolers have been arrested across the country; their families have been kept largely unaware of their whereabouts.

Iranian security forces have killed at least 27 protesters, including five minors, since late December, the Norway-based NGO Iran Human Rights said on Tuesday.

"At least 27 protesters have been killed by gunfire or other forms of violence carried out by security forces in eight provinces. Five of those killed have been verified to have been children," the NGO said after 10 days of protests, adding that over 1,000 people had been detained

The NGO on Sunday expressed concern about the fate of young Iranians detained during the demonstrations, particularly underage protesters believed to be imprisoned in Isfahan Central Prison.

Several wounded detainees have been transferred to the prison’s infirmary, the group said in a statement , including 16-year-old Soroush Azarmehr, 17-year-old Payam Aminzadeh and 16-year-old Saman Shahamat, who were arrested after being injured in the head and back.

In a prison in the conservative city of Qom, a bastion of theological universities in southern Iran, Soroush Javidi, 17, lost consciousness after suffering major blood loss, the organisation said.

“It is unclear whether he received appropriate medical care after being admitted to the prison infirmary,” the statement said. “On January 3, around 100 prisoners were transferred to Qom Central Prison, where they were all crammed into a single hall.”

According to a January 5 report by Human Rights Activists News Agency, which tracks rights in Iran , at least 1,203 people have been arrested since the demonstrations began in late December. Official figures say that at least 12 people, including members of Iran’s security forces, have been killed.

According to Iran Human Rights, AK-47 assault rifles and possibly even machine guns were used on January 3 to repress street protests in Malekshahi county, an area with a large Kurdish population.

The latest protests have affected at least 45 mostly small to mid-sized towns across Iran , mainly in the country’s west, according to an AFP analysis of media coverage and official announcements. Protests have broken out in at least 25 of Iran’s 31 provinces.

“Each time, there are a few dozen to a few hundred people protesting,” said FRANCE 24 correspondent Siavosh Ghazi. “But the movement is gaining momentum, spreading, and becoming increasingly radical.”

In one viral video taken on January 4 in Hamedan, a city in Iran’s west, protesters – including several women – set upon a pro-government militiaman who had just fired upon them. A number of protesters hurl themselves on a uniformed member of the Basij paramilitary force and disarm him, dragging him to the ground and beating him while others try to stop him from being killed in the street.

Other images shared on social media show similar scenes, with protesters hurling stones at riot police or throwing petrol on a militiaman before setting him ablaze.

In other scenes, demonstrators drop to their knees in front of motorbike-riding security forces in a non-violent display of resistance, seemingly without fear of being arrested.

Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei, head of the country’s judiciary, said on Monday that he recognised protesters have the right to demonstrate peacefully over economic concerns. But there will be “no leniency or indulgence” towards “rioters”, he said.

Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , who had mostly maintained his silence since the new protests erupted, echoed this sentiment during a Shiite festival in Tehran on Saturday. While protesters’ economic demands were “just” he said, “rioters” needed to be “put in their place”.

Iran Human Rights warned that the supreme leader's statement amounted to a blank cheque to security forces to escalate their repression.

“On 3 January, Ali Khamenei, the Supreme Leader of the Islamic Republic, implicitly issued an order to crack down by referring to protesters as ‘rioters’ and ‘agents of the enemy’,” the group said in its statement.

But while she was quick to denounce Maduro's "kidnapping", she also called for cooperation and respectful relations with Washington. And she may just be the steady hand needed to lead the country's political transition.

A lawyer specialising in labour law, Rodriguez, 56, spent almost a decade in France and England during her postgraduate studies. She served Maduro's predecessor, Hugo Chavez , as vice-minister for European affairs among other roles.

As Maduro's foreign minister and then vice president starting in 2018, she added the role of oil minister in 2024 – a key post in a country whose economy depends on oil exports.

Venezuela has the largest proven oil reserves in the world, and US President Donald Trump has made clear that gaining access to that oil is a key goal of his Venezuela campaign.

Trump’s advisers believe they may be able to work behind the scenes with Rodriguez, who despite her public defiance, is seen as a technocrat who might be amenable to working with the US on a political transition and key oil-related issues, according to three people briefed on the US strategy.

Because of her connections in the private sector and her deep knowledge of the oil sector, Rodriguez is considered one of the most pragmatic members of Maduro’s inner circle.

Rodriguez has publicly contradicted Trump on his claims that she is willing to work with the US. But despite her loyalist rhetoric, the Trump administration continues to signal an interest in working with her, albeit with some veiled threats.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the US will judge Rodríguez on what she does moving forward as acting president more than her words. "We're going to make an assessment on the basis of what they do, not what they say publicly in the interim," he told CBS News show " Face the Nation " on Sunday.

Trump, meanwhile, warned that Rodriguez could face a fate worse than Maduro's if she failed to heed US demands.

"If she doesn't do what's right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro," Trump told "The Atlantic" magazine.

Venezuela's military – which had repeatedly vowed loyalty to Maduro – recognised Rodriguez as the country's interim leader on Sunday. A day later, the Supreme Court swore her in to serve as president "in an acting capacity" – the first woman to hold the post in the country, even if temporarily.

"She has probably been one of Maduro's most trusted people over the years," political analyst Pedro Benitez of the Central University of Venezuela told AFP.

Rodriguez was among the Venezuelan officials targeted by US sanctions during the first Trump administration. The US levied sanctions on Rodríguez in 2018, naming her as one of the Maduro loyalists helping him "maintain his grip on power" and blocking her entry to the United States as well as any financial transactions involving American entities.

Rodriguez was subject to EU sanctions that same year, with the bloc accusing her of undermining "democracy and the rule of law in Venezuela".

As oil minister, she faced the challenge of maximising Venezuela's oil trade while navigating US sanctions on the industry.

Rodriguez comes from a long line of leftist political activists. Her brother,Jorge Rodriguez, is the head of Venezuela's parliament and a United Socialist Party of Venezuela insider. Their father was a Marxist activist who died in custody in 1976 under a then centre-left government.

The siblings "have been involved in every internal maneuver in which Maduro has pushed out any power centres that cast a shadow over him", Benitez said.

"The emotional fuel that got them where they are has to do with revenge," he added, notably their father's death.

Another political scientist, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal, said it would be a challenge for Rodriguez to recast herself as a moderate politician, given this history.

Rodriguez served as a lawmaker for many years before being taken up in successive Chavista governments, helped by her brother.

"She didn't have a political base of her own," according to Benitez.

But she soon proved herself a full-blooded Chavista and became a Maduro confidante.

From 2020 to 2024, while serving as both vice president and economy minister, Rodriguez cooled her incendiary rhetoric to make inroads with Venezuela's business community, long demonised by socialist leaders. She eased trade controls in the de facto dollarised economy, providing a breather for business leaders who still view her as a savvy economic manager.

While some hailed her practical approach, detractors called her cynical.

Rodriguez will remain the country's acting president at least until elections are organised, which according to the country's constitution should take place within 30 days. But Trump has already indicated that timeline is moot.

"We have to fix the country first. You can’t have an election. There’s no way the people could even vote," Trump said in an NBC News interview on Monday, the day Rodriguez was sworn in.

"No, it’s going to take a period of time. We have, we have to nurse the country back to health," he added.

Trump also dispelled hopes among many Venezuelans that the country might definitively turn the page on the Chavez-Maduro era by holding a free election that could see right-wing opposition leader and 2025 Nobel Peace Prize laureate Maria Corina Machado take the presidency.

Trump asserted that Machado did not have sufficient "support or respect" in the country to become president, despite her being Maduro's most credible opponent. Machado was barred from challenging Maduro in the last election in July 2024.

Machado “doesn’t have the support or the respect within the country. She’s a very nice woman, but she doesn’t have the respect,” Trump told reporters .

A Machado-backed candidate, Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia, " overwhelmingly" beat Maduro , according to international assessments, but the electoral commission quickly declared Maduro the victor despite "no supporting evidence", according to the US State Department . The US later recognised Gonzalez as the rightful president-elect and helped Machado go into hiding.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 17:30:16 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/6edf7596-eae1-11f0-ad58-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/Delcy-Rodriguez.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Watch live: Leaders of Ukraine’s 'Coalition of the Willing' speak from Paris</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260106-watch-live-leaders-of-ukraine-s-coalition-of-the-willing-speak-from-paris</link><description>The summit, hosted by President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday, gathered an unprecedented number of officials in person including European leaders, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and American envoys.

The US agreed to lead a " ceasefire monitoring and verification mechanism" with European participation if a peace deal is agreed in the Russia-Ukraine war, according to a draft statement seen by AFP ahead of the summit.

Washington would also commit to "support" a European-led multinational force – deployed in Ukraine after any ceasefire – "in case of" a new attack by Russia , it added.

But prospects for progress are uncertain: The Trump administration's focus is shifting to Venezuela while US suggestions of a Greenland takeover are causing tensions with Europe , and Moscow shows no signs of backing down from its maximalist demands nearly four years after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 17:51:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/89bad3e4-eb1b-11f0-82e7-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26006542023333.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Spain's Sanchez says US wants to grab Venezuela resources, sets dangerous precedent</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/spains-sanchez-says-us-wants-grab-venezuela-resources-sets-dangerous-precedent-2026-01-06/</link><description>Jan 6 (Reuters) - Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said on Tuesday the United States had set a "terrible and very dangerous precedent" in Venezuela with its , adding that Washington's sole objective appeared to be the change of government and appropriation of energy resources.

Trump says Maduro masterminded the flow of drugs into the U.S. and was illegitimately in power due to vote-rigging.

Demand for the PAC-3, or Patriot Advanced Capability missile interceptors, has grown as the U.S. and allied countries step up air defense capabilities in response to heightened geopolitical tensions.

Alongside the U.S., Lockheed Martin supplies PAC-3 to sixteen other countries, including Sweden, Qatar, Japan and Poland.

The Patriot system is also among the weapons the West has supplied to Ukraine as it fights Russia's invasion .

In 2025, Lockheed Martin delivered 620 units of the Patriot missile. Over the last two years, it has increased production by 60%.

Lockheed Martin will work with the U.S. government towards an initial contract award, which is expected in final fiscal year 2026 Congressional appropriations.

In September 2025, the Bethseda, Maryland-based company was awarded a $9.8 billion contract for 1970 Patriot missiles, the largest order to ever be placed for the weapon.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 18:33:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/3QWVX43QPVPZ3IJYGKNSBZMRTM.jpg?auth=27052d0a2c208c368b82c73199e1cdb5aa6c8726b7a2fe5bd808dac44d4c7579&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>How AI-generated images contributed to the disinformation about Maduro's capture</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260106-ai-generated-images-contributed-disinformation-spreading-maduro-capture</link><description>On the night of Friday, January 2, the US carried out a special forces raid and captured the president of Venezuela , Nicolas Maduro , and his wife, Cilia Flores. They were then transported to the US.

As soon as the news broke, a number of images said to show the capture of the Venezuelan leader were widely shared on social media. However, these images were fake: they were generated by AI.

A series of photos posted on January 3 – some taken face-on, others from above – were described as the first images to show the Venezuelan president after his capture by the US Army. According to one X user , they show Maduro being escorted across the tarmac by two US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agents before being loaded onto a US-bound plane.

The image of Maduro was even shared by several news sites (examples here and here ) to illustrate articles about his capture, and was also retweeted by a Republican lawmaker on X .

At first glance, these images seem pretty realistic. They show the Venezuelan leader being escorted by DEA agents from a few different angles. Maduro is wearing the same black suit, and the agents are wearing identical uniforms in all the images.

However, these photos are fake and were created by Google’s AI image generator, Nano Banana Pro, which is able to create realistic images.

These images are stamped with a watermark, which proves that they were AI-generated. This is a precaution put in place by Google so that artificially-generated content can be identified. This watermark is invisible to the naked eye, but it is visible to SynthID, a verification tool integrated into Google Lens. If you upload these images into Google Lens, it then reads, "Created with Google’s AI” in the “About this image” section.

The photo also features a defect that gives away the fact that it was AI-generated. There is an anomaly in Maduro’s jacket: a giant, blurred mark on the right leaves a gaping hole in his jacket. AI sometimes struggles to reproduce specific details.

Finally, @ultravfx , the name that appears on the watermark that is visible on the image, is an artist who creates AI-generated images.

Another image of the capture posted online on January 3 has so far garnered more than 4 million views on X . The image appears to show the Venezuelan president in an embarrassing situation: in custody and en route to the United States in his pyjamas.

This image also looks realistic: there are no flagrant anomalies, but its poor resolution means that it is hard to discern the details. However, there are a few clues that this image, too, was AI-generated.

First of all, the soldier sitting to the right of the Venezuelan president isn’t wearing the regulation camouflage print used by the US military . It actually seems to be a reproduction of the "Universal Camouflage Pattern" (UCP), a pattern that hasn’t been used by the US Army since 2019 . The US Army actually currently uses a pattern called the " Operational Camouflage Pattern ". The OCP is made up of green and brown patches, unlike the UCP, which features grey and black patches.

Maduro is wearing white pyjamas in the image shared online. US President Donald Trump posted an image on January 3 on the social media network Truth Social that features the Venezuelan president on board the USS Iwo Jima en route to the United States, wearing not white pyjamas but what appears to be a grey tracksuit. It is important to note that we can’t guarantee the authenticity of this image shared by Trump, as underlined in an article published in the New York Times .

Another image, posted on January 4 on X , where it garnered more than 800,000 views, shows Maduro apparently incarcerated in a US prison. You can see the Venezuelan leader in chains, wearing the classic orange prison jumpsuit.

SynthID, Google’s AI verification tool, shows that this image was created by Nano Banana, just like the images said to show Maduro on the tarmac.

Images published by the media of Maduro’s arrival in New York , or during his first appearance in court on January 5, show the president wearing black or brown, not an orange prisoner's uniform.

The gathering was meant to finalise as much as possible contributions to future security guarantees to reassure Kyiv in the event of a ceasefire with Russia, which launched a full scale invasion of its neighbour almost four years ago.

The talks, Meloni said in a statement, were constructive and underscored a high degree of alignment among Ukraine, the U.S., Europe and other partners on measures designed to ensure a durable and just peace.

"Central to the discussions was the refinement of security commitments inspired by NATO's Article 5, a model long advocated by Italy, which would be embedded in a broader package of agreements coordinated closely with Washington," the statement released by Meloni's press office said.

The proposed system aims to safeguard Ukraine's sovereignty through strengthened military capabilities and a robust mechanism to monitor any eventual ceasefire, Italy added.

According to the statement, the declaration adopted in Paris highlights the voluntary nature of countries' participation in a future multinational force and the requirement that national constitutional procedures be followed before providing assistance in the event of a renewed attack.

No Italian troops will be deployed on Ukrainian soil, Meloni reiterated during the meeting.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 19:21:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7UQVRPYO7VPFNB6KBF63XFXVHE.jpg?auth=470b2a94a518fe8ebdc31b3aa99274364aeed98637d73a1bf25bfbf7eadcfca6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump administration says there are ways US can lift Venezuelan oil output quickly</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/trump-administration-says-there-are-ways-us-can-lift-venezuelan-oil-output-2026-01-06/</link><description>WASHINGTON/MIAMI, Jan 6 (Reuters) - The Trump administration on Tuesday dismissed analysts' estimates that it would take years to ramp up Venezuela's crude production, saying there were ways to quickly boost the country’s oil sector.

Raising crude output from the South American nation, which sits on the world’s largest oil reserves, is a top objective for President Donald Trump after U.S. forces seized Venezuela's leader , Nicolas Maduro, in a raid on its capital Caracas on Saturday.

The country’s exports have fallen to below 1 million barrels per day from over 3 million bpd two decades ago amid a prolonged lack of investment that has left its infrastructure in shambles.

U.S. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said one option was for Washington to lift sanctions on Venezuela that had prevented the country from accessing crucial oil field equipment and other technologies to maximize production.

"Some of these things could be done very quickly," he told Fox Business Network in an interview. "The opportunity on the business side here is really enormous."

The Trump administration plans to meet U.S. oil executives this week, a source told Reuters on Monday, but it is unclear when or who will participate. Energy Secretary Chris Wright is scheduled to speak at a Goldman Sachs conference in Miami on Wednesday morning, just before ConocoPhillips CEO Ryan Lance is scheduled to make closed-door comments.

Trump says the U.S. industry could expand operations in Venezuela in less than 18 months, possibly with the help of subsidies.

"I think we can do it in less time than that, but it’ll be a lot of money," Trump told NBC News on Monday. "A tremendous amount of money will have to be spent, and the oil companies will spend it, and then they’ll get reimbursed by us or through revenue."

Trump said on Tuesday in remarks to U.S. House Republicans that increasing Venezuelan production could also reduce energy costs for Americans.

“We got a lot of oil to drill, which is going to bring down oil prices even further," Trump said.

Oil analysts and executives have been skeptical about a quick revival of Venezuela’s oil sector, pointing out that its degraded infrastructure would require billions of dollars and years to overcome.

Venezuela’s oil reserves are among the world’s costliest to develop because the oil is so thick and heavy it requires specialized equipment to extract, transport and refine into usable fuels.

With global oil prices low at around $60 a barrel, producers have been focusing on reserves that are cheaper and easier to develop.

"It’s hard to imagine increases beyond 300,000-400,000 barrels a day in the next year, just given the degraded state of the infrastructure, especially the upgraders," Daan Struyven, co-head of global commodities research at Goldman Sachs, said at the Goldman Sachs Energy, CleanTech &amp; Utilities Conference.

He said it would take until the end of the decade for Venezuela to reach 1.5 million to 2 million bpd, and likely only with significant support from the U.S. government.

"I wouldn't rule it out, but it will require time, significant institutional changes," he said.

Chevron (CVX.N) , opens new tab is the only U.S. major operating in Venezuela's oil fields. Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) , opens new tab and ConocoPhillips (COP.N) , opens new tab had storied histories in the country before their projects were nationalized by former President Hugo Chavez nearly two decades ago.

The Department of Energy did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 19:40:22 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/3ZWURVP42VLEJFFUQMZO6S2POE.jpg?auth=9c8a5404264b14635c7fa1ecf9c669a1f6ba9c760502683da7ca192435916ff0&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israel, Syria to set up communication mechanism after US-mediated talks</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-syria-set-up-communication-mechanism-after-us-mediated-talks-2026-01-06/</link><description>BEIRUT/JERUSALEM, Jan 6 (Reuters) - Israel and Syria agreed during U.S.-mediated talks in Paris to set up a communication mechanism to coordinate on security, intelligence and commercial issues, the three countries said in a joint statement released on Tuesday by the State Department.

But in a statement to Reuters, a Syrian official said it would not be possible to move forward on "strategic files" in talks with Israel without a binding, clear timeline for Israeli troop withdrawal from Syrian territory seized after the late 2024 toppling of Bashar al-Assad.

The Syrian official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the latest round of talks with Israel in Paris, which took place on Monday and Tuesday, concluded with an initiative to suspend all Israeli military activities against Syria.

There was no immediate from Israel on whether it had agreed to suspend military activities in Syria. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said Israel had focused on security issues as well as Israel-Syria economic cooperation during the talks.

Syrian state media reported that the discussions in Paris were focused on reviving a 1974 disengagement agreement that established a U.N.-monitored buffer zone between Israel and Syria after the 1973 Middle East war.

Israeli troops advanced deeper across the border after Assad was toppled on December 8, 2024 by rebel fighters who assumed Syria's leadership. Israel has also intervened in what it calls missions to protect the Druze religious minority in southwestern Syria.

Syria is seeking an Israeli withdrawal to positions held before Assad was toppled, and wants a reciprocal security framework guaranteeing its sovereignty and preventing interference in its internal affairs.

The State Department statement said that the two countries would use the communication mechanism "to facilitate immediate and ongoing coordination on their intelligence sharing, military de-escalation, diplomatic engagement, and commercial opportunities" under U.S. supervision.

The Syrian official accused Israel of stalling by using technicalities in the talks, and said it should abandon its "expansionist mentality" so that the talks could proceed.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 19:40:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Exclusive: Venezuela, US in talks to export Venezuelan oil to US, sources say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/venezuela-us-talks-export-venezuelan-oil-us-sources-say-2026-01-06/</link><description>HOUSTON/WASHINGTON, Jan 6 (Reuters) - Venezuelan and U.S. officials are discussing exporting Venezuelan crude to refiners in the United States, five government, industry and shipping sources told Reuters on Tuesday.

Venezuela has millions of barrels of oil loaded on tankers and in storage tanks that it has been unable to ship due to a blockade on exports imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump since mid-December. The blockade was part of rising U.S. pressure on the government of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro that culminated in U.S. forces capturing him at the weekend.

A deal to sell the stuck crude to refiners in the United States would redirect them from China, which has been Venezuela's top buyer in the last decade and especially since the United States imposed sanctions on companies involved in oil trade with Venezuela in 2020. State oil firm PDVSA has already had to cut production due to the embargo, because it is running out of storage for the oil. If PDVSA does not find a way to export oil soon, it would have to cut production more, one of the sources said.

The White House, Venezuelan government officials and PDVSA did not immediately comment.

U.S. refineries on the Gulf Coast can process Venezuela's heavy crude grades and were importing some 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) before Washington first imposed energy sanctions on Venezuela.

It was not immediately clear how sanctioned PDVSA would obtain proceeds from the oil sales.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 20:25:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ZP6C6S4FFBMOXKVSC7IVQILVDE.jpg?auth=b3a976ba807359458a62f550fce51993da5b1e8256147bc9c53c9d37d853d471&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US, Ukraine discussed 'some ideas' on issue of territory, Zelenskiy says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us-ukraine-discussed-some-ideas-issue-territory-zelenskiy-says-2026-01-06/</link><description>KYIV, Jan 6 (Reuters) - U.S. and Ukrainian officials discussed "some ideas" to address the issue of territory during peace talks to end Russia's war on Ukraine , President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Tuesday, describing the matter as the biggest remaining obstacle in the process.

Ukraine is under U.S. pressure to quickly secure a peace deal that could include painful concessions, but has refused to accept Russian demands that it cede land it still controls in eastern Donbas.

"The biggest issue that needs to be worked on is the territorial issue. We discussed some ideas that might help," Zelenskiy said in Paris after a meeting with European allies to hash out security guarantees for Kyiv.

"If the teams are unable to resolve certain issues, the matter can be brought to the leaders' level."

Separately, White House special envoy Steve Witkoff told reporters that land options were discussed during the Paris talks, and that discussions would continue.

The Ukrainian delegation would remain in Paris for further consultations, Zelenskiy added.

Ukraine had said earlier that the U.S. offered the idea of a free economic zone if Kyiv withdraws from parts of the Donetsk region that Ukrainian forces still control.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 20:25:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/AQO6HUXFAZK7FPWJWX7XT2CGF4.jpg?auth=5ca538c25525dbe61c80245023778ee77729a87f1d56322b7ae6c87daa8875d8&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Czech-led ammunition programme for Ukraine can continue, PM says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/czech-led-ammunition-programme-ukraine-can-continue-pm-says-2026-01-06/</link><description>PRAGUE, Jan 6 (Reuters) - The Czech Republic can keep running an initiative sourcing ammunition for Ukraine, but will act as a coordinator and no longer put its own money into it, Prime Minister Andrej Babis said on Tuesday.

Babis' government, in power since December, has been discussing the fate of the ammunition drive after Babis criticised the programme for being non-transparent. He has pledged to scale back aid, saying money was needed at home.

The programme brings together foreign donors, including Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands, with Czech defence officials and arms traders and producers who purchase large-calibre ammunition around the world, delivering it to Ukraine to reduce its disadvantage on the battlefield against Russia.

"The project will continue and the Czech Republic will act as coordinator," Babis said on X after attending a meeting of Ukraine's allies in Paris. "No money from Czech citizens will be invested in the ammunition initiative."

A senior NATO military official voiced cautious optimism in December that the initiative would continue and said it would deliver 1.8 million rounds of artillery ammunition in 2025 - 43% of the total ammunition supplied to Kyiv.

The Czech state security council is due to debate the programme on Wednesday. It was put in place by the previous centre-right government and President Petr Pavel, a former NATO official, has sought to keep it active.

Babis has criticised the programme's lack of transparency, while his pro-Russian coalition allies oppose it.

Babis told reporters in Paris the programme could continue if others finance it, according to CTK news agency. "Of course, it must be transparent and without corruption," he said.

Donors have given around $4.8 billion to pay for ammunition supplies under the programme, former Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky said in December. The Czech contribution has been up to 3 billion crowns ($145.15 million).

Here are key comments made after a meeting in Paris:

"The president strongly stands behind security protocols. Those security protocols are meant to a) deter any attacks, any further attacks in Ukraine, and b) if there are any attacks, they're meant to defend, and they will do both.

"They are as strong as anyone has ever seen. Everyone on this panel on this stage up here has acknowledged that."

"We think we're largely finished with security protocols, which are important so that the people of Ukraine know that when this ends, it ends forever.

"But we also think, critically, that we are very, very close to finishing up as robust a prosperity agreement as any country has ever seen coming out of conflicts like this."

"I think today was a very, very big milestone.”

"This does not mean that we will make peace, but peace would not be possible without the progress that was made here today...

"If Ukraine is going to make a final deal, they have to know that after a deal they are secure, they have, obviously, a robust deterrence, and there's real backstops to make sure that this will not happen again."

The signing of the declaration "paves the way for the legal framework under which British, French and partner forces could operate on Ukrainian soil, securing Ukraine's skies and seas and regenerating Ukraine's armed forces for the future.

"I can say that following the ceasefire, the UK and France will establish military hubs across Ukraine and build protected facilities for weapons and military equipment to support Ukraine's defensive needs.

"These security guarantees are key to ensuring that a peace agreement can never amount to a Ukrainian surrender, and that a peace agreement can never result in a new threat to Ukraine."

"We all want ... peace (in Ukraine) to be fair, lasting and clear-eyed ... we want this peace to have its guarantees."

He later told France 2 TV:

"We’ve expressed our availability to be deployed in this multinational force. These are not combat forces, I want to clarify that for our fellow countrymen. It’s for the day after there’s peace, offering a guarantee of peace and security.

"That’s potentially thousands of men. But it’s not, first of all, for right now. Second of all, it will be part of a plan. And finally it will be part of our existing foreign operations.”

VOLODYMYR ZELENSKIY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT

"It has been determined which countries are ready to take the lead in ensuring security on land, in the air, at sea, and in reconstruction. It has been determined what kind of forces are necessary. It has been determined how the forces will be managed and at what levels of command.

"We had very substantive discussions with the American team regarding monitoring to ensure that there are no violations of the peace. America is ready to work on this.

"We believe that documents on security guarantees are ready – bilateral, Ukraine-US, as well as trilateral documents. We expect that they may be signed in the near future."

"Every partner in the coalition must, under its own domestic procedures, decide in due course what contribution it will make... Germany will continue to contribute politically, financially, and militarily."

"On the type and scope of a German contribution, the government and the German Bundestag must and will decide once the conditions (of the ceasefire) are clarified.”

That could include, for example, after a ceasefire, deploying forces for Ukraine on neighboring NATO territory.

"We basically rule nothing out.”

DONALD TUSK, POLISH PRIME MINISTER

"We all want to take advantage of this moment when Ukraine and all the countries that participated in this meeting today are demonstrating some good will.

"Let's face it, Ukraine is ready for compromise, or at least is seriously and earnestly discussing compromise."

"We must... force or persuade Russia to finally sit down at the table seriously and discuss the terms of peace."</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 20:47:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/YE5METSTRNJABNULKEWK6Y3AZ4.jpg?auth=59c8b2ca5f030528573f9674cf70b1c6a0ff32a74c0a1b74f65b42552030286a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump 'sees that there's money to be made' out of a Ukraine ceasefire, analyst says</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/trump-sees-that-there-s-money-to-be-made-out-of-a-ukraine-ceasefire-analyst-says</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 20:48:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/686c5032-eb3e-11f0-8a12-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260106-211212-211901-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran security forces use tear gas on protesters in Tehran bazaar as death toll rises</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260106-iran-security-forces-use-tear-gas-on-protesters-in-tehran-bazaar-as-death-toll-rises</link><description>Iranian security forces fired tear gas to disperse demonstrators at the Tehran bazaar on Tuesday, as an NGO said more than two dozen people had been killed in a crackdown on the most significant protests to hit the Islamic republic in three years.

The protests were triggered by anger over the rising cost of living, with the Iranian rial losing value again on Tuesday to reach another record low against foreign currencies.

Security forces have now killed at least 27 protesters, including five minors under the age of 18 , the Norway-based NGO Iran Human Rights (IHR) said. Iranian authorities say members of security forces have also been killed, including a policeman who was shot dead on Tuesday.

The protest wave began on December 28 with a shutdown by merchants in the Tehran bazaar, a national economic hub. They have since spread to other areas, especially the west, which is home to Kurdish and Lor minority groups.

It is the most serious protest movement in Islamic republic since the 2022-2023 nationwide rallies sparked by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini , who had been arrested for allegedly violating the strict dress code for women.

Iran's Fars news agency said "sporadic gatherings" took place around the bazaar during an afternoon shutdown, with police dispersing the protest and demonstrators scattering into the alleyways nearby.

In social media footage verified by AFP, protesters at the scene could also be heard shouting slogans including "Pahlavi will return" and "Seyyed Ali will be overthrown" – references to the monarchy ousted by the 1979 Islamic revolution and to supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .

Dozens of people are seen shouting "freedom" and "shameless" in footage posted by IHR and the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRNA).

Security forces then fire tear gas at the protesters, who rush to disperse as acrid smoke rises from the ground.

The official IRNA news agency said "some" people were arrested, without giving numbers.

With protests continuing in other areas for a tenth day, HRNA posted footage of large crowds of people marching in protests through Abdanan in western Iran shouting slogans including "this is the last message, the entire regime is the target".

The demonstrations have yet to reach the scale of the 2022-2023 movement, let alone that of the mass 2009 street protests that followed disputed elections.

But against the background of an economic crisis and on the heels of the 12-day war against Israel in June, they present a new challenge for the leadership under 86-year-old Khamenei, in power since 1989.

The government of President Masoud Pezeshkian has announced modest monthly payments for people to alleviate the economic pain, but the head of the judiciary warned Monday that there would be no leniency for "rioters".

According to official announcements in Iranian media, at least 13 people have been killed since the protests began, including members of the security forces.

But IHR said: "At least 27 protesters have been killed by gunfire or other forms of violence carried out by security forces in eight provinces. Five of those killed have been verified to have been children."

It added that more than 1,000 people had been arrested nationwide.

IHR said security forces killed at least six people in a single incident alone on Saturday when they opened fire on protesters in the Malekshahi district of the western Ilam province.

It also accused authorities of raiding the main hospital in Ilam the day after to detain injured protesters.

Amnesty International said on Tuesday that the "attack" on the hospital "exposes yet again how far the Iranian authorities are willing to go to crush dissent".

Pezeshkian has ordered his interior minister to investigate "thoroughly, comprehensively and expertly" what happened in Ilam province, according to the presidential website.

With tensions continuing in the area, a policeman was shot dead Tuesday after being "directly hit by rioters' bullet" in Malekshahi, the Fars news agency said.

IHR said Iranian authorities also raided a hospital in the Hasanabad district of Tehran Tuesday, firing tear gas.

The Iranian currency meanwhile fell in value to approximately 1.47 million rials to the dollar, according to the informal black market rate and several currency monitoring websites.

On December 28, a previous low in the rial – then at 1.43 million to the dollar – had driven traders into the streets and sparked the protest movement.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 20:48:22 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/f62bec32-eb1d-11f0-b7d0-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/f6ac7cbadb34583479d554d2cad827ebc263e250.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump, advisers discussing options for acquiring Greenland and US military is always an option, White House says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-advisers-discussing-options-acquiring-greenland-us-military-is-always-an-2026-01-06/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 6 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump and his team are discussing options for acquiring Greenland and utilizing the U.S. military in furtherance of the goal is "always an option," the White House said on Tuesday.

The Israeli police said they detained the driver and are investigating. Video of the scene shows a bus driving straight into a crowd of ultra-Orthodox men at the demonstration, attended by thousands. Reuters could not immediately contact the driver while in police custody and police have not released his name.

Israel's Magen David Adom emergency services said the 18-year-old, who had been trapped under the bus, was pronounced dead on the scene.

The debate over mandatory military service, and those who are exempt from it, has long caused tensions within Israel's deeply divided society and has placed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu under increasing political strain over the past year.

Ultra-Orthodox seminary students have long been exempt from mandatory military service. Many Israelis criticize what they see as an unfair burden carried by the majority who serve. The ultra-Orthodox resistance to joining the military is based on their strong sense of religious identity, which religious leaders say they fear risks being weakened by army service.

The issue of military service has been a central point of tension against a backdrop of heightened military activity. Over the past two years, Israel has seen its highest military death toll in decades from conflicts connected to the Gaza Strip, Lebanon, Syria, Yemen and Iran.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 21:22:07 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/IVILOXRKGNODPAYCTGPBP7T7II.jpg?auth=76550f3b20dc664337517e915d9f2bbd151d125f1164495e689d019fef7c9fbb&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Maduro's legal team includes seasoned lawyer who defended WikiLeaks' Assange</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260106-maduro-s-legal-team-includes-seasoned-lawyer-who-defended-wikileaks-assange</link><description>The lawyer defending deposed Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro is a veteran trial attorney who previously represented WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange .

Barry Pollack, 61, appeared beside Maduro during his arraignment in a New York courtroom on Monday on drug trafficking and other charges.

Maduro pleaded not guilty and it will be up to Pollack to try to convince a federal jury to render that verdict when the case eventually goes to trial.

The next hearing has been set for March 17.

A graduate of Georgetown University law school, Pollack is a partner in Harris St. Laurent &amp; Wechsler LLP, a boutique New York law firm, and a former president of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers.

Law firm research guide Chambers USA describes him as a "thorough and deep-thinking lawyer" who "lives, breathes and sleeps trials, and has such a natural way in front of juries."

In 2024, Pollack secured the release of Assange from a British prison after negotiating a plea deal with the US Justice Department that saw the Australian plead guilty to violating the Espionage Act by unlawfully disclosing national defense material.

In another high-profile case, Pollack obtained the acquittal of a former Enron accountant who was facing criminal fraud charges stemming from the collapse of the energy giant.

Another prominent case involved a New York man who was wrongfully convicted of murdering his parents when he was a teenager and spent 17 years in prison.

Pollack managed to get the charges dismissed and secured his freedom.

The pledge came at a summit in Paris of the "coalition of the willing" of mainly European nations to firm up guarantees to reassure Kyiv in the event of a ceasefire with Russia, which invaded its neighbour in 2014 and again at full scale in 2022.

Unlike previous coalition meetings, the summit was also attended by U.S. envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner - President Donald Trump's son-in-law - as well as America's top general in Europe, Alexus Grynkewich, who a day earlier fleshed out details of security guarantees with European army chiefs.

Witkoff, who has led talks with Russia, said after the summit that Trump "strongly stands behind security protocols".

"Those security protocols are meant to ... deter any attacks, any further attacks in Ukraine, and ... if there are any attacks, they're meant to defend, and they will do both. They are as strong as anyone has ever seen," he said at a joint news conference with the French, German, British and Ukrainian leaders.

Kushner said that if Ukrainians were to make a final deal "they have to know that after a deal they are secure, they have, obviously, a robust deterrence, and there's real backstops to make sure that this will not happen again."

A statement by coalition leaders also said that allies will participate in a proposed U.S.-led ceasefire monitoring and verification mechanism. Officials have said this would likely involve drones, sensors and satellites, not U.S. troops.

The statement was not explicitly endorsed by the United States and details of a U.S. role were watered down from an earlier draft, notably removing language that outlined the use of U.S. capabilities to support a multinational force in Ukraine.

But European officials hailed the involvement of the U.S. envoys and their strong comments as evidence Washington stood behind the security framework.

Talks to bring the almost four-year war to an end have accelerated since November. However, Moscow has yet to signal willingness to make concessions after Kyiv pushed for changes to a U.S. proposal that initially backed Russia's main demands.

Moscow has also given no public sign that it would accept a peace deal with the security guarantees envisaged by Ukraine's allies. Russia has previously rejected any NATO members having troops inside Ukraine.

Until recently, much of the allies' focus was on pledges of military aid for Ukraine's forces and possible contributions to an international reassurance force.

But attention has now shifted to legally binding guarantees to come to Kyiv's aid in the event of another attack by Moscow. The possibility of a military response is likely to trigger debate in many European countries, diplomats say.

"These commitments may include the use of military capabilities, intelligence and logistical support, diplomatic initiatives, adoption of additional sanctions," the leaders' statement said, adding that they would now "finalise binding commitments."

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the discussions had been substantive with the U.S. delegation, but suggested more still needed to be done.

European leaders present at the meeting, including French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk and Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni stressed that the statement showed renewed unity between Europe and the United States on helping Ukraine.

Macron and Starmer brushed aside questions about whether they could rely on commitments by Trump, particularly given his renewed claims that the U.S. should take over Greenland, an autonomous part of NATO ally Denmark.

The leaders' statement also pledged a European-led "Multinational Force for Ukraine ... to support the rebuilding of Ukraine's armed forces and support deterrence" with "the proposed support of the US".

France and Britain signed a declaration of intent on the future deployment of multinational forces once a ceasefire is reached.

Macron said that could involve sending thousands of French troops.

"It paves the way for the legal framework under which British, French and partner forces could operate on Ukrainian soil, securing Ukraine's skies and seas and regenerating Ukraine's armed forces for the future," Starmer said.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 21:43:31 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/TAWKSNYWUBPURKFBEVZFYBAMV4.jpg?auth=2b68a410336cd2dace40d9487b7395ad9ace4ef124b574530987ece464d78d65&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Maduro’s immunity claim tests US power to prosecute foreign leaders</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/maduros-immunity-claim-tests-us-power-prosecute-foreign-leaders-2026-01-06/</link><description>Jan 6 (Reuters) - Nicolás Maduro’s first appearance in a U.S. courtroom offered a glimpse of the legal battle ahead over rarely tested questions — chief among them whether he can claim immunity from prosecution.

Maduro, who pleaded not guilty to narco-terrorism and cocaine charges on Monday, defiantly claimed that he remained the president of Venezuela -- setting up a showdown over the legal protections customarily given to heads of state.

His lawyer, Barry Pollack , signaled a second line of attack at the arraignment, promising voluminous litigation challenging what he called Saturday’s "abduction" by the U.S. military of Maduro and his wife.

At the heart of the case is whether Maduro, 63, is entitled to head-of-state immunity under international law -- a doctrine that would protect him from being prosecuted for his alleged role in what the Justice Department calls a decades-long narco-terrorist conspiracy.

The U.S. argues that Maduro has not been Venezuela’s president following a disputed 2018 election — a position that would weigh against granting him head-of-state immunity.

But Venezuela’s attorney general counters that the United States lacks jurisdiction and that Maduro remains immune as the country’s leader.

Caren Morrison, a law professor at Georgia State College of Law and a former federal prosecutor, said immunity could pose a challenge for prosecutors, who claim Maduro was corrupt and used his office in the conspiracy.

Legal experts say the issue may hinge on whether Maduro’s alleged actions were part of his official duties as president. Most believe prosecutors are likely to prevail in the end.

Head-of-state immunity is rarely litigated in criminal cases. Former Panamanian strongman Manuel Noriega unsuccessfully invoked it against charges of drug trafficking and money laundering after his 1989 capture by U.S. forces during the Panama invasion. Unlike Maduro, Noriega never held the formal title of president.

U.S. courts have dismissed civil lawsuits against heads of state recognized by the State Department, including one against Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos in 1975 and another in 2022 against Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman over the killing of U.S.-based journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

But courts can also throw out cases against former leaders and other government officials who can show their actions were part of their official duties. They can, however, be found liable for certain illegal acts.

A civil case involving a former prime minister of Somalia ultimately went to the U.S. Supreme Court, which kicked it back to a lower court that held he was not immune from being held accountable for torture and extrajudicial killings.

In addition to challenging the prosecution on immunity grounds, Maduro's lawyer told the court on Monday his client would challenge what he called the leader's "military abduction," which scholars said may have violated international law.

Noriega made a similar argument after his capture, but a federal appeals court rejected it, citing Supreme Court rulings that forcible abduction does not violate due process or a court’s jurisdiction over a defendant.

Noriega was convicted by a U.S. jury in 1992 and later served sentences in the United States, France and Panama, where he died in 2017.

If Maduro cannot get the indictment dismissed, legal experts say he may still contest the government’s case.

The indictment describes a decades-long drug operation, but few events directly tie Maduro to the alleged narcotics and terrorism conspiracy described by U.S. prosecutors.

"When you look closely at that indictment, there's really not a lot of Maduro in there," said Zachary Margulis-Ohnuma, a defense attorney who represented Hugo Armando Carvajal Barrios, a former Venezuelan official who pleaded guilty to narco-terrorism charges.

To prove conspiracy, prosecutors must show Maduro agreed with others to commit a crime. The indictment is thin on links to terrorist groups, said Richard Broughton, a professor at the University of Detroit Mercy School of Law.

He said the Justice Department may be holding back evidence to protect witnesses.

"Was a particular terrorist organization paid by Maduro and his associates for any kind of protection, for assisting with any kind of shipment?" Broughton said. "That's the kind of stuff that I would want to know."</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 22:22:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5ABW5SM5KNK3NKAL2LRMCWTL7I.jpg?auth=0237006a5b58b72ece503ad88d7db50d7d3cfd1e63d7ddbce928013be935384d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israel, Syria agree to share intelligence, seek military de-escalation after Paris talks</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260106-israel-syria-intelligence-military-de-escalation-paris</link><description>Syria 's new government and Israel will set up a joint group under US supervision to share intelligence and seek military de-escalation on the ground, they announced Tuesday after talks.

The Syrian foreign minister traveled to Paris in his country's first known meeting in months with Israel, which has pounded its historic adversary despite US unease over the pressure on the fragile government.

A joint statement issued by the US State Department after the talks in the French capital said that Syria and Israel were committed to "achieving lasting security and stability arrangements for both countries."

"Both sides have decided to establish a joint fusion mechanism -- a dedicated communication cell -- to facilitate immediate and ongoing coordination on their intelligence sharing, military de-escalation, diplomatic engagement and commercial opportunities under the supervision of the United States," the statement said.

"This mechanism will serve as a platform to address any disputes promptly and work to prevent misunderstandings."

The statement did not say Israel would refrain from further strikes or restore an agreement that was previously in place.

Israel has no diplomatic relations with Syria, which during the half-century of rule by the Assad family publicly championed the Palestinian cause and was the Arab world's key ally of Iran's clerical state, Israel's arch-enemy.

Bashar al-Assad was ousted in a lightning offensive in December 2024 by Ahmed al-Sharaa, a former jihadist, after more than a decade of brutal civil war.

President Donald Trump has met and praised Sharaa , now the interim president and an ally of Saudi Arabia and Turkey, brushing aside Israeli skepticism.

The talks in Paris were mediated by Tom Barrack, a Trump business friend who is ambassador to Turkey and an outspoken advocate of supporting Sharaa.

The United States recently fully removed remaining sanctions on Syria, hoping to give the country a chance to integrate into the global economy.

Since Assad's fall, Israel sent troops into a UN-patrolled buffer zone that had separated Israeli and Syrian forces on the Golan Heights , which Israel captured in the 1967 Six-Day War.

Israel, saying there was a power vacuum, also unilaterally declared void a 1974 disengagement agreement with Syria that had kept in effect a ceasefire.

Sharaa has sought to restore the agreement and avoid wider conflict with Israel, but he has also opposed Israel's insistence on maintaining a demilitarized zone in southern Syria.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office called for economic cooperation with Syria and "regional stability and security."

"It was agreed to continue the dialogue to advance shared objectives and safeguard the security of the Druze minority in Syria," it said.

Israel has cited violence against the Druze, who also have a presence inside Israel, as a reason to intervene in Syria.

Israel in July launched massive air strikes, including hitting the defense ministry in Damascus, leading some analysts to believe it was hoping to degrade military capacities of Syria while it was at a weak point.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 22:50:03 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/8dfb65ac-946a-11f0-a88c-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25232343473198.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump considering military options to acquire Greenland</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/trump-considering-military-options-to-acquire-greenland</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 22:50:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/2ef5839c-eb4c-11f0-aaa6-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260106-230105-230407-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ramaphosa opposes US military operation against deposed Venezuelan leader Nicholas Maduro</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/ramaphosa-opposes-us-military-operation-against-deposed-venezuelan-leader-nicholas-maduro</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 22:50:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/631daef6-eb47-11f0-8290-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/DN191641-A-01-20251230-01.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>What would be the consequences of a Greenland invasion?</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/what-would-be-the-consequences-of-a-greenland-invasion</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 22:50:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/75396050-eb45-11f0-832c-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260106-220814-221001-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Armed police patrol streets of Caracas as CIA reportedly advises to keep Maduro loyalists in power</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/armed-police-patrol-streets-of-caracas-as-cia-reportedly-advises-to-keep-maduro-loyalists-in-power</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 22:50:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/1769be16-eb45-11f0-a505-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260106-220357-220651-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Donald Trump says using US military to secure Greenland is ‘always an option’</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260106-trump-military-options-greenland</link><description>President Donald Trump is exploring how to take control of Greenland and using the US military is "always an option," the White House said Tuesday, further upping tensions with NATO ally Denmark.

Washington's stark warning came despite Greenland and Denmark both calling for a speedy meeting with the United States to clear up "misunderstandings."

The US military intervention in Venezuela has reignited Trump's designs on the autonomous Danish territory in the Arctic, which has untapped rare earth deposits and could be a vital player as melting polar ice opens up new shipping routes.

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said that "acquiring Greenland is a national security priority of the United States," to deter adversaries like Russia and China.

"The president and his team are discussing a range of options to pursue this important foreign policy goal, and of course, utilising the US military is always an option at the commander in chief's disposal," she said in a statement to AFP.

Trump's renewed claims over self-governing Greenland have stoked concerns in Europe that the transatlantic alliance with the United States could be about to fracture.

Earlier, Greenland and Denmark said they had asked to meet US Secretary of State Marco Rubio quickly to discuss the issue.

"It has so far not been possible," Greenland's Foreign Minister Vivian Motzfeldt wrote on social media, "despite the fact that the Greenlandic and Danish governments have requested a meeting at the ministerial level throughout 2025."

Denmark's Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said meeting Rubio should resolve "certain misunderstandings."

Greenland Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen again insisted that the island was not for sale and only Greenlanders should decide its future.

His comments came after Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Poland and Spain joined Denmark in saying that they would defend the "universal principles" of "sovereignty, territorial integrity and the inviolability of borders."

"For this support, I wish to express my deepest gratitude," Nielsen wrote on social media.

Washington already has a military base in Greenland, which is home to some 57,000 people.

Trump hinted on Sunday that a decision on Greenland may come "in about two months," once the situation in Venezuela, where US forces seized President Nicolas Maduro on Saturday, has stabilised.

The European leaders' joint statement called Arctic security "critical" for international and transatlantic security.

Denmark, including Greenland, was part of NATO, it added, urging a collective approach to security in the polar region.

The statement was signed by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk and Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez.

"Greenland belongs to its people. It is for Denmark and Greenland, and them only, to decide on matters concerning Denmark and Greenland," the statement said.

But Macron and Starmer both sought to play down the issue as they attended Ukraine peace talks in Paris alongside Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner.

"I cannot imagine a scenario in which the United States of America would be placed in a position to violate Danish sovereignty," Macron said.

Starmer said he had made his position "clear" in the joint statement -- although he did not restate that position in front of the cameras.

Trump has been floating the idea of annexing Greenland since his first term.

"It's like a broken record," Marc Jacobsen, a specialist in security, politics and diplomacy in the Arctic at the Royal Danish Defence College, told AFP.

Trump has claimed that Denmark cannot ensure the security of Greenland, saying it had bought just one dog sled recently.

But Copenhagen has invested heavily in security, allocating some 90 billion kroner ($14 billion) in the last year.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 23:23:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/432a6f0a-eb2c-11f0-87f5-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-06T131202Z-431987562-RC2U9DA7NHYT-RTRMADP-3-USA-TRUMP-GREENLAND-EUROPE.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Putin hails 'holy mission' of Russian troops at Orthodox Christmas service</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/putin-hails-holy-mission-russian-troops-orthodox-christmas-service-2026-01-06/</link><description>Jan 7 (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin attended an early Wednesday Russian Orthodox Christmas service and hailed his troops' “holy mission” to defend Russia, pairing the ceremony with a holiday address on unity, charity and support for the armed forces.

His appearance came as the war Russia launched with its full scale invasion of Ukraine nears the end of its fourth year, with the Kremlin casting the conflict as a national mission and leaning heavily on patriotic and religious symbolism.

Russian Orthodox Christmas services are held around midnight, drawing congregations for liturgies, though Putin has often attended smaller ceremonies, including inside a Kremlin cathedral.

Video footage showed Putin in a dark suit without a tie among uniformed servicemen, alongside wives and children, as clerics conducted the service at the St George Victory Bearer church near Moscow.

“Russia’s warriors have always, as if at the Lord’s behest, carried out this mission of defending the Fatherland and its people, saving the Motherland and its people,” Putin said at the church after the service.

“At all times in Russia, this is how people have regarded their warriors, as those who, as if at the Lord’s behest, carry out this holy mission."

In a Christmas greeting published earlier on the Kremlin website, Putin praised the Russian Orthodox Church and other Christian denominations for strengthening social unity and safeguarding Russia’s historical and cultural heritage.

He said religious organisations focus on mercy and charity, care for those in need, and support participants and veterans of the war, which Moscow calls a special military operation.

“Such important and in demand work deserves the most sincere recognition,” Putin said.

Putin has attended Christmas services since 2000, often outside Moscow, but since the war began he has more often marked the holiday near the capital, including at his Novo Ogaryovo state residence.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 23:41:43 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5KDMLWJAQRN2HLKJLMJ376G464.jpg?auth=6f9b1a5ea8977dd9ac36cb41002c16da86939549399e1e32b17cc3e775728e75&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Exclusive: In post-Maduro Venezuela, US eyes security chief as potential target, sources say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/post-maduro-venezuela-us-eyes-security-chief-potential-target-sources-say-2026-01-06/</link><description>WASHINGTON/MEXICO CITY, Jan 6 (Reuters) - The Trump administration has put Venezuela's hardline interior minister on notice that he could be at the top of its target list unless he helps Interim President Delcy Rodriguez meet U.S. demands and keep order following the toppling of Nicolas Maduro, according to three people familiar with the matter.

Diosdado Cabello, who controls security forces accused of widespread human rights abuses, is one of a handful of Maduro loyalists that President Donald Trump has decided to rely on as temporary rulers to maintain stability during a transition period, said one source briefed on the administration’s thinking.

U.S. officials are especially concerned that Cabello, given his record of repression and history of rivalry with Rodriguez, could play the spoiler and are seeking to force his cooperation even as they look for ways to eventually push him out of power and into exile, said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

In the meantime, they have communicated to Cabello via intermediaries that if he is defiant, he could face a similar fate to Maduro, the authoritarian leader captured in a U.S. raid on Saturday and whisked away to New York to face prosecution on “narco-terrorism” charges, or could see his life in danger, the source said.

But taking out Cabello could be risky, possibly motivating pro-government motorcycle groups, known as colectivos, to take to the streets, unleashing the chaos Washington wants to avoid. Their reaction may depend on whether they feel protected by other officials, however.

Also on the list of potential targets is Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino, who, like Cabello, is under a U.S. drug trafficking indictment and has a multimillion-dollar bounty on his head, according to two sources.

“This remains a law enforcement operation, and we are not done yet,” said a U.S. Justice Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity.

U.S. officials see Padrino’s collaboration as crucial for avoiding a power vacuum due to his command of the armed forces. They believe he is less dogmatic than Cabello and more likely to toe the U.S. line while seeking his own safe exit, the source briefed on administration thinking said.

A senior Trump administration official declined to answer Reuters' specific questions but said in a statement: “The President is speaking about exerting maximum leverage with the remaining elements in Venezuela and ensuring they cooperate with the United States by halting illegal migration, stopping drug flows, revitalizing oil infrastructure, and doing what is right for the Venezuelan people.”

Venezuela's communications ministry, which handles all press requests for the government, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

ADMINISTRATION DOUBTS OPPOSITION COULD KEEP PEACE: SOURCE

The administration has decided Venezuela's opposition, led by Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Corina Machado, would be unable to keep the peace at a time when Trump wants enough calm on the ground to jump-start access for U.S. oil companies to Venezuela’s vast oil reserves and to avoid having to put U.S. forces on the ground, the source said.

Trump instead has embraced a classified CIA assessment that concluded Maduro’s top aides would be best situated to run the country on an interim basis, according to sources briefed on the matter.

U.S. officials also decided to work with Maduro’s allies for now out of concern that the country could descend into chaos if they tried to force a democratic handover, and that an excluded member of the inner circle might foment a coup, according to one of the sources.

But the administration wants to eventually see a move toward new elections, U.S. officials have said, though the timeframe remains uncertain.

Trump has offered no clear explanation of how Washington would oversee Venezuela after the biggest U.S. intervention in Latin America since the 1989 invasion of Panama. Critics have condemned it as neocolonialism and a violation of international law.

For now, Washington sees Rodriguez as its best bet to temporarily hold power while it continues developing plans for governing post-Maduro Venezuela, a strategy one source described as “very much still a work in progress.”

Among the U.S. demands for Venezuela's leaders are a demonstration of willingness to open up Venezuela’s oil industry on terms favorable to U.S. companies, a crackdown on the narcotics trade, the expulsion of Cuban security personnel and an end to Venezuelan cooperation with Iran, the source briefed on administration thinking said.

The U.S. wants to see progress toward meeting U.S. objectives in a matter of weeks, the source said.

Beyond threats of further military action, the U.S. could use Rodriguez's finances as leverage. The U.S. has identified those assets, sheltered in Qatar, and could seize them, the source said.

U.S. authorities and their intermediaries are also seeking to co-opt other senior Venezuelan officials and those at levels below them to open the way for a government that will acquiesce to Washington’s interests, the source said.

Trump’s vow to “run” Venezuela appears for now to be more an aspiration to exert outside control - or at least heavy influence - over the OPEC nation without deploying U.S. ground forces, a move that would be unpopular at home.

Trump’s advisers see Rodriguez as the linchpin: a technocrat who they believe is amenable to working with the U.S. on a transition and oil-related issues, according to people briefed on the U.S. strategy.

Though she and Maduro’s other top loyalists have projected a mostly united front, it is unclear whether that will last.

Rodriguez and Cabello have both operated at the heart of the government, legislature and ruling socialist party for years, but have never been considered close allies.

A former military officer, Cabello, seen as the main enforcer of repression within Maduro’s government, exerts influence over the country's military and civilian counterintelligence agencies, which conduct widespread domestic espionage.

“Maduro brought him in to crack heads together in the aftermath of the stolen election,” said Geoff Ramsey, non-resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council think-tank.

The United Nations found both SEBIN, the civilian agency, and DGCIM, the military intelligence service, had committed crimes against humanity as part of a state plan to crush dissent.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 01:46:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7IEG32MJ3JO6XJQUORBFJQAJN4.jpg?auth=373d8e91b20c817c895ba8b8bfa6448d45aaf76e046ee626b0f8861d8181c79e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Brigitte Bardot to be buried on the French Riviera</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/brigitte-bardot-be-buried-french-riviera-2026-01-07/</link><description>SAINT-TROPEZ, France, Jan 7 (Reuters) - Brigitte Bardot, an icon of French cinema who died last month aged 91, will be buried on Wednesday by the sea in the French Riviera resort of Saint-Tropez.

Bardot's funeral will take place at 1000 GMT at Notre-Dame-de-l'Assomption church before she is buried in strict privacy in a cemetery in the glitzy town where she lived for much of her later life behind high walls, surrounded by a menagerie of cats, dogs and horses.

A tribute open to locals and fans will take place at the Pre des Pecheurs area in the old town quarter called La Ponche, the historic centre of the former fishing village.

Bardot shot to international fame in her early 20s in the film "And God Created Woman", her tousled hair and fierce energy radiating a sexual magnetism that defined liberated femininity in 1950s France.

Known affectionately as B.B. by many in France, Bardot's roles made her not just a sex symbol, but a pop culture icon and a touchstone for changing social attitudes. She became the first celebrity to model for a bust of Marianne, the traditional symbol of the French Republic that adorns French town halls.

However, Bardot found celebrity life isolating and a distraction from life's simple pleasures. She made the last of her films in 1973 and left public life, devoting herself to animal welfare.

A tireless crusader for animal rights, Bardot's political sympathies shifted to the far-right National Front. Incendiary remarks on immigration, Islam and homosexuality saw her convicted multiple times for inciting racial hatred.

She publicly endorsed the party's successive leaders, Jean-Marie Le Pen and his daughter Marine Le Pen, whom she once referred to as "the Joan of Arc of the 21st century". Marine Le Pen is expected to attend the funeral.

Aurore Berge, Macron's minister for equality and a defender of animal rights, has been invited and will represent the government.

Bardot told Le Monde in 2018 that she wished to be buried in a quiet corner of her garden. But the Var Prefecture said it never received any request for a private burial, which would have been needed to bury her in her garden.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 01:46:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/FWHVU4YZG5PBBBH5OD6Y7BZPSU.jpg?auth=04c4788cc89ce6bc1073b01fe6d7e17e82f275814b08922186fb7f4296489b68&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia sends submarine to escort tanker the US tried to seize off Venezuela, WSJ reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/russia-sends-submarine-escort-tanker-us-tried-seize-off-venezuela-wsj-reports-2026-01-07/</link><description>Jan 6 (Reuters) - Russia has deployed a submarine and other naval vessels to escort an aging oil tanker, Bella 1, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday , citing a U.S. official.

A short time later, the world watched as the seat of US power descended into chaos, and democracy hung in the balance.

On the fifth anniversary of Jan. 6, 2021 , there is no official event to memorialise what happened that day, when the mob made its way down Pennsylvania Avenue, battled police at the Capitol barricades and stormed inside, as lawmakers fled. The political parties refuse to agree on a shared history of the events, which were broadcast around the globe. And the official plaque honoring the police who defended the Capitol has never been hung.

Instead, the day displayed the divisions that still define Washington, and the country, and the White House itself issued a glossy new report with its own revised history of what happened.

Trump, during a lengthy morning speech to House Republicans away from the Capitol at the rebranded Kennedy Center now carrying his own name, shifted blame for Jan. 6 onto the rioters themselves.

The president said he had intended only for his supporters to go “peacefully and patriotically” to confront Congress as it certified Biden's win. He blamed the media for focusing on other parts of his speech that day.

At the same time, Democrats held their own morning meeting at the Capitol, reconvening members of the House committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, attack for a panel discussion. Recalling the history of the day is important, they said, in order to prevent what Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., warned was the GOP's “Orwellian project of forgetting.”

And the former leader of the militant Proud Boys, Enrique Tarrio, summoned people for a midday march retracing the rioters' steps from the White House to the Capitol, this time to honor Trump supporter Ashli Babbitt and those who died in the Jan. 6 siege and its aftermath. More than 100 people gathered, including Babbitt's mother.

Tarrio and others are putting pressure on the Trump administration to punish officials who investigated and prosecuted the Jan. 6 rioters. He was sentenced to 22 years in prison for seditious conspiracy for orchestrating the Jan. 6 attack, and he is among more than 1,500 defendants who saw their charges dropped when Trump issued a sweeping pardon on his return to the White House last year.

“They should be fired and prosecuted,” Tarrio told the crowd before they arrived at the Capitol, confronted along the way by counter-protesters, and sang the National Anthem.

The White House, in its new report, highlighted the work the president has already done to free those charged and turned the blame on Democrats for certifying Biden’s election victory.

This milestone anniversary carried echoes of the deep differences that erupted that day.

But it unfolds while attention is focused elsewhere, particularly after the US military's stunning capture of Venezuela's president, Nicolás Maduro, and Trump's plans to take over the country and prop up its vast oil industry, a striking new era of American expansionism.

“These people in the administration, they want to lecture the world about democracy when they're undermining the rule of law at home, as we all will be powerfully reminded,” House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York said on the eve of the anniversary.

Jeffries and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer held a candlelight vigil outside the Capitol with lawmakers and family members of police officers to mark the anniversary.

Few Republicans joined in the day’s remembrances, and the Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana, responding to requests for comment about the delay in hanging the plaque honoring the police at the Capitol, as required by law, said in a statement on the eve of the anniversary that the statute “is not implementable," and proposed alternatives “also do not comply with the statute.”

At the morning hearing at the Capitol, lawmakers heard from a range of witnesses and others — including former US Capitol Police officer Winston Pingeon, who said as a kid he always dreamed of being a cop. But on that day, he thought he was going to die in the mayhem on the steps of the Capitol.

"I implore America to not forget what happened," he said, urging the country to find common ground. “I believe the vast majority of Americans have so much more in common than what separates us.”

Also testifying was Pamela Hemphill, a rioter who refused Trump’s pardon, blamed the president for the violence and silenced the room as she apologized to the officer sitting alongside her at the witness table, stifling tears.

“I can’t allow them not be recognized, to be lied about,” Hemphill said about the police who she said also saved her life as she fell and was trampled on by the mob. “Until I can see that plaque get up there, I'm not done.”

Among those testifying was former Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, who was one of two Republicans on the panel that investigated Trump's efforts to overturn Biden's win. The other, Liz Cheney, who lost her own reelection bid to a Trump-backed challenger, did not appear. Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi urged the country to turn away from persistent lies and violence that she said sends the wrong message about democracy.

Republican Rep. Barry Loudermilk of Georgia, who has been tapped by Johnson to lead a new committee to probe other theories about what happened on Jan. 6, rejected Tuesday's session as a “partisan exercise” designed to hurt Trump and his allies.

Many Republicans reject the narrative that Trump sparked the Jan. 6 attack, and Johnson, before he became the House speaker, had led challenges to the 2020 election. He was among some 130 GOP lawmakers voting that day to reject the presidential results from some states.

Instead, they have focused on security lapses at the Capitol — from the time it took for the National Guard to arrive on the scene to the failure of the police canine units to discover the pipe bombs found that day outside Republican and Democratic party headquarters. The FBI arrested a Virginia man suspected of placing the pipe bombs, and he told investigators last month he believed someone needed to speak up for those who believed the 2020 election was stolen, authorities say.

“The Capitol Complex is no more secure today than it was on January 6,” Loudermilk said in a social media post. “My Select Subcommittee remains committed to transparency and accountability and ensuring the security failures that occurred on January 6 and the partisan investigation that followed never happens again.”

In the Senate, one Republican Sen. Thom Tillis displayed a replica plaque behind him and said he would try later this week to push a vote ensuring it complies with the law so it can be displayed as intended. Another Republican, Sen. Tommy Tuberville, objected to a separate resolution condemning the Capitol attack.

At least five people died in the Capitol siege and its aftermath, including Babbitt, who was shot and killed by police while trying to climb through the window of a door near the House chamber, and Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick died later after battling the mob. Several law enforcement personnel died later, some by suicide.

The Justice Department indicted Trump on four counts in a conspiracy to defraud voters with his claims of a rigged election in the run-up to the Jan. 6 attack.

Former Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith told lawmakers last month that the riot at the Capitol “does not happen” without Trump. He ended up abandoning the case once Trump was reelected president, adhering to department guidelines against prosecuting a sitting president.

Trump, who never made it to the Capitol that day as he hunkered down at the White House, was impeached by the House on the sole charge of having incited the insurrection. The Senate acquitted him after top GOP senators said they believed the matter was best left to the courts.

Ahead of the 2024 election, the Supreme Court ruled ex-presidents have broad immunity from prosecution.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 01:47:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/f422f732-eb1d-11f0-9022-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/832ff31832c1592f4ff83972efcb85ffb4bee183.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Magnitude 6.7 earthquake strikes near Baculin, Philippines, USGS says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/magnitude-67-earthquake-strikes-near-baculin-philippines-usgs-says-2026-01-07/</link><description>Jan 7 (Reuters) - A 6.7 magnitude earthquake struck 68 km (42 miles) east of Baculin in the Philippines, at a depth of 10 km (6 miles) on Wednesday, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) said.

The list mostly included countries from Africa, Latin America and South Asia. It had a total of 38 countries as of Tuesday. The policy for the newly added nations will go into effect on January 21, the State Department website said.

Venezuela, whose toppled leader Nicolas Maduro was seized by U.S. forces over the weekend and brought to New York, was also included in the list.

"Any citizen or national traveling on a passport issued by one of these countries, who is found otherwise eligible for a B1/B2 visa, must post a bond for $5,000, $10,000, or $15,000," the State Department website said, adding the amount was determined at the time of the visa interview.

Applicants must agree to the terms of the bond through the U.S. Treasury Department's online payment platform, Pay.gov, the State Department said.

A State Department pilot program was launched in August with an initial list of nations.

The U.S. government has said the bonds seek to deter visitors from overstaying their visas intended for tourism or business purposes.

Since taking office last January, Trump, a Republican, has pursued a hard-line immigration policy, involving an aggressive deportation drive , revocations of visas and green cards and screening of social media posts and past speeches of immigrants.

Human rights groups have widely condemned Trump's immigration and travel-related policies, saying they curb due process guarantees and free speech. Trump and his allies say the policies seek to improve domestic security.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 03:39:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/S5UMFJJICNONHEB7B42HMMW5XM.jpg?auth=c6e3d87a45403522d0ef038ce71001a0ed5757da7e3aff2c37dd934a5d17a8a4&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Japan says China's dual-use export ban 'unacceptable', rare earths in crosshairs</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/japan-says-chinas-dual-use-export-ban-unacceptable-rare-earths-crosshairs-2026-01-07/</link><description>TOKYO, Jan 7 (Reuters) - Japan's top government spokesperson said on Wednesday that China's ban on exports of dual-use items to the country was "absolutely unacceptable and deeply regrettable", as a diplomatic dispute between Asia's top two economies ramped up.

Dual-use items are goods, software or technologies that have both civilian and military applications, including certain rare earth elements that are essential for making drones and chips.

Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi touched off the dispute with Beijing late last year by saying a Chinese attack on democratically-governed Taiwan could be deemed an existential threat to Japan. China regards Taiwan as part of its territory, a claim the island rejects.

Beijing has demanded she retract the remarks, which she has not done, prompting a series of countermeasures, the latest of which was Tuesday's ban on exports of dual-use items for military use.

"A measure such as this, targeting only our country, differs significantly from international practice, is absolutely unacceptable and deeply regrettable," Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Minoru Kihara told a daily press conference on Wednesday.

He declined to comment on the possible impact on Japanese industry, saying it remained unclear exactly what items would be targeted.

The reaction from markets to the news was relatively muted though Japanese shares were lower on Wednesday, bucking a global trend that carried U.S. and European benchmarks to record highs.

Japan's broad Topix (.TOPX) , opens new tab gauge of equities slid 0.55%, with a subindex of mining shares leading declines, down 3.2%.

China Daily, a newspaper owned by the ruling Chinese Communist Party, reported on Tuesday that Beijing was considering tightening the license review of rare earth exports to Japan more broadly, citing sources with knowledge of the matter.

Such a move could have sweeping implications for the manufacturing powerhouse, including its key automotives sector, analysts say.

While Japan has sought to diversify its supply of rare earths since China last throttled exports of the minerals in 2010, around 60% of its imports still come from China.

A three-month curb on Chinese exports of rare earths, like that seen during the 2010, could cost Japanese businesses 660 billion yen ($4.21 billion) and shave 0.11% of annual gross domestic product, Nomura Research Institute economist Takahide Kiuchi said in a note on Wednesday.

A year-long ban would knock 0.43% off GDP, he added.

So far, China Customs data has shown no sign of a decline in rare earth exports to Japan, though the data is released with some delay. In November, the latest month for which there was data, exports grew 35% to 305 metric tons, the highest tally last year.

The four videos recorded by the suspect, Claudio Neves Valente, were discovered during a search of the storage locker in Salem, New Hampshire, where he was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot on December 18, ending a six-day manhunt, the prosecutors said.

Valente, 48, a Portuguese national who had attended Brown two decades ago as a doctoral student in physics, slipped into an engineering building on the Ivy League campus on December 13 and opened fire with a handgun, killing two students and injuring nine others, according to police.

Authorities later determined that after fleeing the Providence, Rhode Island, scene of the Brown attack, Valente killed a physics professor from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in a separate shooting at his home outside Boston.

Valente and the slain MIT professor Nuno Loureiro had once been classmates in Lisbon, authorities said after linking the two shooting incidents. But investigators have yet to offer a motive for either case.

The newly released transcripts of the videos, recovered by the FBI from an electronic device and translated from Portuguese to English, mark the first statements attributed to Valente since his death but shed little new light on the Brown tragedy.

According to the U.S. Attorney's Office in Boston, which has overseen the federal investigation of the shootings, Valente "admitted that he had been planning the Brown University shooting for a long time."

In the rambling, disjointed recordings prosecutors say he made while holed up in the storage unit after the shootings, Valente refers to a shell casing injuring one of his eyes and adds that he had "already planned this for a little more" than "six semesters."

Except for repeated mentions of his eye injury, however, Valente speaks elliptically of what has happened, never explicitly talks about firing a gun or killing anyone, and offers no insights into what precipitated the violence ascribed to him.

"I don't know if there are any kind of implications of what I wanted to do or not," he said. "It was all incompetent, but at least something was done. ... The only objective was to [pause] leave more or less on my own terms and -- and it's -- it's already long overdue."

He alludes to vague, unspecified grievances, while expressing no remorse.

"To say that I was extraordinarily satisfied, no, but I also don't regret what I did," he said in one video. "I am not going to apologize, because during my lifetime no one sincerely apologized to me."

Federal prosecutors said that the evidence collected to date continues to rule out any basis for concerns about ongoing public safety threats associated with the shootings, but that investigators' search for a motive would continue.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 03:39:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/2ZVPEDFTJNM2JCB3BXZ3UTN77U.jpg?auth=3a3fb3bbdcb2b029f3c768899fc77982c8e1744270e4b7543b5fc2d5a6c55839&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China takes punitive actions on three Taiwanese for 'independence activities'</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-takes-punitive-actions-three-taiwanese-independence-activities-2026-01-07/</link><description>BEIJING, Jan 7 (Reuters) - China will take punitive actions against three Taiwanese for their involvement in separatist activities related to "Taiwan independence", its Taiwan Affairs Office said on Wednesday.

Two of the others, as well as their relatives, will be banned from entering the mainland, Hong Kong and Macau, the office's spokesperson Chen Binhua told reporters at a weekly news briefing.

Chen said the purpose of the actions against a small number of "Taiwan independence diehards" is to "fundamentally safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity", and that it was not aimed at Taiwanese in general.

Far-right leader Marine Le Pen has confirmed she will attend, while President Emmanuel Macron will not.

Some showbiz stars can be expected, but her animal rights foundation has stressed it will be a "no frills" event.

"The ceremony will reflect who she was, with the people who knew and loved her. There will no doubt be some surprises, but it will be simple, just as Brigitte wanted," Bruno Jacquelin, spokesman for the Brigitte Bardot Foundation, told AFP.

The funeral will be shown on public screens in Saint-Tropez for well-wishers and fans who are expected to shrug off brisk winter temperatures to pay a final tribute.

The star of "And God Created Woman" died aged 91 on December 28 at her home in Saint-Tropez, where she retreated after giving up her film career in the early 1970s. No cause of death has been given.

Bardot was a divisive figure who alienated many fans with her anti-immigration and racist political views in later life.

Her death sparked mixed reactions. Observers agreed that she was a cinema legend who came to embody the sexual revolution of the 1960s through her acting and daring, unconventional persona.

But having been convicted five times for hate speech, particularly about Muslims, left-wing figures have offered only muted tributes -- and sometimes none at all.

"To be moved by the fate of dolphins but remain indifferent to the deaths of migrants in the Mediterranean -- what level of cynicism is that?" commented Greens lawmaker Sandrine Rousseau about Bardot's views.

Macron's office offered to organise a national homage similar to one staged for fellow New Wave hero Jean-Paul Belmondo in 2021, but the president was snubbed by Bardot's family.

She is survived by her fourth husband, Bernard d'Ormale, a former advisor to Le Pen's late father Jean-Marie, an outspoken far-right leader.

No information has been given about whether Bardot's only child, Nicolas-Jacques Charrier, will attend the funeral.

Charrier, 65, was brought up by his father, film director Jacques Charrier, and lives in Oslo.

Bardot wrote in her memoirs that she had wanted an abortion but was prevented from doing so by her then-husband.

She compared pregnancy to carrying a "tumour that fed on me" and called parenthood a "misery", living most of her life estranged from her son, although they drew closer in the final years of her life.

Bardot's sister Mijanou, 87, who had a brief film career, is not expected to make the trip from her home in Los Angeles.

"My Brigitte, the one I loved more than anything... now knows the greatest of mysteries. She also knows whether our beloved pets are waiting for us on the other side," she wrote on Facebook.

"My God, please let that be the case so she doesn't feel alone, but is with them."

In 2018, Brigitte Bardot had said she wished to be buried in the garden of her home along with her pets to avoid a "crowd of idiots" trampling on the tombs of her parents and grandparents who are in the same cemetery where she will be interred.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 03:40:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/e6c122bc-e3d4-11f0-8d29-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/000-ARP2274742.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Yemen's STC leader al-Zubaidi flees, Saudi-backed coalition says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/yemens-stc-leader-al-zubaidi-flees-saudi-backed-coalition-says-2026-01-07/</link><description>Jan 7 (Reuters) - The leader of Yemen's Southern Transitional Council (STC), Aidarous al-Zubaidi, failed to board a plane set to take him to Riyadh, and fled instead to an unknown destination, the Saudi-backed coalition in the country said on Wednesday.

The remarks came amid efforts to end fighting that erupted last month between the STC, backed by the United Arab Emirates, and Yemen's Saudi-backed internationally recognised government, which has triggered a major feud between the Gulf allies.

Zubaidi was set to travel to Saudi Arabia days after Yemen's government said it had asked Riyadh to host a forum on the southern issue.

In a statement, coalition spokesperson Turki al-Maliki said a flight carrying a large number of senior leaders of the separatist group departed after a delay of more than three hours without Zubaidi, and with no information on his whereabouts.

During the delay "information became available indicating that he had moved large forces," Maliki added, citing "calls for mobilisation and the movement and arming of factions with light and medium weapons".

The feud between the UAE and Saudi Arabia has fractured a coalition originally created to fight the Iran-aligned Houthis, who are still the dominant military force in Yemen.

The Houthis seized the Yemeni capital of Sanaa in 2014 and Gulf countries intervened the following year in support of the internationally recognised government, splitting Yemen into rival zones of control.

The coalition also said it carried out limited pre-emptive airstrikes in Yemen's southern province of al-Dhalea after monitoring the movements of armed forces that had left their camps.

Domestic sources and sources within the STC reported more than 15 strikes in the province, the birthplace of Zubaidi.

Following the developments, the Saudi-backed presidential council stripped Zubaidi of his membership and referred him to the public prosecutor on charges including high treason, state news agency SABA said.

The decision, issued by council chairman Rashad al-Alimi, accused Zubaidi of inciting armed rebellion, attacking constitutional authorities and committing abuses against civilians in southern Yemen.

For years, the STC has been part of Yemen's internationally- recognised government.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 04:41:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/OIYRVKIEZZJX5KG4PJOW4C4XP4.jpg?auth=23ceedb591e6b1bd8591393539af8ed48d58aff3c59083f7e8d7ccd0f2b19eb0&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Taiwan says China's war games sought to undermine global support for the island</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/taiwan-says-chinas-war-games-sought-undermine-global-support-island-2026-01-07/</link><description>TAIPEI, Jan 7 (Reuters) - China's war game exercises around Taiwan last week were part of a campaign to counter growing international support for the island and an attempt to divert attention away from Beijing's economic troubles, Taiwan's top security agency said on Wednesday.

As part of its exercises, called "Justice Mission 2025," China fired dozens of rockets towards Taiwan and deployed a large number of warships and aircraft near the island. That caused dozens of domestic flights in Taiwan to be cancelled and drew concern from allies in the region and the West.

"The Taiwan-focused drills carried clear political intent: to push back in the international arena against democratic partners' support for Taiwan," the National Security Bureau said in a report to Parliament. A copy of the report was reviewed by Reuters.

The drills, China's most extensive war games to date by coverage area, were also meant to "redirect public anger over economic setbacks and social disorder at home into nationalist sentiment framed as 'resisting external interference,'" the report said.

The report said China has been ramping up a "hybrid" campaign to pressure Taiwan militarily and economically, drawing resistance from democratic partners in the U.S. and Europe.

The report also pointed to a comment from Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi late last year. She said a Chinese attack on democratically governed Taiwan could be deemed an existential threat to Japan. The report said the comment underscored how security in the Taiwan Strait was viewed as directly linked to stability in the Indo-Pacific and international order.

China's Taiwan Affairs Office did not respond to a request for comment on the report.

Speaking at a regular press conference on Wednesday, the office said recent military drills around Taiwan, including those held last week, were intended to "staunchly defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity."

The exercises were also aimed at "upholding the shared interests of compatriots on both sides of the strait and the fundamental interests of the Chinese nation," it said.

Beijing claims Taiwan as its own territory and has not ruled out the use of force to bring the island under its control. Taipei strongly objects to China's sovereignty claims and says only Taiwan's people can decide their future.

The report said that during the drills, China used state media, artificial intelligence-generated content and online "troll armies" to amplify its narratives, cast doubt on the Taiwanese military's capabilities and undermine trust in President Lai Ching-te and the U.S.

Some 19,000 "controversial messages" were pushed out across several social media platforms by 799 accounts in the span of five days, the report said.

On the first and second day of the drills, Taiwan's government received more than two million cyberattacks, the report said. It named the People's Liberation Army‑linked hacking groups APT24 and BlackTech as being among the most active participants.

China's armed forces have been synchronising hacking campaigns with military drills around Taiwan to "disrupt the island's cybersecurity environment and unsettle public morale," the report said.

China has routinely denied being involved in hacking attacks.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 04:41:19 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BRTD6MDNLVI5VFIPHLBMPXWU2I.jpg?auth=9f9e8adca0e29457de1c2ec487f4c26731b66ba5c30ee3516cc85b4629247074&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China's top diplomat heads to key strategic points in Africa</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-top-diplomat-heads-key-strategic-points-africa-2026-01-07/</link><description>BEIJING, Jan 7 (Reuters) - China's top diplomat began his annual New Year tour of Africa on Wednesday, with a focus on the strategically important east, as the world's No.2 economy seeks to reinforce its influence on the continent.

Foreign Minister Wang Yi will travel to Ethiopia, Somalia, Tanzania and Lesotho on this year's trip.

Wang's visit to Somalia - the first by a Chinese foreign minister since the 1980s - is likely to provide Mogadishu with a diplomatic boost after Israel last month became the first country to formally recognise the breakaway Republic of Somaliland , a northern region that declared itself independent in 1991.

Beijing, which reiterated its support for Somalia after the Israeli announcement, is keen to buttress its influence around the Gulf of Aden, the entry to the Red Sea and a crucial corridor for Chinese trade heading through the Suez Canal to European markets.

Further south, Tanzania is central to Beijing's push to secure access to Africa's vast copper deposits. Chinese firms are refurbishing the Tazara Railway that runs through the country into Zambia. Li Qiang made a landmark trip to Zambia in November, the first visit by a Chinese premier in 28 years.

The railway is widely seen as a counterweight to the U.S. and European Union-backed Lobito Corridor, which connects Zambia to Atlantic ports via Angola and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

By visiting the southern African kingdom of Lesotho, Wang aims to highlight Beijing's push to position itself as a champion of free trade. Last year, China offered tariff-free market access to its $19 trillion economy for the world's poorest nations, fulfilling a pledge by Chinese President Xi Jinping at the 2024 China-Africa Cooperation summit in Beijing.

Lesotho, one of the world's poorest nations with a gross domestic product of just over $2 billion, was among the countries hardest hit by U.S. President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs last year, facing duties of up to 50% on its exports to the United States.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 04:41:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/UVWYBCCHN5POZG7A7ITFVPFJC4.jpg?auth=501708b890a4731f88739f846a3a51cf6a57839364163c905a44a03fa37132b8&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Live: Trump announces plan to refine, sell up to 50 million barrels of Venezuelan oil</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260107-live-trump-announces-plan-to-refine-sell-up-to-50-million-barrels-of-venezuelan-oil</link><description>The names, ranks and ages of the 32 Cuban military personnel killed during the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro by US forces were published Tuesday by the Cuban government, which announced two days of mourning.

Among the deceased are colonels, lieutenants, majors and captains, as well as some reserve soldiers, ranging in age from 26 to 60.

The uniformed personnel belonged to the Revolutionary Armed Forces and the Ministry of the Interior, Cuba's two main security agencies. The publication did not specify their missions or exactly how they died.

Venezuela 's interim leader Delcy Rodriguez insisted Tuesday no foreign power was governing her country, even as US President Donald Trump announced Caracas will be swiftly turning over millions of barrels of oil to the United States.

Speaking three days after US special forces snatched Maduro and his wife in a stunning raid in Caracas, Rodriguez said: "The government of Venezuela is in charge in our country, and no-one else."

"There is no foreign agent governing Venezuela ."

Oil extended losses Wednesday after Donald Trump said Venezuela would turn over millions of barrels to the United States, while equities wobbled after a record-breaking start to the year.

Crude has seen wild swings since the US president ordered the toppling Saturday of Nicolas Maduro, his counterpart in Caracas, and said Washington would run the country while demanding "total access" to its key resource.

But it sank as much as two percent Tuesday and around one percent Wednesday after Trump announced the latest development.

President Donald Trump on Tuesday unveiled a plan to refine and sell up to 50 million barrels of Venezuelan oil that had been stuck ⁠in Venezuela under US blockade, in a further sign that Washington is coordinating with the Venezuelan government since capturing President Nicolas Maduro.

Trump on social media announced that Venezuela would sell 30 million to 50 million barrels of sanctioned oil that would be shipped directly to the United States under a plan to be executed immediately by Energy Secretary Chris Wright.

"This Oil will be sold at its Market Price, and that money will be controlled by me, as President of the United States of America, to ensure it is used to benefit the people of Venezuela and the United States!" Trump said. Based on recent prices for Venezuelan oil, the deal could be worth up to $1.9 billion.

US officials have yet to outline a legal framework for seizing Venezuelan oil, though the US ‍has accused Venezuelan tankers of breaking US sanctions to ship Iranian and Venezuelan oil.

Entangled in a decades-long shadow war with Israel, Iran has executed many people it has accused of having links with Israel's intelligence service and facilitating its operations in the country.

"The death sentence of Ali Ardestani for the crime of espionage in favour of the Mossad intelligence service by providing the country's sensitive information was carried out after approval by the Supreme Court and through legal procedures," Mizan said.

Executions of Iranians convicted of spying for Israel have significantly increased this year, following a direct confrontation between the two regional enemies in June, when Israeli and U.S. forces struck Iran's nuclear facilities.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 05:26:19 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>South Korea's Lee says he asked Xi to play a mediating role on North Korea</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/south-koreas-lee-says-he-asked-xi-play-mediating-role-north-korea-2026-01-07/</link><description>SEOUL, Jan 7 (Reuters) - South Korean President Lee Jae Myung said on Wednesday that much progress had been made in restoring trust with Beijing, and that he had asked Chinese President Xi Jinping to play a role in mediating Seoul's efforts to engage North Korea.

Lee, who held talks with Xi this week, said the Chinese leader had noted patience was needed when they discussed nuclear-armed North Korea. Lee was speaking to South Korean media in Shanghai with his remarks relayed live on television.

The South Korean president said he laid out the efforts - so far without success - that Seoul had been making to engage North Korea in dialogue and improve relations, and asked Xi to play a role to mediate for peace on the Korean peninsula.

"President Xi acknowledged our efforts so far and said patience is needed," Lee said.

Lee has been on a state visit to China and his meeting with Xi was their second in less than three months.

Lee has sought to open a "new phase" in ties with China, after several frosty years and with South Korea's popular cultural exports being shut out of the Chinese market due to a dispute over a U.S. missile defence system deployment in South Korea in 2017.

"President Xi said 'talk is easy, but action is not so easy,'" Lee said, as he talked about how building trust and respect between countries takes work.

Diplomatic relations are inherently complex in balancing each other's key national interests, Lee said he had told Xi, adding he hoped recent tension between Tokyo and Beijing could be resolved.

Lee said South Korea considered its ties with Japan as important as its relations with China.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 05:50:27 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/L6SOYRLHJBN77N2G6CZ6OIAHIE.jpg?auth=795a8a20b2788bac9ee45ff15d22f4158bb8b66c24e1b94f584a66e60e85cef2&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Yemen's separatist leader al-Zubaidi flees ahead of talks, Saudi-led coalition says</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260107-yemen-separatist-leader-al-zubaidi-flees-ahead-talks-saudi-led-coalition</link><description>Saudi Arabia on Wednesday said the leader of a separatist movement in Yemen “fled” to an unknown location after saying he would travel to the kingdom for negotiations over the future of southern Yemen .

A statement from Maj. Gen, Turki al-Malki, a spokesperson for a Saudi-led coalition in Yemen, represents the latest twist in tensions between it and the Southern Transitional Council, backed by the United Arab Emirates .

Al-Malik said the council's leader, Aidarous al-Zubaidi, had been due to take a flight to Saudi Arabia. But while other council officials took the flight, he said al-Zubaidi did not.

“The legitimate government and the coalition received intelligence indicating that al-Zubaidi had moved a large force – including armored vehicles, combat vehicles, heavy and light weapons, and ammunition,” al-Malki said. Al-Zubaidi “fled to an unknown location".

There was no immediate comment from the council, known by the acronym STC.

Saudi Arabia in recent weeks has bombed STC positions and struck what is said was a shipment of Emirati weapons. After Saudi pressure and an ultimatum from anti-Houthi forces to withdraw from Yemen, the UAE said Saturday it had withdrawn its forces .

The tensions in Yemen have further strained ties between Saudi Arabia and the UAE, neighbors on the Arabian Peninsula that have competed over economic issues and regional politics, particularly in the Red Sea area.

Ostensibly, Saudi Arabia and the UAE have shared the coalition’s professed goal of fighting against the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels, who have held Yemen's capital, Sanaa, since 2014.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 06:35:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/4398ede4-eb8c-11f0-9869-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/000-34FP9U6.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Europe braces for further travel chaos as deadly cold snap brings more snow</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260107-europe-braces-for-further-travel-chaos-as-deadly-cold-snap-brings-more-snow</link><description>More flights will be cancelled, trains will run late and roads will be blocked by snow across Europe in coming days as a cold snap is forecast to worsen , bringing even more heavy snowfall after several days of travel disruption .

Authorities in the Netherlands told people to plan to stay at home if at all possible on Wednesday, with a fresh blizzard expected overnight.

French Transportation Minister Philippe Tabarot said on Tuesday that airlines had already been ordered to cancel at least 40% of flights at Paris 's main Charles de Gaulle airport, and a quarter of flights at smaller Orly.

Public transportation in the Paris region will also be disrupted by the snow, he warned.

As snowfalls are expected again, Dutch airline KLM said it had protectively cancelled 600 flights on Wednesday to avoid last-minute cancellations that could leave travellers stranded at Schiphol airport, one of Europe's main hubs.

KLM had already cancelled 400 flights at Schiphol on Tuesday and told travellers whose flights had been called off to stay away from the airport to prevent overcrowding.

"We haven't experienced such extreme weather conditions in years," spokesperson Anoesjka Aspeslagh said.

Stranded at Schiphol, Simiao Sun said she feared she would spend her 40th birthday in transit. She had been told she would have to wait three days for a rescheduled flight to Britain where she lives.

"My child would miss school and we would both miss work, so I'm queuing here ... hoping to get a slightly earlier flight."

KLM said it was offering alternative flights where possible and doing everything to help travellers, but was "overwhelmed with inquiries".

On top of that, all domestic rail services in the Netherlands were suspended early on Tuesday after an IT outage hit the rail network.

Trains began running in parts of the country after 0900 GMT, but problems persisted around Amsterdam, with high-speed Eurostar services from Amsterdam to Paris either cancelled or late.

Roads in France were gradually clearing on Tuesday after snow caused severe accidents all over the country, killing at least five people, according to BFMTV news station.

Traffic in the Paris area hit a record 1,000 kilometres of jams on Monday evening.

In Germany, temperatures fell well below minus 10 degrees Celsius (14 degrees Fahrenheit) in the south and east early on Tuesday. Much of the country was covered in snow.

In Britain, the Meteorological Office said winter weather hazards could continue throughout the week for most of the country. Temperatures overnight to Tuesday had fallen as low as -12.5 degrees Celsius in Marham, Norfolk, in eastern England, marking the coldest night of the winter so far.

Heavy snow and rain have also caused havoc across the Western Balkans, closing roads, cutting power and causing rivers to flood. A woman died in the Bosnian capital Sarajevo on Monday after a tree overburdened with wet snow fell on her.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 07:27:07 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/b7e9a240-eb93-11f0-a08b-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26006382410239.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Pakistan eyes defence pact with Bangladesh, sale of JF-17 jets</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/pakistan-eyes-defence-pact-with-bangladesh-sale-jf-17-jets-2026-01-07/</link><description>ISLAMABAD, Jan 7 (Reuters) - The air force chiefs of Pakistan and Bangladesh held talks on a potential pact covering the sale of JF-17 Thunder fighter jets to Dhaka, Pakistan's military said, as Islamabad widens its arms supply ambitions and beefs up ties with Bangladesh.

The talks in Islamabad come as Pakistan looks to capitalise on the success of its air force in the conflict with arch-foe India in May last year, the worst fighting in nearly three decades between the nuclear-armed neighbours.

Pakistan's Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu and Bangladesh counterpart Hasan Mahmood Khan had detailed talks on procurement of the JF-17 Thunder, a multi-role combat aircraft jointly developed with China, the military's press wing said.

Pakistan has also assured Bangladesh of the "fast-tracked delivery of Super Mushshak trainer aircraft, along with a complete training and long-term support ecosystem," it added in Tuesday's statement.

The talks signal improving ties as the South Asian nations have grown closer since massive protests in August 2024 drove then-Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to flee to India, shattering Dhaka's relationship with New Delhi.

"The visit underscored the strong historical ties between Pakistan and Bangladesh and reflected a shared resolve to deepen defence cooperation and build a long-term strategic partnership," the military said.

In the wake of Hasina's ouster, Islamabad and Dhaka have resumed direct trade for the first time since the 1971 war that brought independence for Bangladesh, while their military officials have held several meetings.

Under an interim administration led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, Bangladesh is set for general elections on February 12 that could lead to a significant government role for a once-banned Bangladeshi Islamist party with links to Pakistan.

The JF-17s have become the cornerstone of the Pakistani military's weapons development program, figuring in a deal with Azerbaijan and a $4-billion weapons pact with the Libyan National Army .

On Tuesday, Pakistan's defence minister said the success of its weapons industry could transform the country's economic outlook.

"Our aircraft have been tested, and we are receiving so many orders that Pakistan may not need the International Monetary Fund in six months," Khawaja Asif told broadcaster Geo News.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 07:49:07 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/2EVF6DDCVZMDFFRPFXX67V7EMM.jpg?auth=46051937a6db77d02eedb4d6dd985a0c353ef66cc02ed8bcfdae094df99b3eb7&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Intense heatwave grips Australia's southern states, fans bushfires</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/intense-heatwave-grips-australias-southern-states-fans-bushfires-2026-01-07/</link><description>SYDNEY, Jan 7 (Reuters) - Australia’s south sweltered through a brutal heatwave on Wednesday that delivered temperatures above 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) in some cities, triggering health warnings, straining power grids and causing bushfires to flare.

Meteorologists said the conditions were at their worst in six years, when catastrophic bushfires destroyed wide swathes of southeastern Australia, killing 33 people, in what became known as the Black Summer.

The nation's weather bureau issued severe or extreme heat warnings for the states of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania. It also warned of extreme fire danger across Victoria and South Australia.

"These elevated fire dangers are being driven by a very hot air mass that extends all the way from Western Australia with maximum temperatures in excess of 45 degrees," said Senior Meteorologist Sarah Scully.

In Victoria, where temperatures reached up to 44 C, and 41 C in the state capital Melbourne, authorities advised residents to stay indoors and keep hydrated.

Victoria's Emergency Management Commissioner Tim Wiebusch said firefighters were battling several fires across the state and conditions would worsen on Friday.

"We already have a statewide advice warning message out for severe to extreme intensity heatwave, and are now seeing those conditions kick in across the state," he said.

"We are particularly wanting Victorians to make sure they are alert to their conditions, make sure you are staying in cool places."

Temperatures also soared to 31 C in Sydney, 32 C in Perth and 43 C in Adelaide.

Some public spaces like libraries extended their opening hours to help residents stay cool, while others like the Monarto Safari Park were forced to shut for the day. More than 2,000 homes lost power in Adelaide.

"I think psychologically you have to keep calm in the heat and not panic. It’s only two or three days. And then it goes down again," Adelaide resident Valdine Tuckwell told national broadcaster ABC.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 08:32:02 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>France: working with allies on plan should US make move on Greenland</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/france-working-with-allies-plan-should-us-make-move-greenland-2026-01-07/</link><description>PARIS, Jan 7 (Reuters) - France is working with partners on a plan over how to respond should the United States act on its threat to take over Greenland, Foreign Affairs Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said on Wednesday.

Italy and France last month dashed hopes for a December deal , saying they were not ready to support it until farmers' fears of an influx of cheap commodities from Mercosur , including beef and sugar, were resolved.

However, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni welcomed a letter sent by the Commission on Tuesday proposing to accelerate 45 billion euros of support for farmers, describing it as a "positive and significant step forward".

Italian Agriculture Minister Francesco Lollobrigida said the European Union was now proposing to increase spending on Italian agriculture in 2028-2034 rather than to cut it.

An EU source subsequently said Italy would now vote in favour of the Mercosur trade deal at a meeting on Friday.

The executive Commission, backed by countries such as Germany and Spain, is seeking to garner the broad majority of 15 EU members representing 65% of the EU population required to authorise the EU signature, possibly as early as January 12.

They say the accord, which has been 25 years in the making and would be the EU's largest in terms of tariff reductions, is vital to boosting exports hit by US import taxes and to reduce reliance on China by securing access to critical minerals.

With Poland and Hungary opposed to the deal and France still critical, Italy's stance is a key determinant of whether the deal can be signed.

The Commission has held discussions with member states over the past two weeks and the bloc is on track to sign the agreement soon, a spokesperson for the executive said.

The EU executive has invited all 27 EU agriculture ministers to a meeting in Brussels on Wednesday.

European commissioners for agriculture, trade and health are expected to give reassurances on future funding for farmers under the bloc's Common Agricultural Policy , including a 6.3 billion euro ($7.4 billion) crisis fund in the next EU budget.

The Commission's move to merge regional cohesion funds and CAP money in the next seven-year budget has alarmed farming nations.

The Commission will also review import controls, including permissible maximum levels of pesticide residues, two EU diplomats said.

"It is a critical moment to discuss demands from farmers," one of the diplomats said.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 08:32:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/20ed695a-eb9b-11f0-bcf3-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25352512604845-1.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Following US military operation in Venezuela, will 190 countries 'respect any of these rules now'?</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/following-us-military-operation-in-venezuela-will-190-countries-respect-any-of-these-rules-now</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 08:32:31 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/7e202682-eb85-11f0-9411-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260105-130110-130848-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>France working with allies on plan should US move on Greenland</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/france-working-with-allies-plan-should-us-move-greenland-2026-01-07/</link><description>PARIS, Jan 7 (Reuters) - France is working with partners on a plan over how to respond should the United States act on its threat to take over Greenland , a minister said on Wednesday, as Europe sought to address U.S. President Donald Trump's ambitions in the region.

A U.S. military seizure of Greenland from a longtime ally, Denmark, would send shock waves through the NATO alliance and deepen the divide between Trump and European leaders.

Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said the subject would be raised at a meeting with the foreign ministers of Germany and Poland later in the day.

"We want to take action, but we want to do so together with our European partners," he said on France Inter radio.

Leaders from major European powers and Canada have rallied behind Greenland this week, saying the Arctic island belongs to its people, following a renewed threat by Trump to take over the territory.

Trump has in recent days repeated that he wants to gain control of Greenland, an idea first voiced in 2019 during his first presidency. He has argued it is key for the U.S. military and that Denmark has not done enough to protect it.

The White House said on Tuesday that Trump was discussing options for acquiring Greenland, including potential use of the U.S. military, in a revival of his ambition to control the strategic island, despite European objections.

Barrot suggested a U.S. military operation had been ruled out by a top U.S. official.

"I myself was on the phone yesterday with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio (...) who confirmed that this was not the approach taken ... he ruled out the possibility of an invasion (of Greenland)," he said.

A U.S. military operation over the weekend that seized the leader of Venezuela had already rekindled concerns that Greenland might face a similar scenario. It has repeatedly said it does not want to be part of the United States.

The world's largest island but with a population of just 57,000 people, Greenland is not an independent member of NATO but is covered by Denmark's membership of the Western alliance.

The island is strategically located between Europe and North America, making it a critical site for the U.S. ballistic missile defence system for decades. Its mineral wealth also aligns with Washington's ambition to reduce reliance on China.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 09:28:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/X6L53PGKUFJKLJJ6W4SUG5UXHM.jpg?auth=1c1461893a2157d0dbec37a4e3e59a11b7b2b9aefaab4b599e5cbbcbd28c46dc&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Re-elected president of Central African Republic invites Russia's Putin to visit, TASS says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/re-elected-president-central-african-republic-invites-russias-putin-visit-tass-2026-01-07/</link><description>MOSCOW, Jan 7 (Reuters) - The newly re-elected president of the Central African Republic, Faustin-Archange Touadera, has invited Russian President Vladimir Putin to visit his country, Russian state news agency TASS reported on Wednesday.

Moscow has become a key ally of Touadera in recent years, with CAR in 2018 becoming the first West and Central African nation to bring in Russia's Wagner mercenaries as the chronically unstable nation sought to fend off several rebel groups.

Touadera, in power since 2016, won a third term in office, provisional results showed this week, securing an outright majority in the presidential election held on December 28.

In a video interview with TASS, Touadera called Putin a "great leader" and said the Kremlin chief was "very attentive" to relations with Bangui.

Commenting on preliminary election results showing Touadera in the lead, the Wagner Group wrote on its Telegram channel: "We have no doubt that the chosen course of maintaining order and peace will prevail."

Touadera's victory is likely to further Russia's interests in the country, including in gold and diamond mining.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 09:28:58 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/RDEGJAP6RZPQDPYDKQTSQ3LQLI.jpg?auth=2a81803ebbe4c111a915bf42ce1a8f114040f6eaa72ed9611a1d505c1ae4d10a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Cyprus assumes EU presidency with Ukraine's Zelenskiy attending</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/cyprus-assumes-eu-presidency-with-ukraines-zelenskiy-attending-2026-01-07/</link><description>NICOSIA, Jan 7 - Cyprus assumed the rotating presidency of the European Union on Wednesday, marking the start of its six-month term with a meeting in Nicosia attended by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Antonio Costa.

It is the second time the east Mediterranean island has held the EU presidency mantle. A ceremony in Nicosia later Wednesday would include representatives of countries from the Middle East, including Lebanese President Joseph Aoun, underscoring Cyprus's aspiration of being a bridge between Europe and the region.

Noting "constantly numerous" challenges, Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides said: "As the Cyprus Presidency we will respond to this institutional obligation to the European Union, with a single goal: To strengthen, because this is the need shown by international developments, the autonomy of the European Union, to push European integration even further."

Christodoulides was due to meet Zelenskiy in private on Wednesday, and later hold expanded talks with Zelenskiy, Von der Leyen and Costa. Zelenskiy's presence was seen as a political sign of the continued EU backing for Kyiv as its war with Russia enters a fourth year.

The disruption had been predicted late Tuesday, with Transport Minister Philippe Tabarot telling CNews television he was "hoping the situation returns to normal this afternoon".

All public bus services in Paris and the surrounding suburbs were also suspended due to icy roads, though the vast majority of metro and suburban rail systems were working, transport officials said.

The Météo France weather service said 38 of the country's 96 mainland departments were on alert for heavy snow and black ice, with three to seven centimetres (around one to three inches) of snow already accumulated.

It said the cold snap was of "rare intensity for the season", and authorities had already warned people in the Paris region to avoid unnecessary travel and work at home if possible on Wednesday.

"The Islamic Republic of Iran considers the escalation of hostile rhetoric against the Iranian nation a threat and will not tolerate its continuation without responding," General Amir Hatami said, according to the Fars news agency.

Hatami, commander of the Iranian army but not Iran's most senior officer, warned that "if the enemy makes a mistake" Iran's response would be more robust than during last June's 12-day war with Israel.

In recent days, US President Donald Trump has threatened to intervene in Iran if demonstrators were killed, while Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu has expressed support for the protests.

On December 28 merchants in Tehran staged a protest against soaring prices and the collapse of the rial, triggering a wave of similar actions in several cities, some of them deadly.

The demonstrations have yet to reach the scale of a 2022 to 2023 movement, let alone that of the mass 2009 street protests that followed disputed elections.

But the economic protests have attracted international attention, including from the leaders of the Islamic republic's international foes.

"We're watching it very closely. If they start killing people like they have in the past, I think they're going to get hit very hard by the United States," Trump told reporters on Sunday.

Netanyahu, meanwhile, told Israel's cabinet: "We stand in solidarity with the struggle of the Iranian people and with their aspirations for freedom, liberty and justice."

On Monday, the Iranian foreign ministry accused Trump and Netanyahu of inciting violence and trying to undermine Iran's national unity.

The war in June began with an unprecedented Israeli attack on Iranian military and nuclear facilities.

The United States briefly took part in the strikes, hitting three major Iranian nuclear sites.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 09:52:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/a51911a8-eba4-11f0-b7b9-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26004478007275.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Fire put out at oil depot in Russia's Belgorod after Ukrainian drone attack, state TV says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/fire-put-out-oil-depot-russias-belgorod-after-ukrainian-drone-attack-state-tv-2026-01-07/</link><description>MOSCOW, Jan 7 (Reuters) - Firefighters have put out a blaze that broke out at an oil depot in Russia's southern Belgorod region following an overnight Ukrainian drone attack, the Vesti state TV channel reported on Wednesday, citing the regional governor.

The raid follows waves of large-scale detentions of unregistered Christians in recent months, as Beijing steps up scrutiny of churches that operate outside the control of the ruling Communist Party.

Beijing has long required religious groups to be registered. Under President Xi Jinping, the government has tightened control of all religions and in recent years increased crackdowns and regulations targeting unregistered organisations, making it even harder for them to raise funds, preach online and hold in-person meetings.

The detentions of the members of the Early Rain Covenant Church, a large unofficial "house church" based in the southwestern city of Chengdu, took place on Tuesday, according to the church statement and a separate statement on the detentions from advocacy group Human Rights Watch.

Those detained included current church leader Li Yingqiang, whose home was raided by police, according to the church and NGO statements.

Reuters could not determine on what grounds the Early Rain Covenant Church members were detained or whether they had been charged. Efforts to contact the church through social media were unsuccessful.

Chengdu public security bureau did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

"The government should immediately free those detained and let them freely practice their religion," said Yalkun Uluyol, Human Rights Watch China researcher.

China has more than 44 million Christians registered with state-approved churches, the majority Protestant, data shows. But tens of millions more are estimated to be part of illegal "house churches" whose congregations meet in secret.

More than 100 Christians belonging to such churches were detained in a sweeping police raid near the eastern city of Wenzhou in December, according to Human Rights in China, a New York-based NGO.

Nearly 30 pastors and staff of Zion Church, another major underground church, were detained by police in a nationwide operation in October, the biggest such crackdown since 2018.

Established in 2008, the Early Rain Covenant Church was raided by police in 2018, when founder Wang Yi and more than 100 pastors were detained. Wang was later sentenced to nine years in prison on subversion charges. NGOs estimate Early Rain has more than 500 members, making it one of China's larger "house churches".</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 10:27:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China detains six underground church members in latest crackdown, church tells members</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-detains-six-underground-church-members-latest-crackdown-church-tells-2026-01-07/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 10:27:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>US-Venezuela oil deal angers China, pushes prices down</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/us-venezuela-oil-deal-angers-china-pushes-prices-down-2026-01-07/</link><description>HOUSTON/BEIJING, Jan 7 (Reuters) - Global oil prices fell on Wednesday and China denounced the U.S. as a bully after President Donald Trump's administration said it had persuaded Venezuela to divert supplies from Beijing and import up to $2 billion worth of embargoed crude.

The deal was in line with Trump's stated aim of controlling the South American OPEC member's vast oil reserves after deposing its leader Nicolas Maduro whom it had long cast as a drug-trafficking dictator in league with Washington's foes.

Maduro's Socialist Party allies remain in power in Venezuela, where interim President Delcy Rodriguez is treading a fine line between denouncing his "kidnapping" and kick-starting cooperation with the U.S. under explicit threats from Trump.

TRUMP: OIL MONEY 'WILL BE CONTROLLED BY ME'

He said the U.S. would refine and sell up to 50 million barrels of crude stuck in Venezuela under a U.S. blockade as a first step in his plan to revive a sector long in decline despite sitting on the largest reserves in the world.

"This Oil will be sold at its Market Price, and that money will be controlled by me, as President of the United States of America, to ensure it is used to benefit the people of Venezuela and the United States!" Trump posted on Tuesday.

Venezuela has not confirmed the deal.

Crude prices fell around 1.0% on world markets due to anticipated increased supplies.

The deal could initially require cargoes bound for Venezuela's top buyer China to be rerouted as Caracas seeks to unload millions of barrels stranded in tankers and storage.

"The United States' brazen use of force against Venezuela and its demand for 'America First' when Venezuela disposes of its own oil resources are typical acts of bullying," Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning told a press conference.

"These actions seriously violate international law, gravely infringe upon Venezuela's sovereignty, and severely damage the rights of the Venezuelan people."

China, Russia and leftist allies of Venezuela have all denounced the U.S. raid to capture Maduro at the weekend, which was Washington's biggest such intervention in Latin America since the 1989 invasion of Panama to topple Manuel Noriega.

Washington's allies are also deeply uneasy at the extraordinary precedent of seizing a foreign head-of-state , with Trump making a slew of threats of more action - from Mexico to Greenland - to further U.S. interests.

Some details are still sketchy on just how U.S. Special Forces swooped into Caracas by helicopter under darkness on Saturday, smashing Maduro's security cordon and seizing him at the door of a safe room, with no loss of U.S. lives.

Venezuela has not confirmed its total losses, though the army posted a list of 23 of its dead and ally Cuba said 32 members of its military and intelligence services died. The U.S. estimates about 75 fatalities, the Washington Post reported.

Maduro, 63, who had ruled Venezuela since the 2013 death of his predecessor and mentor Hugo Chavez, pleaded not guilty on Monday to narcotics charges in a Manhattan court where he was shackled at the ankles and wore orange and beige prison garb .

Trump appears to be calculating that it is better for stability in Venezuela to work with Maduro's senior allies for now. He is stressing revival of the oil sector with the help of U.S. firms as the priority, not the freeing of political prisoners or a new vote for a democratic transition.

Venezuela's main anti-Maduro figure Maria Corina Machado , who left in disguise to pick up the Nobel Peace Prize in October, wants to return home where she says the opposition would easily win a free vote.

But she is also taking care not to antagonise Trump, saying she would like to personally give him the Nobel prize which he had coveted and which she dedicated to him at the time. She says she is fully on board with his aspirations to make Venezuela a major ally of the U.S. and the energy hub of the Americas.

Banned from running in a 2024 election, Machado's ally Edmundo Gonzalez won overwhelmingly, according to the opposition, the U.S. and various election observers.

While working with Rodriguez and other top Venezuelan officials, the U.S. has warned they must cooperate or risk sharing Maduro's fate.

Hardline Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello , who controls security forces accused of widespread rights abuses, is under particular scrutiny, sources told Reuters.

The U.S. is also closely watching Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino, who like Cabello is under a U.S. drug trafficking indictment and has a multi-million-dollar bounty on his head.

Rodriguez herself is under U.S. sanctions, with her foreign financial assets identified as potential leverage, one source briefed on U.S. administration thinking said.

The U.S. is also pressuring the interim Venezuelan government to expel official advisers from China, Russia, Cuba and Iran, the New York Times reported.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 10:50:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/XGK6ZLCLLRNHPHJFQZXM744NVM.jpg?auth=3925306fc5240333df6d5bc330749f0831891dd8b0a4853813c9a062d514d0d2&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Zelenskiy's chief of staff hails 'concrete results' on second day of Paris talks</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/zelenskiys-chief-staff-hails-concrete-results-second-day-paris-talks-2026-01-07/</link><description>KYIV, Jan 7 (Reuters) - President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's top adviser hailed "concrete results" on Wednesday as talks in Paris on peace and security guarantees for Ukraine entered their second day, vowing Kyiv's national interests would be protected.

Ukraine is seeking strong backing from allies in the event of a ceasefire with Russia while also pushing back on a Kremlin demand that it give up its eastern Donbas region in exchange for peace.

"Not all information can be public, but there are already concrete results, (and) our work continues," Kyrylo Budanov, who was appointed head of Zelenskiy's office last week, said on the Telegram app.

"Ukrainian national interests will be defended."

Budanov's statement follows comments by Zelenskiy late on Tuesday that U.S. and Ukrainian officials had discussed "some ideas" to address the issue of territory, which he said remains the biggest obstacle in the peace process.

Kyiv has refused to pull out of the industrialised Donbas and said the U.S. has offered the idea of a free economic zone in parts of the region from which it withdraws.

White House special envoy Steve Witkoff said separately on Tuesday that land options had been discussed during the Paris talks and would continue.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 10:51:04 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/AQO6HUXFAZK7FPWJWX7XT2CGF4.jpg?auth=5ca538c25525dbe61c80245023778ee77729a87f1d56322b7ae6c87daa8875d8&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Malaysia seizes 2.4 million ringgit in cash tied to army procurement graft probe</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/malaysia-seizes-24-million-ringgit-cash-tied-army-procurement-graft-probe-2026-01-07/</link><description>KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 7 (Reuters) - Malaysia's anti-graft agency on Wednesday seized 2.4 million ringgit ($591,716) in cash linked to an investigation into alleged bribery involving army procurement contracts, state media reported, citing the agency's chief commissioner.

The cash was seized when an individual connected to the case was caught trying to transfer it to another location, the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) chief commissioner Azam Baki told Bernama.

Late last year, the agency raided several firms suspected of involvement in the bribery scheme and froze six bank accounts belonging to a suspect and their family members.

Former army chief Muhammad Hafizuddeain Jantan is believed to have recorded a statement at the MACC headquarters on Wednesday in connection with the investigation, Bernama also reported.

Muhammad Hafizuddeain was placed on leave in late December pending an investigation into the matter.

The Chief of Staff of the Malaysian Armed Forces Headquarters Azhan Md Othman, has been appointed as the Chief of the Malaysian Army effective January 1, Bernama reported.

Caracas and Washington agreed to export up to $2 billion worth of Venezuelan crude to the United States, President Donald Trump said on Tuesday, after U.S. forces captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro over the weekend.

That arrangement is likely to curtail Venezuelan supply to China, analysts say, reducing a source of cheap oil for independent refiners known as teapots. The world's biggest crude importer is a major buyer of discounted sanctioned oil from Russia, Iran and Venezuela.

"The Venezuela drama hits China's independent refineries the hardest, as they may lose access to the discounted heavy barrels," said Sparta Commodities analyst June Goh.

"However as there are ample Russian and Iranian feedstocks available and Venezuelan barrels on water, we do not foresee the teapots needing to bid up for unsanctioned barrels as the economics would likely not make sense for them," she said.

China imported 389,000 barrels per day of Venezuelan oil in 2025, about 4% of its total seaborne crude imports, Kpler data showed.

At least a dozen sanctioned vessels that loaded in December departed Venezuelan waters in early January carrying some 12 million barrels of crude and fuel, Reuters has reported. However, loadings for Asia at Venezuela's main ports have stopped since January 1, shipping data showed.

With supply tightening, sellers of Venezuelan Merey crude for prompt delivery offered cargoes at discounts of about $10 per barrel to ICE Brent versus $15 last month, said one trader, although trade has come to a standstill.

Another trader said offers were at minus $11 per barrel.

Venezuelan crude aboard ships in Asia remains sufficient to cover roughly 75 days of Chinese demand, limiting any immediate upside for alternatives, said Kpler senior analyst Xu Muyu.

Teapots using Venezuelan oil are likely to switch to Russian and Iranian supply in March and April, and China can also tap non-sanctioned sources such as Canada, Brazil, Iraq, and Colombia, she said.

Buyers have yet to start sourcing alternatives, trade sources said, with Iranian Heavy crude priced at a discount of about $10 per barrel to ICE Brent in ample supply, the cheapest alternative.

Teapots may also consider Middle Eastern grades such as Iraqi Basrah, a Singapore-based trader said.

Meanwhile, discounts for Canadian crude such as Cold Lake and Access Western Blend exported from the Trans Mountain pipeline have widened more than $2 this week to $4-$5 a barrel to ICE Brent for April delivery to China on expectations of lower U.S. demand, traders said.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 11:21:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LCAFV7CLDNOWPKRKZ4VJCQHT3Q.jpg?auth=f4bdae23743b8255c01dba7370f6e1161f0a8aac3bc0afca19d4e1c32347fd42&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran's rial reaches new low amid protests and economic crisis</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/iran-s-rial-reaches-new-low-amid-protests-and-economic-crisis</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 11:21:49 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/ea8796d2-ebb9-11f0-a257-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/capture-1401328451695e3fe1c87a37-85447388.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Death toll rises as Iran's security forces clash with protesters</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/death-toll-rises-as-iran-s-security-forces-clash-with-protesters</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 11:21:52 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/64616a3c-ebba-11f0-ac7b-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/capture-1537197220695e40ae948674-46773869.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israel-backed militia kill two Hamas operatives in Gaza, militia says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-backed-militia-kill-two-hamas-operatives-gaza-militia-says-2026-01-07/</link><description>CAIRO, Jan 7 (Reuters) - An Israeli-backed Palestinian militia said on Wednesday it had killed two Hamas operatives in southern Gaza, marking a renewed challenge to Hamas after Israel empowered its rivals in areas under Israeli military control.

The armed group, known as the Popular Forces, said in a statement it had carried out a raid in Rafah, killing two Hamas members who refused to surrender and detaining a third. It shared a photo that it said depicted one of the slain men.

Hamas, which brands such groups as "collaborators", declined to comment on the claim, which Reuters couldn't independently authenticate. Rafah sits in territory under Israeli control under the terms of an October Israel-Hamas deal .

The Popular Forces, founded by an anti-Hamas armed Bedouin leader, Yasser Abu Shabab, is believed to be the largest group operating in Israel-controlled areas.

Abu Shabab was killed in December in what the group described as a family feud. He was replaced by his deputy Ghassan Duhine, who vowed no let up in the fight against Hamas. The Popular Forces and others have reported more recruits since the October deal took effect.

The emergence of the groups, though they remain small and localised, has added to pressures on Islamist Hamas and could complicate efforts to stabilise and unify a divided Gaza, shattered by two years of war. The groups remain unpopular among the local population, as they operate under Israeli control.

Nearly all of Gaza's two million people live in Hamas-held areas, where the group has been reestablishing its grip and where four Hamas sources said it continues to command thousands of men despite suffering heavy blows during the war.

But Israel still holds well over half of Gaza - areas where Hamas' foes operate beyond its reach. With President Donald Trump's plan for Gaza moving slowly, there is no immediate prospect of further Israeli withdrawals.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged Israeli backing for anti-Hamas groups in June, saying Israel had "activated" clans. Israel has given little detail since then.

The Popular Forces deny receiving support from Israel.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 11:42:32 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Nigerian court grants bail to ex-justice minister Malami, trial to start in February</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/nigerian-court-grants-bail-ex-justice-minister-malami-trial-start-february-2026-01-07/</link><description>ABUJA, Jan 7 (Reuters) - A Nigerian court on Wednesday granted bail to former attorney-general and minister of justice Abubakar Malami, held for a month on money laundering and abuse of office charges, and adjourned his trial to February 17.

Malami, who served as the country's top law officer under former President Muhammadu Buhari, was arrested by Nigeria's anti-graft agency in December and charged with 16 counts of money laundering .

Prosecutors say Malami siphoned public funds between 2015 and 2023 and laundered the cash through associates - including his son and wife Hajia Asabe Bashir - and property deals.

All three accused have pleaded not guilty to the charges.

Judge Emeka Nwite of the federal high court in the capital Abuja set bail at 500 million naira ($351,835.17), requiring one surety with property in Abuja’s upscale Asokoro, Maitama or Gwarimpa districts.
Title papers must be verified and lodged with the court, and Malami must surrender his travel documents. The same terms apply to his son and Bashir, Nwite ruled.

The seizure, which could stoke tensions with Russia, came after the tanker, originally known as the Bella-1, slipped through a U.S. maritime "blockade" of sanctioned tankers and rebuffed U.S. Coast Guard efforts to board it.

The officials, who were speaking on condition of anonymity, said the operation is being carried out by the Coast Guard and U.S. military.

They added that Russian military vessels were in the general vicinity when the operation took place, including a Russian submarine.

The tanker, now known as the Marinera and registered under a Russian flag, is the latest tanker targeted by the U.S. Coast Guard since the start of U.S. President Donald Trump's pressure campaign against Venezuela.

Separately, the U.S. Coast Guard has also intercepted another Venezuela-linked tanker in Latin American waters, U.S. officials told Reuters, as the U.S. continues enforcing a maritime "blockade" of sanctioned vessels from Venezuela.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 12:46:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/GACZ47AZZBJOHK4KIZIO3VG3WA.jpg?auth=98a59dc7f2e4cc91d693410e7cdde4abb6be207ce873437c2278f851029654cd&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukraine, US to revisit land, nuclear plant issues in talks</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-us-revisit-land-nuclear-plant-issues-wednesday-talks-2026-01-07/</link><description>KYIV, Jan 7 (Reuters) - U.S. and Ukrainian negotiators will revisit the thorny issues of territory and the fate of the occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Wednesday, the most problematic points in peace talks to end Russia's war.

Kyiv is under U.S. pressure to secure peace in the nearly four-year-old conflict but is pushing back on Russian demands to cede its eastern Donetsk region and give up control of Europe's largest nuclear facility .

The delegations are in Paris for a third day of talks among Kyiv's allies on peace and security guarantees for Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire with Russia, which has been cool on the U.S.-backed process.

"We expect, in particular, that the most difficult issues from the basic framework for ending the war will be discussed – namely, issues related to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant and territories," Zelenskiy wrote on X, announcing a third session with the U.S. team in two days.

He added that he had ordered his team to discuss new leader-level talks involving the U.S. and European allies.

Earlier on Wednesday, Zelenskiy's top adviser hailed "concrete results" in the Paris talks and vowed Kyiv's national interests would be protected.

Zelenskiy said on Tuesday after the "coalition of the willing" talks that U.S. and Ukrainian officials had discussed "some ideas" to address the issue of territory.

White House special envoy Steve Witkoff said "land options" had been discussed on Tuesday and that he hoped for compromise to be reached.

Kyiv has refused to pull out of the industrialised Donetsk region, which Russia has taken swathes of but has failed to seize entirely. Zelenskiy has also said the U.S. has floated the idea of a free economic zone there if Ukraine withdraws from the parts of the region that it still controls.

Any compromises on land should be put to a referendum for Ukrainians, Zelenskiy has previously said. According to an opinion poll last month , around three-quarters of Ukrainians are prepared for a deal that would freeze the current front line, but oppose ceding territory.

The U.S. has also proposed trilateral operation of the Zaporizhzhia plant, which Moscow captured in 2022 and connected to its own power grid, with an American chief manager, Zelenskiy said last month.

Kyiv has instead proposed joint Ukrainian-American use of the plant, according to Zelenskiy, with the U.S. itself determining how to use 50% of the energy produced.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 12:47:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/N6STJIM3GBLHRPTG2DJWOXLJRU.jpg?auth=6a3bfebccf1e2807863cddf1926f0e2315d9f04985b18965c75b9d4b6399c53d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran's top judge warns protesters of 'no leniency' as unrest persists</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/irans-top-judge-warns-protesters-no-leniency-unrest-persists-2026-01-07/</link><description>DUBAI, Jan 7 (Reuters) - Iran's top judge warned protesters on Wednesday there would be "no leniency for those who help the enemy against the Islamic Republic", while accusing Israel and the U.S. of pursuing hybrid methods to disrupt the country.

Tehran is under international pressure with U.S. President Donald Trump threatening to come to the aid of protesters if security forces fired on them, seven months after Israeli and U.S. forces bombed Iranian nuclear sites in a 12-day war.

Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has vowed not to "yield to the enemy" .

The current protests, the biggest wave of dissent in three years, began last month in Tehran's Grand Bazaar by shopkeepers condemning the currency's free fall. Unrest has since spread nationwide amid deepening distress over economic hardships, including rocketing inflation driven by mismanagement and Western sanctions, and curbs on political and social freedoms.

"Following announcements by Israel and the U.S. president, there is no excuse for those coming to the streets for riots and unrest, Chief Justice Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei, the head of Iran's judiciary, was quoted as saying by state media.

"From now on, there will be no leniency for whoever helps the enemy against the Islamic Republic and the calm of the people," Ejei said.

At least 27 people have been killed and more than 1,500 arrested in Iran in the first 10 days of protests, with the west of the country seeing the highest number of casualties according to Kurdish-Iranian rights group Hengaw.

HRANA, a network of human rights activists, has reported a higher death toll of at least 36 people as well as the arrest of at least 2,076 people.

Reuters has not been able to independently verify the numbers of casualties or details of disturbances reported by Iranian media and rights groups.

Iranian authorities have not given a death toll for protesters, but have said at least two members of the security services have died and more than a dozen have been injured.

Iran's western provinces - which are economically marginalised and are heavily policed due to past outbreaks of unrest and their strategic location for national defence - have witnessed the most violent protests and repression lately.

Demonstrators took to the streets again overnight in the western province of Ilam and disturbances erupted, Hengaw said.

It has counted at least 20 demonstrators killed since late December in the provinces of Ilam, Lorestan, Kermanshah, Fars, Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari, and Hamadan.

"During the funeral of two people in Malekshahi on Tuesday, a number of attendees began chanting harsh, anti-system slogans," said Fars, a news agency affiliated with Iran's Revolutionary Guards.

After the funeral, Fars said, "about 100 mourners went into the city and trashed three banks ... Some started shooting at the police trying to disperse them".

In Abdanan, a city in southwestern Ilam province, a large crowd gathered late on Tuesday and chanted slogans against Khamenei that could be heard in a video shared on a Telegram channel called Nistemanijoan with over 180,000 followers.

The semi-official news agency Tasnim said a crowd of 300 gathered peacefully in Abdanan to make economic demands and some started shouting "anti-establishment" slogans, after which many demonstrators fled while security forces tackled "rioters".

Another Iranian outlet, Mehr News, said protesters had stormed a food store and emptied bags of rice, which has been affected by galloping inflation that has made ordinary staples increasingly unaffordable for many Iranians.

Social media footage shared by Iranian media outlets showed young men flinging grains of rice into the air, with the crowd cheering them on. Reuters was not able to verify the videos.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 12:47:31 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/YAVMM557GNKPLBI5TM2RNW2JFU.jpg?auth=b3b3b8cb3a0d8acd0862762b1c3853f49e76112cb73bfebb23937e50a7f8d76b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UK's Starmer says deployment of troops to Ukraine would be voted by parliament</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uks-starmer-says-deployment-troops-ukraine-would-be-voted-by-parliament-2026-01-07/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 7 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on Wednesday that any deployment of UK forces under a declaration signed with France and Ukraine would be subject to a parliamentary vote.

Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy signed on Tuesday a declaration of intent outlining the deployment of forces in the event a peace deal is reached.

"I will keep the house updated as the situation develops, and were troops to be deployed under the declaration signed, I would put that matter to the house for a vote," Starmer told parliament.

He said the number of troops would be determined under UK military plans which are currently being drawn.

Starmer also said he had spoken to U.S. President Donald Trump about security guarantees for Ukraine twice over Christmas and assured lawmakers there was "no question of acting on this without full discussion with the Americans".

The British premier's remarks come a day after the United States backed a broad coalition of Ukraine's allies, which includes Britain, in vowing to provide security guarantees to support the country if Russia attacks again.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 12:47:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/3CQ2EJ5MEZN2LOTH2QXPRWUELM.jpg?auth=49abe5d103563bf02ac875a93ac19f19590ceb4a80d41f621e6151e1955d691f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>French doctors striking over 'authoritarian drift' in universal healthcare system</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/french-doctors-striking-over-authoritarian-drift-in-universal-healthcare-system</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 12:49:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/dc1b888e-ebbd-11f0-88e5-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260107-081036-081729-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Kherson lives under anti-drone nets and in fear of Russian attacks</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/kherson-lives-under-anti-drone-nets-and-in-fear-of-russian-attacks</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 12:49:08 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/e1ac8652-ebbf-11f0-adc2-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260107-120513-120806-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US, Ukraine teams meet in Paris to tackle 'most difficult issues' in Russia war talks</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260107-us-ukraine-teams-meet-in-paris-to-tackle-most-difficult-issues-in-russia-war-talks</link><description>Washington and Kyiv teams in Paris were on Wednesday expected to tackle Ukraine talks' "most difficult issues" including territory following a breakthrough in European-led negotiations , Ukraine's leader said.

On Tuesday, European leaders and US envoys announced they had agreed key security guarantees for Kyiv as they sought to present a united front for Ukraine despite raging tensions over Venezuela and President Donald Trump 's designs on Greenland.

US envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner represented Washington in the talks amid efforts to end nearly four years of war in Ukraine sparked by Russia's invasion.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the Kyiv and Washington teams would dedicate the second day of the Paris talks to the fate of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and control of territory in eastern Ukraine.

"Another session of talks with envoys of the president of the United States will take place, and this will already be the third such session in two days," he said on Facebook.

"The most difficult issues from the basic framework for ending the war will be discussed – namely, issues related to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant and territories."

Zelensky also stressed it was important for Kyiv's Western allies to put pressure on Moscow.

"Peace must be dignified. And this depends on the partners – on whether they ensure Russia's real readiness to end the war," he said.

Kyrylo Budanov, Zelensky's new chief of staff and former top spy, on Wednesday said "there are already concrete results" but added that "not all information can be made public".

A European diplomatic source said that representatives of France, Germany, and the United Kingdom were involved in fresh Paris talks on Wednesday, as well as some from Italy and Turkey.

On Tuesday, Ukraine's Western allies agreed key security guarantees for Kyiv including a US-led monitoring mechanism and a European multinational force that would be deployed after a ceasefire in Russia's war against its neighbour.

But there has been no let-up in fighting in what has been Europe's deadliest conflict since World War II and Moscow's current negotiating position is far from clear.

Russian leader Vladimir Putin has repeatedly said he does not want to see NATO troops on the ground in Ukraine.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 12:49:10 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/005c0ea6-ebc0-11f0-95ff-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/69e76a2af945b41c0fee45190ead3d8c02c911f4.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Heavy snowfall in France causes widespread transport disruption</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/heavy-snowfall-in-france-causes-widespread-transport-disruption</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 12:49:12 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/21ec9c06-ebb7-11f0-8bfd-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-07T085103Z-1505152388-RC27WIAI7AVT-RTRMADP-3-EUROPE-WEATHER-FRANCE-SNOW.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukraine allies agree on security guarantees in case of a ceasefire</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/ukraine-allies-agree-on-security-guarantees-in-case-of-a-ceasefire</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 12:49:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/bce953ac-ebb2-11f0-bde2-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260107-104046-104243-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Yemeni separatist leader charged with 'high treason' by Yemen's anti-Houthi council</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/yemeni-separatist-leader-charged-with-high-treason-by-yemen-s-anti-houti-council</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 12:49:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/4d766d44-ebb1-11f0-a018-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260107-103349-103502-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Snow clogs transport in Europe as Parisians turn to skis</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/western-europe-braces-another-wave-snow-ice-2026-01-07/</link><description>PARIS/BRUSSELS, Jan 7 (Reuters) - Snow and ice brought misery to travellers in northwest Europe on Wednesday but delight to others who set out to explore a snow-blanketed Paris on sledges and skis.

Storm Goretti blew in from the Atlantic coast and hit Paris as daylight broke, dumping heavy snowfall on the city that led to further flight cancellations, traffic snarls and transport disruption.

The city's bus services were suspended as shops geared up for the first day of the New Year sales. But tourists and residents enjoyed the rare sight of snow-covered Paris, with a few taking the opportunity to ski down the slopes of Montmartre and along the Champs de Mars gardens below the Eiffel Tower.

"It's exceptional, it's incredible. It's magnificent and we're enjoying it. We also came across a lot of tourists and they look so happy," said Pierre, a Parisian out admiring the snowy scenery.

People grabbed sledges or even just plastic bags to slide down any slopes they could find.

France's Weather Office warned of snowfall across the northern half of the country on Wednesday.

Dutch airline KLM (AIRF.PA) , opens new tab cancelled 600 flights scheduled for Wednesday at Amsterdam's Schiphol airport, in the sixth consecutive day of disruption at one of Europe's busiest hubs.

KLM has warned it is running out of de-icing fluid for its jets and delays to supplies had made it difficult to replenish stock. No shortages were reported in France.

France's civil aviation authority asked airlines to cut 40% of flights at Paris' main international airport Charles de Gaulle and 25% of flights at the smaller Orly.

Brussels' international airport also faced some cancellations and delays, while train operator Eurostar flagged major delays and cancellations.

Dutch authorities urged people to work from home and French officials banned trucks and school buses from the roads in a third of all administrative departments, most in the northern half of the country.

Carrefour (CARR.PA) , opens new tab CEO Alexandre Bompard said the truck ban would bring some disruption to supermarket supply chains, in particular for fresh produce.

Further east, in Germany, temperatures were below minus 10 degrees Celsius (14 degrees Fahrenheit) again on Wednesday. Traffic disruption has been limited though.

Spain too is facing snow and unusual cold, prompting the suspension of one commuter rail line near Madrid and disrupting more than 40 roads across the country.

Heavy snow and rain overnight caused travel disruptions across the Western Balkans.

Passengers were trapped in a train for more than 12 hours in the town of Knin in northwestern Croatia after trees fell onto the tracks.

Some towns in eastern Bosnia and western Serbia declared emergency situations after power and water cuts.

In Poland, schools in many regions were closed due to snow, with some switching to remote learning. In Hungary, heavy snowfall hit highways and delayed trains and buses on Wednesday morning.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 13:41:07 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/U22IYZKJVZM5HJEXJLK6J4Z3OU.jpg?auth=797df0b3857af6a15f0abe1baee12365bb0e7f4b48f470f80ac1b12b153e6a35&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Brazil’s Bolsonaro authorized to go to hospital for tests after fall</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/brazils-bolsonaro-authorized-go-hospital-tests-after-fall-2026-01-07/</link><description>BRASILIA, Jan 7 (Reuters) - Brazil's Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes authorized former President Jair Bolsonaro to leave prison and be taken to a hospital for tests after he fell and hit his head, a court decision showed on Wednesday.

The military had declared the city's Kurdish-controlled districts "closed military zones" from 3pm (1200 GMT), while creating "two safe humanitarian crossings" through which thousands of civilians had fled before the deadline, according to AFP correspondents.

The deadly clashes , which started on Tuesday, are the worst between the two sides, who have so far failed to implement a March deal to merge the Kurds ' semi-autonomous administration and military into Syria's new Islamist government.

AFP correspondents in Aleppo saw large groups families with children leaving the neighbourhoods, carrying their belongings with them, some in tears.

"All Syrian Democratic Forces military positions within the Sheikh Maqsud and Ashrafieh neighbourhoods of Aleppo are legitimate military targets," the army said referring to the Kurdish-led force.

Senior Kurdish official Ilham Ahmed accused Damascus of launching a "genocidal war" against the Kurds, calling on the Syrian government to "pursue a path of reason to resolve problems through dialogue".

The violence caused the suspension of flights to and from Aleppo's airport, with schools, universities and government offices in the city shut down.

Tuesday's clashes killed nine people, mostly civilians, with both sides trading blame over who started the fighting.

Joud Serjian, a 53-year-old housewife and resident of the Syriac Quarter, said the violence "reminded us of the war".

Living in the Syriac Quarter near Ashrafieh, Serjian said "we have nowhere else to go, so we'll stay in our home".

During the Syrian civil war, Aleppo was the scene of fierce fighting between rebels and forces of ousted President Bashar al-Assad before he regained control of the city in 2016.

Assad was ousted in a lightning Islamist-led offensive in 2024.

Abdul Karim Omar, representative of the Kurds' autonomous administration in Damascus, told AFP Aleppo's Kurdish-majority neighbourhoods were "completely besieged".

He denied that any shells had been fired from these areas, arguing that they are controlled by the Kurds' Asayish domestic security forces "who only have light weapons".

Sheikh Maqsud and Ashrafiyeh have remained under the control of Kurdish units linked to the SDF, despite Kurdish fighters agreeing to withdraw from the areas in April.

The SDF controls swathes of Syria's oil-rich north and northeast, with the backing of a US-led international coalition, and was key to the territorial defeat of the Islamic State group in Syria in 2019.

The March agreement on the Kurdish authority's integration into the state was supposed to be implemented by the end of 2025.

The Kurds are pushing for decentralised rule, an idea which Syria's new authorities have rejected.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 13:42:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/ab97cfaa-ebc8-11f0-a756-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-07T120527Z-204888481-RC28WIAKNDWN-RTRMADP-3-SYRIA-SECURITY-ALEPPO.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>In pictures: Rare heavy snowfall blankets Paris streets and monuments</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260107-in-pictures-rare-heavy-snowfall-blankets-paris-streets-and-monuments</link><description>Snow and ice are falling on northern and western France in a phenomenon of "rare magnitude", according to the Metéo-France weather agency. More than 100 flights at Charles de Gaulle airport and another 40 at Orly were cancelled on Wednesday , with the French capital halting bus services starting from around 7am.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 13:42:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/bf4d311e-ebc0-11f0-80d8-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/Snow-2-ski.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UN accuses Israel of 'severe segregation and discrimination' in West Bank 'apartheid'</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260107-un-accuses-israel-of-severe-segregation-and-discrimination-in-west-bank-apartheid</link><description>The United Nations on Wednesday said decades-long discrimination and segregation of Palestinians by Israel in the West Bank were intensifying, and called on the country to end its "apartheid system".

In a new report, slammed by Israel , the UN rights office said "systematic discrimination " against Palestinians across the occupied Palestinian territories had "drastically deteriorated" in recent years.

"There is a systematic asphyxiation of the rights of Palestinians in the West Bank ," UN rights chief Volker Turk said in a statement.

"Whether accessing water , school, rushing to hospital , visiting family or friends, or harvesting olives – every aspect of life for Palestinians in the West Bank is controlled and curtailed by Israel's discriminatory laws, policies and practices," he added.

"This is a particularly severe form of racial discrimination and segregation, that resembles the kind of apartheid system we have seen before."

A number of independent experts affiliated with the UN have described the situation in the occupied Palestinian territories as "apartheid" but this marks the first time a UN rights chief has applied the term.

Israel's diplomatic mission to the UN in Geneva slammed the report's "absurd and distorted accusations of racial discrimination" against Israel, charging it exemplified the UN rights office's "inherently politically driven fixation ... on vilifying Israel".

The report said the Israeli authorities "treat Israeli settlers and Palestinians residing in the West Bank under two distinct bodies of law and policies, resulting in unequal treatment on a range of critical issues".

"Palestinians continue to be subjected to large-scale confiscation of land and deprivation of access to resources," it added.

This had led to "dispossessing them of their lands and homes, alongside other forms of systemic discrimination, including criminal prosecution in military courts during which their due process and fair trial rights are systematically violated".

Turk demanded Wednesday that Israel "repeal all laws, policies and practices that perpetuate systemic discrimination against Palestinians based on race, religion or ethnic origin".

The discrimination was compounded by continuing and escalating settler violence, in many cases "with the acquiescence, support and participation of Israel's security forces", the rights office said.

More than 500,000 Israelis currently live in settlements in the West Bank, occupied since 1967 and home to around three million Palestinians.

Violence has risen in recent years, surging especially since Hamas 's October 7, 2023 attack, which triggered the Gaza war.

Since the start of the war, Israeli troops and settlers have killed more than 1,000 Palestinians in the West Bank, including many militants as well as dozens of civilians, according to an AFP tally based on figures from the Palestinian health ministry.

According to official Israeli figures, at least 44 Israelis, both soldiers and civilians, have been killed in Palestinian attacks or Israeli military operations in the same period.

Since the Gaza war began, Israeli authorities had also "further expanded the use of unlawful force, arbitrary detention and torture ", the report said.

Increased "repression of civil society and undue restrictions on media freedoms (and) severe movement restrictions" had also characterised "an unprecedented deterioration of the human rights situation" in the West Bank, it said.

There had also been rapid expansions of settlements, considered illegal under international law, even as unlawful killings of Palestinians were taking place "with almost complete impunity", the report warned.

Of the more than 1,500 killings of Palestinians that took place between the start of 2017 and September 30 last year, Israeli authorities had opened just 112 investigations, resulting in only one conviction, it pointed out.

The report said it had found "reasonable grounds to believe that this separation, segregation, and subordination is intended to be permanent... to maintain oppression and domination of Palestinians".

This, it stressed, amounts to a violation of an international anti-racism convention, "which prohibits racial segregation and apartheid".

The UN rights office on Wednesday urged Israel to end its "unlawful presence in the occupied Palestinian territory, including by dismantling all settlements and evacuating all settlers, and to respect the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination".</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 13:42:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/0228e666-ebcd-11f0-9def-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/2025-12-23T111107Z-38182078-RC2AMIAJJ3WT-RTRMADP-3-ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS-WEST-BANK-RAID.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Why does Donald Trump want to take over Greenland?</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/why-does-donald-trump-want-to-take-over-greenland</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 14:25:04 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/432a6f0a-eb2c-11f0-87f5-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-06T131202Z-431987562-RC2U9DA7NHYT-RTRMADP-3-USA-TRUMP-GREENLAND-EUROPE.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US takeover of Greenland would 'simply mean the end of NATO', says Denmark</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/us-takeover-of-greenland-would-simply-mean-the-end-of-nato-says-denmark</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 14:25:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/141c4052-ebcd-11f0-b244-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260107-140348-140941-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Deadly clashes resume in Syria's Aleppo between government, Kurdish forces</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/deadly-clashes-resume-syrias-aleppo-between-government-kurdish-forces-2026-01-07/</link><description>ALEPPO, Syria, Jan 7 - Fierce fighting resumed in Syria's northern city of Aleppo between government forces and Kurdish fighters for a second day on Wednesday, sending thousands of civilians fleeing and leaving at least four people dead.

The violence, and statements trading blame over who started it, signaled that a stalemate between Damascus and Kurdish authorities that have resisted integrating into the central government was deepening and growing deadlier.

It began on Tuesday, when at least six people were killed , including two women and a child, in an exchange of shelling between Syrian government troops and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF).

After relative calm overnight, shelling resumed on Wednesday and intensified in the afternoon, Reuters reporters in the city said. Aleppo's health directorate said a further four people were killed and 18 wounded.

The Syrian army announced that military positions in the SDF-held neighbourhoods of Sheikh Maqsoud and Ashrafiyah were "legitimate military targets." Two Syrian security officials told Reuters that they expected a significant military operation in the city.

The government opened humanitarian corridors for civilians to flee flashpoint neighbourhoods, ferrying them out on city buses. A source from the government's civil defence rescue force said an estimated 10,000 people had fled.

"We move them safely to the places they want to go to according to their desire or to displaced shelters," said Faisal Mohammad Ali, operations chief of the civil defence force in Aleppo.

The latest fighting has disrupted civilian life in a leading Syrian city, closing the airport and a highway to Turkey, halting operations at factories in an industrial zone and paralysing major roads into the city centre.

The Damascus government said its forces were responding to rocket fire, drone attacks and shelling from SDF-held neighbourhoods, but Kurdish forces said they held Damascus "fully and directly responsible for ... the dangerous escalation that threatens the lives of thousands of civilians and undermines stability in the city."

During Syria's 14-year civil war , Kurdish authorities began running a semi-autonomous zone in northeast Syria, as well as in parts of Aleppo city.

They have been reluctant to give up those zones and integrate fully into the Islamist-led government that took over after ex-President Bashar al-Assad's ousting in late 2024.

Last year, the Damascus government reached a deal with the SDF that planned for a full integration by the end of 2025 , but the two sides have made little progress, each accusing the other of stalling or acting in bad faith.

Failure to integrate the SDF into Syria's army risks further violence and could potentially draw in Turkey, which has threatened an incursion against Kurdish fighters it views as terrorists.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 14:51:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4B7KK2ZJ7VNCRKIYHGPTQKN3HU.jpg?auth=8fe1f3ac4c3712d210dd9ccc8d9ffe5ccd0b213bc64bc4180eeb9f495512a1f4&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Soundproofing foam in Swiss bar fire should have been checked by law, official says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/soundproofing-foam-swiss-bar-fire-should-have-been-checked-by-law-official-says-2026-01-07/</link><description>GENEVA, Jan 7 (Reuters) - Soundproofing foam that caught fire in a bar in the Swiss ski resort of Crans-Montana at New Year, killing 40 people, should have been subject to regular safety checks by law, a senior official said, contradicting the town's mayor.

Investigators suspect the blaze at "Le Constellation" bar broke out when revellers held up sparkling candles too close to soundproofing foam on the basement ceiling.

On Tuesday, Crans-Montana Mayor Nicolas Feraud said the bar had not been subjected to any annual safety inspections since 2019, even though it should have been every year.

But Feraud said the law did not mandate safety checks of the soundproofing material itself. Courts will determine if this should have been done regardless, he said.

Stephane Ganzer, head of security in the canton (county) of Valais where Crans-Montana is located, told Swiss media RTS that existing regulations clearly required a list of checks, including materials such as soundproofing foam.

"The checklists are very clear, and obviously, checking materials - especially foam like this - is part of the basic inspection carried out in an establishment," he said.

He cited an ordinance supplementing the law, as well as standards of the Swiss Society of Engineers and Architects.

His remarks add to the debate over who was responsible for the condition of the bar when the fire broke out.

Ganzer said such failings should not happen in Switzerland, long renowned for its image of affluent law and order, stability and precision.

Carney is trying to diversify Canada's exports away from its main market, the United States, as Canada faces uncertain trade policy from U.S. President Donald Trump.

The visit aims to increase engagement on trade, energy, agriculture and international security, Carney's office said. China is Canada's second biggest trading partner.

China announced preliminary anti-dumping duties on Canadian canola imports in August, a year after Canada a 100% tariff on imports of Chinese electric vehicles.

Carney had agreed to visit China after meeting with President Xi Jinping in South Korea in October .

Carney has previously stressed the need to restart broad after years of worsening ties.

Canada's agriculture minister said in November his weeklong trip to China was evidence of bilateral relations beginning to thaw, something desperately needed by Canada's farmers and canola exporters.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 14:52:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HIBPNZS3XJOQ5FUFZBCBQK75MU.jpg?auth=4f4488514bd3b87486174378f3a31cee65cc586d4a8388a2c8c9886632b4762f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Leader of Yemen's southern separatist group never gave up hopes for independence</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/leader-yemens-southern-separatist-group-never-gave-up-hopes-independence-2026-01-07/</link><description>DUBAI, Jan 7 (Reuters) - Yemeni separatist leader Aidarous al-Zubaidi, who took up arms early in life and never shied away from joining conflicts, shows no signs of abandoning his dream of creating an independent state in the south.

Zubaidi, the leader of Yemen's Southern Transitional Council, failed to board a flight to Saudi Arabia on Wednesday for talks on ending a military escalation that saw his forces sweep towards the Saudi border last month.

His no-show added to deep uncertainty in Yemen, ravaged by more than 10 years of civil war and now caught in a deepening feud between Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, the most powerful countries in the region and both close allies of the United States.

Yemen's Saudi-backed presidential council expelled Zubaidi and accused him of treason.

The crisis erupted last month, when STC forces suddenly seized swathes of territory, shifting the delicate balance of power and putting Saudi Arabia and the UAE on opposite sides of the conflict .

Born in 1967 in Al Dhalea province, in southern Yemen, a region known for agriculture and widely-used narcotic leaf qat, he became an officer in the military forces of South Yemen, which was unified with the North in 1990 after 23 years as separate states.

Known for his hardline stance on the independence of the south, Zubaidi often returned to his native region to regroup after setbacks. Now, he appears ready to take on Saudi Arabia to achieve his goals even as Saudi-backed Yemeni government forces advance towards Aden.

Zubaidi fought in the civil war in the summer of 1994 that ended with the defeat of southern forces, an outcome that led him to set up his own armed group in Dhalea calling for self-determination.

After civil war erupted again 20 years later, when the Houthis ousted the Saudi-backed, internationally recognised government of then-president Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi and took the capital Sanaa, Zubaidi led efforts to oust the Iran-aligned group from Dhalea.

He was appointed governor of the restive southern port city of Aden in 2016, surviving an assassination attempt claimed by the Islamic State before being fired from the post in April 2017 after tensions emerged with Hadi's government.

A month later, the STC was founded with backing from the UAE, initially part of the Sunni Muslim Saudi-led alliance against the Houthis.

While joining the fight against the Houthis, whom he labelled "the biggest threat" in an interview with Reuters at Davos in 2025, he never lost focus on the separatist fight for the south.

Zubaidi last week called for a referendum on independence from the north in two years, the clearest indication yet of the STC's intention to secede and a further escalation in the unfolding crisis, which has added to Yemen's woes after more than 10 years of civil war that created one of the world's worst humanitarian crises.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 14:52:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/6XY2MQAKDBLSLBC54YWQ6B2XI4.jpg?auth=32afacc8daa23a90d9fe3a697ef1f3cb199d978789429e0fa2350e7934b5ca67&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>TikTok removes videos by Polish far-right politician after hate speech complaint</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/tiktok-removes-videos-by-polish-far-right-politician-after-hate-speech-complaint-2026-01-07/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 14:53:04 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>US wants Venezuelan oil flowing again with revenues in US accounts, Wright says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/us-wants-venezuelan-oil-flowing-again-with-revenues-us-accounts-wright-says-2026-01-07/</link><description>Jan 7 (Reuters) - The United States needs to control Venezuela's oil sales and revenue to drive the changes it wants to see in the country, Energy Secretary Chris Wright said on Wednesday.

Wright said he was speaking to U.S. oil companies to learn what conditions would enable them to enter the South American country and added that he wanted to sell Venezuelan oil to U.S. refineries.

Over the weekend, President Donald Trump said the U.S. would " take control " of Venezuela after U.S. forces ousted Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, a step that could give U.S. energy companies access to the country's vast oil reserves.

"Instead of the oil being blockaded as it is right now, we're going to let the oil flow," Wright said, adding that the government would sell it to buyers in the U.S. and around the world.

The sales would be controlled by the U.S. government, Wright added, with revenues collected from them "deposited into accounts controlled by the U.S."

"If we control the flow of oil, the sales of that oil, and the flow of the cash that comes from those sales, we have large leverage. But without large leverage ... you don't get change.

Wright was speaking at the Goldman Sachs Energy, CleanTech &amp; Utilities Conference in Miami.

Raising crude output from Venezuela is a top objective for Trump. Venezuela was producing as much as 3.5 million bpd in the 1970s. But mismanagement and limited foreign investment led to a huge drop in annual production, which averaged about 1.1 million bpd last year.

"We could get several hundred thousand barrels a day of additional production in short to medium term if the conditions are there for just small capital deployments," Wright said.

The South American country sits atop the world's largest oil reserves but accounts only for about 1% of global supply.

U.S. oil executives are expected to visit the White House later this week to discuss ways to revive Venezuela's tattered oil sector, Reuters had reported on Tuesday.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 14:53:16 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/H44JBW376BLUNGEZ3YINUTWHC4.jpg?auth=132b0feb858862458d972fad83a2fcdc4cca011be3b530e8e2887aa394ab448b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China calls for joint counter-terrorism efforts with Pakistan</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-calls-joint-counter-terrorism-efforts-with-pakistan-2026-01-07/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 14:54:03 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Is there a link between the military escalation in Aleppo and the diplomatic breakthroughs in Paris?</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/is-there-a-link-between-the-military-escalation-in-aleppo-and-the-diplomatic-breakthroughs-in-paris</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 14:54:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/d3e591ba-ebd5-11f0-9111-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260107-151755-152351-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US Congress divided over Maduro capture and future of US in Venezuela</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/us-congress-divided-over-maduro-capture-and-future-of-us-in-venezuela</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 14:54:12 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/10311962-db98-11f0-b9b4-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2025-12-17T163240Z-480235207-RC2NM8A710A2-RTRMADP-3-USA-DEFENSE-CONGRESS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'Donroe Doctrine': 'Kidnapping of Maduro had nothing to do with democracy, human rights'</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/donroe-doctrine-kidnapping-of-maduro-had-nothing-to-do-with-democracy-human-rights</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 15:30:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/c617bf6e-ebd9-11f0-b5ec-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260106-183045-184600-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Swedish man detained on espionage suspicion</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/swedish-man-detained-espionage-suspicion-2026-01-07/</link><description>STOCKHOLM, Jan 7 (Reuters) - A Swedish man with links to the country's armed forces will be held in pre-trial detention on suspicion of espionage, a court in Sweden ruled on Wednesday.

Lawmakers passed emergency legislation before the holidays to keep the state running after failing to approve the budget. But as they reconvene on Thursday to make a fresh stab at the bill, their positions remain too far apart for it to pass by vote, many of them said.

Finance Minister Roland Lescure and Budget Minister Amelie de Montchalin, who want the budget passed by the end of January, met with key Socialist and conservative lawmakers for four hours on Tuesday to seek common ground before the lower house resumes its review Thursday.

If they cannot narrow differences, Lecornu's only hope of passing the budget would be to invoke article 49.3 of the constitution, breaking his promise not to ram it through without a vote. Such a move would inevitably trigger a no-confidence vote that could bring down his minority government unless the Socialists abstain.

"The government is hoping to avoid being toppled by throwing the Socialists some crumbs," said Eric Coquerel, the hard-left chair of the finance commission in the lower house.

Investors and ratings agencies are scrutinising France's finances as Lecornu struggles to chart a path to a fiscal deficit of under 3% of GDP by 2029. He has little room for manoeuvre in the fractious parliament, where budget battles have already toppled three governments since President Emmanuel Macron lost his majority in 2024.

The government wants to cut the deficit to 5.0% of GDP from an estimated 5.4% last year - the euro zone's highest. The Senate sent back a revised text with a 5.3% deficit, but Lescure warned the shortfall could reach 5.4% or more without restraint.

Socialists accuse conservatives who dominate the Senate of worsening the deficit by scrapping proposed tax hikes on big companies. They want those tax hikes reinstated and a freeze on welfare payments to be lifted.

"If they try to pass the budget in its current form, then the government will fall, that's for sure," said Socialist lawmaker Romain Eskenazi.

The Socialists face a delicate calculation to extract maximum concessions for abstaining on a no-confidence vote, but must also avoid looking reckless to voters ahead of March's municipal elections.

Conservative Republicains leader Bruno Retailleau said the Socialists' position makes it increasingly likely that the government would have to try to pass the budget by force.

"I don't think there is a version of the budget that could pass a vote in parliament," he told journalists.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 16:32:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CF442UIFWVNF5KZJAUUGJWQLZU.jpg?auth=21cf10a533604236acc4322573e89f649c0bfc5f006a3389eff461e1fbac81b4&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UK supported US mission to seize Russian-flagged oil tanker, MoD says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/uk-supported-us-mission-seize-russian-oil-tanker-mod-says-2026-01-07/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 7 (Reuters) - Britain provided support to the United States in its operation to seize a Russian-flagged oil tanker in the North Atlantic, the Ministry of Defence said on Wednesday.

The U.S. seized the tanker - which was being shadowed by a Russian submarine - on Wednesday, after pursuing it for more than two weeks across the Atlantic as part of Washington's efforts to block Venezuelan oil exports.

Britain said its armed forces gave "pre-planned operational support, including basing" following a U.S. request for assistance.

It said a military vessel provided support for the U.S. forces pursuing the tanker, and the Royal Air Force provided surveillance support from the air.

Defence Secretary John Healey said the operation targeted a vessel "with a nefarious history" linked to Russian and Iranian sanctions evasion networks.

“This action formed part of global efforts to crack down on sanctions busting,” he said in a statement.

He added that the U.S. was Britain's closest defence and security partner: "The depth of our defence relationship with the U.S. is an essential part of our security, and today's seamlessly executed operation shows just how well this works in practice."

The Bella-1 tanker, now renamed Marinera, is sanctioned by the U.S. under its counter-Iran sanctions, the British government said.

The MoD statement said the support was provided "in full compliance with international law".</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 16:33:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LV57VTHUNZM45K43XQMAHPRISQ.jpg?auth=9fc2558e5c3caf0565ef16e8e9139f83a4aa3687d923f6ba3a55d6fcd27e3651&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Dozens of Italian tourists evacuated from Yemeni island</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/dozens-italian-tourists-evacuated-yemeni-island-2026-01-07/</link><description>ROME, Jan 7 (Reuters) - Italy has begun repatriating dozens of its citizens stranded on the Yemeni island of Socotra, with a first flight carrying 46 tourists due to land in Jeddah on Wednesday, the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.

Another 59 Italians remain on the island and are expected to return on additional flights in the coming days, as authorities work with Yemen and Saudi Arabia. Saudi authorities will grant the Italians a four-day transit visa to help facilitate their return home.

The United Arab Emirates last week its troops from Yemen under a deadline from Saudi Arabia, also leaving behind the remote Yemeni island of Socotra and roughly 600 tourists who had flown in but could no longer fly out.

Air traffic at the island's main airport came to a halt as a deepening crisis between the UAE and Saudi Arabia translated into fresh conflict on Yemen's mainland, where the two Gulf powers back opposing groups in the country's civil war.

Socotra - which lies more than 300 km (185 miles) south of Yemen's coast, and until recently was mainly accessible by air via the UAE - has been a haven of tranquillity through the years of conflict on the mainland.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 16:33:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/PYPWIHAYSNMEZPMBGE7LPSYZE4.jpg?auth=720a167653141bf8859234df27cb77999e64f268d74d71043ed16e838bb4764f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Meloni condemns political hatred after party activists attacked in Italy</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/meloni-condemns-political-hatred-after-party-activists-attacked-italy-2026-01-07/</link><description>ROME, Jan 7 (Reuters) - Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni on Wednesday urged Italians to reject political violence after four activists from her party's youth wing were beaten up on the 48th anniversary of the killings of three neofascist militants in Rome.

Witnesses said the four activists were attacked as they were putting up posters to commemorate the deaths on January 7, 1978 of the three teenagers in Via Acca Larentia -- a long-standing rallying point for Italy's far-right.

In a statement, Meloni called the 1978 deaths "a painful page in the history of our nation", adding: "Those were dark years of terrorism and political hatred, in which too much innocent blood was shed, from multiple sides."

The three slain teenagers were members of the youth wing of the now defunct Italian Social Movement (MSI), a neofascist party founded after World War Two. Two of the teens were allegedly killed by leftwing militants, while the third was shot dead later the same day by a policeman after a riot broke out.

No one was convicted of the killings.

"We have the duty to preserve memory and to clearly reaffirm that political violence, in all its forms, is always a defeat. It is never justifiable. It must never return," Meloni said.

The four activists attacked on Wednesday were members of Gioventu Nazionale (National Youth), the youth wing of Brothers of Italy. None of them were believed to have been seriously hurt but their car had its windscreen smashed in.

Meloni said Italy had "to choose respect, dialogue, and civil coexistence", adding: "When an idea is silenced by force, democracy loses. Always."

The Via Acca Larentia commemoration has traditionally been marked by hundreds of men making the stiff-armed Roman salute and shouting "present" -- a rallying cry of neofascists.

Meloni's own Brothers of Italy party traces its roots back to the MSI, however the prime minister has denied accusations that her party has close ties with the far right, saying in 2023 that her government had no "nostalgia for fascism".

A year later she said anyone who idolised Italy's fascist past should be expelled from the Brothers of Italy after an undercover media investigation released a video of party members making fascist salutes and chanting "Sieg Heil".</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 16:33:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/XKYZXPMDWZMZZEEOJTMVWDEUSE.jpg?auth=bac3e15f3d9cd023c2d5719c20c6292f7ef113dc27e469636091b77830b4a0b6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Cambodia says Chen Zhi among 3 extradited to China after transnational crime probe</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/cambodia-says-chen-zhi-among-3-extradited-china-after-transnational-crime-probe-2026-01-07/</link><description>Jan 7 (Reuters) - Cambodia said on Wednesday it had extradited three people to China at the request of Beijing following a months-long joint investigation into transnational crime, among them an individual named Chen Zhi.

In a statement, the interior ministry said those extradited on Tuesday were all Chinese nationals. It did not provide further details on Chen Zhi or the alleged crimes, but said his Cambodian citizenship had been revoked.

The United States and Britain in October sanctioned the Prince Group of businesses headed by a Cambodian-Chinese tycoon named Chen Zhi, accusing it of operating large-scale online "scam centres" that used trafficked workers to defraud victims globally.

It was not immediately clear if the Prince Group chair was among the individuals extradited. China's foreign ministry and its public security did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.

Cambodia's interior ministry said in a statement it had arrested Chen Zhi and two other Chinese nationals, Xu Ji Liang and Shao Ji Hui, and had extradited them to China "within the scope of cooperation in combatting transnational crime and pursuant to a request from the relevant authorities of the People's Republic of China".

Parts of Southeast Asia, including the border areas between Thailand, Myanmar and Cambodia, have become hubs for massive online fraud, with criminal networks earning billions of dollars from illegal compounds where trafficking victims are often forced to work.

British sanctions targeted six entities and six individuals, including Chen Zhi, whom the U.S. and Britain accused of having overseen the construction of compounds used for online scams.

The U.S. Treasury Department said it had taken what it described as the largest action ever in Southeast Asia, targeting 146 people within the Prince Group.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 16:34:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Cambodia says Chen Zhi among 3 extradited to China after transnational crime probe</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/cambodia-says-chen-zhi-among-3-extradited-china-after-transnational-crime-probe-2026-01-07/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 16:34:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Taking over Greenland, a long-standing US obsession</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260107-taking-over-greenland-a-long-standing-us-obsession</link><description>US President Donald Trump is considering "several options" to acquire Greenland , including "using the military ", his spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said on Tuesday, stoking further concern in Europe over the future of the Arctic island.

In a joint statement , France , Germany , Italy , Poland , Spain and the UK voiced support for Denmark against Trump’s claims over the semi-autonomous territory. "Greenland belongs to its people. It is for Denmark and Greenland, and them only, to decide on matters concerning Denmark and Greenland," the European leaders said, stressing that Denmark is a NATO member like the United States and is bound to Washington by a defence agreement.

The statement followed new threats from Trump. Speaking to The Atlantic last week, the US president said it was up to observers to judge what the special forces operation in Venezuela – which led to the ouster of Nicolas Maduro and his wife – might mean for Greenland. “They are going to view it themselves. I really don’t know,” he added.

“We need Greenland from the standpoint of national security, and Denmark is not going to be able to do it,” Trump insisted, speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday evening. “We’ll take care of Greenland in about two months … let’s talk about Greenland in 20 days,” he added.

Trump’s renewed focus on the Arctic has sparked debate in Washington and abroad. Senior US officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio , told lawmakers that the administration would prefer to negotiate a purchase with Denmark rather than resort to force, though the option of military involvement has not been ruled out.

Trump had already expressed a desire to annex Greenland, a vast Arctic island home to some 57,000 people, during his first term. In August 2019, he told reporters he wanted to buy the territory from Denmark, calling it "essentially a real estate deal", following reports by The Wall Street Journal on his interest in the island.

The Danish province has been coveted for centuries. From the 10th century, Scandinavians began colonising the land, discovered in 982 by the Viking Erik the Red and previously inhabited by Indigenous peoples . Until the early 18th century, Norway and Denmark contested its sovereignty. In 1814, when the two kingdoms separated, Greenland remained under Danish control under the Treaty of Kiel.

Meanwhile, the United States claimed Greenland as part of its sphere of influence. Under President James Monroe’s 1824 doctrine, Washington warned European powers against interfering in the affairs of the "Americas". “From a US perspective, Greenland is North American,” Mikaa Blugeon-Mered, a geopolitics researcher specialising in Arctic regions, told FRANCE 24.

A few decades later, the United States sought to annex Greenland. In 1867, it tried to acquire the island as part of a purchase including Iceland, but Denmark rejected the offer. The US instead acquired Alaska from Russia for $7 million.

During World War I , Copenhagen and Washington resumed talks. In 1917, the United States purchased the Virgin Islands (formerly known as the Danish West Indies) from Denmark for $25 million to secure the Panama Canal, while recognising Danish sovereignty over Greenland.

During Denmark’s occupation by Nazi Germany, the United States invoked the Monroe Doctrine after losing contact with Greenland, which opposed any European expansion in the Americas. In April 1941, Washington signed a defence agreement with Denmark’s ambassador in the US, despite instructions from his government-in-exile. The deal allowed American troops to be stationed on Greenland, effectively turning the island into a US protectorate. Several bases were established, including Thule Air Base, now known as Pituffik.

The scramble for Greenland: Can Danish dependency resist Trump pressure?

After World War II , President Harry Truman proposed buying the island in 1946 for $100 million, but Denmark refused.

During the Cold War , Greenland proved strategically vital once again. The two countries signed a new agreement allowing the United States to strengthen its Thule base, which became a genuine US military enclave. "If there had been an exchange of intercontinental ballistic missiles aimed at the United States, they would have passed over the Arctic. That’s why they created this base, which still exists today. It is their first line of defence," said Blugeon-Mered, author of Les mondes polaires.

With this long history in mind, Blugeon-Mered said he was not surprised by the US president’s recent remarks. "Trump's 2019 proposal to buy Greenland attracted a lot of attention. Journalists called me, dismissing it as absurd, though it really isn’t. The issue involves political, strategic and resource stakes," he said.

With climate change and melting ice, Greenland now sits along newly accessible shipping routes that could shorten global trade routes. In January 2025, Trump expressed concern about Chinese and Russian activity in the Arctic region.

“You don’t even need binoculars. You look outside, you have Chinese ships all over the place. You have Russian ships all over the place. We’re not letting that happen,” Trump said.

The territory, covering two million square kilometres and 85 percent ice, also contains vast mineral reserves, including rare earths – essential for smartphones, computers and electric vehicles – as well as untapped oil.

"According to the US Geological Survey, Greenland could hold hydrocarbon reserves equivalent to around 31 billion barrels of oil, roughly 15 percent of Saudi Arabia’s reserves," Blugeon-Mered said.

Accessing these resources, however, is expected to be difficult. "All foreign companies that have attempted to locate commercially viable or exploitable deposits have come up empty," the researcher added.

For Blugeon-Mered, "this geo-economic battle is becoming a geopolitical one". He added: “When China takes an interest in Greenland, it is mainly for resources; when Russia does, it is primarily about strategic chokepoints. And when the Americans or Europeans are involved, all of these factors come into play.”

Faced with such ambitions, Greenland has consistently insisted it is not for sale and wants to determine its own future. In January 2025, a poll published in the Danish and Greenlandic press found that 85 percent of Greenlanders opposed annexation by the United States, while only 6 percent were in favour.

US officials say the tanker is part of a so-called shadow fleet that carries oil for countries such as Venezuela, Russia and Iran in violation of US sanctions .

The ship had thwarted an earlier attempt to board it last month near Venezuela, where a US raid on Saturday toppled the country's authoritarian president, Nicolas Maduro .

"The vessel was seized in the North Atlantic pursuant to a warrant issued by a US federal court," US European Command, which oversees American forces in the region, said in a statement on X.

After the operation, Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth posted that the US blockade on Venezuelan oil was in full effect "anywhere in the world".

Shortly after confirming the successful North Atlantic seizure, the US military announced a second sanctioned tanker ship had been seized in the Caribbean Sea.

US special forces at the weekend snatched Maduro and his wife from Caracas and flew them to New York to face trial on drug charges .

Since then, Trump has said that the United States will "run" Venezuela and US companies will control its critical oil industry.

The North Atlantic operation came despite Russia sending a submarine to escort the empty tanker, saying the vessel was sailing under the Russian flag and was far from the US coast.

"For reasons unclear to us, the Russian vessel is receiving heightened attention from the US and NATO militaries – attention that is clearly disproportionate to its peaceful status," Russia's foreign ministry said, prior to the seizure.

The vessel, formerly known as the Bella-1, switched its registration to Russia, changed its name to the Marinera and the tanker's crew reportedly painted a Russian flag on the tanker.

The tanker had been en route to the South American country but was not carrying cargo before it evaded the US blockade. It has been under US sanctions since 2024 over alleged ties to Iran and Hezbollah .

Trump said Tuesday that Venezuela will hand over tens of millions of barrels of oil to the United States after Maduro was seized.

Trump said 30–50 million barrels of "high‑quality, sanctioned" Venezuelan crude will be shipped to US ports, with the revenue – perhaps more than $2 billion at current market prices – placed under his personal control.

It was not clear whether Venezuela's new ruler – interim president Delcy Rodriguez – had agreed to hand over the oil, how the plan would work, or what its legal basis would be.

Rodriguez – a long-time member of Maduro's inner circle as vice president and energy minister – has vowed cooperation with the United States amid fears that Trump could pursue wider regime change.

Trump has said Washington is now "in charge" of the South American nation and has vowed a new doctrine of US dominance in the western hemisphere.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 16:35:07 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/94580246-ebd8-11f0-b088-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/50b4150bdcc087b35e1f7c058c0ed3363d449c0b.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Rubio says US plan for Venezuela is stability, recovery, then transition</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/rubio-says-us-plan-venezuela-is-stability-recovery-then-transition-2026-01-07/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 7 - The United States has a three-step plan for Venezuela that will begin with stabilizing the country after U.S. forces seized leader Nicolas Maduro on Saturday, overseeing the country's recovery and finally a transition, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Wednesday.

"We don't want it descending into chaos," said Rubio, speaking after briefing U.S. senators on the Trump administration's plan for the Latin American country.

"The second phase will be a phase that we call recovery, and that is ensuring that American, Western and other companies have access to the Venezuelan market in a way that's fair.

"Also, at the same time, begin to create the process of reconciliation nationally within Venezuela, so that the opposition forces can be amnestied and released and from prisons or brought back to the country, and begin to rebuild civil society," Rubio added.

Russia has repeatedly attacked Ukraine's ports and foreign-flagged vessels sailing from them in recent weeks, after President Vladimir Putin vowed to cut Ukraine off from the sea in retaliation for Kyiv's strikes on unregulated oil tankers sailing to Russia.

Ukraine's seaport administration said the attacked ports were Chornomorsk and Pivdennyi, both key export arteries for Ukraine's commodity-heavy economy.

"This is yet another attack by a terrorist country on port infrastructure that is involved in ensuring global food security," deputy prime minister Oleksiy Kuleba said.

Moscow attacked the Odesa region seaports 96 times in 2025, Ukraine's seaports authority told Reuters on Wednesday, nearly triple the number of attacks in 2024.

Port facilities, administrative buildings and tanks containing vegetable oil were damaged in Wednesday's attacks, Kuleba said, adding that the ports were continuing to operate even as the damage was being cleared.

Russia escalated strikes on Ukrainian ports in December after Ukraine conducted strikes on empty "shadow fleet" tankers, which Moscow uses to ship its oil to buyers despite Western sanctions. Kyiv has long sought to curtail this revenue stream, which it says is funding Russia's war in Ukraine.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 17:28:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Explainer: Why Saudi-UAE trade ties remain resilient despite Yemen tensions</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/why-saudi-uae-trade-ties-remain-resilient-despite-yemen-tensions-2026-01-07/</link><description>Abu Dhabi, Jan 7 (Reuters) - Turmoil in Yemen's south has exposed a major feud between Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, yet their $30 billion trade ties are proving remarkably resilient.

There is unlikely to be any repeat of the trade boycott that hit Qatar in 2017 during its standoff with Gulf states, because there is simply too much at stake for both Saudi and the UAE.

Saudi Arabia and the UAE are so deeply enmeshed in trade, investment and logistics that analysts say a full-blown economic rift is unlikely.

In June 2017, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt severed ties with Qatar, accusing it of fomenting regional unrest, supporting terrorism and getting too close to Iran, all of which Doha denied. Trade and travel links were severed almost overnight.

But the Qatar blockade targeted a smaller economy with fewer interdependencies.

Gulf states have little appetite for new regional confrontations and are unlikely to risk an economic showdown, said Robert Mogielnicki, a Middle East political economist. Both Saudi Arabia and the UAE see foreign policy as a tool to support business, a mindset that’s helping keep economic ties intact, he added.

Saudi-Emirati bilateral annual trade totalled around $30 billion at the end of 2023, according to Saudi data — up roughly 42% since 2020. The UAE was the kingdom’s fifth-largest destination for exports and its third-largest source of imports in 2024.

Saudi-UAE commerce runs deep, spanning everything from refined petroleum and gold, to jewellery and re-exported consumer goods like electronics. Much of this trade flows through Dubai’s Jebel Ali port, a major hub for goods entering the Saudi market, even as Riyadh spends big to expand its own ports to capture more direct shipments.

Consumer markets are deeply intertwined: shoppers at Lulu hypermarkets, an Emirati chain ubiquitous in both countries, routinely toss Saudi-made staples into their trolleys: Almarai milk, Jomara dates, Alyoum chicken.

Emirati investments in Saudi Arabia exceed $9.2 billion, while Saudi direct investments in the UAE are over $4.3 billion, according to Emirati data. More than 4,000 Saudi trademarks and dozens of commercial agencies operate in the Emirates, alongside joint ventures in logistics, retail, and hospitality.

Yes. The UAE has forged nearly 30 bilateral trade deals , opens new tab with countries, leapfrogging slow Gulf Cooperation Council negotiations that would have included Saudi Arabia.

Saudi Arabia has also taken steps seen as competitive, such as its 2021 directive requiring foreign firms to set up regional headquarters , opens new tab in Riyadh to qualify for government contracts - a move widely viewed as an effort to lure companies away from Dubai.

Competition between Saudi Arabia and the UAE is nothing new, but any move toward a boycott would undermine both countries' wider economic goals, said Alice Gower, a partner at London-based advisory firm Azure Strategy.

The Saudi-UAE economic relationship underpins much of the region’s trade and investment flows. Both countries act as a gateway for capital, goods, and services - Saudi Arabia as the largest Arab economy and the UAE as a major logistics and financial hub.

Regional stability is the top priority for both Gulf states, and any boycott would risk undermining confidence in their long-term economic masterplans and discourage investment and engagement in the region, Gower said.

Any prolonged strain between the two states would ripple across the Middle East.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 17:28:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WG656ECNT5IXRK4PTYAT46UFRI.jpg?auth=568f20871c99f07823074010e3e7d95429082bd28bc70797b283363846cf289f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia says US seizure of oil tanker is illegal, lawmaker calls it piracy</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/russia-says-us-seizure-oil-tanker-is-illegal-lawmaker-calls-it-piracy-2026-01-07/</link><description>Jan 7 (Reuters) - Russia said on Wednesday that the U.S. seizure of a Russian-flagged oil tanker in the Atlantic was a violation of maritime law, and a senior lawmaker described it as "outright piracy".

Russia's Transport Ministry said contact with the vessel, the Marinera, had been lost after U.S. naval forces boarded it near Iceland as part of efforts to block oil exports from Venezuela.

"In accordance with the 1982 U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea, freedom of navigation applies in the high seas, and no state has the right to use force against vessels duly registered in the jurisdictions of other states," the ministry said in a statement.

Russia is demanding that the United States ensure humane and decent treatment of the Russian crew members and their swift return home, state news agency TASS quoted the Foreign Ministry as saying.

The Marinera, originally known as the Bella-1, had previously slipped through a U.S. maritime blockade of sanctioned tankers in the Caribbean.

The blockade was part of a U.S. pressure campaign against Venezuela that culminated when President Donald Trump sent in U.S. special forces on January 3 to capture Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and bring him to New York to face drug trafficking charges, which he has denied.

"After a 'law enforcement operation' that killed several dozen people in Venezuela, the U.S. has engaged in outright piracy on the high seas," Andrei Klishas, a lawmaker from the ruling United Russia party, posted on Telegram.

Two U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters that Wednesday's operation was carried out by the Coast Guard and U.S. military.

They said Russian military vessels, including a submarine, were in the general vicinity. There were no indications of any confrontation between U.S. and Russian military forces.

Relations between Moscow and Washington plunged to their worst state since the Cold War after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, though they have become more cordial since Trump began his second term last year and started engaging with President Vladimir Putin to seek an end to the conflict.

Military incidents between the nuclear-armed powers are rare. In March 2023, a U.S military surveillance drone crashed into the Black Sea after being intercepted by Russian fighter jets, prompting Washington to protest and warn of the risk of an escalation.

Venezuelan leader Maduro was the second close ally of Russia to be ousted in just over a year, following the toppling of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in December 2024.

Russia has said it backs Delcy Rodriguez, sworn in on Monday as interim president, and will continue to support Venezuela in the face of what Moscow has called "blatant neocolonial threats and foreign armed aggression".

With Russians still in the midst of an extended New Year holiday period, Putin has yet to comment publicly on the U.S. action to remove Maduro.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 17:28:58 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BJ7LBQXVNBNELDTJTRS7GHKEFE.jpg?auth=63b6beaa78bc3ce22dbdb0060c30c6cd907b40755d187475826c1f9d4886ae3a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuela cooperating on US-seized oil tankers, says Marco Rubio</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/venezuela-cooperating-on-us-seized-oil-tankers-says-marco-rubio</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 17:30:07 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/729f6c06-ebe8-11f0-8df5-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260107-173301-173737-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Replay: U.S. Secretaries of State and Defence address Venezuela, Greenland</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/replay-u-s-secretaries-of-state-and-defence-address-venezuela-greenland</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 17:30:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/c4615c62-ebe7-11f0-bf18-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260107-172652-173224-CS-01.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Warner Bros rejects Paramount takeover again and tells shareholders to stick with Netflix bid</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/warner-bros-rejects-paramount-takeover-again-and-tells-shareholders-to-stick-with-netflix-bid</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 17:30:10 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/4f4e966c-ebe5-11f0-815c-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260107-171228-171518-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>German foreign minister says he confident NATO will remain as is</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/german-foreign-minister-says-he-confident-nato-will-remain-is-2026-01-07/</link><description>BERLIN, Jan 7 (Reuters) - German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said on Wednesday that he had no doubt that NATO's members remained united and was confident that the defence alliance would remain as it is.

"On Greenland, allow me to be clear: Greenland belongs to its people. Nothing can be decided about Denmark and about Greenland without Denmark, or without Greenland," Costa said in a speech marking the assumption by Cyprus of the rotating presidency of the EU.

"They have the full support and solidarity of the European Union," he said.

U.S. President Donald Trump has repeated in recent days that he wants to gain control of Greenland , as he argues the island is key for U.S. military strategy and claims Denmark has not done enough to protect it.

Costa said Cyprus was taking the helm of the EU Council at a time when the international rules-based order was under attack, and urged EU member states to stand up against these developments.

"The European Union cannot accept violations of international law - whether in Cyprus, Latin America, Greenland, Ukraine or Gaza," Costa said.

The meeting came after President Donald Trump 's signature refugee program was disrupted weeks earlier when South African authorities in an extraordinary move raided a U.S. refugee processing site in Johannesburg , arresting contractors and sparking backlash from Washington.

At the December 23 meeting, the top U.S. diplomat in South Africa, charge d'affaires Marc Dillard, received assurances from Pretoria that South Africa would not interfere with Trump's program, according to the meeting summary, which was signed by Dillard and sent to various U.S. agencies.

"We may not agree with the classification of certain South Africans as facing possible genocide, but their right to move to a destination of their choice is guaranteed and the government of South Africa won't interfere," the summary quoted Thabo Thage, one of the South African officials in the meeting, as saying.

At the same time, South African officials did not fully commit to investigating how a U.S. refugee officer's passport image leaked before being posted online and offered only a "tepid" response to Washington's push to get to the bottom of what happened, according to the meeting summary, which has not been previously reported.

Trump froze U.S. refugee admissions from around the world when he returned to the White House as part of his broader immigration crackdown. But weeks later, he launched an effort to bring white South Africans of Afrikaner ethnicity to the U.S. as refugees, claiming they were victims of race-based persecution in majority-Black South Africa. The South African government has emphatically rejected the allegations, which echoed far-right conspiracy theories .

During a May meeting with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, Trump confronted his counterpart with false claims about white genocide in the country. Ties between the two countries have further soured after Washington banned South Africa from the G20 meetings that it will host later this year.

The tensions peaked in mid-December when South African authorities raided a site where U.S. refugee staff and contractors were working on refugee cases.

The raid resulted in the arrest of seven Kenyans working as contractors for a U.S.-based refugee group over allegations they were violating the terms of their visas, as well as the brief detention of two U.S. refugee officers.

The U.S. State Department said that despite the "unacceptable events" in December, its operations remained unhindered. The department said more Afrikaners arrived in the U.S. as refugees in December than any previous month and that higher numbers were expected in January.

South Africa’s foreign ministry, the Department of International Relations and Cooperation, rejected any suggestion that its officials were negotiating with the U.S. regarding the refugee program.

"Our position on the so-called 'refugee protection' for South African citizens is unchanged: it is based on a false premise that lacks empirical evidence and has been rejected by South Africans of all backgrounds," the ministry said in a statement.

The summary, emailed to U.S. State Department refugee program staff on Monday and labeled “sensitive,” suggests the two nations are quietly seeking a more collaborative approach following tense relations since Trump took office nearly a year ago.

During a two-hour meeting late at night on December 23, South African officials appeared to seek calm rather than confrontation, the U.S. summary said. Dillard met with two high-ranking South African diplomats, Deputy Minister Alvin Botes and Acting Chief Director for North America Thabo Thage, it said.

“Botes and Thage appear to have entered the meeting with the aim of de‑escalating the recent rise in tensions and improving communications with U.S. counterparts to avoid ‘drama’ and the unnecessary airing of public grievances in the future,” the summary read.

South Africa’s foreign ministry said the arrest of U.S. refugee program contractors was "a law enforcement matter, not a diplomatic signal" and that the U.S. effort could proceed if it followed South African law.

"To construe adherence to the rule of law as a 'secret endorsement' of a specific foreign policy program is a deliberate misinterpretation," the ministry said.

While the South African officials defended the arrests of Kenyan contractors as “immigration enforcement,” they also said the country would not seek to derail Trump’s effort to bring white South Africans to the U.S.

They repeatedly assured the charge d’affaires "that there had been no change in policy and South Africa would not interfere with the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program,” the summary said.

Botes and Thage recommended the U.S. increase American staff and contract out to South Africans rather than Kenyans to avoid future issues, the summary said.

The South African officials offered a “tepid pledge” to investigate the leak of a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services refugee officer's passport following the raid, an incident that the U.S. Embassy called “an unacceptable form of harassment” at the time, the summary said.

Thage "downplayed the USCIS incident," questioning the link between the passport leak and the South African government, according to the summary.

While Thage shifted the blame to a blogger who posted the image to X, Botes - the second-highest-ranking official in South Africa’s foreign ministry - called for more scrutiny, it said.

“Botes acknowledged the need to find out what happened, gave Thage a look that questioned why he would object to an investigation, and tasked Thage with following up on the issue,” the summary said.

Dillard became charge d'affaires in Pretoria when the former top official, David Greene, departed in November. Greene had asked in a July cable to Washington whether non-whites could qualify for the refugee program , leading the top Trump appointee at the time to say the program was only for whites, Reuters reported at the time.

Trump set the refugee admissions target for fiscal year 2026 at 7,500 in October, the lowest level on record, with a focus on Afrikaners.

About 1,000 have entered since the first arrivals in May, two people familiar with the matter said.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 18:35:49 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7NYYVTPJSVMLVP5PNNXGS4XZL4.jpg?auth=44bba7e9f66836f9c2b9eb7ebad63bc3951779a0194cc0b665de29429d081716&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>White House says Greenland purchase is an active discussion, Trump is committed to NATO</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/white-house-says-greenland-purchase-is-an-active-discussion-trump-is-committed-2026-01-07/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 7 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump remains committed to the NATO alliance even as he and his national security team are holding active discussions about a U.S. purchase of Greenland, White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said on Wednesday.

Trump, who has long wanted to acquire Greenland for its mineral resources, has raised tensions with NATO allies by not ruling out the possibility of taking the territory by force.

Greenland, through its connection to Denmark, is considered a part of NATO.

"All options are always on the table for President Trump," Leavitt told reporters at a White House briefing. "The president's first option always has been diplomacy."

Leavitt said an acquisition of Greenland would give the United States more control over the Arctic region and an ability to counter aggression in a strategic area.

"The president has been very open and clear with all of you and with the world that he views it in the best interest of the United States to deter Russian and Chinese aggression in the Arctic region, and so that's why his team is currently talking about what a potential purchase would look like," she said.

Trump said earlier on Wednesday the U.S. would support NATO and that Russia and China only feared the alliance as long as the United States was a member.

"We will always be there for NATO, even if they won’t be there for us," he said in a post on Truth Social.

Leavitt said she had not heard Trump question Denmark's claim to Greenland.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 18:36:49 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/YJXZZ7IPAFMD5E3STMA5YQGNEI.jpg?auth=6ff22ef6552738b1da4ff397f490f777b9fc6851edd95e09be33c5298039be05&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Exclusive: Pakistan, Saudi in talks on JF-17 jets-for-loans deal, sources say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/pakistan-saudi-talks-jf-17-jets-for-loans-deal-sources-say-2026-01-07/</link><description>ISLAMABAD, Jan 7 - Pakistan and Saudi Arabia are in talks to convert about $2 billion of Saudi loans into a JF-17 fighter jet deal, two Pakistani sources said, deepening military cooperation months after the two nations signed a mutual defence pact last year.

The talks underscore how the two allies are moving to operationalise defence cooperation at a time when Pakistan is facing acute financial strain and Saudi Arabia is reshaping its security partnerships to hedge against uncertainty about U.S. commitments in the Middle East.

The mutual defence deal was signed following Israel's strikes on what it said were Hamas targets in Doha , an attack that shook the Gulf region.

One of the sources said the discussions were limited to the provision of JF-17 Thunder fighter jets, the light combat aircraft jointly developed by Pakistan and China and produced in Pakistan, while the second said the jets were the primary option among others under discussion.

The first source said the total deal was worth $4 billion, with an additional $2 billion to be spent on equipment over and above the loan conversion. The sources close to the military with knowledge of the matter spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on the deal.

Pakistan's Air Chief Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu was in Saudi Arabia for bilateral talks including on "military cooperation between the two sides", Saudi media outlet SaudiNews50 said on social media platform X on Monday.

Amir Masood, a retired Air Marshall and analyst, said Pakistan was in talks about or had finalised deals with six countries to provide equipment including JF-17s and electronic systems and weapons systems for the jets. He said those countries included Saudi Arabia, but could not confirm any details about the negotiations.

The JF-17s marketability has been increased because "it is tested and has been used in combat," he told Reuters, adding that it's also cost effective. Pakistan has said the aircraft was deployed during its conflict with India in May last year, the heaviest fighting between the neighbours in decades.

Pakistan's military and finance and defence ministries and military did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Saudi Arabia's government media office also did not respond.

The mutual defence pact, signed in September, committed both sides to treat any aggression against either country as an attack on both, significantly deepening a decades-old security partnership.

Pakistan has long provided military support to the kingdom, including training and advisory deployments, while Saudi Arabia has repeatedly stepped in to support Pakistan financially during periods of economic stress.

In 2018, Riyadh announced a $6 billion support package for Pakistan, including a $3 billion deposit at the central bank and $3 billion worth of oil supplies on deferred payment.

Saudi Arabia has since rolled over deposits multiple times, including a $1.2 billion deferment last year , helping Islamabad stabilise its foreign exchange reserves amid chronic balance-of-payments pressures.

Pakistan has in recent months stepped up defence outreach as it seeks to expand arms exports and monetise its domestic defence industry.

Last month, Islamabad struck a weapons deal worth more than $4 billion with Libya's eastern-based Libyan National Army, officials said, one of the country's largest-ever arms sales, which includes JF-17 fighter jets and training aircraft.

Pakistan has also held talks with Bangladesh on the possible sale of JF-17s , as it widens its arms supply ambitions beyond South Asia and the Middle East.

On Tuesday, Pakistan's defence minister said the success of its weapons industry could transform the country's economic outlook.

"Our aircraft have been tested, and we are receiving so many orders that Pakistan may not need the International Monetary Fund in six months," Khawaja Asif told broadcaster Geo News.

Pakistan is currently under a $7 billion IMF programme, its 24th, which followed a short-term $3 billion deal that helped avert a sovereign default in 2023. It secured the Fund's support after Saudi Arabia and other Gulf allies provided financial and deposit rollovers.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 18:37:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/G7NTUVGLNRJAVAFM4IFGYBOOBA.jpg?auth=f88e5146f6af0ea305db68496aa329ac635d67e265d781d7b7e35b4116a1d41d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US Homeland Security: one dead in Minneapolis shooting amid immigration surge</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us-homeland-security-one-dead-minneapolis-shooting-amid-immigration-surge-2026-01-07/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 7 (Reuters) - One person is dead after ICE officers on a large-scale immigration operation in Minneapolis shot someone who the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said had "weaponized" their vehicle, according to DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin.

President Donald Trump has argued that the US needs to control the world’s largest island to ensure its own security in the face of rising threats from China and Russia in the Arctic , and the White House has refused to rule out using military force to acquire the territory.

Rubio told a select group of lawmakers that it was the administration’s intention to eventually purchase Greenland , as opposed to using military force.

The remarks, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, were made in a classified briefing Monday evening on Capitol Hill, according to a person with knowledge of his comments who was granted anonymity because it was a private discussion.

On Wednesday, Rubio told reporters that Trump has been talking about acquiring Greenland since his first term.

“That’s always been the president’s intent from the very beginning,” Rubio said. “He’s not the first US president that has examined or looked at how we could acquire Greenland.”

Tensions with NATO members escalated after the White House said Tuesday that the “US military is always an option”.

Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen warned earlier this week that a US takeover would amount to the end of NATO .

Rubio did not directly answer a question about whether the Trump administration is willing to risk the NATO alliance by potentially moving ahead with a military option regarding Greenland.

“I’m not here to talk about Denmark or military intervention, I’ll be meeting with them next week, we’ll have those conversations with them then, but I don’t have anything further to add to that," Rubio said, telling reporters that every president retains the option to address national security threats to the United States through military means.

Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen and his Greenland counterpart, Vivian Motzfeldt, have requested a meeting with Rubio in the near future, according to a statement posted Tuesday to Greenland's government website. Previous requests for a sit-down were not successful, the statement said.

The leaders of France , Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain and the United Kingdom joined Frederiksen in a statement Tuesday reaffirming that the mineral-rich island, which guards the Arctic and North Atlantic approaches to North America, “belongs to its people”.

Denmark’s parliament approved a bill last June to allow US military bases on Danish soil. It widened a previous military agreement, made in 2023 with the Biden administration, where US troops had broad access to Danish airbases in the Scandinavian country.

Rasmussen, in a response to lawmakers’ questions, wrote over the summer that Denmark would be able to terminate the agreement if the US tries to annex all or part of Greenland.

But in the event of a military action, the US Department of Defense currently operates the remote Pituffik Space Base, in northwestern Greenland, and the troops there could be mobilised.

French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot said he spoke by phone Tuesday with Rubio, who dismissed the idea of a Venezuela-style operation in Greenland.

“In the United States, there is massive support for the country belonging to NATO – a membership that, from one day to the next, would be compromised by … any form of aggressiveness toward another member of NATO,” Barrot told France Inter radio on Wednesday.

Asked if he has a plan in case Trump does claim Greenland, Barrot said he would not engage in “fiction diplomacy”.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 18:37:47 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/9dd13966-ebef-11f0-b5a2-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/000-89VB9T3.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US flexes air power in Maduro extraction mission</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/us-flexes-air-power-maduro-extraction-mission-2026-01-07/</link><description>Jan 7 (Reuters) - The extraction of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife on Saturday showcased U.S. air dominance, deploying stealth fighters to control the skies, jets to jam enemy air defenses, and covert reconnaissance drones and satellites to feed commanders real-time intelligence.

The Defense Department, open-source data reviewed by Reuters and industry analysts indicate the U.S. employed a full arsenal of helicopters, fighter jets, refueling aircraft, and drones, in a major coup for U.S. defense companies and a display that China is likely to note.

Aircraft included Boeing’s (BA.N) , opens new tab F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and EA-18G Growler, Lockheed Martin’s (LMT.N) , opens new tab F-35 Lightning II and F-22 Raptor, and Northrop Grumman's (NOC.N) , opens new tab E-2D Advanced Hawkeye and B-1 bombers, the Pentagon said in a statement that noted more than 150 rotary-wing, fixed-wing, and unmanned aircraft were deployed.

Lockheed shares have gained 6.2% this week, while Northrop rose 4.4% and Textron was up 3.5%.

The mission signaled to adversaries the United States' ability to execute complex overseas operations at a time of rising tensions with China, which is rapidly expanding and modernizing its military presence in the Pacific .

"It's indicative of something that we alone can do," said former U.S. General Tim Ray, who was commander of Air Force Global Strike Command, responsible for the U.S.' long-range nuclear and conventional strike capabilities. Ray, currently CEO of Business Executives for National Security, added, "It's a sign we will compete geographically and economically against the Chinese in our own backyard."

Maduro, 63, pleaded not guilty on Monday in New York to narcotics charges.

To establish control of the airspace over Caracas before the operation began, Trump said power blackouts were caused by “a certain expertise that we have." Dan Caine, chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, added that U.S. Space Command and other agencies used multiple capabilities to “create a pathway” for U.S. aircraft to fly into the country undisturbed.

Reuters could not determine all that was used to clear a path for U.S. aircraft. Space Command provided multiple capabilities as "overwatch" that ensured "freedom of maneuver" for U.S. aircraft during the mission, a spokesperson said, declining to provide details.

The U.S. military created a similar protective corridor in June when it flew bombers into Iran to strike its nuclear facilities . The U.S. Space Force’s Delta 3 electromagnetic warfare unit used ground-based satellite jammers positioned in the region to take out Iranian communications along the route of U.S. bombers, Delta 3 commander Angelo Fernandez told Reuters in December.

The Venezuela extraction itself relied heavily on helicopters, including MH-60L Direct Action Penetrators - specialized assault helicopters equipped with advanced weapons systems - supported by Boeing Little Bird M/AH-6M light-attack and support helicopters and Boeing CH-47 Chinook heavy-lift helicopters capable of transporting troops and equipment in contested environments. AH-64 Apache attack helicopters, armed with Hellfire missiles and 30 mm chain guns, provided close air support during the extraction phase, according to defense industry executives who researched the raid.

Fighter jets used to dominate Venezuela's airspace included the Lockheed F-35 fifth-generation stealth fighter, which is capable of evading advanced radar systems. It operated alongside the F-22 Raptor - a fighter designed to hunt enemy aircraft. Additional jets included the Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, the Navy's primary strike fighters, and EA-18G Growlers, a specialized electronic warfare variant that jams enemy communications and radar to make it difficult for ground-based air defenses to track and shoot attacking aircraft.

Long-range strike capability came from B-1B Lancer supersonic bombers, which can deliver precision-guided munitions from outside the range of air defenses. These aircraft required mid-air refueling from Boeing KC-135 Stratotankers, aerial refueling platforms that extended the operational range of both the bombers and fighter aircraft throughout the multi-hour mission.

Intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance proved critical to mission success. Northrop Grumman E-2D Advanced Hawkeyes - carrier-based airborne early warning aircraft - provided battle management and threat detection. RQ-170 Sentinel stealth drones, previously used in the 2011 operation that located Osama bin Laden, conducted covert reconnaissance, while additional satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles supplied real-time intelligence to ground commanders.

One defense industry official said it was unlikely much of the Defense Department's latest equipment was involved, as operators have not completed training on next-generation platforms.

The executive said if this operation follows the pattern of past Pentagon post-mission analysis, industry would be briefed on what equipment had worked and what did not. Following Operation Midnight Hammer - airstrikes against Iranian drone facilities - the defense industry received an hour-long briefing at an industry day after the operation detailing equipment performance and operational challenges.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 19:21:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5UGMFFLG4NIF3IJ4AUZHCFRSZQ.jpg?auth=34338a4ac3259dff9ff5987e5b368af56e1d83df08bee708591a0408ee97ac54&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>The Bright Side: Fossils found in Morocco shed light on humanity's African roots</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/africa/20260107-the-bright-side-fossils-found-in-morocco-shed-light-on-humanity-s-african-roots</link><description>Fossilised bones and teeth dating to 773,000 years ago, unearthed in a Moroccan cave, ⁠are providing a deeper understanding of the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa , representing the remains of archaic humans who may have been close ancestors of our species.

Researchers said the fossils – lower jawbones of two adults and a toddler, as well as teeth, a thigh bone and some vertebrae – were unearthed in a cave called Grotte à Hominidés ​at a site in the city of Casablanca. The cave appears to have been a den for predators, with the thigh bone bearing bite marks ‍suggesting the person may have been hunted or scavenged by a hyena.

The researchers said the most appropriate interpretation is that these fossils represent an evolved form of the archaic human species Homo erectus, which first appeared about 1.9 million years ago ​in Africa and later spread to Eurasia.

The bones and teeth display a mix of primitive and more modern human characteristics. They ​fill a gap in the African fossil record of species in the human evolutionary lineage – called hominins – from about one million to 600,000 years ago.

According to the researchers, the fossils may represent an African population that existed shortly before the evolutionary split of the lineages that led to Homo sapiens in Africa and two closely related hominins – the Neanderthals and Denisovans – that inhabited Eurasia.

"I would be cautious about labeling them as 'the last common ancestor', but they are plausibly close to the populations from which later African – Homo sapiens – and Eurasian – Neanderthal and Denisovan – lineages ultimately emerged," said paleoanthropologist Jean-Jacques Hublin of Collège de France in Paris and the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany , lead author of the study published on Wednesday in the journal Nature.

"The fossils show a mosaic of primitive and derived ‍traits, consistent with evolutionary differentiation already underway during this period, while reinforcing a deep African ancestry for the Homo sapiens lineage," Hublin added.

The oldest-known fossils of Homo sapiens, dating to about 315,000 years ago, were also found in Morocco , at an archaeological ​site called Jebel Irhoud.

Knowing the age of the Grotte à Hominidés fossils, based on the magnetic signature of cave sediments surrounding the fossils, helped the researchers assess how this population fit into the human family tree.

"Establishing the age was essential to the interpretation of this material," Hublin added.

The fossils were buried by fine sediments ‌over time and the cave entrance was sealed by a dune, enabling exceptional preservation of the remains. Hundreds of stone artefacts and thousands of animal bones were also discovered in the cave.

The Grotte à Hominidés human fossils are roughly the same age as fossils from a site ‍called Gran Dolina near Atapuerca in Spain that represent an archaic human species called Homo antecessor. In fact, these fossils share some traits.

"The similarities between Gran Dolina and Grotte à Hominidés are intriguing and may reflect intermittent connections across the Strait of Gibraltar , a hypothesis that deserves further investigation," Hublin said.

Hominins from this time possessed body proportions similar to ours but with smaller brains.

The jawbone, or mandible, of the Grotte à Hominidés child, who was about 1-1/2 years old, was complete, while the mandible of one of the adults was nearly complete and the other was partial. One of the adult jawbones was built more robustly than the other, suggesting one was from a man and the other from a woman. The largest of the fossils was the adult thigh bone, ‍or femur.

These people were capable of hunting prey but roamed a dangerous landscape and sometimes found themselves as the hunted, with large carnivores, including big cats and hyenas, on the prowl.

"Only the femur displays clear evidence ‌of carnivore modification – gnawing and tooth ​marks – indicating consumption by a large carnivore. However, the cave appears primarily to have been a carnivore den that hominins used only occasionally. The absence of tooth marks on the mandibles does not imply that other parts of the bodies were not consumed by hyenas or other carnivores," Hublin said.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 19:24:48 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/bf680052-ebf2-11f0-bd13-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/000-89WX6CR.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israeli airstrike kills two in Gaza, Israel says targeted Hamas militant</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-airstrike-kills-two-gaza-israel-says-targeted-hamas-militant-2026-01-07/</link><description>CAIRO/JERUSALEM, Jan 7 (Reuters) - An Israeli airstrike killed at least two Palestinians in Gaza on Wednesday, local health authorities said, in what the military said was a retaliatory attack on a Hamas militant that was launched after its troops had come under fire.

Medical officials did not immediately identify the people killed. They said several people were also wounded in the airstrike, which struck a house in Gaza City. There was no immediate comment from Hamas.

The Israeli military said that Hamas militants had shot at soldiers earlier on Wednesday and that the airstrike targeted a senior Hamas militant who had directed attacks on its troops. The military did not say whether it had suffered any casualties.

Separately on Wednesday, in the southern Gaza area of Rafah, an Israeli-backed Palestinian militia said that it had killed two Hamas men , marking a renewed challenge to the militant group.

Nearly all of Gaza's 2 million people live in Hamas-held areas, where the group has been reestablishing its grip and where four Hamas sources said it continues to command thousands of men despite suffering heavy blows during the war.

But Israel still holds well over half of Gaza - areas where Hamas' foes operate beyond its reach. With U.S. President Donald Trump's plan for Gaza moving slowly, there is no immediate prospect of further Israeli withdrawals.

Fighting has greatly abated since Israel and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire in October after two years of war, but it has not stopped entirely. Both sides have accused each other of violations of the ceasefire.

More than 400 Palestinians, most of them civilians according to Gaza health officials, have been killed since the truce began, as well as three Israeli soldiers.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 19:42:26 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuela's PDVSA says oil supply negotiations with US progressing</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/venezuelas-pdvsa-says-oil-supply-negotiations-with-us-progressing-2026-01-07/</link><description>Jan 7 (Reuters) - Venezuela's state-run oil company PDVSA said on Wednesday it is progressing in negotiations with the United States for oil sales, as a board member for the company told Reuters the U.S. will need to buy cargoes at international prices.

On Tuesday, Washington announced a deal with Caracas to get access to up to $2 billion worth of Venezuelan crude, a sign that Venezuelan government officials are responding to U.S. President Donald Trump's demand that they open up to U.S. oil companies or risk more military intervention.

Trump has said he wants interim Venezuelan President Delcy Rodriguez, installed this week after the U.S. deposed President Nicolas Maduro, to give the U.S. and private companies "total access" to her country's oil industry.

PDVSA said in a brief statement that the parties have been talking about similar terms as those in place with foreign partners such as Chevron (CVX.N) , opens new tab , the company's main joint venture partner, which currently controls all oil exports to the U.S.

"The process ... is based on strictly commercial transactions under terms that are legal, transparent and beneficial for both parties," the company said.

PDVSA board member Wills Rangel, who is also a union leader, told Reuters the U.S. will need to buy cargoes at international prices if the country wants Venezuelan oil.

"If they want to buy it, they will have it in due time, sold at the international price," Rangel said. "Not the way (Trump) intends, as if that oil belongs to them because we supposedly owe them. We do not owe anything to the United States."

Chevron, which has a special U.S. license to export Venezuelan crude despite sanctions, is the only company currently exporting crude from the South American country, Rangel added, as a U.S. blockade on Venezuela keeps exports bound to China, the main destination of its oil, paralyzed.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 20:27:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/FO67MTPE6FONDORM3YDKR7WIEQ.jpg?auth=347aa4534964348eba59350c2c8d068d8cfc5525c897e6634d01f992117621c9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Italy says EU-Mercosur deal offers 'enormous benefits'</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260107-italy-says-eu-mercosur-deal-offers-enormous-benefits</link><description>Italy's foreign minister hailed the "enormous benefits" Wednesday of an EU trade deal with South American bloc Mercosur , as Brussels seeks to get the accord that Rome had previously stalled over the line.

Antonio Tajani welcomed new European Union measures to support farmers as EU agriculture ministers held crunch talks ahead of a vote on the agreement expected later this week.

" Italy has never changed its position," Tajani said in a statement.

"We have always supported the conclusion of the deal, emphasising the need to take due account of the legitimate concerns of the agricultural sector, so that markets are opened with adequate safeguards for the benefit of the most exposed production sectors."

"The EU-Mercosur agreement offers enormous benefits and potential," he added.

The accord, more than 25 years in the making, would create the world's largest free-trade area, boosting trade between the 27-nation EU and the Mercosur bloc comprising Brazil, Paraguay , Argentina and Uruguay .

But many European farmers fear they will be undercut by a flow of cheaper goods from agricultural giant Brazil and its neighbours.

Plans to seal the accord in December ran into a late roadblock as EU heavyweights Italy and France demanded a postponement.

The EU on Tuesday offered a carrot to farmers, saying it plans to tweak its budget proposal for 2028-2034 to allow them early access to around €45 billion.

As agriculture ministers met in Brussels on Wednesday, further concessions were made to tackle concerns over high fertiliser costs raised by Italy and France .

The commission said it would propose lowering tariffs on ammonia and urea imports and allow for a retroactive suspension of the bloc's carbon border tax on fertilisers from January 1.

"Keeping fertilisers affordable is vital for farmers' incomes," EU trade chief Maros Sefcovic told a press conference.

A spokeswoman for Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni , who had in December said it was "premature" to sign the Mercosur deal, declined to comment on Wednesday on whether Rome would now approve it.

Member states are expected to vote to give the text the final go-ahead on Friday.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 20:28:56 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/8e74132c-ec02-11f0-a670-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/000-89WB7CQ.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Incoherence: America First creates mixed signals in Russia, China, Latin America, Greenland Policies</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/incoherence-america-first-creates-mixed-signals-in-russia-china-latin-america-greenland-policies</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 20:28:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/7bed421c-ebff-11f0-87c6-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260107-181442-183236-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump says doubts 'NATO would be there for us' if needed</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/trump-says-doubts-nato-would-be-there-for-us-if-needed</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 20:29:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/53f6d92e-ec01-11f0-83ab-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260107-203839-204017-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Why does Trump want to annex Greenland?</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/why-does-trump-want-to-annex-greenland</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 20:29:02 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/6cb7eff6-ebfd-11f0-94a4-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260107-200833-201043-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US seeks to assert its control over Venezuelan oil with tanker seizures and sales worldwide</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/us-seeks-to-assert-its-control-over-venezuelan-oil-with-tanker-seizures-and-sales-worldwide</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 20:29:04 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/b68bd8e6-ebfc-11f0-9c50-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260107-200101-200626-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Mohammad Sinwar: the Hamas military chief who said striking Israel was 'easier than drinking water'</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/obituary-mohammad-sinwar-hamas-military-chief-who-said-striking-israel-was-2026-01-07/</link><description>Jan 7 (Reuters) - Mohammad Sinwar, the elusive Hamas military chief in Gaza, had for months since the death of his brother, in 2024, been Israel's most wanted man. On December 29, Hamas announced that he had died, aged 49, around seven months after Israel said it killed him in a strike.

Hamas did not provide details on Sinwar's death but said it mourned him along with other group leaders, describing them as "heroic martyrs". Hamas confirmed in the statement that Sinwar had been the head of the group's armed forces.

Sinwar was elevated to the top ranks of Hamas in 2024 after the death in combat of his brother Yahya, mastermind of the October 2023 attack on Israel that led to the war in Gaza and later overall leader of the Palestinian organisation.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in May 2025 that Sinwar had been killed. Less than two weeks later, the Israeli army said it had retrieved Sinwar's body in an underground tunnel beneath a hospital in southern Gaza.

Sinwar's death is expected to leave his next in command Izzeldeen Haddad, who had been overseeing operations in northern Gaza, in charge of Hamas' armed wing across the whole of the enclave.

It is unclear how the death will affect decision-making in Hamas more broadly - for example, whether it will bolster or diminish the influence of exiled members of the group's leadership council on policy matters, in particular the full implementation of the Gaza ceasefire plan agreed with Israel in October.

Hamas officials described Sinwar as a "ghost" who long outfoxed Israel's intelligence agencies.

Like his brother Yahya, Sinwar had survived many Israeli assassination attempts, including airstrikes and planted explosives, Hamas sources said.

When Sinwar once visited a cemetery, his comrades discovered a remote-controlled explosive resembling a brick planted along his path, according to the Hamas sources.

In 2003, Hamas operatives discovered a bomb in the wall of Mohammad Sinwar's house, foiling an assassination attempt that the group blamed on Israeli intelligence.

Known for clandestine operations, Mohammad Sinwar played a central role in planning and executing Hamas' October 7, 2023, attack on Israel, the country's worst security failure, Hamas sources said.

He was also widely believed to have been one of the masterminds of the 2006 cross-border attack and abduction of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit.

Hamas held Shalit for five years before he was swapped for more than 1,000 Palestinians jailed by Israel.

Under the deal, his brother Yahya Sinwar, whose meticulous planning for the 2023 attack shattered Israel's reputation as an invincible power in a hostile region, was among those who were released.

Netanyahu has vowed to eradicate Hamas. The offensive against Gaza by the Israeli Defence Forces, the Middle East's most advanced military, severely weakened the organisation.

Yahya Sinwar was killed in combat during a routine Israeli patrol in Gaza in 2024.

Israel released footage of a severely wounded Yahya Sinwar throwing a piece of wood at a hovering drone - his last act of defiance towards his old foe before his death and his brother's rise.

But the group, which was created during the first Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation in 1987 and which carried out suicide bombings that traumatised Israelis in the second one, is still standing.

Born on September 16, 1975, Sinwar rarely appeared in public or spoke to the media. He granted a lengthy interview to Al Jazeera for a documentary broadcast in 2022, but wore a cap and sat in the dark to hide his appearance.

The Sinwars originally came from Asqalan - now the Israeli city of Ashkelon, a short distance to the north of the Gaza Strip. Alongside hundreds of thousands of other Palestinians, they became refugees in what they call the Nakba, or catastrophe, at the time of Israel's declaration of independence during the 1948 war.

The family settled in Khan Younis in Gaza, which has been largely reduced to rubble in the latest war.

Mohammad Sinwar was educated in schools run by the United Nations' Palestinian relief agency (UNRWA), which has long been a target of Israeli criticism, including during the recent war in Gaza.

He joined Hamas shortly after its founding, influenced by his brother Yahya, a former member of the Muslim Brotherhood, the oldest and at one time most influential Islamist group in the Middle East.

His reputation as a hardliner helped him rise through the group's military ranks. By 2005, he was leading Hamas' Khan Younis Brigade.

The unit, one of the largest and most powerful battalions in Hamas' armed wing, has been responsible for cross-border attacks, firing rockets and planting bombs along the frontier. “Striking Tel Aviv is easier than drinking water," Sinwar told Al Jazeera.

The unit also watches the movements of Israeli soldiers around the clock. In 2006, elite commandos led by Sinwar took part in Shalit's abduction.

Sources close to Hamas say Sinwar developed close ties with Marwan Issa, the deputy commander of Hamas' military wing, and Mohammed Deif, the aloof military chief. Both men were killed by Israel in 2024.

In its statement announcing Sinwar's death on December 29, Hamas said that he had succeeded Deif.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 20:52:04 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Yemen separatists lose contact with delegation in Saudi Arabia for talks</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260107-yemen-separatists-lose-contact-with-delegation-in-saudi-arabia-for-talks</link><description>Yemen 's separatists said they had lost contact with a senior delegation that travelled to Riyadh for talks on Wednesday following clashes in the country's south.

More than 50 Southern Transitional Council (STC) members had not been heard from by colleagues or family since arriving in the Saudi capital, an official said.

Witnesses saw the group boarding a black bus at Riyadh airport, senior STC official Amr Al Bidh told journalists in a video call.

"This was a high-level delegation including the minister of defence, several ministers and members of the STC leadership," he said.

"Until now, we have heard nothing from them. We have tried to contact them repeatedly and have received nothing."

AFP was unable to reach the Saudi foreign ministry for comment.

A statement released by the STC on Wednesday night accused the Saudis of arbitrarily detaining the delegation and taking them to an unknown location.

"We call on their immediate release and put the onus on Saudi Arabia for their safety," the STC said in a statement.

The delegation travelled at Riyadh's request after an offensive by the UAE-backed separatists was pushed back by Saudi warplanes and pro-Saudi ground forces.

After STC leader Aidaros Alzubidi refused to join the flight , the Saudi-led coalition formed to fight Yemen's Houthi rebels carried out air strikes on his home province, killing seven people according to hospital sources.

A post on X from Riyadh on the account of one delegation member was not considered "legitimate communication", Al Bidh said.

The delegates' phones were either switched off or calls were going unanswered, he added.

"We cannot reach any of the more than 50 delegation members. That is worrying."

A separate STC statement demanded that Saudi authorities "guarantee the safety of its delegation currently in Riyadh".

"We call on all the international community to put pressure to make sure our delegation is safe," added Al Bidh.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 20:53:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/10dd4172-ec07-11f0-a2b5-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/000-89W34NQ.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump Greenland threats: 'ego politics rather than geopolitics', expert says</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/trump-greenland-threats-ego-politics-rather-than-geopolitics-expert-says</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 20:53:39 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/01804a80-ec07-11f0-b5ee-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260107-210623-211627-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ecuador protests Spain's release of alleged gangster tied to 2024 TV station attack</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/ecuador-protests-spains-release-alleged-gangster-tied-2024-tv-station-attack-2026-01-07/</link><description>QUITO/MADRID, Jan 7 (Reuters) - Ecuador's government on Wednesday protested a Spanish court's release of an alleged crime boss who Quito had been seeking to extradite after he was accused of leading a violent attack on a TV station in 2024.

William Joffre Alcivar Bautista, known as Commander Willy and alleged head of the criminal group Los Tiguerones, was arrested in Spain alongside his brother Alex in October 2024 on terrorism charges.

Ecuadorean authorities accuse Alcivar and his brother of orchestrating car bombings, contract killings, extortion and a live on-air raid of TC Television's studio in Guayaquil, Ecuador's largest city.

Spain's High Court authorized Alcivar's extradition last June, provided that Ecuador guaranteed his safety in custody.

But a spokesperson for the court said on Wednesday that Alcivar had been released on December 29 because Ecuador did not provide the requested guarantees.

"This person had two extradition requests, and both were granted, but on the condition that Ecuador provide guarantees," the court spokesperson said.

"Ecuador had a deadline to submit them and has been repeatedly asked to do so. Several warnings have been issued, and he has had to be released."

Ecuador's Interior Minister John Reimberg said on Wednesday that the government had submitted all necessary documentation for Alcivar's extradition.

Criticizing the release of Alcivar, he said the process had faced unexplained delays and that Spain had repeatedly requested more information despite Ecuador's provision of the documentation.

Reimberg said Ecuador's foreign ministry was working to re-apprehend Alcivar and have him returned to Ecuador. Reimberg did not specify whether Alcivar's brother was also released.

The 2024 attack on the TV station unfolded live for about 20 minutes, as 13 masked and heavily armed men stormed the studio, forcing staff to the floor. Police eventually rescued the hostages and the attackers surrendered.

Following the TV station attack, Ecuadorean President Daniel Noboa declared war on criminal gangs, labeling them terrorist groups.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 21:42:42 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/TUEAYCEDNNOGLFN5YQZKLQLQNE.jpg?auth=505cd1a5c3bfa937047f33e2c5be33ee2c8b9933e7bc4d925b4179e3ae4e2d92&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump signs proclamation withdrawing from international organizations, White House says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-signs-proclamation-withdrawing-international-organizations-white-house-2026-01-07/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 7 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday signed a proclamation withdrawing the United States from 35 non-United Nations organizations and 31 UN entities that "operate contrary to U.S. national interests," the White House said in a statement.

"As a result of the attack, Dnipropetrovsk and Zaporizhzhia regions are almost completely without electricity," the ministry said in a statement on Telegram. "Critical infrastructure is operating on reserve power."

Russian attacks have long targeted Ukraine's energy network and have intensified in recent months.

Ukraine's Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko said impending snowfalls and temperatures plunging overnight to minus 20 degrees Celsius (minus 4 degrees Fahrenheit) were likely to compound disruptions to power and heating.

"Ukraine's energy system is under enemy attacks every day, and energy workers are operating in extremely difficult conditions to provide people with light and heat," Svyrydenko wrote on Telegram.

"Deteriorating weather conditions put additional strain on critical infrastructure," she said.

Public broadcaster Suspilne said power cuts had hit the city of Dnipro, where the metro had stopped running, and other parts of the region.

The head of the Dnipropetrovsk regional council told the broadcaster it was uncertain when power would be restored.

Oleksandr Vilkul, head of the military administration in Kryvyi Rih, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's home town in the region, warned residents to brace for lengthy power cuts and said generators should be brought into use as much as possible.

Ukrainian Railways said trains in the two regions and signalling systems were being switched to reserve systems and stations were being operated with generators.

Zaporizhzhia Regional Governor Ivan Fedorov said the power cuts meant that air raid sirens were not audible. He said mobile telephone networks were working in emergency conditions and asked residents to stay off the networks.

Fedorov said hospitals in the city of Zaporizhzhia were functioning normally and water supplies would be quickly restored in affected areas.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 22:22:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>ICE officer kills driver in Minneapolis as immigration crackdown sparks outrage</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260107-ice-officer-kills-driver-in-minneapolis</link><description>An Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed a Minneapolis driver on Wednesday during the Trump administration’s latest immigration crackdown on a major American city — a shooting that federal officials said was an act of self-defence but that the mayor described as reckless and unnecessary.

The 37-year-old woman was shot in front of a family member during a traffic stop in a snowy residential neighbourhood south of downtown Minneapolis, just a few blocks from some of the city’s oldest immigrant markets and about a mile (1.6 kilometres) from where George Floyd was killed by police in 2020. Her death quickly drew a crowd of hundreds of angry protesters.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, speaking while visiting Texas, described the incident as an “act of domestic terrorism” carried out against ICE officers by a woman who “attempted to run them over and rammed them with her vehicle”.

“An officer of ours acted quickly and defensively, shot, to protect himself and the people around him,” Noem said.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey blasted that characterisation as “garbage” and criticised the federal deployment of more than 2,000 officers to the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St Paul as part of the immigration crackdown.

“What they are doing is not to provide safety in America. What they are doing is causing chaos and distrust,” Frey said, calling on immigration agents to leave. “They’re ripping families apart. They’re sowing chaos on our streets, and in this case, quite literally killing people.”

“They are already trying to spin this as an action of self-defence. Having seen the video myself, I wanna tell everybody directly, that is bullshit,” the mayor added.

Videos taken by bystanders from different vantage points and posted to social media show an officer approaching an SUV stopped across the middle of the road, demanding the driver open the door and grabbing the handle. The Honda Pilot begins to pull forward and a different ICE officer standing in front of the vehicle pulls his weapon and immediately fires at least two shots into the vehicle at close range, jumping back as the SUV moves towards him.

It was not clear from the videos whether the vehicle made contact with the officer. The SUV then sped into two cars parked at the kerb nearby before crashing to a stop. Witnesses screamed obscenities, expressing shock at what they had seen.

After the shooting, emergency medical technicians attempted to administer aid to the woman.

The killing marked a dramatic escalation in a series of immigration enforcement operations in major cities under the Trump administration. The death of the Minneapolis driver, whose name was not immediately released, was at least the fifth linked to immigration crackdowns.

The Twin Cities have been on edge since the Department of Homeland Security announced on Tuesday that it had launched the operation, which is at least partly tied to allegations of fraud involving Somali residents. Noem confirmed on Wednesday that DHS had deployed more than 2,000 officers to the area and said they had already made “hundreds and hundreds” of arrests.

A large throng of protesters gathered at the scene after the shooting, venting their anger at local and federal officers, including Gregory Bovino, a senior US Customs and Border Patrol official who has been the public face of crackdowns in Los Angeles, Chicago and elsewhere.

In scenes reminiscent of those crackdowns, bystanders heckled officers, chanting “Shame! Shame! Shame!” and “ICE out of Minnesota”, and blowing whistles that have become ubiquitous during the operations.

Minnesota Governor Tim Walz said he was prepared to deploy the National Guard if necessary. He said a family member of the driver witnessed the killing, which he described as “predictable” and “avoidable”. While expressing outrage, Walz urged protesters to remain peaceful.

“They want a show. We can’t give it to them. We cannot,” the governor said at a news conference. “If you protest and express your First Amendment rights, please do so peacefully, as you always do.”

Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara briefly described the shooting to reporters but, unlike federal officials, gave no indication that the driver was attempting to harm anyone. He said she had been shot in the head.

“This woman was in her vehicle and was blocking the roadway on Portland Avenue,” O’Hara said. “At some point a federal law enforcement officer approached her on foot and the vehicle began to drive off. At least two shots were fired. The vehicle then crashed on the side of the roadway.”

There were calls on social media to prosecute the officer who fired the shots. Bob Jacobson, commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Public Safety, said state authorities would investigate the shooting alongside federal officials.

“Keep in mind that this is an investigation that is also in its infancy,” Jacobson said. “Any speculation about what has happened would be just that.”

The shooting occurred in the district of Democratic Representative Ilhan Omar, who described it as “state violence”, not law enforcement.

For nearly a year, migrant rights advocates and neighbourhood activists across the Twin Cities have been preparing to mobilise in the event of an immigration enforcement surge. From houses of worship to mobile home parks, they have built extensive online networks, scanned licence plates for suspected federal vehicles, and stocked whistles and other noisemaking devices to alert communities to any enforcement presence.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 22:25:02 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/c45ca712-a466-11f0-aade-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/2025-10-04T231722Z-626913641-RC265HA2P9WJ-RTRMADP-3-USA-TRUMP-CHICAGO.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Burkina Faso' junta claims to have foiled 'yet another attempt at destabilisation'</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/burkina-faso-junta-claims-to-have-foiled-yet-another-attempt-at-destabilisation</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 22:25:04 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/df425fa4-ec0f-11f0-be97-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/DN191642-A-01-20251230-01.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US senators foresee vote on reining Trump in over Greenland</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us-senators-foresee-vote-reining-trump-over-greenland-2026-01-07/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 23:23:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Britain's PM discusses position on Greenland with Trump over call</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/britains-pm-discusses-position-greenland-with-trump-over-call-2026-01-07/</link><description>Jan 7 (Reuters) - The British government said on Wednesday Prime Minister Keir Starmer spoke with United States President Donald Trump this evening and also set out his position on Greenland.

This is the first phone call between the two presidents since Trump said on Sunday that a U.S. military operation focused on Colombia's government "sounds good" to him.

"It was a great honor to speak with the President of Colombia, Gustavo Petro, who called to explain the situation of drugs and other disagreements that we have had. I appreciated his call and tone, and look forward to meeting him in the near future," Trump wrote on social media.

Trump added "arrangements are being made" for a meeting in Washington between himself and Petro, though he did not indicate when the meeting may take place.

"We have spoken by phone for the first time since he became president," Petro told supporters gathered at a rally in Bogota meant to celebrate Colombia's sovereignty, adding he had requested a restart of dialogue between the two countries.

A source in Petro's office told Reuters the call was "cordial" and "respectful."

Relations between Trump and Petro have been frosty since the Republican returned to the White House.

Trump has repeatedly accused the administration of Petro, without evidence, of enabling a steady flow of cocaine into the U.S., and on Sunday referred to Petro as "a sick man."

In October, the U.S. government imposed sanctions on Petro, accusing him of allowing the expansion of the illicit drug trade in the Andean nation.

Colombia and Petro have repeatedly rejected Trump's accusations.

Petro has vocally denounced the Trump administration's strikes across the Pacific and Caribbean, which Washington claims are focused on suspected drug trafficking vessels. The Trump administration has carried out more than 30 strikes against suspected drug boats since September, in a campaign that has killed at least 110 people.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 01:46:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/JAS2QHNI6FJYBALNZMLXYLTYJA.jpg?auth=baf1d82dfaefef375c2a1d21b0eb7641b14ed07493ec2d39883088d687efa413&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump administration withdraws from dozens of international organisations</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260108-trump-administration-withdraws-from-international-organisations</link><description>The Trump administration will withdraw from dozens of international organisations, including the UN’s population agency and the UN treaty that establishes international climate negotiations, as the US further retreats from global cooperation.

President Donald Trump on Wednesday signed an executive order suspending US support for 66 organisations, agencies and commissions after instructing his administration to review participation in and funding for all international bodies, including those affiliated with the United Nations , according to a White House statement posted on social media.

Most of the targets are UN-related agencies, commissions and advisory panels focused on climate, labour and other issues the Trump administration has categorised as catering to diversity and so-called “woke” initiatives, according to a partial list obtained by The Associated Press.

“The Trump Administration has found these institutions to be redundant in their scope, mismanaged, unnecessary, wasteful, poorly run, captured by the interests of actors advancing their own agendas contrary to our own, or a threat to our nation’s sovereignty, freedoms, and general prosperity,” the State Department said in a statement.

Trump’s decision to withdraw from organisations that foster cooperation among nations to address global challenges comes as his administration has launched military efforts or issued threats that have rattled allies and adversaries alike, including capturing autocratic Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro and signalling an intention to take over Greenland .

The administration had already suspended support for bodies such as the World Health Organization, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees known as UNRWA, the UN Human Rights Council and the UN cultural agency UNESCO , as it adopted an a-la-carte approach to paying its UN dues, backing only those operations it believes align with Trump’s agenda.

“I think what we’re seeing is the crystallisation of the US approach to multilateralism, which is ‘my way or the highway,’” said Daniel Forti, head of UN affairs at the International Crisis Group. “It’s a very clear vision of wanting international cooperation on Washington’s own terms.”

The shift marks a sharp break from how previous Republican and Democratic administrations have dealt with the UN and has forced the world body, already undergoing internal reform, to respond with staffing and programme cuts.

Many independent non-governmental organisations, including some that work closely with the UN, have cited widespread project closures following the administration’s decision last year to slash foreign assistance through the US Agency for International Development, or USAID.

Despite the sweeping pullback, US officials, including Trump, say they still see value in the UN and want to focus taxpayer money on expanding American influence in standard-setting bodies where there is competition with China, such as the International Telecommunications Union, the International Maritime Organization and the International Labor Organization.

The withdrawal from the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, or UNFCCC, is the latest move by Trump and his allies to distance the US from international climate efforts . The UNFCCC, a 1992 agreement among 198 countries, underpins the landmark Paris climate accord. Trump, who has called climate change a hoax, withdrew from that agreement soon after returning to the White House.

Gina McCarthy, a former White House national climate adviser, described the move as “shortsighted, embarrassing, and a foolish decision”.

“As the only country in the world not a part of the UNFCCC treaty, the Trump administration is throwing away decades of US climate leadership and global collaboration,” she said, warning the decision would undermine America’s influence over trillions of dollars in global investments and policies.

Mainstream scientists say climate change is driving increasingly deadly and costly extreme weather, including floods, droughts, wildfires , intense rainfall and dangerous heat.

Stanford University climate scientist Rob Jackson, who chairs the Global Carbon Project, said the US withdrawal could hinder global efforts to curb greenhouse gases by giving other countries an excuse to delay their own commitments. Experts also warned meaningful progress would be difficult without cooperation from the US, one of the world’s largest emitters and economies.

The UN’s population agency, which provides sexual and reproductive health services worldwide, has long been a target of Republican opposition. Trump cut its funding during his first term, accusing it of involvement in “coercive abortion practices” in countries such as China — claims later dismissed by a State Department review under President Joe Biden, who restored funding in 2021.

Other organisations the US will exit include the Carbon Free Energy Compact, the United Nations University, the International Cotton Advisory Committee, the International Tropical Timber Organization, the Partnership for Atlantic Cooperation, the Pan-American Institute for Geography and History, the International Federation of Arts Councils and Culture Agencies, and the International Lead and Zinc Study Group.

The State Department said further reviews of US participation in international organisations are ongoing.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 01:47:04 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/78046510-ebfd-11f0-8ec7-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26006628561912.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuela's interior minister says 100 people died in US attack</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/venezuelas-interior-minister-says-100-people-died-us-attack-2026-01-08/</link><description>Jan 7 (Reuters) - Venezuela's interior minister Diosdado Cabello said late on Wednesday that 100 people died in the U.S. attack which removed President Nicolas Maduro from power on Saturday.

The fast-moving crisis in Yemen's south has caused a rift between Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, the two most powerful countries in the oil-rich Gulf, fracturing a coalition headed by Yemen's internationally recognised government which is battling the Iran-backed Houthis.

In a statement on Thursday, the coalition said the plane to Mogadishu from Somaliland was "under the supervision of UAE officers" and waited an hour before flying to a military airport in Abu Dhabi, but did not say if Zubaidi was still aboard.

A day earlier, the coalition said Zubaidi, leader of the Southern Transitional Council, had failed to board a flight to Riyadh for talks and his fate was unclear, clouding efforts to contain a military escalation that erupted last month.

There was no immediate comment from the UAE or the STC.

After al-Zubaidi's unexplained absence from the Riyadh talks, his group said he was overseeing military and security operations in the southern port city of Aden.

The plane from Mogadishu "turned off its identification system over the Gulf of Oman, then turned it back on 10 minutes prior to arrival at (Al Reef) military airport in Abu Dhabi," the coalition said.

The aircraft was of a type similar to those frequently used in conflict zones on the routes of countries such as Ethiopia, Libya and Somalia, it added.

Saudi Arabia and the UAE first intervened in Yemen after the Houthis seized the Yemeni capital of Sanaa in 2014.

The UAE joined the Saudi-backed coalition the following year in support of the internationally recognised government.

The STC was set up in 2017 with UAE backing and eventually joined the government coalition, which controls southern and eastern Yemen.

Last month STC forces suddenly seized swathes of territory, shifting the balance of power and pitting Saudi Arabia against the UAE.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 04:41:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/AM3XM7PCLJOMPLULLJ2A4WG4LE.jpg?auth=09a1c76b5617bc85295ced99f9fefce7e1aabc97615fc3e5d8651fa468d9bd59&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Salt Lake City shooting at church venue leaves two dead - local media report</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/salt-lake-city-shooting-church-venue-leaves-two-dead-local-media-report-2026-01-08/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 7 (Reuters) - A shooting in Salt Lake City, Utah, at a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints venue left two people dead and several wounded, local police told an ABC News affiliate late on Wednesday.

"We secured key subpoenas for billionaire benefactor Les Wexner, and the executors of the Epstein estate," Democratic Congressman Robert Garcia said in a statement in which he also thanked Republican U.S. Representative Anna Paulina Luna.

Republicans currently hold a narrow majority in the House of Representatives. The panel voted to approve the subpoenas on Wednesday.

Wexner has previously been in focus for his association with the late financier, who was entrusted with managing the billionaire's personal finances and served as the trustee of his charitable foundation.

Wexner, a former CEO and founder of Victoria's Secret-owner L Brands, has not been accused of criminal wrongdoing. The Wexner Foundation did not immediately respond to a request for comment late on Wednesday.

President Donald Trump's administration, under pressure from Trump's political base, has ordered the U.S. Justice Department to release files tied to criminal probes of Epstein , who was friends with Trump in the 1990s, in compliance with a transparency law passed by Congress.

Trump had earlier made efforts to keep the files sealed. Trump has said he had a falling-out with the disgraced financier long before Epstein's 2019 death in jail.

The Justice Department revealed in late December it has 5.2 million pages of Epstein files left to review. Epstein had ties with many politicians and influential figures from different walks of life.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 04:41:52 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/FYSR2YBCXNJ5PHJDDIHGNGW6TM.jpg?auth=baab13c9331c3b785374456a3ee06b1be9a45cc21c8b07d5c6dcb8d61143da97&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Bushfires rage in Australia’s southeast, authorities warn of 'catastrophic' Friday conditions</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/bushfires-rage-australias-southeast-authorities-warn-catastrophic-friday-2026-01-08/</link><description>SYDNEY, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Uncontrolled fires burned through bushland in Australia's Victorian state on Thursday, forcing communities to evacuate and authorities to warn of a "catastrophic" fire danger rating for Friday.

Amid temperatures forecast to exceed 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) in parts of the state, two bushfires of more than 3,000 hectares in size were raging near the towns of Longwood and Walwa. They have destroyed at least two structures and are expected to continue to spread on Friday as heat and wind pick up.

Friday's fire danger rating will be set at "catastrophic", the highest level, and both fires pose a real risk of loss of life and property, authorities said.

"Tomorrow is a very, very dire bushfire day in the state of Victoria," Country Fire Authority Chief Officer Jason Heffernan told a press conference.

Meteorologists have said conditions are on par with 2019, when bushfires destroyed wide swathes of southeastern Australia, killing 33 people, in what became known as the Black Summer.

Some 450 schools in Victoria are set to close on Friday.

For Thursday, total fire bans have been issued in several districts.

In New Zealand, the country's weather provider, MetService, also warned of record warm temperatures over the weekend as the heatwave moves across the Tasman Sea.

It has issued heat alerts for parts of the eastern coast of New Zealand and the north of the South Island.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 04:42:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>The last Russia-US nuclear treaty is about to expire. What happens next?</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/last-russia-us-nuclear-treaty-is-about-expire-what-happens-next-2026-01-08/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Even at the height of their Cold War nuclear rivalry, the United States and the Soviet Union thrashed out a series of treaties to keep the arms race from spiralling out of control.

Though they agreed on little else, leaders in Moscow and Washington saw value in talks - from 1969 until long after the Soviet collapse in 1991 - to create a stable and predictable framework limiting the size of their nuclear arsenals.

Now the last U.S.-Russia nuclear treaty, New START, is just weeks away from expiring on February 5, and what comes next is uncertain. The two countries, preoccupied by the war in Ukraine , have not held any talks on a successor treaty.

Russian President Vladimir Putin proposed in September that both parties should agree for a further 12 months to adhere to the New START limits, which cap the number of deployed nuclear warheads at 1,550 on each side.

U.S. President Donald Trump has yet to deliver a formal response, and Western security analysts are divided about the wisdom of accepting Putin's offer.

On the one hand, it would buy time to chart a way forward, while sending a political signal that both sides want to preserve a vestige of arms control.

On the other hand, it would allow Russia to keep developing weapons systems outside the scope of New START, including its Burevestnik cruise missile and Poseidon torpedo. Former U.S. defence planner Greg Weaver noted in a paper , opens new tab for the Atlantic Council that Russia had refused since 2023 to accept mutual inspections that would provide Washington with assurances that Moscow is still complying with the treaty.

Agreeing to Putin's proposal, Weaver added, would also send a message to China that the United States would not build up its strategic nuclear forces in response to China's fast-growing nuclear arsenal.

"This signal would likely undermine the prospects for bringing China to the arms control negotiating table, indicating to China that US forces will remain limited regardless of what China does."

Russia and the United States have estimated total inventories , opens new tab of 5,459 and 5,177 nuclear warheads respectively, according to the Federation of American Scientists. Between them they account for nearly 87% of all such warheads globally.

China, however, has accelerated its nuclear programme and now has an estimated 600 warheads. The Pentagon estimates it will have more than 1,000 by 2030.

While Trump has stated he wants to pursue "denuclearisation" with both Russia and China, Beijing says it is "unreasonable and unrealistic" to ask it to join three-way nuclear disarmament talks with countries whose arsenals are so much larger.

Further complicating the prospects for global arms control, Russia says the nuclear forces of NATO members Britain and France should also be up for negotiation - something those countries reject.

Nikolai Sokov, a former Soviet and Russian arms negotiator, said in a telephone interview that trying to forge a new multilateral nuclear treaty in this environment was "almost a dead end. It will take forever."

Sokov, a senior fellow at the Vienna Center for Disarmament and Non-Proliferation, said one alternative would be for Russia and the U.S. to work out a successor to New START that would include flexible warhead limits to take account of the Chinese build-up.

But a faster and more straightforward course would be for countries to focus on steps to reduce the significant risk of a nuclear war breaking out by accident. Right now, for example, only Russia and the U.S. have a 24/7 hotline for use in a nuclear crisis, whereas "no European capital, not even the NATO headquarters, can actually communicate with Moscow. There is no dedicated line," Sokov said.

"If parties at the same time also begin negotiations on arms control, that would be great. But you need to understand that the next treaty will be very, very complex... It will take time. So the number one priority is risk reduction and confidence building," he added.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:25:33 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5F65WS4KY5PEHD33O55O2ASICU.jpg?auth=e8940bb374a733d5eb693c676ffa58562c850f649d01eba16b1913ec373accd4&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Magnitude 5.5 earthquake strikes northern Peru, GFZ says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/magnitude-55-earthquake-strikes-northern-peru-gfz-says-2026-01-08/</link><description /><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:50:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Australia to hold wide-ranging inquiry into antisemitism after Bondi attack</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/australia-hold-public-inquiry-into-bondi-beach-attacks-2026-01-08/</link><description>SYDNEY, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Australia will hold a Royal Commission inquiry into the Bondi Beach mass shooting in which 15 were killed, the country's most powerful public inquiry, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on Thursday.

The mass shooting at a Jewish Hanukkah celebration at Sydney's famed Bondi Beach on December 14 shocked a country with strict gun laws and fuelled calls for tougher controls and stronger action against antisemitism.

Police say the alleged father and son perpetrators were inspired by the Islamic State militant group.

Albanese said the Royal Commission, a government inquiry which can compel people to give evidence, will be led by retired judge Virginia Bell.

It will consider the events of the shooting as well as antisemitism and social cohesion in Australia, and is expected to report its findings by December this year.

"This Royal Commission is the right format, the right duration and the right terms of reference to deliver the right outcome for our national unity and our national security," Albanese told a news conference on Thursday.

Albanese had initially resisted calls to set up a Royal Commission, saying the process would take years, which attracted criticism from Jewish groups and victims' families who urged him to reconsider.

"I've taken the time to reflect, to meet with leaders in the Jewish community, and most importantly, I've met with many of the families of victims and survivors of that horrific attack," Albanese said.

The government last month announced an independent review into law enforcement agencies that will assess whether authorities could have taken additional steps to prevent the attack.

That review, which will examine whether existing laws or information gaps stopped police and security agencies from acting against the alleged attackers, will now be folded into the Royal Commission, Albanese said. It is expected to report its findings in April.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 06:35:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/TIAWBY4Y55JXHKBJQ6PZCX3C5M.jpg?auth=6b41e0efe53777d498c40d0e242efc1693bdcddcaeeadb31a43a3a059ab23542&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Protesting French farmers bring tractors to Paris</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/protesting-french-farmers-bring-tractors-paris-2026-01-08/</link><description>PARIS, Jan 8 (Reuters) - French farmers blockaded sites in Paris on Thursday in protest against a sweeping trade deal the European Union is poised to sign with South American nations and other local grievances.

Farmers from the Coordination Rurale union had called for protests in Paris amid anger against a free trade agreement between the European Union and South American bloc Mercosur , which they fear may flood the country with cheap food imports, and the way the government is handling a cattle disease.

"We are between resentment and despair. We have a feeling of abandonment, like with Mercosur. We have been abandoned in favour of a space shuttle, an Airbus, or a car," Stephane Pelletier, the deputy president of the union in Vienne, in central France, told Reuters.

The protest comes days after the European Commission proposed making 45 billion euros of EU funding available earlier to farmers and agreed to cut import duties on some fertilizers in a bid to win over countries wavering in their support of Mercosur.

The deal is backed by countries such as Germany and Spain and the Commission appeared to have won Italy's backing, meaning it would have the votes needed to approve the trade accord with or without French support. A vote on the deal is expected on Friday.

Farmers are also demanding an end to cow culling prompted by a series of highly contagious lumpy skin disease , which they consider excessive and advocate for vaccination instead.

Dozens of tractors are parked on the Seine bank below the Eiffel Tower and blockading some accesses to the city centre from the Peripherique, such as at Porte d'Auteuil.

They made it to the city centre even though French police had imposed a strict ban.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 06:36:17 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Pacific Islands environment programme says US must follow formal exit process</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/pacific-islands-environment-programme-says-us-must-follow-formal-exit-process-2026-01-08/</link><description>SYDNEY, Jan 8 (Reuters) - A decades-old Pacific organisation for environmental protection said the United States must go through a formal process to withdraw its support, after President Donald Trump listed it among 66 entities the U.S. would leave because they "operate contrary to U.S. national interests".

On Thursday, Washington said it would withdraw from dozens of international and UN entities, including the world's key climate treaty and the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP).

Headquartered in Samoa, SPREP has supported dozens of low-lying island states to raise awareness at UN climate conferences about the threat to their survival from rising sea levels caused by climate change.

The organisation employs more than 150 staff across Fiji, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu and the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and runs programmes to reduce pollution, improve warning systems for severe weather and plan for disaster response to oil spills.

Sefanaia Nawadra, SPREP's director-general, said the U.S. contributed funding and technical expertise, but other partners were expected to help it continue its work.

"There is a formal process that the U.S. will need to follow to withdraw its membership of SPREP. They are a valued member of SPREP until that formal withdrawal process is completed," he said in a statement to Reuters.

"The impact of that will be determined as part of the details of the withdrawal process," he added.

According to SPREP's annual report, its annual budget comes primarily from five donor countries, Australia, Britain, New Zealand, France and the U.S.

China has also contributed $200,000 annually for several years.

A Pacific Islands government minister, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue, said the U.S. move to withdraw from the organisation would negatively impact U.S. influence in the region, where China is expanding ties.

Several Pacific Island nations face new hurdles to enter the United States.

Fiji, Vanuatu, Tuvalu and Tonga were listed on Wednesday among countries whose nationals must pay a costly visa bond to enter the U.S. from January 21.

Tonga was listed in December as facing entry restrictions from January 1.

U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau discussed migration in a call on Wednesday with Tonga Prime Minister Lord Fakafanua, he wrote on social media platform X.

The United States Embassy in Suva referred requests for comment to the State Department, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 06:36:33 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/JHACGJXUIJOUFM4TNRX6BYFOYM.jpg?auth=cf0a177f0dd1c9b51bdee738abe8eaf7337b0ef58e370ce5cf6ca61af4246baf&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>NASA considers rare early ISS crew return due to astronaut’s medical issue</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/science/nasa-is-considering-bringing-back-iss-crew-over-medical-issue-2026-01-08/</link><description>Jan 8 (Reuters) - NASA is considering a rare early return of an astronaut and its crew from the International Space Station (ISS) over an unspecified medical issue, hours after cancelling a planned spacewalk that had been scheduled for Thursday, the agency said.

A NASA spokeswoman said the astronaut, who she did not identify out of medical privacy, was in a stable condition on the orbiting laboratory.

"Safely conducting our missions is our highest priority, and we are actively evaluating all options, including the possibility of an earlier end to Crew-11’s mission," the spokeswoman said in a statement on Wednesday night.

Returning the four-person Crew-11 crew would be a rare consequence of a medical issue aboard the ISS, where astronauts typically live in six to eight-month rotations with access to basic medical equipment and medications for some types of emergencies.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 06:36:48 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/GXMZHNBUW5KKJHHJLD2M4W2HNQ.jpg?auth=97a44471d67d4ab2b461241b973222fd6a9d83c25d2423c298978b837df43a5e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Live: Venezuela says 100 killed in US attack, Maduro and wife injured</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260108-live-venezuela-100-killed-us-attack-maduro-wife-injured-tanker-oil</link><description>The US seized two Venezuela-linked oil tankers in the Atlantic Ocean on Wednesday, one sailing under Russia's flag, as part of President Donald Trump's aggressive push to dictate oil flows in the Americas and force Venezuela's socialist government to become an ally.

The US is escalating its blockade of vessels that are under sanctions and going to and from the South American country, a member of the OPEC oil producers group.

The White House also said it plans to roll back some of the sanctions Trump placed on Venezuelan oil in 2019 during his first term.

Caracas have not previously given a number for those killed, but the army posted a list of 23 names of its dead.

The US on Wednesday seized a Russian oil tanker in the North Atlantic that officials said was part of a shadow fleet carrying oil in violation of US sanctions.

The US military had pursued the Marinera tanker, formerly named the Bella-1, from the coast of Venezuela , capturing it shortly before seizing a second sanctioned tanker in the Caribbean.

US President Donald Trump announced plans to relax some sanctions so the US can oversee the sale of Venezuela’s petroleum worldwide.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 06:37:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/bc537e3c-e878-11f0-b00f-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26003257376817.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Lebanese army says it achieved state monopoly on arms in the south in 'effective and tangible way'</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/lebanese-army-says-it-has-achieved-goal-state-monopoly-arms-south-effective-2026-01-08/</link><description>BEIRUT, Jan 8 (Reuters) - The Lebanese army said on Thursday that it had achieved the goal of a state monopoly on arms in the country’s south in an "effective and tangible way", but said there was more work to be done to clear unexploded ordnance and tunnels in the area.

The army had set a year-end deadline to clear non-state weaponry from southern Lebanon, which borders Israel, before moving on to other areas of the country.

It said it had extended operational control over the south, except for areas still occupied by Israeli troops.

The statement did not mention Lebanese armed group Hezbollah, which fought a year-long war with Israel that ended in a 2024 ceasefire that stipulated that only Lebanon’s state security forces were allowed to carry arms.

A Lebanese security source told Reuters that the statement signalled that no group would be able to launch attacks from southern Lebanon.

Lebanon has faced growing pressure from the U.S. and Israel to disarm Hezbollah. Its leaders fear Israel could dramatically escalate strikes across the battered country to more quickly push Lebanon's leaders to confiscate Hezbollah's arsenal.

The U.S. removal of President Nicolas Maduro over the weekend sent Venezuela's defaulted debt soaring , while Trump's gamble last year to bolster Argentina's Javier Milei - an ideological ally - with a financial backstop of up to $40 billion paid off when Milei's party did well in crucial midterm elections .

In a different era, Trump's interventions may have sparked more of a backlash against brazen foreign meddling. And while not everyone in Latin America has welcomed his moves, reaction has been relatively muted at a time of a broader rightward political shift that investors say will boost the region's financial assets as they anticipate market-friendly changes.

"What we've found historically in Latin America is that things tend to go in waves and trends together," said Robert Koenigsberger, chief investment officer and managing partner at Gramercy. "It clearly seems that the current trend in Latin America is from left to right."

That perception, he said, has made investors more comfortable adding exposure as they focus on expected fiscal consolidation and regulatory reforms across the region.

The willingness to add exposure reflects a view that Latin America has moved as a block in regional cycles, with political shifts often reinforcing one another rather than playing out country by country.

Recent election wins in Ecuador , Argentina and Chile have seen a shift towards right-wing parties, underpinning rallies in regional equities, currencies and bonds over the past year.

Markets have also been buoyed by a general trend towards orthodox monetary policies and fiscal discipline, even in those countries led by leftist leaders like Brazil and Mexico.

Brazil's real and Mexico's peso were among the best performing emerging market currencies in 2025, while stocks in Colombia, Peru and Chile crowded the leaderboard for equity gains.

The ousting of Maduro was being taken positively by markets, said Graham Stock, an emerging markets strategist at RBC BlueBay.

"If anything, it reinforces our expectation that you're going to see a shift to more market-friendly governments in Latin America," he said.

After Latin America outperformed many emerging market peers last year, investors are watching a packed electoral calendar in 2026, which will include elections in Colombia, Peru and later in the year, Brazil.

Eileen Gavin, head of sovereign analysis at Verisk Maplecroft, said Colombia was particularly exposed to potential fallout from neighboring Venezuela as it heads to congressional elections in March and a presidential race in May.

Leftist Colombian President Gustavo Petro, who has clashed with Trump and was hit with U.S. sanctions back in October, cannot run for reelection.

"The pressure on the elections will be to tilt towards the right, and for bondholders, that's a risk upside," Gavin said, adding that Venezuela's turmoil could also weigh on Peru, Panama and Cuba through changes to migration and trade.

Peru's April 12 presidential election seems open, with at least 34 hopefuls registered to compete, and nearly half of voters without a preferred candidate, according to a poll late last year.

In Brazil, meanwhile, President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva currently leads most polls as he seeks a fourth term in office in a vote set for October .

Whoever wins, they will need to deal with Trump, set to be in office until January 2029.

"The more the U.S. puts pressure on these countries, the more they're likely to bend to American will, which, in the case of Latin America, means more pro-market policies," said Marko Papic, chief strategist at BCA Research.

Investors at Citi noted that the negative response to Trump's Venezuelan operation had been limited.

"In the short term, the action has not generated a rally around the 'Latin American flag', with many voices welcoming the move," Citi's Donato Guarino said in a note, adding that the bank remained long on Venezuelan credit.

Indeed, even some leftist presidents have sought to cut deals or appease Trump. Colombia's government has emphasized in recent days it would cooperate with Washington to fight drug trafficking.

"Leftist leaders are probably constantly looking over their shoulders," said Brian Jacobsen, chief economic strategist at Annex Wealth Management.

As regional governments seek investment that fits U.S. strategic priorities, multinational companies involved in infrastructure development and resource extraction were likely to be among the main beneficiaries, Jacobsen said.

BCA's Papic also predicted natural resources-linked assets should outperform, as well as banks.

"The Latin American private sector has deleveraged, and there is potential for financial institutions to benefit as well," he added.

Broadly constructive on Latin American assets, he warned that investor enthusiasm hinged on Washington avoiding an overly aggressive posture, however.

"It would be a mistake for the U.S. to rely purely on the heavy-handed approach," he said, arguing that it could yet trigger a backlash rooted in sovereignty concerns. "Hopefully the (Trump) administration can find some middle ground."</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 07:25:49 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/JQFIPFIECFJV7HQNHY5MTDJVJU.jpg?auth=216efb9858efd30b7ba3e0a00a41b9ff5c290f1e7c1416a1b31d87070a3b1d58&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>French farmers take tractor protest to Paris amid anger over Mercosur deal, cow cull</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260108-french-farmers-take-tractor-protest-to-paris-amid-anger-over-mercosur-deal-cow-cull</link><description>French farmers blockaded sites in Paris on Thursday in protest against a sweeping trade deal the European Union is poised to sign with South American nations and other local grievances.

Farmers from the Coordination Rurale union had called for protests in Paris amid anger against a free trade agreement between the European Union and South American bloc Mercosur , which they fear may flood the country with cheap food imports, and the way the government is handling a cattle disease.

"We are between resentment and despair. We have a feeling of abandonment, like with Mercosur. We have been abandoned in favour of a space shuttle, an Airbus, or a car," Stéphane Pelletier, the deputy president of the union in Vienne, in central France, told Reuters.

The protest comes days after the European Commission proposed making 45 billion euros of EU funding available earlier to farmers and agreed to cut import duties on some fertilizers in a bid to win over countries wavering in their support of Mercosur.

The deal is backed by countries such as Germany and Spain and the Commission appeared to have won Italy's backing , meaning it would have the votes needed to approve the trade accord with or without French support. A vote on the deal is expected on Friday.

Farmers are also demanding an end to cow culling prompted by a series of highly contagious lumpy skin disease, which they consider excessive and advocate for vaccination instead.

Dozens of tractors are parked on the Seine bank below the Eiffel Tower and blockading some accesses to the city centre from the Peripherique, such as at Porte d'Auteuil.

A U.S. immigration agent shot and killed a 37-year-old woman in her car in Minneapolis on Wednesday during an immigration enforcement surge, according to local and federal officials, the latest violence in President Donald Trump's nationwide crackdown on migrants.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey adamantly rejected the Trump administration's assertion that the agent fired in self-defense, saying video of the shooting directly contradicted what he called the government's "garbage narrative."

"They're already trying to spin this as an action of self-defense," a visibly angry Frey said at a press conference. "Having seen the video myself, I want to tell everybody directly - that is bullshit."

Frey blamed federal immigration agents for sowing chaos in the city, telling ICE: "Get the fuck out of Minneapolis." But he also urged residents to remain calm, as Democratic leaders in Minnesota, Washington and elsewhere called the ICE operation an unnecessary provocation that resulted in tragedy.

The Minnesota City Council identified the dead woman as Renee Nicole Good and said she was "out caring for her neighbors this morning and her life was taken today at the hands of the federal government." The council statement also demanded that ICE leave the city immediately.

As night fell, a crowd that appeared thousands strong gathered at the site of the shooting in a residential area of the city's Central neighborhood, aerial TV images showed. Candles placed at the site lighted up the winter night. Earlier, some protesters were met by heavily armed federal agents wearing gas masks who fired chemical irritants.

Opponents of Trump called for protests in several American cities, raising the risk that the killing could become a national flashpoint over his deployment of federal officers to Democratic-led cities and states.

Kristi Noem, secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, told a press conference that Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers were responding to a vehicle stuck in the snow when they were harassed by a "mob of agitators."

One of the protesters, later identified as Good, followed agents all day, Noem said. Good blocked their vehicle and refused orders to move out of the way, she said.

"She then proceeded to weaponize her vehicle, and she attempted to run a law enforcement officer over," Noem told a news conference, saying the car struck the officer.

She characterized that as domestic terrorism and said the act was under investigation by the FBI. State officials said they would launch their own investigation.

Videos of the shooting posted on social media and verified by Reuters raised doubts about the government's account. One widely shared video showed a maroon Honda SUV partially blocking the road. As the clip begins, the driver inches forward before stopping to let another car pass.

The driver, with the window down, then appears to gesture to an approaching pickup truck to go ahead as well. Instead, the truck stops, and two officers exit and approach the car on foot.

As one of the officers orders the driver out of the SUV and grabs at the door handle, the vehicle reverses briefly, and a third agent moves to the front of the car from the passenger side.

The driver then advances, steering to the right in what appears to be an effort to drive away from the officers. The agent in front of the car pulls his weapon, steps back and fires as the moving car's left front bumper comes close to his legs.

He fires three shots, with at least one shot after the car's front bumper had passed him. It was not clear from the video whether the car made contact with the officer, who stayed on his feet throughout the encounter.

After the shots, the car accelerates and crashes into parked cars and a utility pole.

Noem said the officer was experienced and "followed his training." He was treated by a doctor at a hospital and released.

Good's mother told the Minnesota Star Tribune that her daughter was "extremely compassionate," and she said Good was not the type of person to confront ICE agents.

"She's taken care of people all her life," her mother, Donna Ganger, told the newspaper. "She was loving, forgiving and affectionate."

The police chief said Good, who was married, was not a target of immigration operations. A witness whose home is nearby told CNN that Good lived in the neighborhood.

The Department of Homeland Security has said it is conducting the "largest DHS operation ever" in Minnesota with 2,000 officers deployed to arrest "fraudsters, murderers, rapists, and gang members." The surge follows allegations of wide-scale welfare fraud involving Somali immigrants, whom Trump has called "garbage." Noem said authorities had arrested 1,500 people in recent weeks.

Democratic Governor Tim Walz, who ran for U.S. vice president in the 2024 election won by Trump, also rejected the federal government's account and placed the blame for the shooting on the Trump administration. He told a press conference that he had put the National Guard on alert for possible deployment.

"What we are seeing is the consequences of governance designed to generate fear, headlines and conflict," Walz said. "...Today that recklessness cost someone their life."

In a social media post, Trump said the video showed the woman "violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer, who seems to have shot her in self defense."

The competing narratives highlighted U.S. political polarization, in which Trump's supporters enthusiastically endorse his version of events while opponents contend his assertions are often provably false.

Venus de Mars, a 65-year-old who lives near the site of the shooting, described seeing paramedics perform CPR on a woman collapsed next to a snowbank near the crashed car.

"There's been lots of ICE activity but nothing like this," de Mars said. "I'm so angry. I'm so angry, and I feel helpless."

The fraud allegations date to 2020 against some nonprofit groups in the Somali community that administer childcare and other social services programs.

At least 56 people have pleaded guilty since federal prosecutors started to bring charges in 2022 under Trump's Democratic predecessor, Joe Biden. Walz announced this week he would not seek a third term as governor, saying he did not have time both to address the fraud scandal and to campaign.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 07:45:42 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/L56UZZIG7BJ4ZD4SZJ33QPFUPI.jpg?auth=ca1a52392d84204a32a23b1197ae072bbdcf3ceabb814d74d633ec56bc08b2e8&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China against 'political disinformation' about US government email breach</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-against-political-disinformation-about-us-government-email-breach-2026-01-08/</link><description>BEIJING, Jan 8 (Reuters) - China on Thursday said it was against "politically motivated disinformation" in relation to reports of Chinese hackers targeting staff in United States congressional committees in an email breach.

Shahin Dehghan, a member of the police force in Malard county west of Tehran, "was martyred a few hours ago after being stabbed during efforts to control unrest", Fars news agency reported, adding that efforts to identify the perpetrators are underway.

Unrest broke out in Iran on December 28 after merchants in Tehran staged a protest against rising prices and the collapse of the rial, triggering a wave of similar actions in other cities.

The demonstrations have spread to 25 of Iran's 31 provinces, according to an AFP tally based on official statements and local media, and left dozens killed including from security forces.

It is the most serious protest movement in the Islamic republic since the 2022-2023 nationwide rallies sparked by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini , who was arrested for allegedly violating the strict dress code for women.

The demonstrations have yet to reach the scale of the 2022-2023 movement, let alone that of mass 2009 street protests that followed disputed elections.

But they have presented a new challenge for Iran's leadership against the backdrop of a biting economic crisis and on the heels of the 12-day war with Israel last June.

Several Iraq-based Iranian Kurdish opposition parties have called for a general strike on Thursday in Iran in support of the protests, one of the exiled parties told AFP.

The Komala party, an exiled Iraq-based Iranian Kurdish separatist group that Tehran considers a terrorist organisation, announced the strike on Wednesday.

"Seven Kurdish opposition parties have called for a general strike tomorrow Thursday," said Komala central committee member Hassan Rahmanpanah.

"The aim of this call is to demonstrate the unified support of the Kurdish people for the struggle and protests being waged by the Iranian people against the Islamic republic," he told AFP.

Rahmanpanah also accused the Iranian authorities of "brutal and criminal attacks" against demonstrators.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 07:47:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/a79c9282-eb37-11f0-b067-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/f6ac7cbadb34583479d554d2cad827ebc263e250.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China says it will release more details about extradition case from Cambodia</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-says-it-will-release-more-details-about-extradition-case-cambodia-2026-01-08/</link><description>BEIJING, Jan 8 (Reuters) - China said on Thursday it will release more information related to the extradition of an individual named Chen Zhi from Cambodia, without confirming the person's whereabouts or if he is the same person sanctioned by the U.S. and Britain, accused of operating large online scam centres.

Gambia's defence ministry last week put the death toll at seven and said more than 200 people could have been on board.

A total of 112 people had been rescued as of Wednesday, said Sima Lowe, public relations officer for Gambia's Immigration Department, and a senior defence ministry official who asked not to be named as he was not authorised to speak to press.

The migration route used by West Africans trying to reach Spain via the Canary Islands is one of the world's deadliest.

Survivors interviewed by Reuters after being released from hospital in Gambia this week said the boat had been heading for Europe.

Their stories highlight the risks and challenges faced by would-be migrants from West Africa who are often fleeing poverty, unemployment and lack of opportunities in their home countries.

"It's ... desperation driving me to risk my life, seeking better opportunities in Europe due to poverty and lack of prospects at home," said Sadibou Fatty, who described the journey as "traumatic".

"I survived the tragedy but lost friends and fellow passengers," he said, adding that, unlike many others on board, he knew how to swim.

Of the 39 dead, 24 were recovered in Gambian territory, while 15 were recovered in Senegalese territory, the defence official said.

Passengers on board included citizens of Gambia, Senegal, Guinea, Mali, Ivory Coast, Burkina Faso and Sierra Leone, the official said.

"My friends in Europe inspired me to take the 'back way,'" said Kajali Camara, another survivor, referring to irregular immigration routes via small boats.

"They're supporting their families back home, and I wanted a better life too," he said.

Gambia's government said it intercepted more than 2,700 would-be migrants in 2025.

During the first 11 months of 2025, irregular migration into the European Union along the West African route fell 60%, according to the EU's border agency Frontex.

The drop is largely due to stronger prevention efforts by departure countries working with EU member states, Frontex has said.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 08:32:04 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump says US oversight of Venezuela could last years, NYT reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/trump-says-us-oversight-venezuela-could-last-years-nyt-reports-2026-01-08/</link><description>Jan 8 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said that "only time will tell" how long the United States will maintain oversight of Venezuela in an interview published by the New York Times early on Thursday.

When asked by the Times if it would be three months, six months, a year or longer, Trump said: "I would say much longer."

"We will rebuild it in a very profitable way," Trump said of Venezuela , adding, "we're going to be using oil, and we're going to be taking oil. We're getting oil prices down, and we're going to be giving money to Venezuela, which they desperately need."

Trump added the U.S. was "getting along very well" with the interim president Delcy Rodriguez's government in Venezuela right now, according to the Times.

Trump on Tuesday unveiled a plan to refine and sell up to 50 million barrels of Venezuelan oil that had been stuck in Venezuela under U.S. blockade, in a further sign that Washington is coordinating with the Venezuelan government since capturing President Nicolas Maduro in a raid last weekend.

“They’re giving us everything that we feel is necessary,” Trump said, referring to the Venezuelan government.

Dual-use items are goods, software or technologies that have both civilian and military applications. They include certain rare earth magnets that power motors in car parts such as side mirrors, speakers and oil pumps. They play an even bigger role in EVs.

"Civilian users will not be affected," He Yadong, a commerce ministry spokesperson, told reporters. "China has always been committed to the stability and security of global production and supply chains," he added.

He did not say whether rare earth elements were covered by the restrictions, and did not comment when asked about reports by state media that the commerce ministry was weighing whether to further tighten rare‑earth export licences to Japan.

China has an export control list of around 1,100 dual-use items and technologies that manufacturers require a licence for to ship overseas, wherever the end user may be. That list contains at least seven categories of medium and heavy rare earths. It has, however, not specified which items may be affected by the ban on exports to Japan.

Ties between Beijing and Tokyo have deteriorated since Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said in November that a Chinese attack on Taiwan threatening Japan's survival could trigger a military response, a remark that Beijing said was "provocative".

"Exports to Japan for military purposes, that could find a military application, and all other end-uses contributing to the enhancement of Japan's military capabilities are prohibited," He said.

"The objective of halting Japan's re-militarisation and nuclear ambitions is entirely legitimate, justified and lawful," he added.

Japan's foreign ministry on Tuesday, the day Beijing announced the ban, said it strongly protested the measures and demanded that China withdraw them.

Last month, Japan's cabinet approved a record spending package for the fiscal year starting in April that includes a 3.8% increase in the country's annual military budget to 9 trillion yen ($58 billion).</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 09:30:08 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/MIS3J3ZQRJKV7NQ7AVJ5DOXA3Q.jpg?auth=01fac781bdd2ff1e49f2d0eac3c004dc17e60256993583cfbdedc7b5f15657f7&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Turkey ready to help end conflict in Syria's Aleppo, parliament speaker says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/turkey-ready-help-end-conflict-syrias-aleppo-parliament-speaker-says-2026-01-08/</link><description>ANKARA, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Turkey said on Thursday it is ready to help Syria if asked after the Syrian army independently launched a "counter-terrorism" operation in Aleppo, where fierce fighting broke out in recent days between government forces and Kurdish fighters.

Turkey's Defence Ministry said at a briefing that the Aleppo operation was "carried out entirely by the Syrian army," implying no Turkish involvement.

The clashes in the northern Syrian city on Tuesday and Wednesday killed at least four people and drove thousands of civilians from their homes, with Washington reported to be mediating a de-escalation.

Ankara is the strongest foreign backer of the interim administration in Damascus and maintains a substantial military presence in northern Syria.

"If Syria requests assistance, Turkey will provide the necessary support," the ministry said.

The violence - and statements trading blame over who started it - signaled that a stalemate between Damascus and Kurdish authorities that have resisted into the central government was deepening and growing deadlier.

Turkey deems the Kurdish fighters terrorists and has threatened a military operation if they do not integrate with Syrian authorities.

"We are following the developments in Syria hour by hour. It is an extremely fragile environment," Turkish Parliament Speaker Numan Kurtulmus said at a separate briefing in parliament in Ankara.

"We are ready to provide all kinds of support for the immediate end of the clashes in Aleppo and the establishment of peace and stability," he said.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 09:31:02 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russian strikes on Ukraine's Dnipropetrovsk leave one million without water and heat</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260108-russian-strikes-on-ukraine-s-dnipropetrovsk-leave-one-million-without-water-and-heat</link><description>Russian strikes on Ukraine overnight left more than one million people in the Dnipropetrovsk region without water supplies or heating, a Ukrainian minister said Thursday, as temperatures dipped below freezing.

As in previous winters, Russia has intensified its strikes on Ukraine's energy sites , leading to heating and water outages in what Kyiv and its allies call a deliberate strategy to wear down the civilian population.

The large-scale Russian drone attack also knocked out power in the Zaporizhzhia region, leaving thousands without electricity or heating, the state grid operator Ukrenergo said late Wednesday.

"Repair work continues in Dnipropetrovsk region to restore heat and water supply for over a million subscribers," Restoration Minister Oleksiy Kuleba wrote on social media.

The Ukrainian air force said Russia attacked with 97 drones, with 70 downed by air defence systems but 27 striking various locations, without elaborating.

Dnipropetrovsk's critical energy infrastructure was damaged in the attack, according to its military head Vladyslav Gaivanenko.

"The situation is difficult. However, as soon as the security situation allows, energy workers will begin restoration work," he posted on Telegram.

In Zaporizhzhia, the electricity supply was restored to "key facilities" but most consumers were still without power, according to its governor, Ivan Fedorov.

Kyiv has responded to the long-running targeting of its energy grid with strikes on Russian oil depots and refineries, seeking to cut off Moscow's vital energy exports and trigger fuel shortages.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 09:32:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/82680770-ec6e-11f0-a20f-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-07T215622Z-2080856433-RC2KWIAIRL67-RTRMADP-3-UKRAINE-CRISIS-ATTACK-POWER-ZAPORIZHZHIA.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Colombian President Petro defends national security in the face of Trump's threats</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/colombian-president-petro-defends-national-security-in-the-face-of-trump-s-threats</link><description /><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 09:52:32 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/843565ba-ec74-11f0-bf8b-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260108-090954-091151-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UK helped US military to seize sentenced oil tanker on way to Russia</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/uk-helped-us-military-to-seize-sentenced-oil-tanker-on-way-to-russia</link><description /><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 09:52:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/2e41c054-ec74-11f0-82e9-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260108-090718-090920-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'Very challenging: Lack of stability, security' amid decade-long civil war in Yemen</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/very-challenging-lack-of-stability-security-amid-decade-long-civil-war-in-yemen</link><description /><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 09:52:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/72f77514-ec73-11f0-8d12-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260108-080638-081309-CS-01.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>American plans for Venezuelan oil</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/american-plans-for-venezuelan-oil</link><description /><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 09:52:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/845d2740-ec73-11f0-9566-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260108-090453-090654-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>ICE officer kills a woman in Minneapolis</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/ice-officer-kills-a-woman-in-minneapolis</link><description /><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 09:52:39 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/04e53afc-ec73-11f0-9ace-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260108-090223-090419-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>ICE fatal shooting of Minnesota woman puts US on edge</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/ice-fatal-shooting-minnesota-woman-puts-us-edge-2026-01-08/</link><description>MINNEAPOLIS, Jan 8 (Reuters) - The fatal shooting of a 37-year-old Minnesota mother by a U.S. immigration agent has put the city of Minneapolis and much of the United States on edge, with the potential of becoming another flashpoint in a polarized country.

State and federal officials offered starkly different accounts of the shooting, in which an unidentified officer killed U.S. citizen Renee Nicole Good in her car on Wednesday while immigration officers were carrying out what federal officials have called the "largest DHS operation ever" by the Department of Homeland Security.

With 2,000 federal officers deployed across the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and Saint Paul, thousands of people gathered in Minneapolis to protest the shooting, while demonstrations were called in New York, Chicago, Seattle, Phoenix, Orlando, and Columbus, Ohio.

The Minnesota operation, which includes U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, is part of Republican President Donald Trump's nationwide crackdown on migrants and a politically charged investigation into fraud allegations against some Minnesota nonprofit groups in the Somali community.

At least 56 people have pleaded guilty since federal prosecutors under the previous Democratic administration of Joe Biden, started investigating childcare and other social service programs in the Somali community.

Trump's DHS secretary, Kristi Noem, labeled Wednesday's incident as an act of domestic terrorism, saying an experienced officer followed his training with an act of self-defense.

Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, both Democrats, immediately disputed the federal government's account and blamed Trump for what they called an unnecessary provocation by deploying federal law enforcement.

"It was not 'domestic terrorism.' It was state sanctioned violence. A family will forever live with the pain caused by the admin's reckless and deadly actions," Democratic U.S. Representative Ilhan Omar, a Somali-American representing Minneapolis and a frequent target of Trump's political barbs, said on X.

The competing narratives highlight the political polarization of the U.S., where Trump's supporters enthusiastically endorse his version of events and opponents contend his assertions are often provably false.

Video showed masked officers approaching Good's car, which was stopped at an unusual angle on a Minneapolis street. The car then backs up and pulls away, briefly driving in the direction of the officer who opened fire at close range.

The video did not appear to show contact or any sign that the officer was wounded, though Noem said he was treated at a hospital and released, while Trump said on social media the woman "ran over the ICE Officer."

Trump administration officials called the incident part of a pattern of anti-Trump demonstrators endangering ICE officers, but critics say they saw a woman attempting to evade masked and armed men and the vehicle's front wheels turned away from the shooter.

While Trump and Noem drew immediate conclusions that the officer was the subject of an intentional attack, border czar Tom Homan was more cautious.

"It would be unprofessional to comment on what I think happened in that situation. Let the investigation play out and hold people accountable based on the investigation," Homan told CBS News.

The FBI and Minnesota state officials are investigating.

The ICE officer would be protected from being charged by local prosecutors if he was acting within the scope of his official federal duties, and any legal case would likely come down to whether he reasonably feared for his life, said Caren Morrison, a law professor at Georgia State College of Law. She said cases involving vehicles tended to favor officers because a car could be considered a deadly weapon.

Minnesota law allows the use of deadly force by an officer only if an objectively reasonable officer would believe that doing so was necessary to protect the officer or others from immediate death or serious harm. Federal law has a similar standard.

Minnesota civil rights attorney Paul Applebaum said it was unclear who, if anyone, would prosecute the officer. “The possibility of the officer being prosecuted by Pam Bondi are slim to none,” Applebaum said of the U.S. attorney general, a Trump loyalist. He said if state officials tried to charge the officer it would set up a constitutional conflict between state and federal government.

Federal agents are generally immune from state prosecution for actions taken as part of their official duties.

Courts have increasingly narrowed the ability to sue federal officers for damages for civil rights violations to the point it was “almost an empty exercise,” Applebaum said.

The Minneapolis City Council identified the dead woman as Good and said she was "out caring for her neighbors this morning and her life was taken today at the hands of the federal government."

She was the mother of a 6-year-old boy, the Minnesota Star Tribune reported, citing the boy's grandfather.

Good's mother told the Minnesota Star Tribune that her daughter was "extremely compassionate," and she said Good was not the type of person to confront ICE agents.

"She's taken care of people all her life," her mother, Donna Ganger, told the Star Tribune. "She was loving, forgiving and affectionate."</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 10:26:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/FQF3ZLXKY5IOBM6EFT5Z4X47GU.jpg?auth=ea8bede7c292dfb5c9151a83cdf2dc87ef36228899c29a08aaf1974e635ec893&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Swiss families file legal complaint over New Year's bar fire</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/swiss-families-file-legal-complaint-over-new-years-bar-fire-2026-01-08/</link><description>GENEVA, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Families of those who died or were injured in a New Year's Eve fire in the bar of a Swiss ski resort have filed a legal complaint to the Swiss prosecutor's office, a lawyer for a group of victims confirmed to Reuters on Thursday.

"Each family filed a complaint and joined the proceedings as a plaintiff. These applications were accepted (by prosecutors)," Romain Jordan, a Geneva-based lawyer, said in response to emailed questions.

He did not specify the target of the legal complaint, adding only that it was "against all those responsible, without exception".

The criminal investigation into the Crans-Montana fire only includes the bar's owners who are suspected of crimes including homicide by negligence. Questions remain about the fire and the safety procedures in place.

Moscow has intensified its attacks on Ukraine's energy system as Ukrainian forces fend off Russian advances on the battlefield and Kyiv faces U.S. pressure to secure a peace deal .

Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Oleksiy Kuleba said repairs were still ongoing to return heat and water supplies to more than 1 million consumers in the industrialised region of Dnipropetrovsk.

The energy ministry said nearly 800,000 consumers in the region remained without electricity early on Thursday but that power had been restored to the other affected region, Zaporizhzhia.

Zaporizhzhia governor Ivan Fedorov said it was the first time in "recent years" that his region had faced a total blackout, but that officials had been quick to respond.

"A difficult night for the region. But 'light' always wins," he wrote on Telegram on Thursday.

Ukraine's energy ministry said eight mines across the Dnipropetrovsk region had faced blackouts, but that workers had been evacuated.

Water supplies to the strategic city of Pavlohrad and nearby areas could take up to a day to repair, said Mykola Lukashuk, head of the Dnipropetrovsk regional council.

Ukraine is facing an impending cold snap this week, with Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko warning late on Tuesday that it would likely compound disruptions to power and heating.

The energy ministry added on Wednesday that weather conditions had already cut power to some settlements in at least four regions.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 10:26:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5Y6UQGQ47FJCRJM775BJA2DFQE.jpg?auth=628f0617e75ee9f9a5e536ad67d7263b926c3b06b4f8e31c61144147068ad0c9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran warns suppliers against overpricing or hoarding goods</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-warns-suppliers-against-overpricing-or-hoarding-goods-2026-01-08/</link><description>DUBAI, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Iran's president warned domestic suppliers against hoarding or overpricing goods, state media reported on Thursday, as Tehran rolls out high-stakes subsidy reforms during nationwide protests against economic hardship.

"People should not feel any shortage in terms of goods' supply and distribution," Masoud Pezeshkian said, calling upon his government to ensure adequate supply of goods and monitoring of prices across the country.

Iran's subsidy reform is meant to favour consumers over importers by removing preferential currency exchange rates that allowed importers to access foreign currency at rates cheaper than those available to ordinary Iranians.

According to the policy, Iranians will be given about $7 a month to purchase basic goods in select grocery stores. The price of some basic goods such as cooking oil or eggs has significantly increased since the policy was announced.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 10:27:03 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/FNAFQ57A7NNMHOK3AXWWVVUG6U.jpg?auth=f31b80f332b45e87a9a6a80270b80ac6d65a33a466d96773c79191c68efe0820&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Pope Leo urges Catholic cardinals to create more inclusive Church</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/pope-leo-urges-catholic-cardinals-create-more-inclusive-church-2026-01-08/</link><description>VATICAN CITY, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Pope Leo met on Thursday with the world's Catholic cardinals as part of a two-day summit, urging the senior clerics to shun divisions in the 1.4-billion-member Church and focus on attracting new believers.

Leo also signalled a desire to press ahead with the reforms of the late Pope Francis, who battled with conservative cardinals while trying to make Catholicism more inclusive by welcoming gay Catholics and discussing women's ordination .

Beginning the closed-door summit on Wednesday, Leo said the Church would only grow if it could attract people with a message of God's love for everyone, according to remarks released by the Vatican.

"Only love is trustworthy; only love is credible," said the pope. "While unity attracts, division scatters."

Massimo Faggioli, an Italian academic at Trinity College Dublin, who follows the Vatican, said Leo was "working to convince the cardinals that they need to work collectively together to do what the Catholic people want them to do".

"Leo is cautious, but I think he will continue on Pope Francis' trajectories," said Faggioli. "I don't think he will go back."

Francis, who led the Church for 12 years, died in April . Leo, formerly the U.S. Cardinal Robert Prevost, was elected the new pope in May.

One hundred and seventy of the world's 245 cardinals were attending the summit, which ends on Thursday, the Vatican said.

The clerics have been asked to refrain from publicly discussing their meetings in order to allow for frank conversations, spokesman Matteo Bruni said.

Leo, opening his first full year as Church leader, asked the cardinals on Wednesday for advice on what priorities he should focus on for the next two years.

British Cardinal Timothy Radcliffe urged his peers to shun divisions. If they quarrel with one another, he said, "we shall be of no use to the Holy Father".</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 10:27:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/VEI2F6KRMJNHVLFLGCSCT6W6U4.jpg?auth=e56df8bf5246a2490839f0bbbed242220623b181b6ff615ea0d3f92fabe80b64&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israeli military says it hit Gaza launch site following failed rocket fire</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-military-says-it-hit-gaza-launch-site-following-failed-rocket-fire-2026-01-08/</link><description>Jan 8 (Reuters) - Israel's military said on Thursday it had carried out a targeted strike on a rocket launch site near Gaza City after identifying a failed launch, as questions mount over when the next phase of the Gaza ceasefire will begin.

The military said the projectile did not cross into Israeli territory and that the launch site was struck shortly after the attempt was detected.

It accused Hamas of violating the ceasefire twice in the past 24 hours. A source from the Palestinian militant group told Reuters it was checking the allegation.

Israel is awaiting the handover of the final body due under the current stage of the truce. An Israeli official close to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel will not move to the next phase of the ceasefire until Hamas returns the remains of the last Israeli hostage still held in Gaza.

Israel has yet to open the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt, which is another condition of the U.S.-backed plan, saying it will only do so once the remains are returned.

Despite the ceasefire, Israel has continued to carry out air strikes and targeted operations across Gaza. The Israeli military said it views "with utmost severity" any attempts by militant groups in Gaza to attack Israel.

Israel and Hamas have accused each other of major breaches of the deal and remain far apart on the more difficult steps envisaged for the next phase.

Hamas has refused to disarm and has been reasserting its control as Israeli troops remain entrenched in about half the territory. Israel has said it would resume military action if Hamas is not disarmed peacefully.

Israel and Palestinian armed groups have been engaged in repeated rounds of fighting since the war erupted in October 2023.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 10:27:47 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>ICE fatal shooting of Minnesota woman puts US on edge</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/ice-fatal-shooting-minnesota-woman-puts-us-edge-2026-01-08/</link><description /><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 10:28:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Israel strikes Gaza launch site after failed rocket fire</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-military-says-it-hit-gaza-launch-site-following-failed-rocket-fire-2026-01-08/</link><description /><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 10:29:02 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Trump says US oversight of Venezuela could last years</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/trump-says-us-oversight-venezuela-could-last-years-2026-01-08/</link><description>Jan 8 (Reuters) - The United States could oversee Venezuela and control its oil revenue for years, President Donald Trump said in an interview published on Thursday.

During what the New York Times described as a wide-ranging, two-hour interview, the paper said Trump also appeared to lift a threat to take military action against Venezuela's neighbour Colombia. Trump invited Colombia's leftist leader, whom he had previously called a "sick man", to visit Washington.

"Only time will tell" how long the United States will oversee Venezuela, Trump said. When asked by the newspaper if it would be three months, six months, a year or longer, Trump said: "I would say much longer."

"We will rebuild it in a very profitable way," Trump said of Venezuela , where he sent troops to seize President Nicolas Maduro in a night raid on January 3.

"We're going to be using oil, and we're going to be taking oil. We're getting oil prices down, and we're going to be giving money to Venezuela, which they desperately need."

Trump added that the U.S. was "getting along very well" with the government of the interim president, Delcy Rodriguez, a longstanding Maduro loyalist who had served as the ousted leader's vice president.

The Times said Trump declined to answer questions about why he had decided not to give power in Venezuela instead to the opposition, which Washington had previously considered the legitimate winner of an election in 2024.

Trump on Tuesday unveiled a plan to refine and sell up to 50 million barrels of Venezuelan oil that had been stuck in Venezuela under U.S. blockade.

"They’re giving us everything that we feel is necessary," Trump said, referring to the Venezuelan government.

He declined to comment when asked if he had personally spoken to Rodríguez.

"But Marco speaks to her all the time," he said, referring to Secretary of State Marco Rubio. "I will tell you that we are in constant communication with her and the administration."

The Times said its reporters were permitted to sit in during a phone call between Trump and Colombia's President Gustavo Petro, provided the contents of the call were off the record.

In a post on social media, Trump said: "It was a great honor to speak with the President of Colombia, Gustavo Petro, who called to explain the situation of drugs and other disagreements that we have had. I appreciated his call and tone, and look forward to meeting him in the near future."

Petro described the call, his first with Trump, as cordial.

On Sunday Trump had threatened to carry out military action against Colombia, calling Petro "a sick man who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States, and he's not going to be doing it very long".

The Times said Trump's phone call with Petro lasted about an hour and "appeared to dissipate any immediate threat of U.S. military action".

Trump has said the United States intends to "run" Venezuela. U.S. officials have indicated their plan for now is to exert influence without a military occupation.

Venezuela, with the world's biggest proven oil reserves, has become impoverished in recent decades, with eight million people fleeing abroad in one of the world's biggest migration crises.

Washington and the Venezuelan opposition have long blamed corruption, mismanagement and brutality by the ruling Socialist Party. Maduro blamed the economic damage on U.S. sanctions.

Several senior U.S. officials said on Wednesday that the United States needs to control Venezuela's oil sales and revenues indefinitely in order to restore the country's oil industry and rebuild its economy.

Trump is scheduled to meet with the heads of major oil companies at the White House on Friday to discuss ways of raising Venezuela's oil production. Representatives from the top three U.S. oil companies, Exxon Mobil, ConocoPhillips and Chevron (XOM.N) , opens new tab , (COP.N) , opens new tab , (CVX.N) , opens new tab , would be present, according to a source familiar with the planning.

The companies, all of which have experience in Venezuela, have declined to comment.

U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in an interview with CNBC on Wednesday that he spoke with the CEOs of all three companies immediately after Maduro was seized, and expected them to engage in rehabilitating Venezuela's oil sector.

"Are they going to put billions of dollars into building new infrastructure in Venezuela next week? Of course not," he said. "But they want to be productive advisers and helpers in that process."</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 10:50:48 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/T54AVALDRNIMZFDNJ6KPMGCJ24.jpg?auth=fc5d007ff3e252575cd716eed4f5ef4a431a30e119a27f0ad8658ef255441f64&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>German president says US is destroying world order</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/german-president-says-us-is-destroying-world-order-2026-01-08/</link><description>BERLIN, Jan 8 (Reuters) - German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier has strongly criticised the U.S. foreign policy under President Donald Trump and urged the world not to let the world order disintegrate into a "den of robbers" where the unscrupulous take what they want.

In unusually strong remarks, which appeared to refer to actions such as the ousting of Venezuela 's President Nicolas Maduro at the weekend, the former foreign minister said global democracy was being attacked as never before.

Although the German president's role is largely ceremonial, his words carry some weight and he has more freedom to express views than politicians.

Describing Russia's annexation of Crimea and the full-scale invasion of Ukraine as a watershed, Steinmeier said the U.S. behaviour represented a second historic rupture.

"Then there is the breakdown of values by our most important partner, the USA, which helped build this world order," Steinmeier said in remarks at a symposium late on Wednesday.

"It is about preventing the world from turning into a den of robbers, where the most unscrupulous take whatever they want, where regions or entire countries are treated as the property of a few great powers," he said.

Active intervention was needed in threatening situations and countries such as Brazil and India must be convinced to protect the world order, he said.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 10:51:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/Q5JTRRPIOJPCFI37QN5N5B2NLE.jpg?auth=27ba10d809b9d9ed3bbfa6b4ba63668261e4300fe6995603ba408225d24148cc&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US Senate to vote on reining in Trump on Venezuela</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/us-senate-vote-reining-trump-venezuela-2026-01-08/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 8 (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate is due to consider a resolution on Thursday that would block President Donald Trump from taking further military action against Venezuela without congressional authorization, and backers said the measure could pass in a close vote.

Days after U.S. forces captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro in a dramatic military raid in Caracas, senators will vote on the latest in a series of war powers measures introduced since the administration ramped up military pressure on the country with attacks on boats off its coast in September.

Republicans have blocked all of the measures, but the last vote was just 49-51 , as two senators from Trump's party joined Democrats in backing a resolution in November. Administration officials had told lawmakers at that time that they did not plan regime change or strikes on Venezuelan territory.

After Maduro's capture, some lawmakers have accused the administration of misleading Congress, including Democrats publicly and some Republicans behind the scenes.

"I spoke to at least two Republicans today who did not vote for this resolution previously who are thinking about it," Senator Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican who is co-sponsoring the resolution, told a news conference ahead of the vote.

"I can't guarantee you how they vote, but at least two are thinking about it, and some of them are talking publicly about their misgivings over this," Paul said, speaking beside Democratic Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, another leader of the resolution.

He did not identify the Republicans. Trump's party holds a 53-47-seat majority in the Senate.

Senate passage would be a significant victory for the lawmakers who have been pushing the war powers issue.

But to become law, the resolution would have to pass the Republican-led House of Representatives and survive an expected Trump veto, which would require two-thirds majorities in both chambers.

The lawmakers acknowledged the hurdles, but said some Republicans may be wary of a prolonged and expensive campaign of regime change in Venezuela. Trump on Wednesday said on his Truth Social website that he wanted the U.S. military budget to increase to $1.5 trillion from $1 trillion.

Kaine noted that U.S. forces have been striking Venezuelan boats for months, and mentioned Trump's statement that the U.S. would "run" Venezuela as well as the seizures of Venezuelan oil, saying: "This is not a surgical arrest operation by any stretch."

The U.S. Constitution requires any president to obtain Congress' approval before launching a prolonged military operation.

Senators who oppose the war powers resolution say the seizure of Maduro is a law enforcement operation, not a military action. Maduro faces trial in a U.S. court on drug and guns charges, to which he has pleaded not guilty. They also say that Trump is within his rights as commander-in-chief to launch limited military actions he feels are necessary for national security.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 11:21:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LCNWMLPW75KJHGKXPFW5EONUGY.jpg?auth=76b63496e007cd2635eb9c8495ee78d1896960e83442a82477618fc63903a39d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Cubans brace for more hardship as US pressure on Venezuela chokes off oil</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/cubans-brace-more-hardship-us-pressure-venezuela-chokes-off-oil-2026-01-08/</link><description>MATANZAS, Cuba, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Cubans braced for a deepening economic crisis after the United States seized two more Venezuela-linked oil tankers on Wednesday, a move that threatens to sever a critical energy lifeline for the Communist-run island just days after U.S. forces captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro .

In the port of Matanzas where oil tankers dock, shuttered gas stations and long fuel lines reflected mounting supply shortages. The latest U.S. action is stoking fears that already-frequent, hours-long power cuts will worsen.

"Now I think that with this situation, things will get worse, because now they won't let oil come," William Gonzalez, a Matanzas resident, told Reuters. "Before oil came from Venezuela and Russia, now it will only come from Russia...So that's one less source of oil, so the country must get a little worse."

In a dramatic escalation of its pressure campaign, the U.S. military on Wednesday seized the Russian-flagged tanker 'Marinera' in the Atlantic near Iceland after a two-week pursuit, U.S. officials said.

The seizure, which a senior Russian lawmaker decried as "outright piracy," marks the fourth such interception since Washington imposed a blockade on all sanctioned vessels going in and out of Venezuelan waters in mid-December.

Earlier on Wednesday, the U.S. Coast Guard had intercepted another Venezuela-linked tanker, the 'M Sophia,' northeast of South America.

For Cuba, the loss of Venezuelan oil is devastating. Between January and November of last year, Venezuela sent an average of 27,000 barrels per day (bpd) to the island, covering roughly 50% of Cuba's oil deficit, according to shipping data and documents from Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA.

"The repercussions are not going to be very good. Venezuela was one of the countries that helped us the most with energy and fuel," said Mario Valverde, a business owner in Havana.

While Mexico has become an "important supplier," President Claudia Sheinbaum said on Wednesday that Mexico is not sending more oil to Cuba than it has historically.

The aggressive U.S. posture has been met with a mix of anger and grim determination by some Cubans.

"We are very dissatisfied with (U.S. President Donald) Trump's attitude toward Maduro, because that is forcing a country to submit by force," said resident Manuel Rodriguez. "If there are more blackouts, we will have to endure the blackouts as Cubans and resist until the end."</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 11:23:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/APO3O2NMRJINFHRAY5FN67JNYU.jpg?auth=17d76a6878461e375c4139e75707eecfe0aa35cf14f1e572da3c813803010b87&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Malaysian prosecutors end graft case against country's deputy prime minister</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/malaysian-prosecutors-end-graft-case-against-countrys-deputy-prime-minister-2026-01-08/</link><description>KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Malaysian prosecutors said on Thursday that they have put an end to their corruption case against Deputy Prime Minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, saying that there was insufficient evidence to continue.

The move by the Attorney General's Chambers came more than two years after graft charges against Ahmad Zahid, the leader of a key partner in Malaysia's ruling coalition, were dropped to allow prosecutors to conduct further investigations.

The Kuala Lumpur High Court in September 2023 granted Ahmad Zahid a discharge not amounting to an acquittal on 47 charges involving criminal breach of trust, corruption, and money laundering related to funds connected to his charitable foundation.

The 2023 decision raised questions about the government's commitment to fighting corruption cases, with Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim's party dependent on the support of Ahmad Zahid's United Malays National Organisation to maintain its parliamentary majority.

The AGC said on Thursday that it has decided that no further action will be taken in relation to the case, adding that the decision was in line with the power and authority of the Attorney General under the Federal Constitution and related laws.

"After examining all the materials and new evidence obtained from the results of the further investigations and research, the AGC, based on the assessment and consideration of the prosecution, found that the available evidence is insufficient to support continuation of the prosecution for all the charges in question," it said in a statement.

The decision was made "taking into account the interests of justice, integrity of the prosecution process, as well as the need to ensure certainty and accuracy in the criminal justice system," it added.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 11:23:17 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/Y2TAMNY5SVLMHLFCZJ7G43OEBE.jpg?auth=8df7daa056ee28bbcddde0346a419c5ac109397ee17d0231713a181eb7517886&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Prince Group founder linked to online scams extradited to China, says CCTV</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/china-extradited-prince-group-founder-chen-zhi-state-media-reports-2026-01-08/</link><description>BEIJING, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Prince Group founder Chen Zhi, a Chinese national, has been extradited from Cambodia to China, where he is wanted on suspicion of fraud and operating illegal casinos, Chinese national broadcaster CCTV reported on Thursday.

The Prince Group of businesses, headed by the tycoon, has been sanctioned by the U.S. and Britain, and is accused of operating large online scam centres that used trafficked workers to defraud victims globally.

Reuters was not able to reach Prince Group on Thursday.

China has been actively cooperating with countries such as Cambodia to effectively combat cross-border telecom and fraudulent phone scams, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning told reporters on Thursday.

"China is willing to strengthen law enforcement cooperation with neighbouring countries, including Cambodia, to safeguard the safety of people's lives and property... and cooperation among regional countries," she said, when asked about the extradition case. She did not name Chen directly.

China will release a wanted list of key members of the "Chen Zhi criminal group" and urges fugitives to surrender at once, CCTV said.

Cambodia's Interior Ministry said on Wednesday that it had extradited three Chinese nationals , including Chen, to China.

Cambodia said the extraditions were in response to a request from Beijing and reflected cooperation "in combating transnational crime".

The Cambodian ministry statement did not provide details on Chen or the alleged crimes but said his Cambodian citizenship had been revoked.

Chen was seen on footage released by CCTV being escorted off a China Southern Airlines plane by three Chinese SWAT officers, handcuffed and dressed in blue with his head covered in a black cloth, a video released by CCTV showed.

An officer removed the cloth to identify him before he was escorted off the tarmac with his head bowed, the clip showed.

Beijing's Public Security Bureau had set up a special task force to investigate individuals involved with Cambodia's Prince Group in 2020, calling the group a "mega cross-border online gambling syndicate", a Chinese court document released in 2022 showed.

The ministry had also instructed other local authorities to make arrests in collaboration with the task force from Beijing, according to the document.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 11:23:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump faces rare Republican opposition in Congress</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/trump-faces-rare-republican-opposition-congress-2026-01-08/</link><description /><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 11:24:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>US Senate to vote on reining in Trump on Venezuela</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/us-senate-vote-reining-trump-venezuela-2026-01-08/</link><description /><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 11:24:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Trump faces rare Republican opposition in Congress</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/trump-faces-rare-republican-opposition-congress-2026-01-08/</link><description /><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 11:24:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>How do shadow fleets work?

Deadly clashes erupted this week between Syrian government forces and the Kurdish-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) after the two sides failed to reach a year-end deadline to merge the Kurdish fighters into the main Damascus military.

"Turkey supports Syria's fight against terrorist organisations," the official told reporters, saying Ankara was "closely monitoring" developments in the north.

"Should Syria request assistance, Turkey will provide the necessary support," he said, echoing a long-standing offer by Ankara to extend military support to its allies in Damascus's new Islamist government.

Turkey has long been hostile to the Kurdish SDF that controls swathes of northeastern Syria, seeing it as an extension of the banned Kurdish militant group PKK, seeing it as a major threat along its southern border.

It has repeatedly pushed for implementation of a March 2025 deal under which the Kurds' semi-autonomous administration and military would be integrated into the Syrian military and security apparatus.

The Kurds are pushing for decentralised rule, an idea which Syria's new authorities have rejected, blocking the deal's implementation causing tensions that have occasionally erupted into clashes.

On Wednesday, the Syrian military began shelling two neighbourhoods in Aleppo after ordering all Kurdish fighters to leave the area following clashes that forced thousands of civilians to flee.

Parliamentary speaker Numan Kurtulmus said Turkey wanted to help end the clashes.

"Our aim is to bring an immediate end to the kind of clashes currently seen in Aleppo ... and for a truly pluralistic, democratic regime that meets the needs of Syria's people to be established rapidly. Turkey is ready to provide all necessary support for this," he told reporters.

He also warned against any involvement by Israel in the ongoing dispute between Damascus and the SDF, echoing frequent concerns expressed by Turkish officials that Israel could exploit the unrest to further its own interests.

Israel on Thursday denounced Damascus's operation "against the Kurdish minority in Aleppo", describing it as "grave and dangerous" for Syria's minorities, hiking concern it could weigh.

"Let me be very clear: Israel does not love the Sunni Arabs in Syria, nor does Israel love the Kurds of Syria," Kurtulmus said.

"We know the fundamental aim of some countries in the region is to fragment and divide this region further, to turn people against each other on ethnic, religious, and sectarian grounds and even turn them into enemies."</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 11:25:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/5853a4b2-ec7d-11f0-bd25-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26007608951129.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iranians protest for 12th day as Kurdish opposition calls for general strike</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/iranians-protest-for-12th-day-as-kurdish-opposition-calls-for-general-strike</link><description /><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 11:25:16 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/b0a91bca-ec77-11f0-9f16-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260108-091220-091420-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Greenland should hold talks with the US without Denmark, opposition leader says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/greenland-should-hold-talks-with-us-without-denmark-opposition-leader-says-2026-01-08/</link><description>COPENHAGEN, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Greenland should hold direct talks with the U.S. government without Denmark, a Greenlandic opposition leader told Reuters, as the Arctic island weighs how to respond to President Donald Trump's renewed push to bring it under U.S. control.

Trump has recently stepped up threats to take over Greenland, reviving an idea he first floated in 2019 during his first term in office.

Greenland is strategically located between Europe and North America, making it a critical site for the U.S. ballistic missile defence system. Its rich mineral resources also fit Washington's goal of reducing dependence on China.

The island is an autonomous territory of the Kingdom of Denmark. It has its own parliament and government, but Copenhagen retains authority over foreign affairs and defence.

"We encourage our current (Greenlandic) government actually to have a dialogue with the U.S. government without Denmark," said Pele Broberg, the leader of Naleraq , the largest opposition party and the most prominent political voice for Greenland's independence.

"Because Denmark is antagonising both Greenland and the U.S. with their mediation."

Naleraq, which strongly advocates a rapid move to full independence, doubled its seats to eight in last year's election, winning 25% of the vote in the nation of just 57,000.

Although excluded from the governing coalition, the party has said it wants a defence agreement with Washington and could pursue a "free association" arrangement - under which Greenland would receive U.S. support and protection in exchange for military rights, without becoming a U.S. territory.

All Greenlandic parties want independence but differ on how, and when, to achieve it.

Greenlandic Foreign Minister Vivian Motzfeldt said Greenland could not conduct direct talks with the U.S. without Denmark because it is not legally allowed to do so.

"We must respect the law, and we have rules for how to resolve issues in the Kingdom," she told Sermitsiaq daily late on Wednesday.

The Danish and Greenlandic governments did not immediately reply to requests for comment on Broberg's remarks.

The comments come ahead of a planned meeting between the Danish and Greenlandic foreign ministers and U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio next week to address tensions between NATO allies.

Motzfeldt said it was important to set Greenland's relationship with Washington on a steady course.

"My greatest hope is that the meeting will lead to a normalisation of our relationship," she told Sermitsiaq.

Rubio appears not to favour a military operation, according to France's foreign minister . But others in the Trump administration say the option is on the table.

"We are going to make sure we defend America's interests," U.S. Vice President JD Vance told Fox News in an interview aired late on Wednesday. "And I think the president is willing to go as far as he has to make sure he does that."</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 11:43:03 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/U7YOFTT6MRJU3EJX7RUW2IFXAM.jpg?auth=59819779d169eaa6cb73524cd8a28f6a4d34613d01ea39369f61c694cbf140b1&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Can the ICE agent who shot a Minneapolis woman be prosecuted?</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/can-ice-agent-who-shot-minneapolis-woman-be-prosecuted-2026-01-08/</link><description>NEW YORK, Jan 8 (Reuters) - A U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent shot and killed a 37-year-old woman in her car in Minneapolis on Wednesday amid President Donald Trump's federal crackdown.

Local officials rejected the Trump administration's explanation that it was self-defense.

Here is a look at the potential legal repercussions.

The officer fired "defensive shots" after a "violent rioter" attempted to run over officers, a spokeswoman of the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement, adding that the officer had feared for his life.

Online videos of the shooting verified by Reuters cast doubt on the government's narrative, however.

One video showed an officer approach an SUV and order the driver out and grab at the door handle while another officer appeared in front of the car.

The driver moves forward while turning away from the officers, and the one in front pulls his weapon, steps back and fires three shots.

It was not clear if the car made contact with the officer, and he fired at least one shot after it had already passed him.

Minnesota’s use-of-force law permits state police to use deadly force only if reasonable officers would believe doing so was necessary to protect themselves, or others, from death or serious harm.

Federal law has a similar standard, permitting use of deadly force when a reasonable officer would have probable cause to believe a person posed an immediate threat of death or serious injury.

Federal agents are generally immune from state prosecution for actions taken as part of their official duties. Immunity only applies when an officer's actions were authorized under federal law and were necessary and proper.

If Minnesota charged the agent, he could seek to move the case to federal court and argue he is immune from prosecution.

To prevail, the state would have to show the actions were outside his official duties or were objectively unreasonable or clearly unlawful.

If a judge ruled the officer was immune, the case would be dismissed and the state would not be able to charge him again.

Federal prosecutors can charge law enforcement officers for fatal shootings, but the bar is very high and charges are rare.

Prosecutors would need to show the officer knew his conduct was unlawful or acted with reckless disregard for the constitutional limits of his authority, which is difficult to prove in court.

The Trump administration has so far defended the officer's actions.

In addition to federal immunity, the agent could argue that his actions were reasonable under the Constitution, that he acted in self-defense or that he did not act with intent to harm or kill the woman.

Federal officers are immune from civil lawsuits unless their conduct clearly violated a clear constitutional right.

This legal standard, known as qualified immunity, has become a highly effective tool for shielding police officers accused of using excessive force, a series of Reuters investigative stories found in 2020.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 11:43:17 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/2NCQXLZ32JLXLCNB22W3EJIDNI.jpg?auth=b959dc526cfc37950aea3546c45f2a259962484896af61f514384eea59477d22&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'Any great power can do as it pleases': US operation in Venezuela 'a clear violation of int'l law'</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/any-great-power-can-do-as-it-pleases-us-operation-in-venezuela-a-clear-violation-of-int-l-law</link><description /><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 11:43:48 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/88308bc4-ec81-11f0-a6f8-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260104-175959-185611-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Live: Macron sets out foreign policy priorities in speech to French ambassadors</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260108-live-macron-sets-out-foreign-policy-priorities-speech-french-ambassadors</link><description>The French president 's address to ambassadors is expected to dwell at length on ongoing efforts to secure a ceasefire in Russia's war on Ukraine, days after Macron pledged to put French boots on the ground to safeguard Ukraine's security in the event of a peace deal.

A Russian Foreign Ministry statement said "militaristic declarations" by a coalition of pro-Ukraine Western governments were becoming increasingly dangerous.

Russia was responding for the first time to a meeting of the "coalition of the willing" in Paris on Tuesday at which Britain and France signed a declaration of intent on the future deployment.

French President Emmanuel Macron said it could involve sending thousands of French troops. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said it paved the way for a legal framework whereby "British, French and partner forces could operate on Ukrainian soil, securing Ukraine's skies and seas and regenerating Ukraine's armed forces for the future".

Russia "warns that the deployment of Western military units, military facilities, depots and other infrastructure on Ukrainian territory will be classified as foreign intervention, posing a direct threat to the security of not only Russia but also other European countries," the statement from Moscow said.

"All such units and facilities will be considered legitimate combat targets of the Russian Armed Forces."

It added: "The fresh militaristic declarations of the so-called coalition of the willing and the Kyiv regime constitute a veritable 'axis of war'.

"The plans of these participants are becoming increasingly dangerous and destructive for the future of the European continent and its inhabitants, who are also being forced by Western politicians to finance these aspirations out of their own pockets."

Russia, which staged a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, says it was forced to intervene in order to prevent Ukraine from being absorbed into NATO and used as a launchpad to threaten Russia. It has consistently said it will never accept the stationing of Western forces there.

Ukraine and its allies accuse Moscow of waging an imperial-style war aimed at seizing the territory of its neighbour, of which it now holds nearly 20%. They say Ukraine needs firm security guarantees as part of any peace settlement in order to prevent another Russian invasion in future.

The United States has ruled out sending its own troops to Ukraine, but its special envoy Steve Witkoff said at Tuesday's meeting in Paris that President Donald Trump "strongly stands behind" security protocols aimed at deterring future attacks on Ukraine.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 12:48:21 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/Y4OP2TMAKVODFCVMBYCPWVJ6SQ.jpg?auth=e02ddabef9a05c04ffd8c74c83aa3d68eb7ae8ef12321a03d91913eeb6e2691b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Syrian army orders evacuations as heavy fighting grips Aleppo's Kurdish areas</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/syrian-army-orders-evacuations-heavy-fighting-grips-aleppos-kurdish-areas-2026-01-08/</link><description>Jan 8 (Reuters) - The Syrian army clashed with fighters from the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in parts of Aleppo on Thursday and ordered residents to evacuate, accusing the SDF of using Kurdish-majority areas to launch attacks, according to Syrian state media.

The army released more than seven maps identifying areas it said would be targeted in strikes, urging residents to leave immediately for their safety. Its operations command announced a curfew in the neighbourhoods of Sheikh Maqsoud and Ashrafieh from 3 p.m. (1200 GMT).

The fighting, which erupted on Tuesday , has driven thousands of civilians from their homes and killed and wounded several people, state media reported.

SDF said their fighters were engaged in intense clashes with Damascus-aligned factions and auxiliaries near Aleppo's Syriac neighbourhood, adding that they had inflicted what they described as heavy losses.

The violence and competing claims over responsibility highlight a deepening and increasingly deadly standoff between Damascus and Kurdish authorities who have resisted integrating into the central government.

The Kurdistan Regional Government's Prime Minister Masrour Barzani said he was deeply concerned by attacks on Kurdish neighbourhoods in Aleppo, warning that targeting civilians and attempts to alter the area's demography amounted to what he described as ethnic cleansing.

Barzani called on all sides to exercise restraint, protect civilians and pursue dialogue.

The SDF accused Damascus-aligned factions of threatening unlawful attacks on civilian areas, saying public warnings of shelling could amount to forced displacement and war crimes under international humanitarian law.

More residents were seen leaving Sheikh Maqsoud and Ashrafieh through designated safe corridors.

The SDF are a U.S.-backed alliance that controls much of northeastern Syria and has been Washington's main local partner in the fight against Islamic State.

Kurdish-led authorities established a semi-autonomous administration in those areas and parts of Aleppo during Syria's 14-year war and have resisted fully integrating into the Islamist-led government that took power after former President Bashar al-Assad was ousted in late 2024.

Damascus reached a deal with the SDF last year that envisaged full integration by the end of 2025, but progress has been limited, with both sides accusing the other of stalling.

The United States has sought to mediate, holding meetings as recently as Sunday, though those talks ended without tangible results.

Diplomats warn that failure to integrate the SDF into Syria's army risks further violence and could draw in Turkey, which has threatened military action against Kurdish fighters it regards as terrorists.

Turkey said on Thursday it is ready to help Syria if asked after the Syrian army independently launched what it called a "counter-terrorism" operation in Aleppo.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 12:48:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/3MXPRLEHKJMYPA7CL4PS3KMMSU.jpg?auth=e1d9dc291c599f47005ddfe981d6419f66319d396013bd717fda1c13ea6f0113&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Spanish Catholic Church to compensate sex abuse victims under agreement with government</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/spanish-catholic-church-compensate-sex-abuse-victims-under-agreement-with-2026-01-08/</link><description>MADRID, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Spain's Catholic Church, reeling from a clergy sexual abuse scandal, agreed with the government on Thursday to compensate victims of abuse whose cases have expired under the statute of limitations or where the perpetrator has died.

"Today we are settling a debt and doing justice to the victims. We are moving from decades of silence and oblivion to fair reparation paid by the Church," Justice Minister Félix Bolaños said of the deal signed by his ministry and the Church.

The abuse scandal surfaced after an investigation by El Pais newspaper in 2021 uncovered more than 1,200 alleged cases, echoing similar scandals in the Catholic Church in the United States, Ireland and France.

A 2023 report by Spain's human rights ombudsman estimated hundreds of thousands of victims over decades, based on a survey of 8,000 people. It urged the creation of a state fund and accused the Church of failing to cooperate and trying to "minimise the phenomenon." More than 700 people shared their cases with the ombudsman up to 2024.

An investigation commissioned by the Spanish Catholic Church identified around 2,000 victims by the end of 2023.

Under the agreement signed on Thursday, the ombudsman will review each case and propose compensation — financial, moral, psychological or restorative — based on the victim's request, Bolaños said.

Previously, victims could apply directly to the Church, but many were reluctant. The Church said Thursday it had already paid around 2 million euros ($2.34 million) to victims.

The new process is for victims who do not want to apply directly to the Church. Reparations proposed by the ombudsman must be agreed upon by both the victim and the Church’s Assessment Commission.

"American dominance in the Western Hemisphere will never be questioned again," US President Donald Trump told reporters shortly after the raid.

He underscored the point with a reference to the Monroe Doctrine, a 19th-century creed that put world powers of the time – notably European colonists – on notice to respect American hegemony in the region.

But the message may have been most pointedly directed at China , which for more than two decades has been developing close ties with Latin American countries – including billions invested in the Venezuelan oil sector.

The US raid came just days after China conducted two days of live-fire drills near Taiwan in a massive show of force. But a TV report broadcast in the week before Christmas hinted that China may also be weighing its military options in South America.

China’s CCTV state television aired a December 19 segment on wargames, simulated military engagements for training purposes. One scene depicted theoretical confrontations in Latin America, including simulated battles near Mexico, Cuba and the Caribbean Sea.

China currently has a minimal military presence in the region, which is far removed from Beijing's traditional sphere of influence in Asia. But several observers wondered if these conflict scenarios signaled that its global ambitions are evolving.

Venezuela has historically served as China’s “gateway into Latin America”, says Amalendu Misra, a specialist in international relations and the Global South at Lancaster University. With Maduro's ouster, Beijing has lost its key ally in the Latin American country where it has invested the most, which Misra says came as a “shockwave” to Beijing.

China has loaned more than $100 billion to Venezuela since the early 2000s. “That’s nearly 39% of all the loans Beijing allocated to the region,” Misra points out.

Former Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez lauded the deals he made with China back in 2006, describing them as a “ Great Wall ” against US hegemony in the region.

The close relations between Beijing and Caracas persisted even after Chavez’s death in 2013 . One of the last people Maduro saw, just hours before being ousted by US forces, was none other than China’s special envoy to Venezuela, Qiu Xiaoqi, who was on a visit to reaffirm the strength of ties between the two countries.

The fate of their $100 billion Venezuelan investment must now be worrying Chinese leaders, although a large portion of the debt has already been repaid in raw materials. China’s dealings with Venezuela are modelled on the “Angola system” – that is, countries receive funding and are repaid in commodities but namely oil, says Mario Esteban, director of the Centre for East Asian Studies at the Autonomous University of Madrid.

While precise figures are not publicly available, the Belgian think tank Beyond Horizon estimates that Caracas still owed Beijing more than $12 billion as of December.

As the United States looks to capitalise on – and possibly even administer – Venezuela’s vast oil resources, it may find itself negotiating with China.

Beijing will need to have “a seat at the table” when decisions are being made about how and when to repay Venezuela’s creditors, says Günther Maihold, a Latin America specialist at the Free University of Berlin.

Trump has said that American oil companies will be able to continue selling Venezuelan oil – including to China – once they have rebuilt the country’s oil sector. But Beijing may not agree to this arrangement, says Carlotta Rinaudo, a China specialist at the International Team for the Study of Security Verona. “I wouldn't be so sure, to be honest, that China would buy oil sold by US oil giants,” she says.

Beijing also had its sights set on other resources: Venezuela possesses the world's largest untapped reserves of gold as well as oil. The China National Petroleum Corporation, for example, had already established several joint ventures with local companies to explore Venezuela's subsoil.

Sino-Venezuelan cooperation on vast infrastructure projects has also led to some 400,000 Chinese to settle in Venezuela, working primarily in the restaurant sector.

From the Chinese perspective, Rinaudo says, a longtime partner is now essentially defunct. And after investing so much, “they cannot afford to lose all that money".

The United States is unlikely to want to share Venezuelan resources with rival China, which Rinaudo says may create a new source of competition – and friction – between the two countries.

Beijing has reason to be wary. The US operation in Venezuela represents a newly aggressive version of the Monroe Doctrine adapted to the Trump era – namely, the desire to rid Latin America of all other foreign influences. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated as much after Maduro’s ouster, saying the United States would not allow the oil industry in Venezuela to be controlled by “adversaries”, namely Russia, China or Iran.

“This is the Western Hemisphere. This is where we live. And we’re not going to allow the Western Hemisphere to be a base of operations for adversaries, competitors, and rivals of the United States, simple as that,” he said .

And Esteban is not convinced that China’s recent wargaming indicates any kind of real shift in global focus, saying it is unlikely that Beijing would be willing to commit troops to a theatre so far away. He says the CCTV report was primarily aimed at a domestic audience, to demonstrate that China thinks like a global military power.

But Venezuela might just be the first of China's headaches in Latin America, with the United States already exerting pressure on Colombia and Cuba as well as Mexico.

This pressure could be one way “to discourage them from doing business with China”, notes Esteban.

While Colombia and Cuba are not economically important to Beijing, Mexico is a different story: Beijing has already invested heavily in Mexican supply chains as well as its transport infrastructure.

“All the ports are owned by the Chinese. Most of the roads are owned by the Chinese,” Misra says.

The automobile industry gets a lot of its supplies from China, especially for cars and trucks, which are then mainly exported to the United States, Maihold adds.

Realistically, China has limited options for protecting its interests in the region. By removing Maduro, Washington also managed to signal to other Latin American powers that China cannot protect them if they choose Beijing over Washington.

On the ground, Maduro’s capture was a failure of Chinese intelligence, Rinaudo says, noting that China “had no idea" of the US plans.

But it was also a failure of matériel, with Beijing’s air-defence system proving ineffective. “Its missile system didn't work. All the radars that the Chinese had installed are in Venezuela – didn't work," Misra says.

If China were to respond to US actions aggressively, Esteban predicts that cyber-attacks would be the weapon of choice. But he says the most likely scenario is that Beijing will launch a vast diplomatic charm offensive in the region.

It would be easy to play on bitter memories of past US actions in Latin America by “emphasising sovereignty, emphasising the UN charter – emphasising these core principles” of international law, Esteban says.

“They know their history … and there is a very long history of US intervention."</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 12:50:33 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/c3ab4b44-eb19-11f0-95f7-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/060126-maduro-xi-jinping-m.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Zelenskiy says US security guarantees document set to be finalised with Trump</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/zelenskiy-says-us-security-guarantees-document-set-be-finalised-with-trump-2026-01-08/</link><description>KYIV, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Thursday the text of a bilateral security guarantee between Kyiv and Washington was "essentially ready" to be finalised with U.S. President Donald Trump.

As a cornerstone of any post-war settlement, Ukraine has sought strong guarantees which commit the U.S. and other Western allies to come to Ukraine's aid if Russia invades again.

Ukrainian and U.S. envoys, joined by a coalition of Ukraine's allies, have been negotiating in Paris this week to iron out remaining disagreements in a peace framework Washington is seeking to thrash out with Kyiv before presenting it to Russia. On Tuesday, the U.S. endorsed the idea of providing security guarantees for Ukraine for the first time.

"The bilateral document on security guarantees for Ukraine is now essentially ready for finalisation at the highest level with the president (Trump)," Zelenskiy said in a post on X.

He said Wednesday's meetings of Ukrainian and U.S. representatives in Paris addressed "complex issues" from the framework under discussion to end the nearly four-year war , and that Kyiv had presented its solutions for these.

The Ukrainian president called for more pressure on Russia after further Russian missile attacks on energy infrastructure on Wednesday, arguing that the credibility of future security guarantees must be demonstrated by a response at this stage.

Under Trump, Washington has shifted its position from an outright supporter of Kyiv to a broker leaning on both sides to agree a peace, and will try to get Moscow to sign up to the deal it negotiates with Ukraine.

Zelenskiy has said that while the framework is 90% agreed, thorny issues remain around control of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant as well as Russian demands on Kyiv to cede a strategically significant slice of territory in eastern Ukraine that Moscow has been unable to capture in almost four years of war.

"We understand that the American side will engage with Russia, and we expect feedback on whether the aggressor is genuinely willing to end the war," Zelenskiy wrote on X.

He said the teams also discussed documents dealing with Ukraine's post-war recovery and economic development.

The World Bank last year estimated the cost of Ukraine's reconstruction and recovery at $524 billion, while the Trump administration has sought to leverage economic benefits and privileged post-war access for the U.S. in Ukraine.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 13:41:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WYXZ2WLANRPRPIHN3FHOSU2VUA.jpg?auth=31449e188ae40985121faf78dbbf44ba82dcce1da52aff9589a47ccf2cf6e92a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russian-bound tanker hit by drone in Black Sea, maritime sources say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/russian-bound-tanker-hit-by-drone-black-sea-maritime-sources-say-2026-01-08/</link><description>ISTANBUL, Jan 8 (Reuters) - A Russia-bound oil tanker suffered a drone attack in the Black Sea that prompted it to request Turkish coastguard assistance and divert from its course, according to a notice by Lloyd's List Intelligence and a separate maritime security source on Thursday.

Maritime data specialist Lloyd's List Intelligence said the Palau-flagged Elbus vessel "experienced an unmanned marine-vehicle and drone attack" on Wednesday targeting its engine room, and that no injuries were reported among the 25 crew, nor any pollution.

The security source described it as a drone attack, based on an assessment. It was unclear who or what was behind the incident.

In late November, shipping insurance rates rose after Ukrainian naval drones hit two Russia-bound tankers in the Black Sea, incidents that prompted Moscow to threaten retaliation and Ankara to urge calm. Another vessel, Russian-flagged, said in early December that it too was attacked in the sea, but Kyiv denied any role in that incident.

The Security Service of Ukraine did not respond when asked about the incident involving Elbus.

Turkey's transport ministry was not immediately available to comment. The Russian embassy in Ankara was not immediately available to comment.

The Black Sea is crucial for grain, oil and oil products shipping and its waters are shared by Turkey, Russia, Ukraine, Bulgaria, Georgia and Romania.

The vessel was headed on Wednesday to the Russian port of Novorossiysk from Singapore, the Lloyd's notice said.

Marinetraffic data showed the Elbus had settled a few kilometres off the northern Turkish port of Inebolu on Thursday, after having diverted from its earlier eastward course across the Black Sea.

It dropped anchor at Inebolu anchorage under its own power, Lloyd's said.

Calls to the Inebolu harbour master did not get through.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 13:43:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>France releases Russian man wanted in US for cyberhacking, lawyer says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/france-releases-russian-man-wanted-us-cyberhacking-lawyer-says-2026-01-08/</link><description>MOSCOW, Jan 8 (Reuters) - A Russian basketball player who was arrested in France last year and threatened with extradition to the United States has been released and flown back to Moscow, his lawyer was quoted as saying on Thursday.

Daniil Kasatkin was detained at a Paris airport on June 21 at the request of the U.S., which suspected him of being part of a hacking network using ransomware against U.S. companies and federal institutions. He denied the accusation.

Russian state news agency RIA quoted his lawyer, Frederic Belot, as saying Kasatkin had been released late on Wednesday and was already back in Moscow. Belot has previously said that Kasatkin had no computer expertise and that his device had been hacked by cybercriminals.

Kasatkin's release came two weeks after the Kremlin said Russia was in contact with France over the case of Laurent Vinatier , a French researcher who was sentenced in 2024 to three years in a Russian prison for violating the country's "foreign agent" laws.

A French journalist raised Vinatier's case with Russian President Vladimir Putin at a press conference last month, and Putin said he would look into it.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov later said that Moscow had made an unspecified "offer" to Paris, and the ball was in France's court.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 13:43:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Lebanon central bank seeks to recuperate embezzled funds to bolster liquidity, governor says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/lebanon-central-bank-seeks-recuperate-embezzled-funds-bolster-liquidity-governor-2026-01-08/</link><description>BEIRUT, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Lebanon's central bank will seek the repayment of public funds embezzled by at least one former central bank official and by lawyers and commercial bankers, to help guarantee its liquidity, Central Bank Governor Karim Souaid said on Thursday.

Souaid did not name Riad Salameh , the former central bank governor whose 30-year term ended in disgrace amid investigations into whether he embezzled more than $300 million between 2002 and 2015.

Instead Souaid told reporters that the central bank had filed a criminal complaint against an unnamed former official of the central bank, a former banker and a lawyer over alleged illicit enrichment through misuse of public funds. He said the operations were carried out through four offshore shell companies in the Cayman Islands that he did not name.

Souaid said the bank would become a primary plaintiff in the state's investigation against Forry Associates, suspected of receiving commissions from commercial banks and transferring them out of the country. Forry is controlled by Salameh's brother, Raja. Both Raja and Riad Salameh deny wrongdoing.

The pair are under investigation in France, Germany, Switzerland and other countries over the alleged embezzlement. Souaid said he would travel to France to meet with the investigators this month "to exchange highly sensitive information held by the French authorities."

Souaid would not say how many people in total were suspected of involvement in the scheme or the full sum now thought to have been embezzled.

"Our mission is to pursue these individuals and entities, seek their conviction, and seize their movable and immovable assets and the proceeds of their illicit activities to ensure liquidity for the rightful owners, first and foremost the depositors," he said.

A Lebanese source familiar with the central bank's new measures said they were prompted by lots of evidence - both new material uncovered in the central bank's records and other evidence made available from external investigators. The source said the bank's leadership suspected Salameh was aided in his scheme by other members of the institution.

Salameh was detained for nearly 13 months over the alleged financial crimes committed during his tenure, and was released last September after posting a record bail of more than $14 million. He remains in Lebanon under a travel ban.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 14:26:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WHLA24SHVFNSPB2L3AWW7LZBOU.jpg?auth=295396e00a0bca96dafbc265a6bd7c7c373c107bc2c6afcbea8c6b454315879a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Explainer: Why are French farmers driving their tractors into Paris?</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/why-are-french-farmers-driving-their-tractors-into-paris-2026-01-08/</link><description>PARIS, Jan 8 (Reuters) - French farmers have brought tractors to central Paris and blocked roads across the country to demand government action to address numerous grievances.

Here are some of the issues that have prompted the protest movement and initial responses at government and European Union levels.

Farmers in France, the EU's biggest agricultural producer, say they struggle to make a profit due to high costs and excessive red tape while facing unfair competition from countries within and outside the EU that do not have to meet the same strict production standards.

A proposed trade deal between the EU and the South American bloc Mercosur has been a focus of discontent among farmers in France and across Europe. They say the arrangement would lead to cheap imports of South American commodities, notably beef, ethanol and sugar, that do not meet EU standards.

The agreement , which could be signed next week, includes a significant section on agriculture with the establishment of import quotas for certain farm products from Mercosur countries - Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay - either duty free or at reduced levies.

On the other hand, the deal would also give EU farmers increased access to South American markets, which could boost exports of products such as wine, cheese and olive oil.

Even though Paris has won significant last-minute concessions, including safeguard measures on sensitive farm products such as beef and sugar, the government and farmers still oppose the deal, claiming imports should be produced with the same standards as EU produce.

French Agriculture Minister Annie Genevard said France would continue to fight against the deal in the European Parliament, where it also needs to be approved.

Some French farmers, mainly in the south of the country, also blame the government for its handling of the lumpy skin disease affecting cattle, including the culling of entire herds when the highly contagious virus is detected.

Lumpy skin disease, mainly spread by biting insects, causes fever and painful skin lumps, weakens animals and reduces milk output.

The government, which said that the disease could wipe out about 10% of the national herd if left unchecked, has launched a campaign to vaccinate all cattle in affected regions.

On the environment, farmers take issue both with EU subsidy rules and what they see as France's overcomplicated implementation of EU policy.

They say France applies tougher restrictions than other EU member states, including a ban on a pesticide for sugar beets and taking a highly bureaucratic approach to water use and fertiliser pollution.

Green policies are seen as contradicting goals to become more self-sufficient in the production of food and other essential goods in the light of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and amid trade tensions with the United States and China.

Farmers see an excessive regulatory burden as contributing to a decline in French agricultural output, exports and income.

France may post its first annual trade deficit for food and farm goods in nearly 50 years in 2025.

Grain growers, previously the wealthiest producers in French farming, have lost money in the past three years as ample global supply has depressed prices while costs for energy and fertilisers have risen.

Pushed by France, the EU on Wednesday agreed to cut duties on imported fertilisers and exempt them from a carbon tax scheme to avert more cost rises.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 14:27:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/OBBPU35U2FONTBCZSVJLC4CBHY.jpg?auth=2d8bc2736a418f3ad0cab7dc3952b5a4c4e68c64ccab42feb63f6211b4d55464&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Mexico's daily murder rate down 40% under Sheinbaum, president says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/mexico-murder-rate-down-40-under-sheinbaum-president-says-2026-01-08/</link><description>MEXICO CITY, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Mexico's daily murder rate has fallen nearly 40% from where it was when Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum took office, government officials said on Thursday, citing preliminary statistics.

The daily homicide average in December 2025 was 52.4, down from 86.9 in September 2024, the month before Sheinbaum took office.

"It is the lowest number since 2016," Sheinbaum said at her morning press conference alongside security officials.

For the full year, Mexico's national murder rate per 100,000 people was 17.5 in 2025, the lowest since 2015, according to a presentation by the head of Mexico's National Public Security System.

Sheinbaum said the numbers showed her government's security strategy was producing results and credited close collaboration between security and justice officials and state governors.

Homicide numbers are usually revised, often upwards, when they are formally released by the national statistics agency INEGI after going through a process of revisions, checks and adjustments.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 14:27:56 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/M7QWRWNG3FPB7EFFMLT4Y4QRYE.jpg?auth=0db44db2b7eafc9b6b13aa3cc2cd2c2ce47972dc8994b3ca0caed9d7016ae213&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Europe discusses response to US threat on Greenland, EU's Kallas says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe-discusses-response-us-threat-greenland-eus-kallas-says-2026-01-08/</link><description>BRUSSELS, Jan 8 (Reuters) - The EU has discussed what a European response would look like if the U.S. threat on acquiring Greenland, a semi-autonomous Danish territory, is real, European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said on Thursday.

Brodard is one of seven victims from Lutry Football Club, the club said. Five others are fighting for their lives in hospitals.

Under light snowfall, dozens of people including fellow players walked through the cobbled streets of Lutry to the church holding black umbrellas before filling every pew, with more standing or sitting in the aisles.

A large banner showed a drawing of Brodard in the arms of his younger brother Benjamin.

His mother Laetitia Brodard-Sitre described him as "responsible and kind" and carried a white teddy bear and a single red rose - the colours of his team.

At the start of the ceremony, a song called “One day in the wrong place” by France's Calogero played on the speakers with the lyrics: “And it’s because they were there/One day in the wrong place”.

Brodard had reserved a table with friends at Le Constellation bar the night of the fire, his mother told Reuters last week.

Just over an hour before the blaze, he texted her "Happy New Year mum. I love you" and shared a disappearing video of them partying together, she said.

His photo, with tousled brown hair carrying a Yorkshire Terrier "Lili", appeared in newspapers around the world as she sought information on his whereabouts from morgues and hospitals.

He was identified as one of the victims on January 3.

"Loved by all for his kindness, his dedication and commitment, he will be part of the Lutry Football Club family forever," the club in the pretty lakeside village, east of the city of Lausanne, said in Swiss newspaper 24 heures.

Swiss authorities said this week that the bar in the upscale ski resort of Crans-Montana had not had a mandatory inspection since 2019 and questions remain about safety standards .

Swiss prosecutors are investigating a couple who ran the bar and a group of victims' families have filed legal complaints . The couple's lawyers did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Lutry ceremony was one of two back-to-back services for teenage fire victims at the same church.

Another joint funeral for two 14- and 15-year-old sisters happened in Lausanne earlier on Thursday. Local schools have mobilised mental health counsellors to support students and teachers, the Vaud canton said.

Twenty-one of the dead were from Switzerland , seven from France, six from Italy, and there was a Swiss-French dual national and a French-British-Israeli national. The remaining four were Romanian, Turkish, Belgian and Portuguese.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 14:53:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CIAFOMSXP5NADCA5QB7TQ7IFW4.jpg?auth=a9bb69b611be9fca35ceb6125b91fa36f45f98f5452845c7d874e0583f45073f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump withdrawal from bedrock UN climate treaty raises legal questions</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/cop/trump-withdrawal-bedrock-un-climate-treaty-raises-legal-questions-2026-01-08/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 8 (Reuters) - The Trump administration's decision to withdraw the United States from the foundational U.N. climate treaty, which the U.S. Senate unanimously adopted more than 30 years ago, may be illegal, according to some legal experts who say that Congress would need to approve its exit.

President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that the United States would withdraw from dozens of international and U.N. entities , including the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change as well as the scientific Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, that "operate contrary to U.S. national interests" of focusing on oil, gas and mining development.

Trump, a vocal critic of renewable energy who has called climate change a "con job" and a hoax, went beyond his previous action of withdrawing the U.S. - the world's biggest historical greenhouse gas emitter - from the Paris climate agreement, by removing the country from the underlying UNFCCC.

He also pulled the U.S. out of the key scientific climate change body called the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and a host of other U.N. bodies focused on environment, health, arts and women's rights.

Some international law experts said the president's unprecedented move on Wednesday raises major legal questions because case law has not been clear on whether a president can unilaterally withdraw the country from a treaty that has been ratified by a majority of the Senate.

"Because the U.S. entered the UNFCCC with advice and consent of the Senate in 1992, it’s our legal view that it also must be exited using the same process in reciprocation," Jean Su, energy justice director at the Center for Biological Diversity told Reuters. "Letting this lawless move stand could shut the U.S. out of climate diplomacy forever.”

The CBD is currently evaluating whether to take the U.S. government to court on this, Su said.

White House officials were not immediately available to respond to Reuters questions on the legality of the move.

Quitting the UNFCCC would take effect a year after notification and would mean the U.S. would withdraw from all global climate negotiations including the central Paris climate agreement.

The U.S. already skipped the annual U.N. international climate summit last year in Belem, Brazil for the first time in three decades and Trump announced the withdrawal from the Paris pact a year ago. It is the only country to exit the UNFCCC.

The UNFCCC requires wealthy industrialized countries to take measures to cut their emissions, adopt policies to limit greenhouse gas emissions, publicly report their emissions, and provide funding to help poorer nations address climate change.

While the rules around ratifying a treaty are clear, the rules around withdrawing from a treaty are not spelled out in the U.S. Constitution, said Curtis Bradley, a professor at the University of Chicago Law School.

This has meant that some presidents have asserted the authority to withdraw the United States from treaties and international agreements without seeking Congressional approval. For example, Republican President Ronald Reagan withdrew the U.S. from UNESCO in 1983 over his concerns about that agency's perceived politicization.

Bradley said Congress could enact legislation to prevent a president from unilaterally withdrawing from a treaty. Congress did pass a law in 2023 to stop a future administration from withdrawing from the NATO treaty.

"But that is not likely to happen for the UNFCCC," he said, given the polarization around climate change policy in Congress.

Legal experts are also split around how difficult it would be to rejoin the UNFCCC.

Some legal groups believe that if a future administration wants to get back in, it would need to go through a new process of getting the two-thirds support in the U.S. Senate required for treaty ratification.

Other experts argue that the U.S. can easily rejoin after 90 days, using the "advise and consent" that the Senate used to ratify the treaty unanimously in 1992 under Republican President George H.W. Bush.

In recent years, achieving a two-thirds majority in the highly polarized U.S. Congress has been near impossible, especially on divisive issues.

The U.S. has entered into more than 90% of international agreements through different mechanisms that rely on executive authority or pre-existing domestic laws.

Sue Biniaz, former deputy special envoy for climate change during the Biden administration, said she is in the camp of legal scholars who believe that rejoining the UNFCCC could be "seamless" because of the unanimous Senate approval it won in 1992.

"There are multiple future pathways for rejoining the key climate agreements," she said.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 14:54:17 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5SPLPWYVSNNSLM5ADJ2GXCQZQU.jpg?auth=093b2605fa2a767d526d3f17a7a566c314876f2f72493548c66bbd8edb9408dd&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Fatal ICE shooting sparks protests in Minneapolis</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/fatal-ice-shooting-sparks-protests-in-minneapolis</link><description /><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 14:56:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/1e29dc8e-eca0-11f0-a716-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260108-151056-151715-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia frees imprisoned French researcher Laurent Vinatier</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/russia-frees-imprisoned-french-researcher-laurent-vinatier</link><description /><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 14:56:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/d765b364-ec9e-11f0-ab27-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260108-150157-150341-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Yemeni separatist chief fled to UAE, Saudi-led coalition says</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260108-yemeni-separatist-chief-fled-to-uae-saudi-led-coalition-says</link><description>Yemen 's separatist leader has fled to the UAE with Emirati help, the Saudi-led coalition said on Thursday, after a failed military advance that roiled relations between the Gulf countries .

Aidarous Al-Zubaidi was accused of high treason and removed from Yemen's Presidential Leadership Council on Wednesday, while the coalition bombed his home province after he refused to attend talks in Riyadh.

Zubaidi's UAE-backed Southern Transitional Council (STC) seized swaths of territory last month and he announced a two-year transition to independence before the group was pushed back under Saudi military pressure.

A coalition statement detailed Zubaidi's boat-and-plane journey from Aden to Abu Dhabi via Somaliland , a breakaway region in the Horn of Africa , and Somalia .

"Reliable intelligence indicates that Aidarous Al-Zubaidi and others have escaped in the dead of night," the statement said.

Zubaidi sailed from Aden to Somaliland's Berbera – whose port is run by DP World, a United Arab Emirates state-owned company – after midnight on Wednesday, the coalition said.

He then flew in a Russian-made Ilyushin plane to Mogadishu "under the supervision of UAE officers", before continuing to a military airport in Abu Dhabi, arriving on Wednesday evening, it added.

An STC official contacted by AFP on Thursday insisted Zubaidi was still in Yemen. The UAE foreign ministry did not respond to a request for comment.

Somalia's immigration agency said it was investigating an "alleged unauthorised use of Somalia's national airspace and airports".

Last month's STC offensive brought fresh turbulence to fractured Yemen, the Arabian Peninsula's poorest country, and exposed a deep rift between Saudi Arabia and the UAE.

The oil-rich neighbours formed the backbone of the coalition fighting Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, who overran the capital Sanaa in 2014 and still control much of the country.

Riyadh and Abu Dhabi now find themselves backing competing factions in Yemen's internationally recognised government, which includes the STC and is based in the group's southern stronghold of Aden.

Cinzia Bianco, a visiting fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said helping Zubaidi flee would indicate the UAE is in "damage-control mode".

"I think it means a retrenchment of UAE influence in Yemen for sure," she added. "Which is also partly because Saudi Arabia is simply the most relevant external player."

The STC moved into Hadramawt and Mahra provinces bordering Saudi Arabia and Oman in December, before being pushed back by air strikes from Saudi jets and a counter-offensive by pro-Saudi land forces.

On Wednesday, the STC said its delegation of more than 50 officials had been "arbitrarily detained and taken to an unknown location" after flying to Riyadh for talks.

The Saudi ambassador to Yemen, Mohamed AlJabir, posted a picture with 19 officials on Thursday, saying he met the STC delegation and discussed a conference on south Yemen to be held in Riyadh soon.

In a sign of Saudi anger, Riyadh-based Arab News printed a front-page headline of "WANTED" with a photo of Zubaidi in military fatigues.

A Yemeni security official told AFP that units from the Saudi-backed Nation Shield forces had arrived in Aden and were awaiting deployment in coordination with forces there.

Government buildings in Aden are being guarded by forces controlled by Zubaidi's deputy, who is in Riyadh and approved his demotion from the Presidential Leadership Council.

The STC seeks to restore independence after Yemen was formally divided between North and South from 1967 to 1990.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 14:56:42 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/10739fb0-ec75-11f0-9a5b-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/e753383e2a491e5af6b7aea21620aaa49acfd6cf.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>One dead in floods in Albania as rain and snow grip Balkans</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/one-dead-floods-albania-rain-snow-grip-balkans-2026-01-08/</link><description>FIER, Albania, Jan 8 (Reuters) - A man was found drowned on Thursday in the Albanian city of Durres and emergency teams worked around the clock to evacuate dozens of people from flooded houses hit by heavy rainfall.

The Western Balkan countries have seen disruption from snow and other winter weather since Sunday, with the closure of roads and railway lines, power cuts and drinking water affected.

Emergency teams were using boats to evacuate villagers trapped in flooded houses in the area around other southwestern Albanian towns of Fier and Vlora, after the Viosa River rose to over 9 metres, the defence ministry said.

A 55-year-old municipal worker who went missing on Tuesday was found dead in a drainage canal in Durres, probably swept away by the current, according to the interior ministry.

The emergency services said they were working to remove water from around 800 homes and buildings, after sheltering around 300 people in the army and police facilities.

In neighbouring Kosovo, where vast areas of land have been flooded in the past days, the rain was replaced by snow on Thursday. Bosnia has also been hit by snow.

"It is very difficult to function like this, the streets are not cleared, especially for pedestrians," said Armin Hasanovic, a resident of the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo.

The temperature of -14 degrees Celsius (7 degrees Fahrenheit) was recorded on Thursday morning in the Croatian capital of Zagreb, with meteorologists forecasting a new cold spell on Sunday with even lower temperatures.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 15:26:48 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/EH34RGIDWZM5PPNKCBUNXJWQMM.jpg?auth=6049bd7f458d73e9aefb910f86072208afd107373a3220c7c97f9024ae4a426e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Brazil's Lula vetoes bill cutting former president Bolsonaro's sentence</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/brazils-lula-vetoes-bill-cutting-former-president-bolsonaros-sentence-2026-01-08/</link><description>SAO PAULO, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva vetoed on Thursday a bill passed by Congress cutting former President Jair Bolsonaro's 27-year prison sentence for plotting a coup after losing the 2022 election.

The bill approved by lawmakers in December was set to cut the former right-wing president's prison term to just over two years. Congress can still override Lula's veto.

The bill also reduced sentences for those convicted over their roles in a January 2023 riot, when Bolsonaro supporters invaded and ransacked the presidential palace, Supreme Court and Congress.

About 2,000 people were arrested over the attack, which drew comparisons to the January 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol in Washington. Many of those in Brazil have been convicted by the Supreme Court of attempting a coup, among other crimes.

"All of the (coup plotters) were tried transparently and impartially, and at the end of the trial they were convicted on the basis of strong evidence," Lula said at an event in Brasilia.

The leftist leader had already vowed to veto the bill in December. Bolsonaro began serving his sentence in November.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 15:28:48 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/JI724IJO7FLP7IJCTGCF63MQDE.jpg?auth=bee1a566a453865bd881f178562fadfac4eeb7d65376def45457b88f42391b6c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Brazil's Lula vetoes bill cutting former President Bolsonaro's sentence</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/brazils-lula-vetoes-bill-cutting-former-president-bolsonaros-sentence-2026-01-08/</link><description /><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 15:29:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Policing the sky: NATO’s high-risk patrols near Ukraine</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/policing-the-sky-nato-s-high-risk-patrols-near-ukraine</link><description /><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 15:30:02 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/086eecee-eca1-11f0-bd61-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260108-152609-152917-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israel bars some aid workers from Gaza as groups face suspension</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-bars-some-aid-workers-gaza-groups-face-suspension-2026-01-08/</link><description>GENEVA/CAIRO/JERUSALEM, Jan 7 (Reuters) - Israel said on Thursday it had barred entry to Gaza of foreign medical and humanitarian staff whose organisations were ordered to cease operations unless they register employee details with Israeli authorities and meet other new rules.

Fearing a renewed humanitarian crisis if medical and aid services can suddenly no longer access war-shattered Gaza , some of the 37 international nongovernmental organisations that were ordered to halt work are weighing whether to submit staff names to Israeli authorities, two aid sources told Reuters.

Three of the aid groups said their foreign staff were told by Israeli authorities this week they could not enter Gaza.

Israel's diaspora ministry, which manages the registration process, says the measures are meant to prevent diversions of aid by Palestinian armed groups. NGOs say sharing staff details poses too much of a risk, pointing to the hundreds of aid workers who were killed or injured during the two-year Gaza war.

Israel has shared little evidence of aid being diverted in the Palestinian enclave, an allegation that was disputed in a U.S. government analysis.

The diaspora ministry said that while the NGOs had been granted 60 days to conclude operations, "the entry of foreign personnel into Gaza is not approved". It said international staff with "approved organisations" including the United Nations could continue work as usual.

Three prominent global NGOs - Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), Medecins du Monde Suisse and the Danish Refugee Council - said their international staff were refused entry to Gaza this week. Foreign aid staff had generally been permitted to rotate in and out of Gaza since the start of the war.

"If we don't have somebody in a key position, such as the emergency coordinator in charge of operations, then we either have to compensate, or we have a gap" in aid service, said Anna Halford, Gaza emergency coordinator at MSF.

Israel's government said some 23 aid groups had agreed to the new registration rules, meaning humanitarian goods will continue to get into Gaza.

But a U.N.-led coordination body has said the international groups that have registered could meet only a fraction of the required humanitarian response in the devastated Gaza Strip, where homelessness and hunger remain rife.

Some of the 37 banned groups operate specialised services like field hospitals, aid officials say. MSF bolsters six Gaza health ministry hospitals and runs two field hospitals. The Medicos del Mundo NGO screens Gaza residents for malnutrition and provides mental health services.

"Without nutritional staff doing the screening and primary healthcare centres doing the therapeutic feeding and referral of patients with severe malnutrition to in-patient care - the whole system breaks down," an aid source told Reuters.

Fearing the loss of those essential services for Gaza's two million residents, some aid groups are considering reversing course and agreeing to the new registration rules.

"The essence of the debate (for aid groups) is how to safeguard their principles, humanitarian standards, and the safety of the local staff while being able to continue the services," a senior aid source said.

COGAT, the Israeli defence ministry unit that controls access to Gaza, said the NGOs' conduct "raises suspicion regarding the parties with whom they operate" in Gaza, but they remained free to register with the diaspora ministry.

Samira al-Ashqar, 40, who fled her Beit Lahia home to Al-Ansar camp in north Gaza with her disabled husband and nine others during the war, depends on Oxfam - one of the aid groups facing an Israeli ban - for food and financial support.

"Now, after the war, everything is missing, and things have become dire ... If these institutions were to stop, the people of Gaza would face complete devastation," al-Ashqar said.

Mohamed Abu Selmia, head of Gaza's Al Shifa Hospital, told Reuters the banning of groups like MSF could affect hundreds of thousands of people.

"The Israeli occupation's decision comes at a time of unprecedented deterioration in health conditions. We suffer acute shortages of medication that reach 100% in some areas, and 55% overall," he said.

The Saudi-led coalition said that Aidarous al-Zubaidi, head of a UAE-backed southern separatist group, had left Yemen by boat for Somaliland , before boarding an aircraft to Mogadishu that was later tracked to a military airport in Abu Dhabi.

Somalia said it was investigating whether its airport had been used illegally.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 15:51:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/AM3XM7PCLJOMPLULLJ2A4WG4LE.jpg?auth=09a1c76b5617bc85295ced99f9fefce7e1aabc97615fc3e5d8651fa468d9bd59&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia frees imprisoned French researcher Laurent Vinatier</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/russia-frees-imprisoned-french-researcher-laurent-vinatier-1</link><description /><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 15:52:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/adc872a0-eca6-11f0-a8a4-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260108-160308-160721-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia frees French researcher Vinatier convicted under country's 'foreign agents' law</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/russia-frees-french-researcher-vinatier-convicted-under-country-s-foreign-agents-law</link><description /><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 15:52:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/f7412960-eca4-11f0-8a27-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260108-160138-160305-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Inside Iran's nationwide protests: Security forces attack hospital after protests in western Iran</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/inside-iran-s-nationwide-protests-security-forces-attack-hospital-after-protests-in-western-iran</link><description /><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 16:31:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/9e9a6696-eca9-11f0-bcd6-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260108-163048-163449-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>‘I spent almost four months in a prison cell’: Journalist Mario Guevara on covering ICE</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260108-i-spent-almost-four-months-prison-cell-journalist-mario-guevara-covering-ice</link><description>Mario Guevara is a Salvadoran journalist specialising in crime and police reporting who arrived in the United States in 2004. Known for his reporting on immigration enforcement and ICE raids, the Emmy Award-winner was arrested by US immigration authorities on June 14, 2025, while covering a “No Kings” protest against US President Donald Trump in the suburbs of Atlanta, Georgia.

At the time of his arrest, Guevara held a valid work permit and press credentials. The 48-year-old father of three – two of whom are US citizens – was separated from his family and transferred between six detention facilities before spending nearly four months in an ICE detention centre in Georgia.

Guevara says he was targeted because of his journalistic work and his prominence within Latino communities in the southern United States, where his reporting reaches more than one million followers on TikTok and Facebook combined. Placed in solitary confinement – officially, for his own safety –  he says the move was intended to silence a reporter who closely monitors ICE operations.

After ICE convinced a judge to reopen his immigration case, on October 3 Guevara was deported  without the possibility of appeal to El Salvador , where he remains today, separated from his family. His 112-day-long detention also made him one of the journalists to have spent the longest time behind bars in US history .

FRANCE 24 spoke with Guevara about press freedom in the United States since Trump’s return to the White House and the growing challenges of reporting on immigration enforcement, as ICE raids intensify nationwide and a day after the shooting death of a 37-year-old woman during an ICE raid in Minneapolis.

FRANCE 24: How did you get into journalism, and what led you to move to the United States?

Mario Guevara: I was drawn to journalism from a very young age. I studied the field in college and began my career in 2000 as a photojournalist for La Prensa Gráfica, one of El Salvador’s leading daily newspapers. Soon after, I was threatened by criminal gangs – they followed me and even threw rocks at me – forcing me to leave the country in 2004.

My mother had lived in Atlanta, Georgia, so it felt natural to move there when I applied for asylum in the United States. The process was long, and my case remained unresolved until 2012. In the meantime, I began working for El Mundo Hispánico, the Spanish-language version of the local Atlanta newspaper AJC (The Atlanta Journal-Constitution). Immigration authorities then denied my asylum request, and the judge granted me voluntary departure. I was planning to move to Canada with my family when immigration officials contacted my attorney to say the case had been put on hold and I was allowed to stay in the United States with a work permit.

In 2024, I launched my own media outlet, MG News , which now employs six full-time staff.

How have ICE raids evolved in recent years? Have you seen a difference between Trump’s first and second term?

I have been covering immigration and police stories for a long time. Topics related to ICE are particularly followed by the Latino community in the United States. I usually wake up around 4-5am, when followers alert me to suspicious activity in a neighbourhood. ICE officers often make arrests in the streets or at workplaces, frequently targeting work vans. They often appear to be civilians but wear bulletproof vests.

In the past, people had the right to go to court and be assisted by an attorney. Today, ICE arrests are much more immediate, and people have fewer due process rights. Deportations can now happen without a judge ever reviewing the case (a process known as “ expedited removal ”). I used to follow ICE officers during raids in Latino communities in Gwinnett County, Georgia, under the Obama administration. But now, immigration officers act more aggressively. During their operations they sometimes accuse people of obstruction, and press freedom is not respected. It’s also more and more common to see people hunting others for money, almost like bounty hunters.

During his first term, Trump’s approach was somewhat different. Under Biden , immigration policy was more open, with more work permits granted. But since Trump returned, his rhetoric and actions appear harsher toward the Latino community. He refers to some as "criminals" or "terrorists" and stepped up enforcement. It is a significant shift.

Many Latino voters supported Trump because of his promises to protect Christians and create job opportunities, messages that resonated in their communities. Today, many feel betrayed, as his focus seems to have shifted almost entirely to immigrants rather than the broader agenda he had promoted.

Can you tell us about the day you were arrested and the circumstances surrounding it?

It was a Saturday, and I was covering one of the “No Kings” protests in the suburbs of Atlanta. The participants did not have a permit to demonstrate, and the police arrested 30 people, including me. Although I am a journalist and had proper credentials, they ignored them and accused me of being part of the protest. I believe they recognised me – I was the only reporter broadcasting live in Spanish – but it is difficult to prove that I was specifically targeted.

I was placed in a police car, then a bus, and finally taken to a jail, where I was put in a small cell. My attorney visited me and was optimistic, saying I should be released the same day. However, the following day, the sheriff informed me that immigration had requested I be held. Despite my work permit being valid until 2030, they effectively moved to detain me.

I contacted my consulate, and initially they were supportive. But my work permit was immediately revoked, and I was placed into immigration proceedings for deportation.

What were the conditions like during your detention ?

I was initially transferred between six different jails, spending about a week in each. I was then placed in the Folkstone ICE detention centre, on the border between Georgia and Florida, where I remained for 112 days – almost four months. Most of the time, I was alone in a cell measuring roughly two by three metres. The lights were on constantly, and I could barely sleep. I spent 23 hours a day confined, with only about two hours outside to breathe and see the sun.

While I was never physically harmed, the experience felt like emotional torture . Authorities justified the solitary confinement as a protective measure, claiming it was because I was a public figure. I find that hard to believe. I was told it was standard procedure, yet I am convinced it was a strategy to pressure me into accepting voluntary deportation.

I was allowed to see my family on weekends, for an hour at a time, which was better than nothing. I filled my days with reading and sleeping. I was in contact with my attorney once a week but  he consistently brought bad news, warning that immigration was preparing a strong case against me. My phone had been confiscated, and they monitored my social media, looking for anything that could be used against me. It felt as though my attorney had very little room for manoeuvre. From this experience, I realised that if you are not a US citizen, you do not have the same rights – even as a journalist.

How did your deportation unfold?

The immigration authorities’ strategy was to reopen my 2012 case, effectively cancelling the administrative closure that had previously allowed me to stay. A new judge ruled that I had to leave the country, and within less than 48 hours, I was ordered into immediate deportation.

On Thursday, October 2 at 4am, I was woken, handcuffed – hands and feet – and taken to an airport in Jacksonville, Florida. From there, I was transferred to another plane in Louisiana, where I remained for 24 hours. The following day, Friday, October 3 at 4am, I was placed on a flight to El Salvador. I was only able to bring what I had on me at the time of my arrest: a wallet, my original clothes and shoes, my watch, my jewellery, and my bulletproof vest and press credentials.

When I arrived at the airport, many reporters were there.

How are you and your family managing from a personal standpoint?

I want to return to the United States, to my family and my home. My only relatives in El Salvador are my grandmother and my aunt. Everything else is in Atlanta: my wife and three children, ages 14, 21 and 27. Two of them were born in the United States and are US citizens. One of them is being treated for a brain tumour by a specialist there. My media company is also based in Atlanta.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 16:31:52 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/e050b984-ec9d-11f0-9b7f-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/000-77ZC8TB.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Japan's iconic digital pet Tamagotchi turns 30</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/japan-s-iconic-digital-pet-tamagotchi-turns-30</link><description /><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 16:31:54 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/ffa77c0e-eca8-11f0-b733-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260108-162524-162647-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuela's top lawmaker says significant number of prisoners, including foreigners, to be freed</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/venezuelas-top-lawmaker-says-significant-number-prisoners-including-foreigners-2026-01-08/</link><description>Jan 8 (Reuters) - Venezuela's top lawmaker Jorge Rodriguez said on Thursday that a significant number of both foreign and Venezuelan prisoners will be freed in the coming hours.

“The Bolivarian government, together with state institutions, has decided to release a significant number of Venezuelan and foreign individuals, and these release processes are taking place as of this very moment,” Rodriguez added.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 17:27:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/MR4L6MM3NJOXXMZ76AUUPHKARM.jpg?auth=eb4df88c29fb51d330e40335fe52003c71f29828ea82744edafa955643f756d6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US and Colombia hold call as country protests Trump's threats</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/us-and-colombia-hold-call-as-country-protests-trump-s-threats</link><description /><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 17:29:02 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/d56c30aa-ecae-11f0-93b2-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260108-170428-170818-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US president's agenda tests world order</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/us-president-s-agenda-tests-world-order</link><description /><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 17:29:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/07d6271e-eca8-11f0-98ea-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260108-160722-161655-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Brazil's President Lula vetoes law reducing Bolsonaro's sentence</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260108-brazil-s-president-lula-vetoes-law-reducing-bolsonaro-s-sentence</link><description>Brazil 's left-wing President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva on Thursday vetoed a law dramatically reducing the prison sentence of former far-right leader Jair Bolsonaro , convicted last year of coup plotting.

Lula vetoed the law adopted by Congress late last year on the third anniversary of major riots by Bolsonaro supporters in the capital Brasilia over his defeat by Lula in 2022 elections.

In scenes reminiscent of the 2021 US Capitol riots, thousands of demonstrators ransacked government buildings in Brasilia on January 8, 2023, a week after Lula's inauguration for a third term.

The rioters called on Brazil's military to overthrow Lula.

"January 8th is etched in our history as the day of our democracy 's victory," Lula said at the presidential palace, which was among the buildings targeted by the rioters.

He added that it was a "victory over those who tried to seize power by force, disregarding the will expressed at the ballot box."

Bolsonaro, 70, was sent to prison in November after being convicted of trying to cling onto power in a landmark coup trial seen as a test of Brazilian democracy.

Bolsonaro denied the charges.

He and his supporters, including US President Donald Trump , have argued that is the victim of a left-wing "witch hunt."

His allies in Brazil's conservative-dominated Congress late last year pushed through a law reducing his prison sentence from 27 years to a little over two.

Lula had made no secret of his plan to strike down that legislation.

In Brazil, Congress has the last word, however, and can in turn reject the president's veto.

Bolsonaro was convicted over a scheme to stop Lula from taking office after the right-winger's razor-thin loss in the bitter 2022 election that highlighted Brazil's stark political divisions.

The plot allegedly involved a plan to assassinate Lula, his vice president Geraldo Alckmin and Supreme Court judge Alexandre de Moraes.

Prosecutors said the scheme failed because of a lack of support from military brass.

Bolsonaro's lawyers have appealed, in vain, for him to be allowed serve his sentence under house arrest, on health grounds.

The former army captain, who has suffered serious health complications related to a 2018 stabbing on the campaign trial, spent a week in hospital in December following surgery for a groin hernia and treatment for recurring hiccups.

On Wednesday, he returned to hospital for check-ups following a fall in prison. Doctors gave him a clean bill of health.

Under current rules, he is expected to serve at least eight years behind bars.

The law passed by Congress on his early release also aims to benefit others convicted over the coup plot, as well as more than 100 people who were imprisoned for their role in the January 2023 riots.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 17:29:07 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/53c32888-ecae-11f0-8a72-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/be4ec620a72589bda1d7d4f67af707cbcf48993a.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Exclusive: Trump administration mulls payments to sway Greenlanders to join US</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/trump-administration-mulls-payments-sway-greenlanders-join-us-2026-01-08/</link><description>Jan 8 (Reuters) - U.S. officials have discussed sending lump sum payments to Greenlanders as part of a bid to convince them to secede from Denmark and potentially join the United States, according to four sources familiar with the matter.

While the exact dollar figure and logistics of any payment are unclear, U.S. officials, including White House aides, have discussed figures ranging from $10,000 to $100,000 per person, said two of the sources, who requested anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.

The idea of directly paying residents of Greenland, an overseas territory of Denmark, offers one explanation of how the U.S. might attempt to "buy" the island of 57,000 people, despite authorities' insistence in Copenhagen and Nuuk that Greenland is not for sale.

The tactic is among various plans being discussed by the White House for acquiring Greenland, including potential use of the U.S. military . But it risks coming off as overly transactional and even degrading to a population that has long debated its own independence and its economic dependence on Denmark.

"Enough is enough ... No more fantasies about annexation," Greenland's Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen wrote in a Facebook post on Sunday after U.S. President Donald Trump again told reporters the U.S. needed to acquire the island.

Leaders in Copenhagen and throughout Europe have reacted to comments by Trump and other White House officials asserting their right to Greenland in recent days with disdain, particularly given that the U.S. and Denmark are NATO allies bound by a mutual defense agreement.

On Tuesday, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, Britain and Denmark issued a joint statement , saying only Greenland and Denmark can decide matters regarding their relations.

Asked for comment about discussions to purchase the island, including the possibility of direct payments to Greenlanders, the White House referred Reuters to remarks by press secretary Karoline Leavitt and Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Wednesday.

During a press briefing, Leavitt acknowledged that Trump and his national security aides were "looking at what a potential purchase would look like." Rubio said he would meet his Danish counterpart next week in Washington to discuss Greenland.

The Danish embassy declined to comment, and Greenland's representative office in Washington did not respond to a request for comment.

Trump has long argued that the U.S. needs to acquire Greenland on several grounds, including that it is rich in minerals needed for advanced military applications. He has also said the Western Hemisphere broadly needs to be under the geopolitical influence of Washington.

While internal deliberations regarding how to seize Greenland have occurred among Trump's aides since before he took office a year ago, there has been renewed urgency after his government captured Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro in a daring snatch-and-grab operation over the weekend, according to sources familiar with internal deliberations.

One source said White House aides were eager to carry over the momentum from the Maduro operation toward accomplishing Trump's other long-standing geopolitical goals.

"We need Greenland from the standpoint of national security, and Denmark isn't going to be able to do it," Trump told reporters on Air Force One on Sunday. "It's so strategic."

One of the sources familiar with White House deliberations said the internal discussions regarding lump sum payments were not necessarily new. However, that person said, they had gotten more serious in recent days, and aides were entertaining higher values, with a $100,000-per-person payment - which would result in a total payment of almost $6 billion - a real possibility.

Many details of any potential payments were unclear, such as when and how they would be doled out if the Trump administration pursued that route or what exactly would be expected of the Greenlanders in exchange. The White House has said military intervention is possible, though officials have also said the U.S. prefers buying the island or otherwise acquiring it through diplomatic means.

Among the possibilities being floated by Trump's aides, a White House official said on Tuesday, is trying to enter into a type of agreement with the island called a Compact of Free Association.

The precise details of COFA agreements - which have only ever been extended to the small island nations of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands and Palau - vary depending on the signatory. But the U.S. government typically provides many essential services, such as mail delivery and military protection. In exchange, the U.S. military operates freely in COFA countries, and trade with the U.S. is largely duty-free.

COFA agreements have previously been inked with independent countries, and Greenland would likely need to separate from Denmark for such a plan to proceed. In theory, payments could be used to induce Greenlanders to vote for their independence, or to sign onto a COFA after such a vote.

While polls show an overwhelming majority of Greenlanders want independence, concerns about the economic costs of separating from Denmark - among other issues - have kept most Greenlandic legislators from calling for an independence referendum.

Surveys also show most Greenlanders, while open to separating from Denmark, do not want to be part of the U.S.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 17:54:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/XJU5P6MTXVMO3ANKNE3A4POZXY.jpg?auth=ddeeafba184498215a16ef202cb442e2add2b699e7451f94c2872748d778509f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Digital blackout hits Tehran, other parts of Iran, Netblocks says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/digital-blackout-hits-tehran-other-parts-iran-netblocks-says-2026-01-08/</link><description>Jan 8 (Reuters) - Tehran and several other parts of Iran experienced a digital blackout on Thursday as internet connectivity dropped across multiple service providers, internet monitoring group NetBlocks said, during nationwide protests against economic hardships .</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 17:54:27 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/J2OT46IMSVO2LHG3HHCW3T5WGM.jpg?auth=1bb42dc711388997fd45b2f1aac58ca16ebd233c55b315fd77faa5f6343d7aff&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran security forces attack hospital after protests in western region</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260108-security-forces-attack-hospital-protests-western-iran</link><description>The FRANCE 24 Observers team has verified videos showing Iranian security forces attacking a hospital in the city of Ilam, in western Iran , on the night of 3-4 January 2026. The footage shows security forces firing shotguns and using tear gas inside and around the hospital as they attempt to detain protesters who had been injured earlier in the day.

Hours before the hospital raid, security forces opened fire on a peaceful protest in the nearby town of Arkavaz, killing several demonstrators, according to local reports. Witnesses say the wounded were transferred to Khomeini Hospital in Ilam, where further clashes broke out between residents trying to protect injured protesters and armed security units, including motorcycle forces.

On January 7, Iran’s government announced that it would investigate the incident.

The latest wave of protests began in December 2025, driven by Iran’s worsening economic crisis, and has since spread to dozens of cities across the country. According to HRANA, an Iranian human rights organisation, at least 36 protesters have been killed so far, including children.

The unrest has drawn international attention following comments by US President Donald Trump , who warned Iran’s leadership against the use of lethal force. Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , has rejected dialogue with what he described as “rioters”, insisting that security forces must restore order.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 17:56:10 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/1ae98c4a-ec9b-11f0-b531-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/vlcsnap-2026-01-08-14h41m35s840.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Storm Goretti set to batter Europe with heavy wind, rain and snow</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260108-storm-goretti-set-to-batter-europe-with-heavy-wind-rain-and-snow</link><description>Europe was set to be buffeted by weather ranging from severe winds to snow and freezing temperatures with the arrival of Storm Goretti on Thursday, with forecasters issuing warnings from Britain to Germany .

Britain's Met Office issued a "rare" red wind warning for the Isles of Scilly and Cornwall in southwestern England between 1600 GMT and 2300 GMT -- its highest level of alert.

"Exceptionally strong winds" of up to 160 kilometres (100 miles) per hour were expected, it said, warning that "very large waves will bring dangerous conditions to coastal areas".

It also issued an amber snow warning in Wales , the Midlands and parts of northern England, predicting snow of up to 30 centimetres (11 inches) in some areas.

The UK 's National Rail has said train services will be impacted over the next two days, and called on people to avoid travel unless necessary.

No disruptions to air travel from London had yet been announced.

France was also bracing for Goretti, which will bring gusts of up to 160 kilometres per hour in the northern Manche department.

Schools there will remain closed Friday, and weather alerts have been issued in 30 other northwestern regions.

"Take shelter and do not use your vehicle," the Manche prefecture warned on X, urging residents to prepare emergency lighting and a drinking water supply.

In Germany , heavy snow and winds in the north were set to affect schools, hospitals and transport links.

Up to 15 centimetres of snow (six inches) could fall in the north, and there was a risk of icy conditions in the south, according to the German Weather Service (DWD).

Temperatures this weekend could plunge to as low as -20C in certain areas, DWD meteorologist Andreas Walter told AFP.

Some areas have announced schools will shut on Friday, including in the northern cities of Hamburg and Bremen.

In Hamburg, the weather had already caused delays and cancellations on the public transport network on Thursday.

The national rail company Deutsche Bahn warned of significant delays in the coming days and has mobilised more than 14,000 employees to clear snow from tracks and platforms.

The DWD says that the storm is expected to last until Saturday, with snowfall stopping on Monday.

Walter said the storm was an exception when compared to the last few years of milder winters, which were a "a consequence of climate change ".

"It's still possible to have a cold month with snow, even as temperatures rise due to climate change, but such events will become rarer in the future," he said.

"The signing of the agreement is not the end of the story. I will continue to fight for the full implementation of the commitments obtained from the European Commission and to protect our farmers."

Ireland will also vote against the agreement, its deputy prime minister Simon Harris said earlier.

But as the European Commission has secured the support of Italy , the agreement is likely to be adopted during Friday's vote.

During the day, French farmers blockaded roads into Paris and landmarks like the Arc de Triomphe with tractors in protest against the EU-Mercosur deal.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 18:31:22 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LLSA6J6DVBIT7HGSUWZGAK6OW4.jpg?auth=06f0da45bceb74f5a7c3edbeacd179b0ba26b603b7e0d8893dc19ad0636d44f3&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Yemen's Saudi-backed presidential council sacks defence minister, Saba says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/yemens-saudi-backed-presidential-council-sacks-defence-minister-saba-says-2026-01-08/</link><description>Jan 8 (Reuters) - Yemen's Saudi-backed presidential leadership council has dismissed Defence Minister Mohsen al-Daeri in the internationally recognised government, the state news agency Saba reported on Thursday.

The U.S. State Department's Under Secretary of Foreign Assistance in an X post on Wednesday said Somali government officials had destroyed a U.S.-funded World Food Programme warehouse and illegally seized donor-funded food aid for vulnerable Somalis.

As a result, he said, Washington was suspending aid to Somalia. The value of the aid was not immediately clear.

Somalia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Thursday disputed the assertion that the U.S.-provided aid had been stolen, and said it remained in WFP custody.

It said expansion and repurposing works had been taking place in the Mogadishu Port area, where the warehouse originally holding the aid - known as the blue warehouse - was located. Those operations "have not affected the custody, management, or distribution of humanitarian assistance," it added.

A WFP spokesperson said the blue warehouse had been demolished by port authorities and that WFP was working with the authorities to address the issue and ensure the safe storage of food.

"The warehouse contained 75 metric tons of specialized nutritious foods intended for the treatment of malnourished pregnant and breastfeeding women and girls and young children. The warehouse is crucial for WFP's emergency operations at a moment when almost a quarter of the population (4.4 million people) are facing crisis levels of hunger or worse," the spokesperson said.

WFP did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether it had possession of the aid.

A Mogadishu Port Authority shipment handover note, seen by Reuters and dated Wednesday, says WFP took over the food that had been "earlier shifted from the blue warehouse" to another warehouse. The note appears to be signed by a WFP Somalia official and includes a handwritten comment saying WFP will confirm final receipt of the food once a lab test confirms it is suitable for human consumption.

According to a letter to the WFP country director seen by Reuters, Somalia's Ministry of Ports and Marine Transport in November provided official notice that the program was required to vacate the blue warehouse by December 31 as a result of plans to relocate port offices.

In Trump's second term, the Republican president has pursued a hardline immigration policy that has posed a stumbling block to relations between Washington and Mogadishu. The Trump administration has barred citizens of Somalia from entering the U.S., and last month said it was auditing immigration cases involving U.S. citizens of Somali origin to detect fraud.

It has also leveled fraud allegations against some nonprofit groups in Minnesota's Somali community, with at least 56 people pleading guilty since federal prosecutors under the previous Democratic administration of Joe Biden started investigating childcare and other social service programs in the Somali community.

The U.S. State Department said on Wednesday that any resumption in assistance would be dependent on Somalia's government taking accountability and remedial steps.

Since returning to office last year, the Trump administration has more widely slashed U.S. aid spending, shifting the U.S. priority in Africa from assistance to trade.

On Thursday, the U.S. embassy in South Sudan said it was suspending assistance to an area in South Sudan and considering significant reductions in another area after what it said was South Sudanese officials' interference and the exploitation and theft of U.S. aid.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 19:22:19 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ULCW3VGE45KLHJSGMO3N2IXEX4.jpg?auth=4e20a31e3ce4d93ef48698ff3d2fd2d304d2780ed5746b9b879ddc7911169503&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Brazil's Justice Minister Lewandowski resigns</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/brazils-justice-minister-lewandowski-resigns-2026-01-08/</link><description>BRASILIA, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Brazil's Justice Minister Ricardo Lewandowski resigned from his role, a letter released by the ministry showed on Thursday.

U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that the United States would withdraw from dozens of international and U.N. entities, including a key climate treaty and a U.N. body that promotes gender equality and women's empowerment, because they "operate contrary to U.S. national interests."

A "large number" of the 31 U.N. entities on the U.S. list are funded by the regular U.N. budget, said U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric, adding that the U.N. has not received any formal notification from the Trump administration. He noted the U.S. had listed some treaty organizations that it plans to withdraw from, which would require official letters.

"All United Nations entities will go on with the implementation of their mandates as given by member states," Dujarric said. "The United Nations has a responsibility to deliver for those who depend on us."

The United States is the top contributor to the U.N. regular budget, paying the maximum 22% according to assessments agreed upon by the General Assembly. These payments are mandatory. The U.S. made no payments to the regular budget last year, Dujarric said. Washington currently owes some $1.5 billion.

"Assessed contributions to the United Nations regular budget and peacekeeping budget, as approved by the General Assembly, are a legal obligation under the U.N. Charter for all member states, including the United States," Dujarric said.

The regular budget - which for 2026 is $3.45 billion - includes political, humanitarian, disarmament, economic, social affairs and communications work. Contributions to most U.N. agencies, funds and programs - such as the World Food Programme and children's group UNICEF - are voluntary.

Trump has described the U.N. as having " but said it is that. He wants to slash U.S. funding. Guterres launched a in March, known as UN80, which seeks to cut costs and improve efficiency.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 19:22:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/OT52N54UZZMLNLGAIY3WHMHM4M.jpg?auth=2202cb1c3cb7ca0e85b87df96ab77f71dcaff13d9c733df5cf8ad8c7928562f3&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UN chief Guterres regrets US decision to withdraw from some UN entities</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/un-chief-guterres-regrets-us-decision-withdraw-some-un-entities-2026-01-08/</link><description /><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 19:23:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>US judge dismisses lawsuit by Palestinian Americans trapped in Gaza</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-judge-dismisses-lawsuit-by-palestinian-americans-trapped-gaza-2026-01-08/</link><description>Jan 8 (Reuters) - A federal judge dismissed on Thursday a lawsuit demanding the U.S. government conduct emergency rescues of Palestinian Americans and family members who are trapped in Gaza and trying to escape hardships caused by the war between Israel and Hamas .

Chief Judge Virginia Kendall of the U.S. District Court in Chicago said she lacked the power and tools to evaluate "delicate foreign policy decisions" belonging to the government's Executive Branch, while expressing sympathy with "the impossible positions in which many of the plaintiffs have found themselves."

Nine Palestinian Americans, all U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents, sued in December 2024, accusing the U.S. government of violating their constitutional right to equal protection by abandoning them in a war zone and not evacuating them as readily as it would evacuate other Americans.

They said destroyed homes, food shortages, poor medical care, mental anguish and other hardships imposed a "mandatory, non-discretionary duty" on the government to evacuate people from Gaza.

But the judge said she was ill-equipped to address how to coordinate an evacuation with neighboring countries, how to shepherd evacuees through dangerous "red zones," which people are eligible for evacuations, and how the nonexistent U.S. diplomatic presence in Gaza would complicate the process.

"Endeavoring to answer these questions - and many more like them - from the comfort of chambers is both undoable and would also invade the political branches’ constitutionally committed tasks of determining when, how, and under what circumstances evacuations from war zones should proceed," Kendall wrote.

The judge also said available evidence showed the U.S. government has developed an evacuation plan, and the nine plaintiffs had either been evacuated or rejected offers that did not cover immediate family members.

Lawyers from the Council on American-Islamic Relations advocacy group, which represents the plaintiffs, had no immediate comment. The U.S. Department of State did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Hamas-led militants killed about 1,200 people and abducted 251 others in an October 7, 2023, assault on Israel, according to Israeli data. More than 71,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's offensive in Gaza since then, according to the territory's health ministry.

The lawsuit was filed against former U.S. President Joe Biden, former Secretary of State Antony Blinken and former Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, and continued against their respective successors Donald Trump, Marco Rubio and Pete Hegseth.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 20:28:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ND44AHBCHJM7HLAEHB3UGHUBPI.jpg?auth=dbaa8084876272979b2dfe2b11cedfd81c32879e090cf2bfa1a12f04207fe8e4&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'If it expires, it expires,' Trump tells NYT about US-Russia nuclear treaty</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/if-it-expires-it-expires-trump-tells-nyt-about-us-russia-nuclear-treaty-2026-01-08/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 8 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump appeared to suggest he would allow the last arms control treaty with Russia to expire and not accept an offer from Moscow to voluntarily extend the deal, according to remarks released on Thursday.

In September, Russian President Vladimir Putin suggested the two nations could voluntarily maintain , opens new tab the limits on deployed strategic nuclear weapons set out in the New START treaty, which is set to expire on February 5.

"If it expires, it expires," Trump told the New York Times on Wednesday. "We'll just do a better agreement."

Trump said China should be incorporated in any future agreement, according to the newspaper.

Spokespeople for the Russian and Chinese embassies in Washington did not immediately respond to requests for comments.

The 2010 New START agreement cannot be extended. The treaty provided for one extension and Putin and former U.S. President Joe Biden agreed to roll it over for five years in 2021.

The agreement caps U.S. and Russian deployments of strategic nuclear war heads at 1,550 and their delivery platforms - missiles, aircraft and submarines - at 700.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 20:28:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5G723T74DNLNHIG3YVKJA4TGFQ.jpg?auth=475b0a14384d6a466c677be9d01e183c49680e1205d1c971ae0b554fbf4469a9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US detains Ghana's fugitive former finance minister</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/us-detains-ghana-s-fugitive-former-finance-minister</link><description /><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 21:24:10 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/35cca20a-ecd6-11f0-997e-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/ANGL260108-2140-Live-01.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Yes, Elon Musk’s Grok chatbot is 'digitally undressing' women and children</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/musk-s-x-facing-global-probes-after-grok-chatbot-digitally-undresses-women-and-children</link><description /><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 21:24:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/643997c2-ecd3-11f0-937d-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/ANGL260108-2045-Live-CS2045.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>No call for reform: Amid nationwide protests, do Iranians envision new regime in free secular Iran?</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/no-call-for-reform-amid-nationwide-protests-do-iranians-envision-new-regime-in-free-secular-iran</link><description /><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 21:24:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/83421610-ecd0-11f0-b879-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260108-163000-163009-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump says there could be more US strikes in Nigeria, New York Times reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/trump-says-there-could-be-more-us-strikes-nigeria-new-york-times-reports-2026-01-08/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 8 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said there could be more strikes by the U.S. in Nigeria if Christians are killed in the African nation, even as Nigeria has previously denied Christians there are subjected to systematic persecution.

Trump's comments in an interview with the New York Times were published on the newspaper's website on Thursday.

Trump made the remarks when asked about Washington's Christmas Day military strike in Nigeria. The U.S. military said at the time it carried out a strike against Islamic State militants in northwest Nigeria at the request of Nigeria's government.

Nigeria said then that the strike was a "joint operation" targeting "terrorists," and had "nothing to do with a particular religion."

"I'd love to make it a one-time strike ... But if they continue to kill Christians, it will be a many-time strike," Trump was quoted as saying.

When asked about his own Africa adviser having said that Islamic State and Boko Haram militants were killing more Muslims than Christians, Trump responded: "I think that Muslims are being killed also in Nigeria. But it's mostly Christians."

Trump, in late October, began warning that Christianity faces an "existential threat" in Nigeria and threatened to militarily intervene in the West African country over what he says is its failure to stop violence targeting Christian communities.

Nigeria's population of over 230 million people is roughly evenly divided among Christians, who predominate in the south, and Muslims, who predominate in the north.

While Nigeria has had persistent security problems, including violence and kidnappings by Islamist insurgents in the north, it strongly denies that Christians are subjected to systematic persecution.

Its government responded to Trump's past threats by saying it intended to work with Washington against militants, while rejecting U.S. language that suggested Christians were in particular peril. Nigerian authorities note that militants have killed many Muslims as well as Christians.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 21:43:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/JAS2QHNI6FJYBALNZMLXYLTYJA.jpg?auth=baf1d82dfaefef375c2a1d21b0eb7641b14ed07493ec2d39883088d687efa413&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Treasury's Bessent says Iran facing precarious moment, economy in trouble</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/treasurys-bessent-says-iran-facing-precarious-moment-economy-trouble-2026-01-08/</link><description>GOLDEN VALLEY, Minnesota, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Iran's economy is facing high inflation and other challenges, partly due to U.S. sanctions, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Thursday, underscoring Washington's concerns about Tehran cracking down violently on anti-regime protests.

"The Iranian economy is on the ropes," Bessent told the Economic Club of Minnesota, underscoring President Donald Trump's warning to Tehran to avoid harming protesters.

"It's a very precarious moment. He does not want them to harm more of the protesters. This is a tense moment," the U.S. Treasury secretary said, referring to Trump's threat on Sunday to hit Tehran if it began killing protesters.

"We're watching it very closely. If they start killing people like they have in the past, I think they're going to get hit very hard by the United States," Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday.

Rights groups say at least 25 people were killed in Iran during the first nine days of protests that started in the bazaar of Tehran over the plunging value of the currency and soaring inflation, the biggest wave of dissent in three years.

The protests have since spread nationwide amid deepening distress over rocketing inflation driven by mismanagement and Western sanctions, and curbs on political and social freedoms.

Iranian authorities have acknowledged the economic hardships facing Iranians, but accused networks linked to foreign powers of stoking the protests. Iran's top judge warned protesters on Wednesday there would be "no leniency for those who help the enemy against the Islamic Republic."

Bessent said it was clear that "what had been an affluent society that still maintained a high standard of living is really crumbling, and a lot of that is through the sanctions."

He said it was unclear how Tehran planned to finance the rebuilding of its nuclear program.

Trump's threat to come to the aid of protesters if security forces fire on them comes seven months after Israeli and U.S. forces bombed Iranian nuclear sites in a 12-day war. Trump often references the U.S. and Israeli attacks as an example of what he sees as his strong leadership on global affairs.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 21:44:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/GOZBI5OTVNMVFM6UYR3VVRN6PI.jpg?auth=8e854a9332ea4e9b0b978df34559c2de6b2d97fd0a5b8b71b7d2b9feb73e716d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Some whales restrand at New Zealand's Farewell Spit, six die</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/some-whales-restrand-new-zealands-farewell-spit-six-die-2026-01-08/</link><description>AUCKLAND, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Fifteen whales restranded and six have died after a mass stranding at Farewell Spit on the coast of New Zealand’s South Island, conservation group Project Jonah said on Friday, as volunteers prepared to attempt to refloat them.

On Thursday, 55 whales were stranded in two locations in Farewell Spit, a 26-kilometre (16-mile) sandbar at the northern tip of the South Island. Most of them were refloated.

Project Jonah, in a statement on Facebook, said teams had been checking beaches across Golden Bay, where Farewell Spit is located, for other stranded whales and are working to keep the surviving animals cool and comfortable until the afternoon high tide.

“These whales have restranded along the high-tide line, which adds to the complexity of the refloat,” Project Jonah said in an update.

Farewell Spit has been the site of numerous whale strandings over the years. It is a remote location with no facilities and those travelling to the area are being reminded to stock up on energy snacks, food, toiletries and water.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 22:21:58 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KKZN47MTURPUTMH7XUSQCHC2GE.jpg?auth=5f2efe82efe093bd394071e1cf79ad281e2ece386fd2a93b4cc3ac087c4f9672&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump advisers meet with Denmark, Greenland envoys, Danish official says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-advisers-meet-with-denmark-greenland-envoys-danish-official-says-2026-01-08/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Aides to U.S. President Donald Trump met at the White House on Thursday with envoys from Denmark and Greenland, a Danish government official said as Trump pushes to bring the island territory under U.S. control.

Denmark's Ambassador Jesper Moller Sorensen and Jacob Isbosethsen, Greenland’s chief representative to Washington, met with officials at the White House National Security Council, the official said on condition of anonymity.

The White House did not immediately confirm the meeting.

The talks were described as an effort to get more clarity on U.S. comments over the past week about Greenland.

The White House said on Tuesday that the U.S. is considering a range of options to acquire Greenland, and that U.S. military force was among the options. The purchase of the territory is also an option, U.S. officals said.

President Donald Trump has said the U.S. needs Greenland for national security.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is expected to meet with Danish officials next week in Washington.

Greenland has repeatedly said it does not want to be part of the United States. Leaders from major European powers and Canada rallied behind the Arctic territory on Tuesday, saying it belongs to its people.

A U.S. military seizure of Greenland from a longtime ally, Denmark, would send shock waves through the NATO alliance and deepen the divide between Trump and European leaders.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 22:22:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Panama says it canceled flag of US-seized oil tanker a year ago</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/panama-says-it-canceled-flag-us-seized-oil-tanker-year-ago-2026-01-08/</link><description>PANAMA CITY, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Panama's maritime authority on Thursday said it had canceled in January of last year the flag of the M Sophia, a Venezuela-linked oil tanker seized by the U.S. military this week.

The U.S. military's Southern Command on Wednesday said it had intercepted the M Sophia before dawn, and described it as a "stateless, sanctioned dark fleet motor tanker." Panamanian authorities canceled the supertanker's flag on January 23, 2025, the AMP authority said in a statement.

The maritime authority also said the Bella-1, a Russian-flagged tanker the U.S. seized the same day near Iceland after a two-week pursuit, was once listed on the country's registry but this stopped being the case as of October 7, 2024.

A ship's flag determines who has authority over it. The U.S. says that when a flag is canceled it can become stateless, meaning it lacks protections under international law and may be boarded or even seized.

Panama's maritime authority did not immediately respond to a request for more information on why the ships were no longer flagged as Panamanian.

The Bella-1 appeared to be the first time in recent memory that the U.S. military has seized a Russian-flagged vessel.

Wednesday's tanker seizures were third and fourth after the United States intercepted two vessels in December and then captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro in a pre-dawn raid on the capital Caracas, and demanded authorities there open oil to U.S. companies or risk more military intervention.

Top Venezuelan officials have accused the U.S. of trying to steal the country's vast oil reserves, estimated to be the largest in the world, but Trump said earlier this week he had reached a deal with Maduro's successor on crude exports.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 22:47:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US law enforcement clashes with protesters after fatal immigration shooting</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260108-us-law-enforcement-protesters-immigration-shooting</link><description>The White House said Thursday US law enforcement was under "organised attack" as protesters clashed with officers in Minneapolis following a woman's fatal shooting by an immigration agent.

Vice President JD Vance said, without providing evidence, she was part of a "broader left-wing network" opposed to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and insisted the officer acted in "self-defense."

Federal immigration officers armed with pepperball guns and tear gas wrestled several protesters to the ground Thursday, as large, noisy crowds gathered around Minneapolis to chant slogans against ICE. More protests are planned.

Footage from Wednesday shows a masked agent attempt to open Good's car door before another officer, standing near the front bumper, fired three times into the Honda SUV.

The vehicle veered into parked cars, as horrified onlookers hurled abuse at the federal officers before her bloodied body appeared slumped at the wheel.

Good leaves behind a wife and six-year-old, officials said. More than $800,000 has been fundraised for her family.

President Donald Trump and senior officials quickly claimed Good was trying to kill the agents, an assertion local leaders rubbished.

"I want to see nobody get shot. I want to see nobody screaming and trying to run over policemen either," Trump told The New York Times.

Witness Tyrice told US media he heard "three gunshots and then I hear a car crash."

"I see this lady hugging the victim," he said.

"There's blood all in the snow in front of our house. I could see a lady in the car...You could see the wounds and everything, like a whole bunch of blood."

Good, a US citizen, was not the target of immigration enforcement action and was only suspected of blocking traffic, police said.

Vance alleged Thursday Good was "part of a broader left-wing network to attack, to doxx, to assault and to make it impossible for our ICE officers to do their job."

White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said "law enforcement are under organised attack."

Protests grew after Minnesota's Democratic Governor Walz called it a "patriotic duty" to demonstrate.

On Thursday he said Minnesota must participate in the shooting probe alongside federal investigators -- otherwise Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem "is judge, jury and basically executioner."

But Vance suggested the officer would be cleared by a federal probe that would exclude state-level officials.

"The idea that this was not justified is absurd," he said.

Minneapolis schools were closed Thursday and Friday in anticipation of unrest.

ICE is at the forefront of Trump's immigrant deportation drive, carrying out raids despite local opposition.

Wednesday's incident came during protests over immigration enforcement in southern Minneapolis, where locals are expressing widespread anger over Trump's vow to arrest and deport "millions" of undocumented people.

The victim's mother, Donna Ganger, told the Minnesota Star Tribune her daughter "was probably terrified" and "not part" of anti-ICE activity.

Good was a poet who studied creative writing at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia, US media reported.

Religious leaders addressed crowds at the scene, where a growing memorial of flowers and candles was erected to commemorate Good's life.

"Hate does not make us great," said one banner.

Nearby, Abdinasir Abdullahi, 38, a naturalised US citizen originally from Ethiopia , told AFP he goes nowhere without his passport for fear of ICE.

"They don't trust if I say I'm a citizen, they don't want to trust you," he said.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 23:21:26 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/cadbbf2e-ecaa-11f0-b6ee-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-08T143356Z-2045700529-RC22XIA7SX09-RTRMADP-3-USA-TRUMP-MINNESOTA.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump says Venezuela does not give China a Taiwan precedent, but 'it's up to' Xi</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/trump-says-venezuela-does-not-give-china-taiwan-precedent-its-up-to-xi-2026-01-08/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 8 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said "it’s up to" Chinese President Xi Jinping what China does on Taiwan, but that he would be "very unhappy" with a change in the status quo, according to an interview the New York Times published on Thursday.

"He (Xi) considers it to be a part of China, and that’s up to him what he’s going to be doing," Trump told the newspaper on Wednesday.

"But I’ve expressed to him that I would be very unhappy if he did that, and I don’t think he’ll do that. I hope he doesn’t do that."

Trump made the comments in the context of an exchange about what lessons Xi might take away from Trump's audacious military operation in Venezuela.

The Republican president said he did not view the situations as analogous because Taiwan did not pose the same type of threat to China that he has said the government of Nicolas Maduro posed to the United States.

He also repeated his belief that Xi would not make a move against Taiwan during his presidency, which ends in 2029.

"He may do it after we have a different president, but I don’t think he’s going to do it with me as president," Trump said.

The Trump administration said in a strategy document last year that it aims to prevent conflict with China over Taiwan and the South China Sea by building up U.S. and allies' military power.

China views democratically governed Taiwan as its own, and Beijing has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control. Taiwan rejects Beijing's claims.

“The Taiwan question is purely China's internal affair, and how to resolve it is a matter purely within China’s sovereign rights,” said Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for China’s embassy in Washington.

The United States has no formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan, but Washington is the island's most important international backer and is required by law to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself. The issue has been an irritant in U.S.-China relations for years.

Trump has largely avoided directly saying how he would respond to a rise in tensions over the island.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 23:40:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5G723T74DNLNHIG3YVKJA4TGFQ.jpg?auth=475b0a14384d6a466c677be9d01e183c49680e1205d1c971ae0b554fbf4469a9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russian attack hits infrastructure target in western Lviv region, governor says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/russian-attack-hits-infrastructure-target-western-lviv-region-governor-says-2026-01-08/</link><description>Jan 9 (Reuters) - A Russian attack struck an infrastructure target in western Ukraine's Lviv region, officials in the region said early on Friday.

Lviv Mayor Andriy Sadovyi and regional governor Maksym Kozytskyi, writing on Telegram, gave no details on the strike and did not say what weapons had been deployed.

Sadovyi said it was for Ukraine's military to determine if the weapon deployed by Russian forces was an Oreshnik missile.

Kozytskyi said experts were examining the area where the strike occurred.

Russia fired an Oreshnik missile against the Ukrainian city of Dnipro for the first time in November 2024.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has said the Oreshnik's destructive power is comparable to that of a nuclear weapon, even when fitted with a conventional warhead.

Ukraine's Air Force warned of the threat of missiles being fired from a Russian testing ground in Kapustin Yar, where the Oreshnik is based in southeastern Russia. Oreshnik missiles have also been based in Russia's ally, Belarus.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 23:41:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Canadian PM Carney, Brazilian President Lula urge Venezuelan-led transition process</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/canadian-pm-carney-brazilian-president-lula-urge-venezuelan-led-transition-2026-01-09/</link><description>Jan 8 (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney spoke to Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva on Thursday about the situation in Venezuela , and the two countries have affirmed their support for a "peaceful, negotiated, and Venezuelan-led transition process."

The U.S. military seized ousted Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro and his wife from Venezuela in a raid over the weekend and brought the two to New York.

"They affirmed their support for a peaceful, negotiated, and Venezuelan-led transition process that respects the democratic will of the Venezuelan people," Prime Minister Carney's office said in a statement about his discussion with Lula.

"The leaders emphasised the necessity for all parties to uphold international law and the principle of sovereignty."

The U.N. human rights office has said the U.S. intervention in Venezuela was a violation of international law that made the world less safe.

Trump told the New York Times in an interview published on Thursday that the U.S. could oversee Venezuela and control its oil revenue for years.

Trump has decided to back Venezuela's interim president, Delcy Rodriguez, instead of Venezuelan opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Corina Machado .

Carney spoke to the Venezuelan opposition leader on Sunday and his office said he thanked her "for her resolute voice on behalf of the Venezuelan people."

Canada has been critical of Maduro's government over reported human rights abuses in Venezuela and Carney called his removal from power "welcome news", but Ottawa did not directly praise the U.S. military raid in the South American nation. Carney has also urged parties to uphold international law.

Lula has condemned Washington's actions as crossing an "unacceptable line."</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 01:47:21 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/RMYU2YOSBBPJRBFS2XZDD4G24Q.jpg?auth=6aba0339d5a6b1f03d5b164fbeec53ddab3ae61464dbac6f2bdf71677bd47b4b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russian drone attack on Kyiv kills at least two, triggers fires</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-drone-attack-kyiv-triggers-fires-injures-four-officials-say-2026-01-08/</link><description>Jan 9 (Reuters) - Russian drones attacked targets in Kyiv early on Friday, killing at least two people, triggering fires and inflicting considerable damage, officials said.

Tymur Tkachenko, head of the capital's military administration, wrote on Telegram that two people had been killed in the strikes, which began just before midnight (2200 GMT).

Mayor Vitali Klitschko put the death toll at three, with six injured. One of the dead, he said, was an emergency medic who had arrived at an apartment hit by two drones in succession.

Klitschko said two apartment buildings had been hit on the east bank of the Dnipro River, causing major damage. In one building, an entire entrance had been destroyed.

A high-rise building had also been badly damaged in a central district, he said.

Tkachenko said one drone had triggered a fire in a shopping centre, while another had fallen outside a medical facility.

Both officials said fires had broken out in several city districts.

Air alerts were in effect throughout the country. In the capital, an alert remained in place more than three hours after the first drone attacks occurred.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 01:47:26 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Honduras opposition party condemns attack on lawmaker as election tensions simmer</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/honduras-opposition-party-condemns-attack-lawmaker-election-tensions-simmer-2026-01-09/</link><description>TEGUCIGALPA, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Honduran opposition lawmaker Gladis Aurora Lopez was injured on Thursday after an explosive device was thrown near her at the National Congress, her National Party said in a statement, as tensions remain high following the country's disputed presidential election.

The conservative National Party alleged the device was thrown by members of the ruling Liberty and Refoundation Party (Libre), and said the blast detonated "centimeters" from Lopez, wounding her.

A representative for the Libre Party did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Video verified by Reuters showed the lawmaker seated, with a white button-down shirt pulled away to reveal stripes of blood and apparent bruising on her back.

The incident comes amid political mistrust after the November 30 vote, in which centrist Salvador Nasralla has appealed to the Electoral Justice Tribunal seeking recounts in multiple departments after the electoral authority declared National Party candidate Nasry Asfura the winner by less than 1% of the vote.

Both were seeking to unseat the leftist Libre Party of President Xiomara Castro, whose candidate Rixi Moncada trailed in third in the elections.

Asfura is due to take office on January 27.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 01:47:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>South Korea's President Lee to visit Japan for a summit with PM Takaichi</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/south-koreas-president-lee-visit-japan-summit-with-pm-takaichi-2026-01-09/</link><description>SEOUL, Jan 9 (Reuters) - South Korean President Lee Jae Myung will visit Japan on January 13 and 14 for a summit with Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, Lee's office said in a statement on Friday.

UN economists predicted that growth would edge up to 2.9% in 2027. That's still well below the average 3.2% growth between 2010 and 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic hurt economies around the globe. The estimate for 2025 is 2.8%.

“A combination of economic, geopolitical and technological tensions is reshaping the global landscape," UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Thursday in a statement, "generating new economic uncertainty and social vulnerabilities.”

But the UN economists said there was “unexpected resilience" to the sharp increases in US tariffs last year. This was supported by solid consumer spending and easing inflation, which helped sustain growth, but they cautioned that underlying weaknesses persist.

According to the UN’s World Economic Situation and Prospects report, growth in Europe, Japan and the United States is projected to hold broadly steady.

In the United States, the UN said growth declined from 2.8% in 2024 to an estimated 1.9% in 2025, “as strong consumer spending and AI-related investment were partly offset by weak residential and commercial construction.”

The UN projected a very small rise in US economic growth this year to 2%, and it forecast that growth will edge up to 2.2% in 2027.

Japan’s economy is forecast to grow by 0.9% this year and by 1% in 2027 — below the 1.2% growth estimated for 2025, the UN said.

“Private consumption is expected to recover gradually, while exports — particularly of automobiles — will likely remain constrained by higher United States tariffs and policy uncertainty,” the economists said of Japan.

The European Union ’s economic growth is forecast to decline from 1.5% in 2025 to 1.4% in 2026 “as higher US tariffs and ongoing geopolitical uncertainty dampen exports,” the report said. But it projected growth will increase to 1.6% in 2027.

On a more positive note, the UN said some large developing economies, including China, India and Indonesia, are expected to continue to see solid growth.

Prospects for many low-income and vulnerable countries are expected to remain less favorable, the economists said, though they projected growth in the world’s least developed countries will rise from an estimated 3.9% in 2025 to 4.6% in 2026 and 5% in 2027. They singled out stronger economic performances in Bangladesh, Ethiopia and Tanzania.

In East Asia, the UN said, economic growth is projected at 4.4% this year, down from 4.9% last year. China’s economy, the world’s second largest, is forecast to grow by 4.6% in 2026 and 4.5% in 2027, below the estimated 4.9% expansion in 2025.

“A temporary easing of trade tensions with the United States — including targeted tariff reductions and a one-year trade truce — has helped stabilise confidence,” it said.

In Africa, modest economic growth is projected, from an estimated 3.9% in 2025 to 4% in 2026 and 4.1% in 2027, the report said. “However, high debt and climate-related shocks pose significant risks," it said.

In Latin America and the Caribbean, while “the outlook remains broadly resilient,” growth is projected to decline slightly from an estimated 2.4% in 2025 to 2.3% in 2026 before edging up to 2.5% in 2027.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 01:48:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/d108b698-ecf7-11f0-81cc-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP081003016631.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israeli strikes kill at least 13 in Gaza, including children, civil defence says</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260108-israeli-strikes-gaza-children</link><description>Gaza 's civil defence agency said Israeli attacks in the Palestinian territory on Thursday killed at least 13 people, including five children, despite a ceasefire that has largely halted the fighting.

Four people including three children were killed when a drone struck a tent sheltering displaced people in southern Gaza, agency spokesman Mahmud Bassal told AFP.

In the north of the Gaza Strip, an 11-year-old girl was killed near the Jabalia refugee camp and a strike on a school killed one person, while a drone near Khan Yunis in the south killed a man, the agency added.

Two more Gazans, including a child, were killed in other attacks, reported the agency, which operates under Hamas authority.

When asked by AFP, the Israeli military said it was checking the reports.

Later on Thursday evening, four more people were killed in an Israeli air strike that targeted a house in an eastern area of Gaza City, Bassal said, adding that rescue work to search for several people who were missing had begun.

"The death toll has risen to 13 as a result of Israeli strikes on the Gaza Strip since this morning in a clear violation of the ceasefire agreement," Bassal said.

Earlier on Thursday, the Israeli military said a projectile was launched "from the area of Gaza City toward the State of Israel" but that it fell within the Gaza Strip.

"Shortly after, the (military) precisely struck the launch point," it said in a statement.

Since October 10, a fragile US-sponsored truce in Gaza has largely halted the fighting between Israeli forces and Hamas, but both sides have alleged frequent ceasefire violations.

Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem told AFP that the strikes in Gaza on Thursday "confirm the Israeli occupation's renunciation of its commitment to the ceasefire".

Israeli forces have killed at least 425 Palestinians in Gaza since the ceasefire took effect, according to Gaza's health ministry.

At least 21 people were killed on November 22 in Israeli strikes, making it one of the deadliest days in Gaza since the ceasefire came into effect.

The Israeli military said militants have killed three of its soldiers during the same period.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 01:48:39 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/d3326096-ece7-11f0-8b5e-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26008624019273.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump says he will meet with Venezuela's Machado next week</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/trump-says-he-will-meet-with-venezuelas-machado-next-week-2026-01-09/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 8 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump indicated on Thursday that Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado was coming to Washington next week.

During an interview on Fox News' "Hannity" program, Trump was asked if he plans to meet with Machado following U.S. strikes on Venezuela that resulted in the capture of its president Nicolas Maduro .

"Well, I understand she's coming in next week sometime, and I look forward to saying hello to her," Trump responded.

The White House did not immediately respond when reached for additional details on the meeting.

This will be Trump's first meeting with Machado, who said earlier this week that she hadn't spoken to the U.S. leader since she won the Nobel Peace Prize in October.

The future governance of the South American country remains in doubt. Trump over the weekend dismissed the idea of working with Machado, saying "she doesn't have the support within or the respect within the country."

Trump told Fox News that it will take time for the South American country, currently led by interim acting President Delcy Rodriguez , to get to a place where it can hold elections.

"We have to rebuild the country. They couldn't have an election," he said. "They wouldn't even know how to have an election right now."

Venezuela, an OPEC member, is one of the biggest producers of oil. Its industry has become focal point of the Trump administration with a senior official telling Reuters that oil sales to the United States will start immediately with an initial shipment of approximately 30 million to 50 million barrels and will continue indefinitely.

Trump said he will meet with oil executives at the White House on Friday. Those oil companies, according to the president, will play a key role in rebuilding Venezuela's oil industry.

"They're going to rebuild the whole oil infrastructure. They're going to spend at least $100 billion and it's an unbelievable oil that they have, and an unbelievable quality of oil and amount of oil," he said.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 03:40:56 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5FGNLH7NRRPUZHLOYODYLM53SU.jpg?auth=8e56798760bc40ca13f63e81ef32078eb2f9d608bf59a5e68e784733cbb3111b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Three people missing as bushfires destroy homes in Australia's southeast</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/three-people-missing-bushfires-destroy-homes-australias-southeast-2026-01-09/</link><description>SYDNEY, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Three people are unaccounted for as out-of-control bushfires rage in the Australian state of Victoria, destroying homes and burning through vast swathes of bushland, authorities said on Friday.

Victoria's Emergency Management Commissioner Tim Wiebusch told a news conference that firefighters were battling 30 active blazes, with the state's fire danger rating on Friday at "catastrophic", the highest level.

Authorities said damaging winds and temperatures up to 46 degrees Celsius (114.8 degrees Fahrenheit) forecast for Victoria’s north would mean any fires burning will be "undefendable".

"Today represents one of the most dangerous fire days that this state has experienced in years," said Victoria's state Premier Jacinta Allan.

A blaze near the town of Longwood has burned through more than 35,000 hectares (86,486 acres) of bushland, while a blaze near Walwa has grown to around 20,000 hectares (49,421 acres).

Both started on Wednesday as an intense heatwave in the country’s south produced the worst fire conditions since 2019, when bushfires destroyed large tracts of southeastern Australia, killing 33 people, in what became known as the Black Summer.

The largest fire near Longwood had destroyed community and residential property, including multiple homes, a community centre and a telephone exchange, said Wiebusch.

"We can't confirm those numbers at this stage, it's still too dangerous to get in and on the ground," he said.

Victoria Police Deputy Commissioner Bob Hill said two adults and a child were unaccounted for in Longwood after firefighters told them to shelter in their house on Thursday.

"They alerted those people that the risks are great, the risks are so high that they needed to take shelter, that it was too late for them to leave," he said.

"Later that afternoon, those same fire service representatives reattended that area to see the house they saw those three people standing in front of had been completely destroyed," he said.

The Walwa fire had burned through a pine plantation but had not yet caused any property losses.

Dozens of communities near the fires have been evacuated and many of the state's parks and campgrounds are closed.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 03:41:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Italian PM Meloni to visit South Korea for summit with President Lee</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/italian-pm-meloni-visit-south-korea-summit-with-president-lee-2026-01-09/</link><description>SEOUL, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni will visit South Korea between January 17 and 19 for a summit with President Lee Jae Myung, South Korea's Blue House said in a statement on Friday.

Her visit, at Lee's invitation, is the first state visit by an Italian leader to South Korea in 19 years, the presidential office said.

The leaders, who will hold their summit on January 19, plan to discuss areas of bilateral cooperation including trade, artificial intelligence and defence as well as broader international affairs, it said.

Italy is one of South Korea's four largest trading partners in the European Union, the office said.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 03:41:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/VS3LEDA3URINFIRR673VFCUH5A.jpg?auth=2fcb5080397d69801f28bc57a9a8a146a39e79b98415eb48d1f5ff7d9c5b4122&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Devotees in Philippines join massive 'Black Nazarene' procession</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/devotees-philippines-join-massive-black-nazarene-procession-2026-01-09/</link><description /><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 03:42:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Venezuela opposition members freed in prisoner release</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/venezuela-opposition-members-freed-prisoner-release-2026-01-09/</link><description>Jan 8 (Reuters) - Two leading members of Venezuela's political opposition were freed in a prisoner release on Thursday, according to local rights group Foro Penal and videos shared by Venezuelan journalists.

Officials did not provide details of the medical event but said the unidentified crewmember is stable. They said it did not result from any kind of injury onboard or from ISS operations.

NASA chief medical officer James Polk said "lingering risk" and a "lingering question as to what that diagnosis is" led to the decision to return early. Officials insisted it was not an emergency evacuation.

The four astronauts on NASA-SpaceX Crew 11 -- US members Mike Fincke and Zena Cardman along with Japan's Kimiya Yui and Russia 's Oleg Platonov -- would return within the coming days to one of the routine splashdown sites.

Amit Kshatriya, a NASA associate administrator, said it was the "first time we've done a controlled medical evacuation from the vehicle. So that is unusual."

He said the crew deployed their "onboarding training" to "manage unexpected medical situations."

"Yesterday was a textbook example of that training in action. Once the situation on the station stabilised, careful deliberations led us to the decision to return Crew 11... while ensuring minimal operational impact to ongoing work aboard."

The four astronauts set to return have been on their mission since August 1. Such journeys generally last approximately six months, and this crew was already due to return in the coming weeks.

Officials indicated it was possible the next US mission could depart to the ISS earlier than scheduled, but did not provide specifics.

Chris Williams, who launched on a Russian mission to the station, will stay onboard to maintain US presence.

Russians Sergey Kud-Sverchkov and Sergei Mikaev are also there.

NASA had previously said it was postponing a spacewalk planned for Thursday due to the medical issue.

Astronauts Fincke and Cardman were to carry out the approximately 6.5-hour spacewalk to perform power upgrade work.

Continuously inhabited since 2000, the ISS functions as a testbed for research that supports deeper space exploration -- including eventual missions to Mars.

The ISS is set to be decommissioned after 2030, with its orbit gradually lowered until it breaks up in the atmosphere over a remote part of the Pacific Ocean called Point Nemo, a spacecraft graveyard.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 03:42:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/ef600690-ece9-11f0-9073-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26008604020905.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump administration says it is creating new DOJ division to tackle fraud</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-administration-says-it-is-creating-new-doj-division-tackle-fraud-2026-01-09/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 8 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's administration said on Thursday it was creating a new division at the U.S. Department of Justice to combat what the White House called "rampant" fraud across the country.

Rights advocates and critics have said the Trump administration has used fraud allegations as an excuse to target immigrants and political opponents. They have also dismissed Trump's ability to tackle fraud, citing pardons from Trump to those who have faced fraud convictions in the past.

"To combat the rampant and pervasive problem of fraud in the United States, the DOJ's new division for national fraud enforcement will enforce the federal criminal and civil laws against fraud targeting federal government programs, federally funded benefits, businesses, nonprofits and private citizens nationwide," the White House said in a statement.

In recent weeks, the Trump administration has singled out Minnesota, alleging rampant fraud is being committed by immigrants in the welfare system and social-service programs.

Trump administration officials have frequently and sharply attacked the state's Somali community, the largest in the country. Rights and immigration advocates say Trump has exaggerated isolated examples and used those to engage in what they called federal overreach.

The assistant attorney general for the new Justice Department division will be responsible for leading the department's efforts to investigate, prosecute and remedy fraud affecting the federal government, federally funded programs and private citizens, the White House said.

The White House said the official will advise the U.S. attorney general and deputy attorney general "on issues involving significant, high-impact fraud investigations and prosecutions and related policy matters."

Earlier this week, the Trump administration said it would freeze more than $10 billion in federal childcare and family assistance funds to California, Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota and New York, citing what the administration called fraud concerns. The states later sued the Trump administration.

The administration has threatened federal funding cuts to organizations and states over a number of issues ranging from alleged fraud in programs in states governed by Democrats to diversity initiatives and pro-Palestinian university protests against U.S. ally Israel's assault on Gaza .</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 04:41:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CECJ53VF3FOLPAD36EQ2BS36C4.jpg?auth=ccbbf6a01a72c88cb50f4453d481a6397e2ae6949aaaa95e24f715e33dd3f9ad&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran's rulers face legitimacy crisis amid spreading unrest</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/irans-rulers-face-legitimacy-crisis-amid-spreading-unrest-2026-01-09/</link><description>DUBAI, Jan 9 (Reuters) - With Iran's anti-government unrest evolving rapidly and foreign pressure mounting, the clerical establishment appears unable, for now, to tackle what has become a crisis of legitimacy at the heart of the Islamic Republic .

The demonstrations, which began in Tehran last month, have spread to all of Iran's 31 provinces but have yet to reach the scale of the 2022-3 unrest sparked by the death of Mahsa Amini while in detention for allegedly violating Islamic dress codes.

Starting in Tehran with shopkeepers in the Grand Bazaar angered by a sharp slide in the rial currency, the latest protests now involve others - mainly young men rather than the women and girls who played a key role at the Amini protests.

The U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA), has reported at least 34 protesters and four security personnel killed, and 2,200 arrested during the unrest, which analysts say highlights a deeper disillusionment with the Shi'ite status quo.

"The collapse is not just of the rial, but of trust," said Alex Vatanka, director of the Iran Program at the Middle East Institute in Washington D.C.

Authorities have tried to maintain a dual approach to the unrest, saying protests over the economy are legitimate and will be met by dialogue, while meeting some demonstrations with tear gas amid violent street confrontations.

Nearly five decades after the Islamic Revolution, Iran's religious rulers are struggling to bridge the gap between their priorities and the expectations of a young society.

"I just want to live a peaceful, normal life … Instead, they (the rulers) insist on a nuclear program, supporting armed groups in the region, and maintaining hostility toward the United States," Mina, 25, told Reuters by phone from Kuhdasht in the western Lorestan province.

"Those policies may have made sense in 1979, but not today. The world has changed,” said the jobless university graduate.

A former senior official from the establishment's reformist wing said the Islamic Republic's core ideological pillars — from enforced dress codes to foreign policy choices - did not resonate with those under 30 - nearly half the population.

"The younger generation no longer believes in revolutionary slogans — it wants to live freely," he said.

The hijab, a flashpoint during the Amini protests, is now being enforced selectively. Many Iranian women now openly refuse to wear it in public places - breaking with a tradition which has long defined the Islamic Republic.

In the ongoing protests, many protesters are venting anger over Tehran's support for militants in the region, chanting slogans such as "Not Gaza, not Lebanon, my life for Iran," signalling frustration at the establishment's priorities.

Tehran's regional sway has been weakened by Israel's attacks on its proxies - from Hamas in Gaza to Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen and militias in Iraq - as well as by the ousting of Iran's close ally, Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad.

In a video shared on X and verified by Reuters, protesters in the second-most-populated city of Mashhad, in the northeast, were seen bringing a large Iranian flag down from a pole and tearing it up.

People clashed with security forces in Tehran's Grand Bazaar and cheering protesters marched through Abdanan, a city in southwestern Ilam province, other videos verified by Reuters this week showed.

In a video from the northeastern city of Gonabad, which Reuters was unable to verify, young men were seen rushing out of a seminary mosque to join a large crowd of protesters cheering them on in an apparent revolt against the clergy.

Vatanka from the Washington-based Middle East Institute said the Iranian clerical system had survived repeated protest cycles by repression and tactical concessions but the strategy was reaching its limits.

"Change now looks inevitable; regime collapse is possible but not guaranteed," he said.

In other countries in the region such as Syria, Libya and Iraq, longtime leaders only fell after a combination of protests and military intervention.

U.S. President Donald Trump has said he might come to the aid of Iranian protesters if security forces fire on them.

"We are locked and loaded and ready to go," he posted, without elaborating, on January 2, seven months after Israeli and U.S. forces bombed Iranian nuclear sites in a 12-day war.

Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, facing one of the most precarious moments of his decades-long rule, responded by vowing Iran "will not yield to the enemy."

The former Iranian official said there is no easy way out for the 86-year-old leader, whose decades-old policies of building proxies, evading sanctions and advancing nuclear and missile programs appear to be unravelling.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has praised the protests, calling them "a decisive moment in which the Iranian people take their futures into their hands".

Inside Iran, opinions are divided on whether foreign military intervention is imminent or possible and even firm government critics question whether it is desirable.

"Enough is enough. For 50 years this regime has been ruling my country. Look at the result. We are poor, isolated and frustrated," said a 31-year-old man in the central city of Isfahan on condition of anonymity.

Asked whether he supported foreign intervention, he replied: "No. I don't want my country to suffer military strikes again. Our people have endured enough. We want peace and friendship with the world — without the Islamic Republic."

Exiled opponents of the Islamic Republic , themselves deeply divided, think their moment to bring down the establishment may be close at hand and have called for more protests. But how far they enjoy any support inside the country is uncertain.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:26:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/GW3DJTDWZRPWLEV5OAZMVA5254.jpg?auth=b511255495012b817af34ceca8ebaf5fe8fbe10db1bbb67a6c03028eb26767d7&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Syria announces Aleppo ceasefire after deadly clashes force thousands to flee</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260109-syria-announces-aleppo-ceasefire-after-deadly-clashes-force-thousands-to-flee</link><description>Syria 's defence ministry announced a ceasefire in Aleppo on Friday after days of deadly clashes between the army and Kurdish fighters forced thousands of civilians to flee.

The violence, which has killed at least 21 people, is the worst to erupt since the Islamist authorities took power just over one year ago.

The Syrian government forces have been fighting the US-backed Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in the country's second city since Tuesday.

Both sides have traded blame over who started the fighting, which comes as they struggle to implement a deal to merge the Kurds' administration and military into the country's new government.

The SDF controls swathes of Syria's oil-rich north and northeast, and was key to the territorial defeat of the Islamic State group in Syria in 2019.

"To prevent any slide towards a new military escalation within residential neighbourhoods, the Ministry of Defence announces ... a ceasefire in the vicinity of the Sheikh Maqsud, Ashrafiyeh and Bani Zeid neighbourhoods of Aleppo, effective from 3:00 am," the Ministry of Defence wrote in a statement.

Kurdish fighters were given until 9:00 am Friday (0600 GMT) to leave those areas.

The goal is for civilians who were displaced by the fighting to be able "to return and resume their normal lives in an atmosphere of security and stability," the ministry added.

The governor of Aleppo, Azzam Algharib, told the official SANA news agency that he had inspected the security arrangements in the Ashrafiyeh neighbourhood.

There was no immediate comment from Kurdish forces in response to the government statements.

An AFP correspondent reported fierce fighting across the Kurdish-majority Ashrafiyeh and Sheikh Maqsud districts into Thursday night.

Syria's military had instructed civilians in those neighbourhoods to leave through humanitarian corridors ahead of launching the operation.

State television reported that around 16,000 people had fled.

"We've gone through very difficult times... my children were terrified," said Rana Issa, 43, whose family left Ashrafiyeh earlier Thursday.

"Many people want to leave", but are afraid of the snipers, she told AFP.

Mazloum Abdi -- who leads the SDF -- said attacks on Kurdish areas "undermine the chances of reaching understandings", days after he visited Damascus for talks on the March integration deal.

The agreement was meant to be implemented last year, but differences, including Kurdish demands for decentralised rule, have stymied progress.

Sheikh Maqsud and Ashrafiyeh have remained under the control of Kurdish units linked to the SDF, despite Kurdish fighters agreeing to withdraw from the areas in April.

Turkey, which shares a 900-kilometre (550-mile) border with Syria, has launched successive offensives to push Kurdish forces from the frontier.

Aron Lund, a fellow at the Century International research centre, told AFP that "Aleppo is the SDF's most vulnerable area".

"Both sides are still trying to put pressure on each other and rally international support," he said.

He warned that if the hostilities spiral, "a full Damascus-SDF conflict across northern Syria, potentially with Turkish and Israeli involvement, could be devastating for Syria's stability".

Israel and Turkey have been vying for influence in Syria since the December 2024 toppling of longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad.

In Qamishli in the Kurdish-held northeast, hundreds of people have protested the Aleppo violence.

"We call on the international community to intervene," said protester Salaheddin Sheikhmous, 61, while others held banners reading "no to war" and "no to ethnic cleansing".

In Turkey, several hundred people joined protests in Kurdish-majority Diyarbaki.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:28:26 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/6e5e0dbe-ecf1-11f0-bcc5-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-08T160142Z-1160667913-RC24XIARWNKT-RTRMADP-3-SYRIA-SECURITY-ALEPPO.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia hits Kyiv in large-scale strike after rejecting peacekeeping plan</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260109-russia-hits-kyiv-in-large-scale-strike-after-rejecting-peacekeeping-plan</link><description>Russia launched a massive attack on Ukraine 's capital, setting apartment blocks alight and killing at least four people, Kyiv's mayor said Friday after Moscow rejected the latest post-war peacekeeping plan.

Ukraine and its Western allies, scrambling to bring an end to the war as it approaches the four-year mark, agreed this week that Europe would deploy troops after a ceasefire.

But Moscow , which says it launched its February 2022 invasion in part to prevent Kyiv from joining the NATO defence treaty, has repeatedly rejected the idea of any Western forces stationed in Ukraine.

Such troops would be "considered legitimate military targets", Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova warned on Thursday, branding Ukraine and its American and European allies an "axis of war".

As diplomats wrangle for a breakthrough in what has been Europe's deadliest conflict since World War II, Russia has continued to press forward with its assault, bombarding Ukraine daily.

In Kyiv, drone strikes across the city killed four people and wounded at least 19 others, Mayor Vitali Klitschko said early Friday.

At a residential building on the city's left bank, a medic was killed while responding to a strike as the site was hit a second time.

Some neighbourhoods were plunged into darkness during what Klitschko described as a "massive enemy missile attack".

The country's military warned "all of Ukraine is under a missile threat" after confirming Russian bombers were airborne.

In the western city of Lviv, the Ukrainian Air Force said a ballistic missile traveling at hypersonic speed struck "infrastructure facilities" just before midnight.

It said the missile had been travelling at about 13,000 kilometres (8,000 miles) per hour.

Lviv Mayor Andriy Sadovy said it was up to the Ukrainian military to determine if a nuclear-capable Oreshnik missile had been used in the strike near the border with Poland.

The regional military administration said afterwards that radiation levels were within normal range.

Russia used an Oreshnik with a conventional warhead to strike the city of Dnipro in central Ukraine in late 2024.

Russia's latest barrage came after the US Embassy in Kyiv warned on Thursday that a "potentially significant air attack" could occur any time within the next several days.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had echoed the rare warning in his evening address.

Ukraine was still scrambling to restore heating and water to hundreds of thousands of households after strikes targeted energy facilities in Dnipropetrovsk and Zaporizhzhia regions.

"This is truly a national level emergency," Borys Filatov, mayor of Dnipropetrovsk's capital Dnipro, said as families were left without power in the frigid depths of winter.

While Zelensky has said an agreement between Kyiv and Washington for US security guarantees was "essentially ready for finalisation", German Chancellor Friedrich Merz acknowledged a ceasefire deal was still "quite far" given Russia's position.

Moscow balked after European leaders and US envoys announced this week that post-war guarantees for Ukraine would include a US-led monitoring mechanism and a multinational force.

In its first response after a summit in Paris, Russia called the plan dangerous" and "destructive".

Key territorial issues also appear to remain unresolved.

Russia, which occupies around 20 percent of Ukraine, has insisted on full control of the Donbas region as part of any settlement, a term Kyiv rejects.

Russia's army claimed to have captured another village in the Dnipropetrovsk region on Thursday as its grinding advance continues.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:28:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/68fa387e-e356-11f0-bfe1-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/42f65562daf289921eca99a2f3deffeaef24815a.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'Intended killings': Tanzania's election violence ensnared unsuspecting victims</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/intended-killings-tanzanias-election-violence-ensnared-unsuspecting-victims-2026-01-09/</link><description>NAIROBI, Jan 9 - Around 8:30 p.m. on October 31, a group of policemen appeared in the Mjimwema neighbourhood of the Tanzanian city of Mwanza, where residents were running errands and drinking coffee. Without warning, they opened fire in different directions, triggering panic.

The officers ordered men who had taken shelter in a nearby cafe to lie on the ground and then shot at them, three witnesses told Reuters. By the time shooting subsided, more than a dozen lay dead, they said.

A video posted on social media in early November and verified by Reuters shows the aftermath - 13 limp bodies splayed on the blood-soaked ground.

The massacre in Mjimwema, reported by Reuters in detail for the first time, is one of the deadliest known incidents from days of violence around Tanzania's October 29 elections.

It was not an isolated case.

Reuters interviewed nine witnesses to eight other incidents in Mwanza as well as Tanzania's commercial capital Dar es Salaam and the northern city of Arusha who said they saw officers shoot at people who were not protesting, sometimes kilometres away from any known demonstrations.

Driven by the exclusion of leading opposition candidates from the elections and a surge of arrests and alleged abductions of government critics, the violence was the worst political unrest in Tanzania's post-independence history and has undermined its reputation for stability.

The U.N. human rights office estimates hundreds were killed and the U.S. government says it is reviewing its relationship with the country, partly as a result.

The demands by mostly youthful demonstrators for more accountable governance echoed so-called Gen-Z protests in countries like Kenya, Madagascar and Nepal , which have forced major reforms or toppled governments.

Charles Kitima, the secretary-general of the Tanzania Episcopal Conference, the country's Catholic bishops organisation, said police deliberately targeted civilians.

"We have witnessed lots of people killed in their houses. That's why we say it was intended killings," Kitima told Reuters.

He acknowledged some looting occurred: "But overall protesters were not criminals. They were demonstrating their needs."

Palamagamba Kabudi, a senior Tanzanian official, said the government takes concerns about the use of force seriously and has created a commission of inquiry to investigate election violence. However, he said many allegations were based on unverified and out-of-context information.

"The Government does not recognise a policy or practice of intentional brutality against civilians," Kabudi, Minister of State in the President's Office, told Reuters in written responses to questions.

"Security operations are conducted for specific law-enforcement purposes and are governed by legal safeguards."

President Samia Suluhu Hassan was declared winner of the presidential election with nearly 98% of the vote. In public remarks, she has defended the security response as a reasonable reaction to violence by protesters.

Hassan, previously vice president, came to power in 2021 when her predecessor died in office and the vote was her first electoral test. After initially promoting democratic reforms, Hassan has in recent years clamped down on opponents her government accuses of trying to disrupt elections and foment instability.

After young people in several cities took to the streets on election day, authorities cut internet access across Tanzania for more than five days, limiting access to information and reliable accounts of violence.

Shortly before the connection was restored, police threatened legal action against anyone who shared images that "cause panic or degrade a person's dignity".

Independent human rights experts appointed by the U.N. Human Rights Council said in December that “disturbing reports” indicated security personnel were given "shoot to kill" orders during an enforced curfew, without saying where that information came from.

Kabudi said the government "categorically rejects claims that 'shoot to kill' orders were issued as policy".

The U.N.-appointed experts estimated at least 700 people had been extrajudicially killed but said other estimates pointed to thousands of potential victims.

Kabudi acknowledged that lives were lost but said it would be premature to issue a definitive death toll. The commission of inquiry's findings would be published "in due course", he said.

Witnesses interviewed by Reuters from Mwanza, Dar es Salaam and Arusha, Tanzania's three biggest cities, described widespread vandalism during protests, saying some demonstrators set fire to government offices, properties belonging to ruling party members and public infrastructure.

But, according to the witnesses, police shot civilians not involved in demonstrations and fired indiscriminately into crowds of protesters.

In most cases, the witnesses said they did not know why the police acted the way they did. In some, officers appeared to be targeting civilians accused of ignoring orders the officers had issued to go home, they said.

Reuters was unable to ascertain the legal basis for these orders.

While the police announced on state television a dusk-to-dawn curfew in Dar es Salaam after the initial violence, Reuters could find no evidence of an official curfew or lockdown order for Mwanza or anywhere else.

The national police spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.

From the hills above Lake Victoria, people in Mjimwema could see demonstrations elsewhere in Mwanza on October 30 and 31, but there was no unrest in the immediate area, six residents told Reuters in telephone interviews.

Nonetheless, at around 6 p.m., police came through the neighbourhood to order people who were shopping or watching television in cafes to go home, an instruction that was largely ignored, a witness said.

Around two hours later, about half a dozen police officers - some in the green police uniforms worn by many field units, others dressed in black - arrived on foot and began firing their weapons in different directions, four witnesses said.

Terrified people scattered. One of the witnesses hid in a house. Another sheltered in a nearby bar.

In one cafe, a wooden structure that had no official name but showed soccer matches, patrons switched off the television and the lights in hopes of going unnoticed, said two witnesses who were inside. One of them said he then snuck out a back door and sprinted to a nearby compound. The other remained inside.

When the police reached the door, they ordered those inside to come out and lie on the street, said three of the witnesses.

The witness still inside the cafe said he crawled out, as instructed by the officers. He recalled a stream of insults from the police but at no point did the officers explain their actions, he said.

Then the shooting started. For around 30 seconds, the witness stayed still. "They would shoot again if they noticed you were moving," he said.

After the police left, firing into the air as they departed, he rose, shaken but alive. He said he saw over 15 dead and wounded people around him.

A video posted on social media platform X by a U.S.-based Tanzanian activist on November 5 showed 13 lifeless bodies, surrounded by pools of blood, most face-down near the cafe's entrance. The ground is strewn with sandals, a glass bottle and a cell phone.

A voice can be heard saying: "All of them are dead. This is murder."

In a photo taken by a witness and verified by Reuters, nine of the same bodies are visible.

Two of the witnesses – the one hiding in the bar and the one who fled to a nearby compound – said they saw at least 14 bodies after the shooting.

A few minutes later, police officers in green uniforms pulled up in a large vehicle, loaded the bodies inside and drove off, according to four witnesses, the fourth of whom had returned to the area after taking shelter down the road.

A man in his 20s with a gunshot wound arrived at the nearby Sekou Toure Hospital around 10 p.m., saying police shot people at a Mjimwema cafe, said a person at the hospital that evening. Less than an hour later, police brought about 15 young men - all but one were dead from bullet wounds, he added.

The hospital did not respond to a request for comment.

Kabudi said authorities are reviewing the Mjimwema incident but require verified information before drawing any conclusions.

Reuters confirmed the identities of three of those killed.

Thirty-nine-year-old Raphael Esau Magige and his 27-year-old nephew Johnson Patrick Deus went to the cafe that evening to watch the television news, a family member said.

Neither was politically active, the family member said. Deus, who was learning to drive for a job he had landed in Dar es Salaam, had a young son. Magige, a tailor, had a teenage daughter.

Family members identified their remains at the Sekou Toure hospital mortuary. Deus had been shot four times, including in the ribs and the chest, while Magige had been shot three times in his neck and chest, the family member said. They were buried on November 4.

Another victim was 20-year-old Juma Shaban Joseph, a domestic worker and fervent supporter of Dar es Salaam’s Simba S.C. soccer club, a family friend told Reuters, citing witnesses who saw his body at the scene.

Like the families of many victims nationwide, Joseph's relatives have searched city hospitals and mortuaries in vain for his body, the person said.

In their November statement, the U.N. Human Rights Office cited “disturbing reports” that security forces had taken bodies to undisclosed locations "in an apparent attempt to conceal evidence".

The Boeing (BA.N) , opens new tab 737-800 coming from Bangkok belly-landed and overran the runway at Muan International Airport, killing almost everyone on board after it struck a concrete support for a localiser antenna. The only survivors were two flight attendants at the far rear of the plane.

A simulation contained in the report commissioned by the government-led Aviation and Railway Accident Investigation Board indicated that all on board might have survived without the concrete structure , which did not meet international safety standards, Kim Eun-hye, a member of a bipartisan parliamentary special committee on the accident, said in a press release issued on Thursday.

The simulation by a South Korean structural engineering institute found the aircraft's initial impact as it hit the runway was not strong enough to cause severe injuries and the plane would have slid about 770 m (2,526 ft) before stopping if the barrier was not there, her press release said.

It also concluded that if the navigation facility had been supported by a breakable structure, instead of a concrete mound, the aircraft could have breached a fence with only minor injuries, according to the release.

Kim's office declined to share the full report. Korea Airports Corp, which runs Muan airport, said it could not comment until the final investigation results are released. South Korea's investigation board did not respond immediately to requests for comment.

Kim said the tragedy reflected years of government negligence dating back to 1999, when the structure was built, and it was left uncorrected despite violating regulations and being flagged as unsafe.

The lawmaker's statement comes as families of the victims and opposition politicians step up pressure for full accountability, accusing authorities of delaying the release of the analysis and failing to adequately address whether the infrastructure's design contributed to the high death toll.

The report focused on the structural hazard, but does not yet constitute a final official accident conclusion.

A full investigative report is still pending authorities’ public disclosure after missing a one-year deadline to release a progress report. The Muan airport has been closed since the crash and is not due to reopen until April.

A representative of the victims' family association told Reuters that the report was "solid proof that the disaster was man-made" and said the families were demanding an apology from the investigation board for concealing the information.

The investigation board said in a preliminary report in January last year that both of the plane's engines sustained bird strikes .

The pilots shut off the less-damaged engine after the bird strikes, investigators said in a July update that was not released publicly due to objections from victims' families.

South Korea's parliament has launched its own probe into the crash and its aftermath amid continuing calls for greater transparency.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 06:36:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CM33IBI7RJMEVGTMFCR7YARJOQ.jpg?auth=b851cc9bcaa2968391971a2c42f7937e4938bb55c59638ce278f479211cb362e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Can the US put a price tag on Greenland?</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/can-us-put-price-tag-greenland-2026-01-09/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Despite Denmark's repeated insistence that Greenland is not for sale , U.S. President Donald Trump and his team are "talking about what a potential purchase would look like", according to a White House spokeswoman this week.

But even as a thought experiment that assumes the presence of a willing seller, discussion of the hypothetical sale of an autonomous territory such as Greenland rapidly encounters imponderables such as how a meaningful price tag could even be established.

"There's not a market for buying and selling countries," said Nick Kounis, chief economist of Dutch ABN AMRO bank, noting there was no accepted framework for valuing countries.

Attempts to find historical benchmarks for fair value also run into difficulties.

In 1946 the U.S. offered to buy the vast, mineral-rich Arctic island from Denmark for $100 million - an offer that was rejected back then.

In today's money, that is around $1.6 billion. But that figure, already paltry, is of no use as a baseline because of the massive growth in both U.S. and Danish economies over eight decades since then: it does not reflect any relative "value" of Greenland and its resources in the global economy of the 2020s.

America's $15-million purchase of Louisiana in 1803 and $7.2-million acquisition of Alaska from Russia in 1867 are also not useful precedents.

First and most obviously there is the fact that both France and Russia actually chose to sell.

And while it is clear that those figures would be vastly higher in today's money, how much more would depend on how and whether you factored in variables like inflation, appreciation in land prices and growth in local economies.

So how about if you tried a method akin to the valuation of a corporate takeover based on the income the target is capable of generating? Still tricky.

Denmark's central bank put the size of Greenland's fishing-based Gross Domestic Product (GDP) at a tiny $3.6 billion in 2023 - about a tenth that of its smaller Arctic neighbour Iceland. Even if that was a starting point for a valuation, what multiple would you use to determine a price based on that?

How too would you account for the fact that Danish subsidies cover about half Greenland's public budget, funding hospitals and schools and underpinning infrastructure for the sparsely populated territory?

While Trump has denied the U.S. has its eyes on Greenland's mineral assets and energy assets, Reuters reported last October that his administration has held discussions about taking a stake in Critical Metals Corp (CRML.O) , opens new tab , a company aiming to build the largest rare earths project there.

Estimates put the value of Greenland's mineral and energy reserves in the hundreds of billions of dollars or more. Proper geological studies of the entire island have not been fully conducted but a 2023 survey showed that 25 of 34 minerals deemed "critical raw materials" by the European Commission were there.

Mining and energy companies have a long history of putting price tags on assets around the world. But here, at least two complications emerge.

First, the extraction of oil and natural gas is banned in Greenland for environmental reasons, and development of its mining sector has been snarled in red tape and opposition from Indigenous people. Is that a political constraint that a buyer would want a discount for? If so, how much?

And second, mining and energy deals crucially do not include the transfer of national sovereignty - in this case complicated further by the presence of Greenlandic Inuits who assert ownership claims of their own.

"Because you are adding the intangible notions of Indigenous peoples' culture, history, then you can't - there is no way to price it," said Andreas Osthagen, Research Director for Arctic and Ocean Politics at the Fridtjof Nansen Institute in Norway. "It's why that notion is ridiculous."

For now, the Trump administration says all options are on the table - including military action - to gain control of a territory that it says is vital for U.S. national security and where it already has a small military presence.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio's scheduled meeting with Danish leaders next week may yield further insights into the U.S. game plan on Greenland.

ABN AMRO's Kounis suggested Trump could be using a similar playbook to one he has used in other situations such as talks on trade tariffs, where an extreme scenario is put on the table simply to soften up the other side.

If one possible outcome is an agreed settlement that the U.S. sees as being to its military and economic advantage, then "part of this might well be about getting leverage for future negotiations", Kounis said.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 06:37:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/2OTT6ITHEJKHLANKLGUJGNPN3A.jpg?auth=dd0487a03c448d02e7575305125368c4c67d9a59e316f1b9cf03408349468cea&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Live: Russia pounds Kyiv in massive attack after rejecting peacekeeping plan</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260109-live-russia-pounds-kyiv-in-massive-attack-after-rejecting-peacekeeping-plan</link><description>Russia also struck critical infrastructure in the western city of Lviv using an unidentified ballistic missile, said Mayor Andriy Sadoviy.

A Ukrainian attack left more than half a million people without heat or power in the Russian border region of Belgorod, its governor said early Friday.

"According to the results of the enemy's overnight attack on Belgorod region's utility infrastructure, as of 6:00 am today, 556,000 people in six municipalities are without power," said Vyacheslav Gladkov, adding that almost the same number were without any heating as temperatures hovered around freezing.

Russia launched a massive attack on Ukraine's capital, setting apartment blocks alight and killing at least four people, Kyiv's mayor said Friday after Moscow rejected the latest post-war peacekeeping plan.

The Defence Ministry said in a statement that the strike was a response to an attempted Ukrainian drone attack on one of President Vladimir Putin's residences at the end of December.

Kyiv has called the Russian assertion that it tried to attack the residence, in Russia's Novgorod's region, "a lie."

The governor of Ukraine's western Lviv region had earlier said that a Russian attack had struck an infrastructure target, which unverified social media reports said was a massive underground gas storage facility.

Reuters could not verify that.

Ukrainian media had quoted the Ukrainian Air Force as saying that a ballistic missile had been used in the strike which had been travelling at a speed of nearly 13,000 km per hour (8,000 mph).

Moscow first fired an Oreshnik – Russian for hazel tree - against what it said was a military factory in Ukraine in November 2024. On that occasion Ukrainian sources said the missile was carrying dummy warheads, not explosives, and caused limited damage.

Putin has said that the intermediate-range Oreshnik missile is impossible to intercept because of speeds reportedly more than 10 times the speed of sound and that its destructive power is comparable to that of a nuclear weapon, even when fitted with a conventional warhead.

Some Western officials have expressed scepticism about the Oreshnik's capabilities. One U.S. official said in December 2024 that the weapon was not seen as a game-changer on the battlefield.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 07:27:54 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/3YBD3VOPFJIZ5GJLXNDT2Z65NM.jpg?auth=f44d5269426794f78ae1e7e9015ddee090cbc01bd6414f3bd7dd7761a0875b07&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Storm Goretti lashes France with fierce winds, cuts power to 380,000 households</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260109-storm-goretti-lashes-france-fierce-winds-cuts-power-to-380000-households</link><description>Around 380,000 households in France were without power on Friday morning as Storm Goretti swept through northern Europe with fierce winds.

The vast majority of the affected households were in the northern Normandy region, the Enedis power provider said in a statement, with residents also affected in Brittany, Picardy and the Ile-de-France region around Paris.

Forecasters had issued weather warnings ahead of Storm Goretti, urging people to stay inside their homes.

Overnight, a wind gust of 213 kilometres per hour (132 miles) was registered in France's northwestern Manche region, authorities said.

"Take shelter and do not use your vehicle," the Manche prefecture warned on X, urging residents to prepare emergency lighting and a drinking water supply.

Britain's Met Office also issued a "rare" red wind warning for the Isles of Scilly and Cornwall in southwestern England – its highest level of alert.

"Exceptionally strong winds" of up to 160 kilometres (100 miles) per hour were expected, it said, warning that "very large waves will bring dangerous conditions to coastal areas".

It also issued an amber snow warning in Wales , central England and parts of northern England, predicting snow of up to 30 centimetres (11 inches) in some areas.

The UK's National Rail has said train services will be affected over the next two days, and called on people to avoid travel unless necessary.

Europe's current extreme weather conditions have caused at least eight deaths, and on Thursday police in the Albanian city of Durres pulled a man's body from floodwater following days of heavy snow and torrential rain across the Balkans .

In Germany , heavy snow and winds in the north were set to affect schools, hospitals and transport links.

Up to 15 centimetres of snow (six inches) could fall in the north, and there was a risk of icy conditions in the south, according to the German Weather Service (DWD).

Temperatures this weekend could plunge to as low as -20C in certain areas, DWD meteorologist Andreas Walter told AFP.

Some areas have announced schools would be shut on Friday, including in the northern cities of Hamburg and Bremen.

In Hamburg, the weather had already caused delays and cancellations on the public transport network on Thursday.

The national rail company Deutsche Bahn warned of significant delays in the coming days and has mobilised more than 14,000 employees to clear snow from tracks and platforms.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 07:28:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/70d3b090-ed27-11f0-aeba-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/000-92366ZQ.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>With Maduro gone, the US sets its sights on driving Hezbollah from Venezuela</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260109-with-maduro-gone-us-sets-sights-driving-hezbollah-from-venezuela</link><description>The shockwaves unleashed by the deadly US strikes on Caracas and the capture of Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro were felt all the way to the southern suburbs of Beirut, the stronghold of Lebanese Shiite group Hezbollah

Washington has used Maduro’s abduction to send an unmistakable signal to the militant group’s leadership as well as its Iranian backers, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio directly threatening them the morning after the attack.

“It's very simple,” he told US broadcaster CBS . “In the 21st Century, under the Trump administration, we are not going to have a country like Venezuela in our own hemisphere in the sphere of control and the crossroads for Hezbollah, for Iran and for every other malign influence in the country, in the world. That's just not going to exist.”

Rubio later told NBC News that the new dispensation would mean the outright elimination of any Hezbollah or Iranian presence on Venezuelan soil, where they have been welcomed for the past three decades in the name of a shared antipathy to the United States. The US designated Hezbollah as a foreign terrorist organization in 1997.

Rubio called on the Venezuelan regime – now under the interim leadership of Maduro’s vice president, Delcy Rodriguez – to break with both Iran and Hezbollah. The Islamic Republic, facing mounting protests first triggered by a cost-of-living crisis, has also found itself under pressure, with US President Donald Trump even threatening to intervene if Iranian security forces kill peaceful protesters.

The US has long been monitoring Hezbollah’s activities in the region. The US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has said since 2008 that the movement, then led by Hassan Nasrallah , had been financing itself through drug-trafficking, arms sales and money laundering across Latin America and beyond. According to DEA figures, these activities earned Hezbollah about $1 billion a year .

As for Venezuela in particular, US investigators say that Maduro was even more permissive than his predecessor, Hugo Chavez , and that Venezuela had become a safe haven for the Shiite movement, which reportedly set up command structures in the capital Caracas.

Both Venezuela and Hezbollah have strongly denied these allegations, with the latter insisting that drug trafficking and related activities are “forbidden by Islam”. Despite this, the self-described “Party of God” appeared to have played a key role, alongside Bashar al-Assad’s regime, in trafficking the illicit drug captagon across the Middle East during the Syrian Civil War.

US investigators have long accused Hezbollah of extending its operations into Venezuela in part through the region’s Lebanese and Syrian diaspora.

“In Venezuela, Hezbollah’s support network operates through compartmentalized, familial clan structures that embed into the Maduro regime-controlled illicit economy and the regime’s political apparatus and bureaucracy,” according to a 2020 report by the Washington-based Atlantic Council think tank. “Many of the clans are assimilated within the Venezuelan state and society through the robust Lebanese and Syrian communities that extend to neighboring Colombia .”

Links between Caracas and the Shiite movement “are mutually beneficial, allowing Hezbollah a safe space to conduct its global crime-terror operations and providing the Maduro regime with increased illicit support from the Middle East”, the report says.

Caroline Rose, the director of military and national security priorities at the Washington-based New Lines Institute for Strategy and Policy, said the Latin American drug trade had given Hezbollah access to badly needed financing.

“The relationship that Hezbollah has developed with the Maduro regime and the embedded Cartel de los Soles syndicate (a term used for Venezuelan officials the US accuses of having links to drug trafficking) is extremely nuanced, often simplified by reductionist assertions that Venezuela is a ‘base’ for Hezbollah’s terrorist operations,” she said. “Rather, the picture has been more complex, with the group exploiting Venezuela’s proximity to established drug smuggling routes – just as they have in Western Africa – as a way to diversify alternative revenue streams through the trafficking of drugs, arms, and money laundering schemes.”

Rose said that the sudden death of Chavez in 2013 had only intensified Hezbollah’s activities in Venezuela after his hand-picked successor Maduro took office.

“The relationship has grown since Venezuela’s Chavez era, with reports that Hezbollah has particularly taken advantage of informal ports and smuggling routes off the coast of Venezuela’s Margarita Island,” she said.

This sun-drenched island in the country’s northeast is believed to serve as a key logistics hub for Hezbollah, used for financial activities, espionage and possibly drug trafficking. Margarita Island was described in 2011 during a congressional hearing of the Subcommittee on Counterterrorism and Intelligence as having “ eclipsed ” the infamous “Triple Frontier” between Paraguay , Brazil and Argentina as the movement’s favored bastion in the Americas. This border region served for decades as one of Hezbollah’s strongholds in Latin America, used by the group as both sanctuary and center of operations.

More recently, former assistant secretary for terrorist financing at the US Treasury Marshall Billingslea told a Senate hearing in October 2025 that “under Hugo Chavez, Venezuela opened its doors to Hezbollah, allowing the group establish a major footprint, including a paramilitary training site, on Margarita Island”.

Lebanon’s media have made much of the fact that Rubio’s threats come at a tense moment for the Shiite group and its new leader, Naim Qassem , who is under intense US and Israeli pressure to disarm.

Despite having been severely weakened both militarily and politically during its most recent conflict with Israel – losing longtime leader Nasrallah and most of its military leadership, as well as the abrupt collapse of its Assad ally in Syria – Hezbollah has categorically refused to lay down arms.

According to Rose, “2025 has been a transition year for Hezbollah”. And it may now need to consider its remaining options.

“Israel has imposed a severe blow on Hezbollah’s command and control, infrastructure and finances, creating an incentive for the organization to lay low in Lebanon while pursuing alternative revenue-generating schemes, such as drug trafficking, elsewhere,” she said.

“In that same vein, risk-taking behavior from both Israel and the Trump administration – demonstrated through Israeli strikes on Qatar and Iran, as well as the US’s recent capture of Maduro and designation of cartels as terrorist organizations – could also serve as a deterrent against any major Hezbollah entrenchment in Venezuela,” she added.

For Rose, Trump’s attack on Venezuela, and threats of more to come, could well push Hezbollah to redirect its operations to parts of the world less directly menaced by Washington’s military reach.

“The Trump administration’s violation of international law – and brazen impetus to act against actors that could be brandished as ‘narco-terrorists’ – could make South America a more risk-ridden zone for outside players like Hezbollah,” Rose observed.

“I believe that with so much attention and pressure against any organization that engages in illicit smuggling that encompasses an armed component – militarized cartels, terrorist organizations, and mafia networks – Hezbollah will do its best to quiet its activities in South America. Likely, it will turn its attention towards existing enclaves in Western Africa, as well as seek to charter new potential inroads, such as Southeast and Central Asia .”

US President Donald Trump , who has been pressuring Maduro allies now leading the country to fold to his vision for the future of the oil-rich nation, said the releases came at the request of the United States. In the interview on Fox News on Thursday night, Trump praised the government of acting President Delcy Rodriguez, saying: “they've been great ... Everything we’ve wanted, they’ve given us.”

Jorge Rodriguez, brother of the acting president and head of Venezuela's National Assembly, said a “significant number” of people would be freed, but as of late Thursday night it was still not clear who or how many people would be released. The US government and Venezuela's opposition have long demanded the widespread release of imprisoned politicians, critics and members of civil society. The Venezuelan government insists it does not hold prisoners for political reasons.

“Consider this a gesture by the Bolivarian (Venezuelan) government, which is broadly intended to seek peace,” he announced.

Among those released was Biagio Pilieri, an opposition leader who was part of Nobel Peace Prize winner María Corina Machado’s 2024 presidential campaign, according to Foro Penal, an advocacy group for prisoners based in Venezuela's capital, Caracas. Also released was Enrique Márquez, a former electoral authority and candidate in the 2024 presidential election, the organisation said.

Videos posted by journalists on social media show Marquez and Pilieri embracing loved ones on the streets outside the prison. One video showed Marquez beaming and video-calling family members, saying, “Soon I will be with you all.”

Five Spanish citizens – including the prominent Venezuelan-Spanish lawyer and human rights activist Rocío San Miguel – were also released in the afternoon and, as the night wore on, reports trickled out of more detainees walking free. Relatives who waited for hours outside a prison in Guatire, about an hour east of Caracas, briefly chanted, “Libertad! Libertad!” meaning “Freedom! Freedom!”

Venezuela's government has a history of releasing people imprisoned for political reasons – including real and perceived opponents – during moments of high tension to signal openness to dialogue. The releases on Thursday were the first since Maduro was deposed.

Human rights groups and members of the opposition were encouraged by the move, though it wasn’t clear yet what it represented – whether the growing pains of a government in transition or a symbolic overture to placate the Trump administration, which has allowed Maduro’s loyalists to stay in power as it exerts pressure through crippling sanctions.

For opposition leader Machado – whom Trump has snubbed by endorsing Rodriguez to lead the transition – the gesture was “an act of moral restitution".

“Nothing brings back the stolen years,” she said in an audio message from exile addressed to families of released detainees, urging them to take comfort in the knowledge that “injustice will not be eternal and that the truth, though badly wounded, eventually prevails".

Alfredo Romero, president of Foro Penal, expressed cautious hope "that this is indeed the beginning of the dismantling of a repressive system in Venezuela ... and not a mere gesture, a charade of releasing some prisoners and incarcerating others".

Despite a widespread crackdown in the aftermath of the tumultuous 2024 election – in which authorities said they detained more than 2,000 people – Venezuela's government denies that there are prisoners unjustly detained, accusing them of plotting to destabilise Maduro’s government.

Romero's organisation said that as of Dec. 29, 2025, there were 863 people detained in Venezuela “for political reasons".

The Spanish government said Thursday that five of its citizens, including dual national San Miguel, had been released from custody in Venezuela and would soon return to Spain.

Speaking to Spanish broadcaster RNE, Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares identified the other Spanish nationals released as Andrés Martínez, Jose Maria Basoa, Ernesto Gorbe and Miguel Moreno.

Two of them, Martinez and Basoa, were arrested in Venezuela in September 2024 and accused of plotting to destabilise Maduro’s government as Spanish spies – allegations vehemently denied by Spain.

Spain’s El Pais newspaper reported Thursday that another freed detainee, Gorbe, was arrested in 2024 on allegations of overstaying his visa.

As the news of the release broke Thursday, families of detainees rushed to prisons across the country, seeking information on their loved ones.

Pedro Duran, 60, was among those hoping to reunite with his brother Franklin Durán as he waited outside the prison in Guatire. Duran said his brother was detained in 2021 on charges of trying to overthrow Maduro’s government – an accusation his family denies.

Durán, who has been living in Spain, heard rumors on Wednesday that the government could release a number of detainees and immediately bought a plane ticket from Madrid to Caracas to find his brother.

“I don’t have words to express the emotion I’m feeling,” Durán said. “We’re feeling a lot of hope ... We’re just waiting now.”

Despite the anticipation, fear persists.

“Of course everyone here is very scared, but what more could (the government) do to us that they haven’t done already,” he added.

Ronal Rodríguez, a researcher at the Venezuelan Observatory at the University of Rosario in Bogotá, Colombia, said the government releases prisoners at politically strategic moments.

In July last year, Venezuela released 10 jailed US citizens and permanent residents in exchange for the repatriation of over 200 Venezuelans deported by the Trump administration to El Salvador , where they had been held in a prison built to house criminal gangs.

“The regime uses them like a bargaining chip,” he said of prisoners in Venezuela. It will be telling to see not only how many people the government releases, he said, but also under what conditions and whether the releases include anyone high-profile.

On Wednesday, the Trump administration sought to assert its control over Venezuelan oil, seizing a pair of sanctioned tankers transporting petroleum and announcing plans to relax some sanctions so the US can oversee the sale of Venezuela’s petroleum worldwide.

Both moves reflect the administration’s determination to make good on its effort to control the next steps in Venezuela through its vast oil resources. Trump pledged after the capture of Maduro that the US will “run” the country.

Trump on Thursday night said that Machado may be visiting Washington next week and that he may be meeting with her.

“I understand she’s coming in next week some time and I look forward to saying hello to her,” Trump said in the Fox News interview with Sean Hannity. “And I’ve heard that she wants to do that.”</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 07:28:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/b8c0371a-ecc4-11f0-9727-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-08T185350Z-1984415062-RC26XIA6AXU8-RTRMADP-3-USA-VENEZUELA-PRISONERS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuela-style strike on Taiwan's leader could prove tricky for China</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/venezuela-style-strike-taiwans-leader-could-prove-tricky-china-2026-01-09/</link><description>HONG KONG/TAIPEI, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Some Chinese online users are calling for a lightning Venezuela-style snatch of Taiwan's leaders in a prelude to taking over the island, but analysts, scholars and security officials say China's modernising military is still far from ready.

In Taiwan, they say, China's military has an adversary which has prepared for years against a "decapitation operation" on its leaders, besides extensive air defences and radar capabilities, as well as likely support from the United States and its allies.

Although China has spent years acquiring advanced weapons, questions remain about the capabilities of its People's Liberation Army in using them effectively, as well as a command structure that must knit them together in combat.

"Once such an operation runs into trouble, it would quickly escalate into a full-scale conflict, with extremely high political and military risk," said Chen Kuan-ting, a lawmaker of Taiwan's ruling Democratic People's Party.

Taiwan's layered air defence and early warning systems meant any air assault or special operations infiltration effort would risk detection as it crossed the Taiwan Strait, foreshadowing escalation, he added.

The United States showcased its forces' battle-tested air dominance with last weekend's operation to extract Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife.

Its military controlled the skies with stealth fighters, jets that jammed enemy defences and covert reconnaissance drones and satellites feeding commanders real-time intelligence.

By contrast, the PLA "still has clear gaps in real joint-operations experience, electro-magnetic and electronic-warfare capabilities, and actual combat validation of high-risk missions," said Chen.

China's defence ministry offered no immediate response to faxed questions from Reuters.

China, which claims Taiwan as its own territory, has not ruled out using force to bring the island under its control. Taiwan rejects China's claims.

"Operationally, while the PLA is in recent times trying to get up to speed with force integration, it is still baby steps compared to what the Americans have for decades been accumulating," said Singapore-based security scholar Collin Koh.

Taiwan is determined to defend its sovereignty and boost its defence, President Lai Ching-te said last month, after Beijing fired rockets towards Taiwan as part of its latest military drills.

The drills surrounding Taiwan - the most extensive to date - were accompanied by strong messaging from Chinese officials and the military.

"Any external forces that attempt to intervene in the Taiwan issue or interfere in China's internal affairs will surely smash their heads bloody against the iron walls of the Chinese People's Liberation Army," China's Taiwan Affairs Office said in a statement.

In October, Lai unveiled a multi-layered air defence system called "T-Dome".

It is intended to be similar to Israel's "Iron Dome", with a more efficient and "sensor-to-shooter" mechanism for a higher kill rate that integrates weaponry from Taiwan-developed Sky Bow missiles to U.S.-supplied HIMARS rocket systems.

In July, Taiwan's military staged a drill to protect the Taipei's main airport from a hostile landing, deploying portable stinger rockets and tanks.

While military attaches say China has war-gamed extraction operations in Taipei in a broad range of military options to take control of Taiwan, some Chinese online users tom-tommed the U.S. action in Venezuela as inspiration.

"The Venezuelan situation has provided us a solution for unifying Taiwan," said one user on the X-like microblogging site Weibo.

"First use special operations to arrest Lai Ching-te, then immediately announce the takeover of Taiwan, issue new identity cards ... and achieve a swift and decisive victory."

Chen, who sits on the foreign affairs and defence committee of Taiwan's parliament, dismissed such remarks as "fantasy" and other analysts said any such attempt would quickly face hard military realities.

China had added aircraft to replicate platforms such as Boeing's EA-18G Growler electronic warfare jet and Northrop Grumman's (NOC.N) , opens new tab E-2D Advanced Hawkeye command and early warning aircraft, but their precise capabilities had yet to be delineated, Koh said.

With the ruling Communist Party still playing a role in the PLA's command structure, doubts remain about its effectiveness, added Koh, who is with the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies.

"A decentralised command-and-control hierarchy is essential; that allows field commanders to exercise necessary initiative to cope with the fluid, evolving and uncertain nature of military operations as events unfold," Koh said.

Despite any perceived PLA shortcomings, Taiwan's leaders are taking no chances, however.

"We have have no capital to take them lightly," said a senior Taiwan security official, who spoke on condition of anonymity as the military issues are sensitive.

"After all, in the wake of this painful and shocking experience, China will also look for all kinds of ways to overcome these problems."</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 08:31:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CYJID4IXC5JMZO2CABI3PBDVP4.jpg?auth=c971b87602e23785cd34b72e0738bd990c06de33bd60255de356a32d74434ad9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US to provide $45 million to help implement Cambodian-Thai accords</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/us-provide-45-million-help-implement-cambodian-thai-accords-2026-01-09/</link><description>Jan 9 (Reuters) - The United States will provide $45 million in assistance to Cambodia and Thailand, the senior U.S. diplomat for East Asia said on Friday during a visit to the region, to help solidify President Donald Trump 's peace-making efforts between the two.

"The United States will continue to support the Cambodian and Thai governments as they implement the Kuala Lumpur Peace Accords and pave the way for a return to peace, prosperity, and stability for their people and the region," Michael DeSombre, the U.S. assistant secretary for East Asia, said in a statement.

A senior State Department official said DeSombre would meet senior Thai and Cambodian officials in Bangkok and Phnom Penh on Friday and Saturday to discuss implementation of the peace accords "and broader efforts to promote our shared interests in a safer, stronger and more prosperous Indo-Pacific."

DeSombre said the United States, which has slashed its global foreign assistance programs under Trump, would provide $15 million for border stabilization to help communities recover and to support people displaced by the recent conflict, and $10 million for demining and clearing of unexploded ordnance.

The U.S. would also provide $20 million for initiatives that will help Cambodia and Thailand combat scam operations and drug trafficking, and other programs, DeSombre said.

The Trump administration has made combating the so-called scam centers based in Southeast Asia a priority, as U.S. citizens have been targeted by their financial fraud operations.

Border clashes between Cambodia and Thailand flared up again last month after the collapse of a previous ceasefire deal brokered in July by Trump and Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim to end a previous round of conflict.

The Southeast Asian neighbors agreed on another ceasefire at the end of last year, halting 20 days of fighting that killed at least 101 people and displaced more than half a million on both sides. The more recent clashes included fighter-jet sorties, exchanges of rocket fire and artillery barrages.

Thailand is a long-time U.S. ally, while the United States has sought to improve relations with Cambodia to try to woo it away from strategic rival China.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 08:31:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/RSJQETYPTFJUVLQBN32DYO7BLY.jpg?auth=2c2c98f52619d096eef373d750b17643b11f7ce79ee1dc3cc88aab04e6a92672&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China tops Japanese public's security worries in latest government poll</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-tops-japanese-publics-security-worries-latest-government-poll-2026-01-09/</link><description>TOKYO, Jan 9 (Reuters) - The Japanese public now sees China's growing military power as the country's leading security concern, overtaking the threat posed by North Korean nuclear missiles, a government survey released on Friday showed.

In the survey 68% of 1,534 respondents pointed to advances in Chinese military technology and its activities close to Japan and in the South China Sea as their top security worry, up from 61% when the poll was last conducted three years ago.

The five-week survey began on November 6, a day before Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi sparked the worst diplomatic dispute with Beijing in more than a decade by saying that Tokyo could deploy its forces if a Chinese attack on democratically governed Taiwan was deemed an existential threat to Japan.

China has demanded she retract her remarks , warned its citizens against travelling to Japan and threatened to restrict exports of rare earths, a key component in industrial supply chains. Beijing has also conducted military drills near Japan and, last week, held war games around Taiwan involving missiles, warships and aircraft.

The survey also showed support for Japan's military at an all-time high, with 94% of respondents saying they had a favourable opinion of the Self-Defense Forces.

The poll comes as Takaichi's government prepares to formulate its next defence plan, which is expected to further increase funds for defence.

Under its U.S.-drafted post-war constitution, Japan renounced the right to wage war, but it remains one of the world's biggest military spenders. It is doubling defence outlays to 2% of GDP to deter China from using force to pursue its territorial ambitions in East Asia.

Beijing has accused Japan of stoking regional tensions with its military plans and has warned Tokyo of a "crushing" defeat if it were to intervene over Taiwan, which Beijing claims as its own territory.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 08:31:54 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/MIS3J3ZQRJKV7NQ7AVJ5DOXA3Q.jpg?auth=01fac781bdd2ff1e49f2d0eac3c004dc17e60256993583cfbdedc7b5f15657f7&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China tops Japanese public's security worries in latest government poll</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-tops-japanese-publics-security-worries-latest-government-poll-2026-01-09/</link><description /><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 08:32:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Switzerland marks day of mourning for victims of Crans-Montana fire tragedy</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260109-live-switzerland-holds-memorial-ceremony-victims-crans-montana-fire-tragedy</link><description>All of Switzerland will mark a national day of mourning Friday for the dozens of mostly teenagers killed when fire ravaged a ski resort bar crammed with New Year revellers.

Just over a week after the tragedy at the Le Constellation bar in Crans-Montana, which left 40 dead and 116 injured, the wealthy Alpine nation will come to a standstill for a minute of silence at 2pm (1300 GMT).

A chorus of church bells will then ring throughout the country.

The moment of silence will stand as a "testament to the shared grief felt by the entire nation with all the families and friends directly affected", the Swiss government said in a statement.

At the same time, a memorial ceremony for the victims will be held in Martigny, a town about 50 kilometres (31 miles) down the valley from Crans-Montana, which had been rendered all but inaccessible by a large snowstorm.

Inhabitants of the plush ski resort town will meanwhile be able to watch the ceremony as it is livestreamed to large screens, including at the congress centre that for days after the tragedy accommodated families seeking news of missing loved ones.

A memorial that has sprung up in front of the bar, loaded with flowers, candles and messages of grief and support, was covered in an igloo-like tarp Thursday to protect it from the heavy snowfall.

Swiss President Guy Parmelin, who has declared the fire "one of the worst tragedies that our country has experienced", will be joined for the ceremony by his French and Italian counterparts, whose countries lost nine and six nationals respectively in the fire.

Top officials from Belgium, Luxembourg, Serbia and the European Union were also due to participate in the ceremony.

Most of those impacted by the inferno at Le Constellation were Swiss, but a total of 19 nationalities were among the fatalities and the wounded.

Half of those killed in the blaze were under 18, including some as young as 14.

Of those injured, 83 remain in hospital, with the most severely burned airlifted to specialist centres across Switzerland and abroad.

Prosecutors believe the blaze started when champagne bottles with sparklers attached were raised too close to sound insulation foam on the ceiling in the bar's basement section.

Experts have suggested that what appeared to be highly flammable foam may have caused a so-called flashover – a near-simultaneous ignition of everything in an enclosed space, trapping many of the young patrons.

Video footage which has emerged from the tragedy shows young people desperately trying to flee the scene, some breaking windows to try to force their way out.

On Tuesday, municipal authorities acknowledged that no fire safety inspections had been conducted at Le Constellation since 2019, prompting outrage.

The investigation underway will seek to shed light on the responsibilities of the authorities, but also of bar owners Jacques and Jessica Moretti.

The French couple, facing charges of manslaughter by negligence, bodily harm by negligence and arson by negligence, have been called in for questioning on Friday, sources close to the investigation told AFP.

The pair, who have not been detained, said in a statement Tuesday that they were "devastated and overwhelmed with grief", and pledged their "full cooperation" with investigators.

They will need to answer numerous questions about why so many minors were in the bar, and whether fire safety standards were adhered to.

There has been much focus on the soundproofing foam, which, according to photos taken by the owners, had been added during renovations in 2015.

A video filmed by a member of the public, screened Monday by Swiss broadcaster RTS, showed that the danger was known years ago.

"Watch out for the foam!", a bar employee said during 2019 New Year's Eve celebrations, as champagne bottles with sparklers were brought out.

"This video is staggering," Romain Jordan, a lawyer representing several affected families, told AFP, saying it showed "there was an awareness of this risk – and that possibly this risk was accepted".</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 08:32:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/dc4cd2cc-ed2a-11f0-8c43-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-07T110415Z-489520278-RC2AWIAYPPYA-RTRMADP-3-SWISS-BLAST.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US border agent shoots and wounds two people in Portland</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-federal-agents-shot-two-people-portland-abc-affiliate-reports-2026-01-08/</link><description>Jan 8 (Reuters) - A U.S. immigration agent shot and wounded a man and a woman in Portland, Oregon, authorities said on Thursday, leading city and state officials to call for calm given public outrage over the ICE shooting death of a Minnesota woman a day earlier.

"We understand the heightened emotion and tension many are feeling in the wake of the shooting in Minneapolis, but I am asking the community to remain calm as we work to learn more," Portland police chief Bob Day said in a statement.

The Portland shooting unfolded Thursday afternoon as U.S. Border Patrol agents were conducting a targeted vehicle stop, the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement.

The statement said the driver, a suspected Venezuelan gang member, attempted to "weaponize" his vehicle and run over the agents. In response, DHS said, "an agent fired a defensive shot" and the driver and a passenger drove away.

Reuters was unable to independently verify the circumstances of the incident.

Portland police said in a statement that the shooting took place near a medical clinic in the eastern part of the city.

Six minutes after arriving at the scene and determining federal agents were involved, police were informed that two people with gunshot wounds - a man and a woman - were asking for help at a location about 2 miles (3 km) to the northeast of the medical clinic.

Police said they applied tourniquets to the man and woman, who were taken to a hospital. Their condition was unknown.

Portland and Oregon leaders said at a news conference Thursday evening that they had no details on what led to the shootings, including whether the violence was linked to immigration enforcement.

While they said the FBI was investigating, Portland Mayor Keith Wilson and Oregon Governor Tina Kotek, both Democrats, called for a pause in the federal immigration crackdown pending a full and independent investigation.

"There was a time when we could take them at their word," Wilson said of how federal officials had described the shooting. "That time is long past."

At the same news conference, state Senator Kayse Jama, who arrived in the U.S. 28 years ago as a refugee from Somalia, addressed federal immigration agents: "We do not need you, you are not welcome, you need to get the hell out of our community."

Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield said late on Thursday that his office is opening a formal investigation into the incident to look into whether "any federal officer acted outside the scope of their lawful authority."

"We have been clear about our concerns with excessive use of force by federal agents in Portland and nationally," Rayfield said.

The shooting came a day after a federal agent from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), a separate agency from the Border Patrol within the Department of Homeland Security, fatally shot a 37-year-old mother of three in her car in Minneapolis.

That shooting has prompted two days of protests in Minneapolis.

Officers from both ICE and Border Patrol have been deployed in cities across the U.S. as part of Republican President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown.

While the aggressive enforcement operations have been cheered by the president's supporters, Democrats and civil rights activists have decried them as unnecessary provocation.

U.S. officials contend criminal suspects and anti-Trump activists have increasingly used their cars as weapons, though video evidence has sometimes contradicted their claims.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 09:28:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WPRY3PERWNLWPCSRDMT6WVC6IA.jpg?auth=ac896ef15d6c6e03021964289bd4ca712daab252249a46317f89fdcc80762b6b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran's Supreme Leader to give speech about protests shortly, state TV says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/irans-supreme-leader-give-speech-about-protests-few-minutes-state-tv-2026-01-09/</link><description>Jan 9 (Reuters) - Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei will give a speech in a few minutes on "the terrorist actions" in the country, Iranian state TV reported on Friday, as protests over economic hardships continued nationwide.

A countrywide internet blackout was reported in Iran on Thursday and extended into Friday, internet monitoring group NetBlocks said. It coincided with calls for more protests from Reza Pahlavi, the long-exiled son of Iran's last shah who was toppled in the 1979 Islamic Revolution.

Starting in Tehran with shopkeepers in the Grand Bazaar angered by a sharp slide in the rial currency, the latest protests now involve others - mainly young men rather than the women and girls who played a key role in 2022-23.

The U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency has reported at least 34 protesters and four security personnel killed, and 2,200 arrested during the unrest, which analysts say highlights deeper disillusionment with the status quo.

Authorities have tried to maintain a dual approach to the unrest, saying protests over the economy are legitimate and will be met by dialogue, while responding to some demonstrations with tear gas amid violent street confrontations.

Nearly five decades after the Islamic Revolution, Iran's Shi'ite Muslim clerical rulers are struggling to bridge the gap between its priorities and the expectations of a young society.

In the ongoing unrest, many protesters are venting anger over Iran's support for militants around the Middle East, chanting "Not Gaza, not Lebanon, my life for Iran" in frustration over the authorities' perceived neglect of domestic problems.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 09:29:39 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HVEXFIO5DBNW3MV4JZ6J7TJJCE.jpg?auth=35e43fea6a5cfac3f17359455cf2fd1f66a5df7e0ed17a77789165f9c2684698&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>What is the Oreshnik missile?</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/what-is-oreshnik-missile-that-russia-has-fired-ukraine-2026-01-09/</link><description>Jan 9 (Reuters) - Russia said on Friday it had fired an Oreshnik missile at Ukraine. Here's what to know about this weapon.

The Oreshnik, whose name means Hazel Tree, is an intermediate-range hypersonic ballistic missile that Russia has fired only once before against Ukraine, in November 2024. On that occasion it was equipped only with dummy warheads and therefore caused limited damage, Ukrainian sources said, in what was effectively a test. If the overnight attack carried explosive warheads, it would mark the first time that Russia has used the Oreshnik with full destructive intent. The strike targeted what Russia called critical infrastructure in Ukraine, though the extent of the damage was not immediately clear.

Experts say the novel feature of the Oreshnik is that it can carry multiple warheads capable of simultaneously striking different targets - usually associated with longer-range intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs).

The missile is based on the RS-26 Rubezh, which Russia had originally developed as an intercontinental missile.

Like many Russian weapons systems, it is capable of carrying nuclear as well as conventional warheads, but there was no suggestion of any nuclear component to the overnight attack.

Ukraine said the missile fired in 2024 took about 15 minutes to reach its target after being launched from southern Russia, and reached a speed of about 13,600 kph (8,450 mph).

Russian President Vladimir Putin has claimed that the Oreshnik is impossible to intercept and that it has destructive power comparable to that of a nuclear weapon, even when fitted with a conventional warhead.

Some Western experts have said those claims are exaggerated. In December 2024, a U.S. official said the weapon was not seen as a game-changer on the battlefield, calling it experimental in nature and saying Russia likely possessed only a handful.

Since 2024, Russia has put the Oreshnik into serial production and also supplied it to its ally Belarus.

The Russian military said it fired the Oreshnik in response to what Moscow says was an attempted Ukrainian drone attack late last year on one of Putin's residences in Novgorod, northern Russia. Ukraine said Russia was lying, and that no such attack took place.

Putin had previously threatened to use the Oreshnik, including against "decision-making centres" in Kyiv, if Ukraine continued to attack Russia with long-range Western weapons, but had refrained from doing so until now.

The overnight attack was directed against the Lviv region of western Ukraine, which borders NATO member Poland. Ukraine's foreign minister called it a "global threat" that demanded a global response.

The escalation comes as U.S. President Donald Trump struggles to persuade Russia and Ukraine to agree a peace deal to end the war that began with Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 09:30:33 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/JGKXHFVR2BJLXCENWG3PUJGGUA.jpg?auth=c3c1263ed305fd2bc6ac5c98b7f7446e1cdbfbd67bc8cebccaa203e715b84dd3&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>EU countries expected to clear signing of record Mercosur trade deal</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/eu-countries-expected-clear-signing-record-mercosur-trade-deal-2026-01-09/</link><description>BRUSSELS, Jan 9 (Reuters) - EU nations are expected on Friday to approve the signing of the bloc's largest ever free trade accord with South American group Mercosur, over 25 years since negotiations began and after months of wrangling to secure key member states' backing.

The European Commission, which concluded negotiations a year ago, and countries such as Germany and Spain argue it is a vital part of an EU push to unlock new markets to offset business lost from U.S. tariffs and to reduce reliance on China by securing access to critical minerals.

Opponents led by France, the European Union's largest agricultural producer, say the agreement will jack up imports of cheap food products, including beef, poultry and sugar, undercutting domestic farmers. Farmers have launched protests across the EU, blockading French roads on Thursday.

Ambassadors from the EU's 27 member states are due to indicate their governments' positions on Friday, with 15 countries representing 65% of the bloc's total population required for approval. EU capitals would then give written confirmation later on Friday or on Monday.

This will clear the way for Commission President Ursula von der Leyen to sign the agreement with Mercosur partners - Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. The European Parliament will also need to approve the accord before it can enter force.

The free trade agreement would be the European Union's biggest in terms of tariff reduction, removing 4 billion euros ($4.66 billion) of duties on its exports. The Mercosur countries have high tariffs, such as 35% on car parts, 28% on dairy products and 27% on wines.

The EU and Mercosur will hope to expand evenly split goods trade worth 111 billion euros in 2024. EU exports are dominated by machinery, chemicals and transport equipment, and Mercosur's are focused on agricultural products, minerals, pulp and paper.

To win over deal sceptics, the European Commission has put in place safeguards that can suspend imports of sensitive farm produce. It has strengthened import controls, notably regarding pesticide residues, established a crisis fund, accelerated support for farmers, and has pledged to cut import duties on fertilisers .

The concessions were not enough to win over Poland or France, but Italy appears to have shifted from a 'no' in December to a 'yes' on Friday.

French Agriculture Minister Annie Genevard has said the battle is not over and has pledged to fight for a rejection by the EU assembly, where the vote could be tight. European environmental groups also oppose the accord, with Friends of the Earth calling it a "climate-wrecking" deal.

German Social Democrat Bernd Lange, the chair of parliament's trade committee, expressed confidence that the deal would be passed, with a final vote most likely in April or May.

Jean-Noel Barrot's comments come amid increasing frustration among some of Washington's allies over how President Donald Trump's "America First" foreign and trade policies have upended traditional relationships and alliances.

"In just a few months, the new U.S administration has decided to rethink the ties that bind us. That is its right. And it is also our right to say no to an historic ally, however historic it may be, when its proposal is unacceptable," Jean-Noel Barrot said in an annual speech to French ambassadors.

Trump's coveting of Greenland, the autonomous, mineral-rich Danish territory that he says the U.S. needs for its national security, is the latest policy stance to alarm Europeans, who are scrambling to assess how to respond to the threat.

Barrot appeared to cast the U.S. as a threat on a par with President Vladimir Putin's Russia, whose forces have invaded Ukraine, saying Europe was being assailed from the outside by "adversaries" trying to unravel historic bonds.

"They dream of exploiting our divisions once again, as they have done for centuries. They are already beginning to test the strength of our Union through threats and coercion, as evidenced by territorial incursions on our eastern flank, trade blackmail, and claims to Greenland, which is not for sale," he said.

Barrot was speaking two days after Germany's President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, in unusually strong comments, spoke of a "breakdown of values by our most important partner, the USA" and said the world risked being turned into a "den of robbers, where the most unscrupulous take whatever they want".

With a French presidential election in less than 18 months, Barrot criticised efforts to back "political forces that want to turn their backs on the European heritage" - a clear reference to U.S. support for far-right parties in Europe.

Barrot also slammed U.S. sanctions imposed on European anti-disinformation campaigners and former European Union officials, including ex-commissioner Thierry Breton, over what Washington says were attempts to censor U.S. social media platforms.

"These are... in reality a challenge to our ability to choose our own rules within our own borders," he said, adding that France would resist such pressure.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 09:53:27 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ZYSR7VHYSBJ3ROFRAD5EFQKVHI.jpg?auth=51cdb49664f8367a8e1b24008ff2838ac48f75dcc8fea7d605c446faccc0cead&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>South Korea's ex-President Yoon faces potential death sentence request in trial</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/south-koreas-ex-president-yoon-faces-potential-death-sentence-request-trial-2026-01-09/</link><description>SEOUL, Jan 9 (Reuters) - South Korea's special prosecutor is expected to make a sentencing request for former president Yoon Suk Yeol on charges of insurrection over his brief imposition of martial law in 2024, as a lower court trial convened on Friday for its final session.

Yoon, who is accused of masterminding an insurrection, could face the death penalty or life in prison under South Korean law if found guilty. South Korea has followed an unofficial moratorium for nearly 30 years and has not executed a death-row inmate since 1997.

In hearings at the Seoul Central District Court, prosecutors have alleged Yoon and then-defence minister, Kim Yong-hyun, began devising a scheme as far back as October 2023 to suspend parliament and take over legislative powers.

Prosecutors allege Yoon sought to brand political opponents - including then-opposition leader Lee Jae Myung - as "anti-state forces" and detain them.

The then president and Kim also tried to manufacture a pretext for martial law by escalating tensions with North Korea through a covert drone operation , prosecutors have said.

While the botched bid to impose martial law lasted only about six hours, it sent shockwaves through Asia's fourth-largest economy, a key U.S. security ally and long considered one of Asia's most resilient democracies.

Yoon, 65, has denied the charges. The conservative has argued it was within his powers as president to declare martial law and that the action was aimed at sounding the alarm over opposition parties' obstruction of government.

Dressed in a dark suit and white shirt and appearing noticeably thinner than at the start of the trial in February, Yoon sat with seven other defendants including Kim and legal counsel.

The session opened earlier than usual for defence arguments, followed by the prosecutors' final arguments and sentencing requests relating to each of the defendants.

The court is expected to rule in February, capping more than a year of political upheaval following Yoon's martial law declaration on December 3, 2024, which was revoked within hours after lawmakers scaled fences to break through a security cordon around the National Assembly to vote.

Yoon was later impeached and removed from office by the Constitutional Court and a snap presidential election in June last year brought liberal-leaning Lee Jae Myung to power.

Yoon faces a string of other criminal charges, including obstructing the execution of an arrest warrant and abuse of power.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 09:53:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/SDST3LAVT5OLRL7SZHS4EMR43I.jpg?auth=95e48f5a4a2e84c274baa07d1e86c43fa4d24997a5dcc728e8b918a75e1a124c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Pope Leo decries 'diplomacy based on force' in speech to Vatican envoys</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/pope-leo-decries-diplomacy-based-force-speech-vatican-envoys-2026-01-09/</link><description>VATICAN CITY, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Pope Leo decried the use of military force by countries wishing to achieve diplomatic goals on Friday, saying the weakness of international organizations in the face of global conflicts was "a particular cause for concern."

Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei accused protesters of acting on behalf of U.S. President Donald Trump, saying rioters were attacking public properties and warning that Tehran would not tolerate people acting as "mercenaries for foreigners".

The protests that began over soaring inflation in the Islamic Republic late last month have spiralled into the biggest for three years, with unrest reported in every province and rights groups documenting dozens of deaths.

Iran's fragmented external opposition factions called for more protests on Friday with Reza Pahlavi, exiled son of the late ruling shah, telling Iranians in a social media post: "The eyes of the world are upon you. Take to the streets."

Trump, who bombed Iran last summer and who last week warned Tehran it could come to the protesters' aid, said on Friday he would not meet Pahlavi and was "not sure that it would be appropriate" to back him.

The images published by state television overnight showed what it said were burning buses, cars and motorbikes as well as fires at metro stations and banks. It accused the People's Mujahedin Organisation, an opposition faction that splintered off after the 1979 Islamic Revolution and also known as the MKO, of being behind the unrest.

A state television journalist standing in front of the fires on Shariati Street in the Caspian Sea port of Rasht said "this looks like a war zone - all the shops have been destroyed".

Iran has quelled far bigger bouts of unrest before, but it now faces a graver economic situation and intensifying international pressure with global sanctions over its nuclear programme reimposed since September.

A French diplomatic source on Friday said Iran should show maximum restraint towards protesters.

The protests have not yet approached the scale of nationwide demonstrations in late 2022 over women's rights following the death in custody of a Kurdish woman, Mahsa Amini, but they pose the biggest internal challenge to the authorities since then.

The authorities have attempted a dual approach - describing protests over the economy as legitimate while condemning what they call violent rioters and cracking down with security forces.

"Last night in Tehran, a bunch of vandals and rioters came and destroyed a building that belonged to the state, to the people themselves, just to please the heart of the president of the United States," Khamenei said, urging Trump to "manage your own country".

While the initial protests were focused on the economy, with the rial currency losing half its value against the dollar last year and inflation topping 40% in December, they have morphed to include slogans directly against the authorities.

Protesters have chanted slogans including "Death to the dictator" and praising the former monarchy that was toppled in 1979. The extent of support inside Iran for the monarchy or for the MKO, the most vocal groups among émigré Iranians, is disputed.

Most of the demonstrators seen in videos viewed by Reuters, many of which it has been unable to verify, have been young men.

Iran blocked off the internet overnight. Reuters reporters trying to place phone calls to Iran from abroad were unable to do so on Friday.

At least six flights between Dubai and Iranian cities scheduled for Friday were cancelled, the Dubai Airport website showed.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 10:24:19 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/2MFOTYODRNOPNEEM7LBT3W7WAY.jpg?auth=01406f2e17012aff4bfa67deb51e59f34a6fddf80f86c774a2e8abd7130f4804&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>French opposition parties seek to topple government over Mercosur</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/french-opposition-parties-seek-topple-government-over-mercosur-2026-01-09/</link><description>PARIS, Jan 9 (Reuters) - France's far-right and far-left opposition parties will launch no-confidence motions against France's weak minority government in response to the likely approval on Friday of the EU's Mercosur trade deal.

The far-left France Unbowed (LFI) party said it would file a no-confidence motion on Friday morning, while the far-right National Rally (RN) said it would also launch one against the European Commission chief in Brussels.

The no-confidence motions underline the domestic political blowback French President Emmanuel Macron's government faces over the trade deal with South American nations as it battles to pass an already-late 2026 budget through a truculent parliament.

It seems unlikely the RN and LFI will muster enough votes in parliament to oust the government, led by Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu. Still, their threats underline the perilous political tightrope Macron's administration continues to walk just over a year before the 2027 presidential election.

Macron says France will vote against the Mercosur accord. However, the treaty only requires qualified majority support among EU member states for the deal to be signed by the European Commission and the South American bloc. The European Parliament would then need to ratify the accord.

In a post on X late on Thursday, RN party president Jordan Bardella said Macron's pledge not to vote in favour of the deal was mere posturing amounting to "a betrayal of French farmers."

In a separate X post, RN party chief Marine Le Pen called on Macron "to announce, if necessary, the suspension of France's contribution to the European Union budget."

LFI lower house chief Mathilde Panot said on X that France had been "humiliated" by Brussels and on the world stage.

"Lecornu and Macron must go," she wrote.

Lecornu said the motions of no confidence were sending a negative signal abroad at a time France should be trying to display unity to convince other European nations and was delaying talks to agree on a budget.

"Tabling a motion of no-confidence in this context... is choosing to weaken France's voice rather than show national unity in defence of our agriculture," Lecornu posted on X.

EU nations are expected on Friday to approve the signing of the bloc's largest ever free trade accord with Mercosur.

Supporters, including Germany and Spain, argue it is a vital part of an EU push to unlock new markets to offset business lost from U.S. tariffs and to reduce reliance on China.

Opponents led by France, the European Union's largest agricultural producer, say the agreement will jack up imports of cheap food products, undercutting domestic farmers.

French farmers staged a new protest on Friday against the deal. The Confederation Paysanne farmers' lobby group had tractors driving slowly to block traffic on the main highway route around Paris on Friday, with one tractor carrying the slogan 'Stop the EU-Mercosur Agreement!'</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 10:25:08 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HU6KK4ABBNNBZOO7XC6AQTZGAA.jpg?auth=775dec17de6c96bf16913aa2cc060723385b90bc1fdb4f6c8cda82e7fd6ac6be&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Kurdish councils in Syria's Aleppo reject evacuation call</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/kurdish-councils-syrias-aleppo-reject-evacuation-call-2026-01-09/</link><description>Jan 9 (Reuters) - Kurdish councils in Syria's Aleppo said on Friday they would not evacuate neighbourhoods under their control as part of a ceasefire deal to end days of fighting between Kurdish forces and Syrian government fighters.

The FAO Food Price Index, which tracks a basket of globally traded food commodities, averaged 124.3 points in December, down from 125.1 in November and 2.3% lower than a year earlier.

For the full 2025 year, the index averaged 127.2 points, up 4.3% from 2024, as higher world prices for vegetable oils and dairy products outweighed declines in cereal and sugar quotations.

The dairy index declined by 4.4% in December, driven by a steep drop in butter prices following increased cream availability in Europe. However, for 2025 as a whole, dairy prices averaged 13.2% above 2024, reflecting strong import demand and limited exportable supplies earlier in the year.

Meat prices dipped 1.3% last month, led by falls in bovine and poultry categories, but the full-year index remained 5.1% above the previous year's value, supported by strong global demand and uncertainty linked to animal diseases and geopolitical tensions, the FAO said.

Vegetable oil prices eased 0.2% in December to a six-month low, as weaker soy, rapeseed and sunflower oil quotations offset gains in palm oil. For the whole of 2025, the vegetable oil index averaged 17.1% higher than in 2024, reaching a three-year high amid tight global supplies.

The FAO Cereal Price Index rose 1.7% in December with wheat supported by renewed concerns over Black Sea export flows, and maize buoyed by strong ethanol production in both Brazil and the United States.

For the whole of 2025, the cereal index averaged 4.9% below its 2024 level, its third consecutive annual decline and the lowest annual average since 2020.

Sugar prices rose 2.4% in December after three consecutive monthly declines, mainly due to lower production in Brazil's southern regions.

The sugar index reached a five-year low for 2025, down 17% from 2024, as global supplies remained plentiful.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 10:26:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/S2QOCJCST5N45HIWAIK4MGOEYM.jpg?auth=898baef623f9c723b4c052ea2db0f677c1c05acb441c57dc89b0c2f8d3a0524e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>World food prices dip in December but still up in 2025, UN's FAO says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/world-food-prices-dip-december-still-up-2025-uns-fao-says-2026-01-09/</link><description /><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 10:26:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Spain arrests dozens of suspected 'Black Axe' crime ring members</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/spain-arrests-dozens-suspected-black-axe-crime-ring-members-2026-01-09/</link><description>MADRID, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Spanish police have arrested 34 people in a nationwide operation against an international crime ring known as "Black Axe" on accusations of fraud, money laundering and document forgery, Europol said on Friday.

Black Axe originated in Nigeria as a student confraternity in the late 1970s and has since evolved into a structured, violent criminal organisation dealing mainly in cyber-enabled financial crime.

The arrests were carried out across several Spanish provinces from Seville in the south to Barcelona in the northeast with support from Europol, the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation.

Europol said the operation was coordinated with authorities in Germany as part of a wider investigation.

The organised crime network allegedly recruited money mules in impoverished areas of Spain with high unemployment rates.

"Most of these vulnerable individuals are Spanish nationals and are exploited to facilitate the network's criminal activities," Europol said in a statement.

Investigators estimate that the network had defrauded its victims of more than 5.9 million euros ($6.87 million).

Moscow said it had fired the Oreshnik missile in response to what it has described as an attempted drone attack on one of President Vladimir Putin's residences last month, which Ukraine has denied and the United States has said did not happen.

It was only the second time Russia has fired the Oreshnik at Ukraine, and came amid a night of air attacks that Ukrainian authorities said also killed four people in Kyiv, knocked out power in the capital and damaged the Qatari embassy there.

The Oreshnik, designed to project power across Europe and which Moscow says is impossible to intercept, is capable of carrying nuclear warheads although there was no suggestion it had done so.

"Such a strike close to EU and NATO border is a grave threat to the security on the European continent and a test for the transatlantic community,” Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha said on X.

"It is absurd that Russia attempts to justify this strike with the fake 'Putin residence attack' that never happened," he added. "Putin uses an IRBM near EU and NATO border in response to his own hallucinations — this is truly a global threat. And it demands global responses."

Kyiv has called Russia's allegation it attacked Putin's residence in the Novgorod region of northern Russia on December 29 "an absurd lie" to sabotage peace talks. U.S. President Donald Trump has said he does not believe it happened, although something else happened in the area.

The Oreshnik hit the Lviv region in western Ukraine, around 60 kilometres (40 miles) from the border with Poland. Moscow said it hit a drone factory and energy infrastructure. Ukrainian officials said it hit unspecified infrastructure; local media reported that it struck a large underground gas storage site.

Russia fired a total of 242 drones and 36 missiles, including Oreshnik, to hit infrastructure in the western Lviv region and in and around the capital Kyiv, Ukraine said.

Authorities said at least four people were killed and more than 20 injured by the strikes on Kyiv, which knocked out electricity to more than half a million homes in the capital. Water and heat were cut off, with temperatures around -10 degrees Celsius (14°F) and heavy snow.

There was no immediate word from Qatar about reports of damage to the building housing its embassy in Kyiv. Qatar has occasionally acted as a mediator in the conflict.

The Oreshnik was fired just before midnight, according to Lviv regional officials. The Ukrainian military said the missile was moving at a speed of 13,000 km per hour.

"The strike's targets were hit," Russia's Defence Ministry said in a statement, describing the targets as a factory producing drones used in the alleged attack against Putin's residence, as well as energy infrastructure.

Russian war correspondents released video purportedly showing the moment the Oreshnik struck its target in western Ukraine. Filmed across a snow-covered landscape, what looked like six flashes were seen striking the ground followed by a loud bang and a series of detonations. Reuters could not immediately verify the authenticity of the video.

Moscow first fired an Oreshnik – Russian for "hazel tree" - against what it said was a military factory in Ukraine in November 2024. On that occasion Ukrainian sources said the missile was carrying dummy warheads, not explosives, and caused limited damage.

Ukrainian and U.S. envoys, joined by a coalition of Ukraine's allies, have been negotiating in Paris this week to iron out remaining disagreements in a peace framework Washington is seeking to thrash out with Kyiv before presenting it to Russia.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 10:50:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/3GUDOO4WPZL5LLP3D3ZLVITMME.jpg?auth=08f786a3f91ef0a8e84a4973907a6a0b997435e50fa4669ad239bbe2ee4dc492&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Swiss prosecutors summon owners of ski resort bar after deadly blaze</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/swiss-prosecutors-summon-owners-ski-resort-bar-after-deadly-blaze-2026-01-09/</link><description>SION, Switzerland, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Swiss prosecutors summoned on Friday the owners of a ski resort bar where a fire on New Year's Day killed 40 people, amid growing criticism that the couple is still at large.

The prosecutors are investigating the French owners on suspicion of crimes including homicide by negligence, while victims' families have filed legal complaints over the blaze at the "Le Constellation" bar in the town of Crans-Montana.

The owners, Jacques and Jessica Moretti, did not answer reporters' questions as they entered the prosecutors' office in the nearby town of Sion on Friday, which Swiss authorities have designated a national day of mourning over the tragedy.

The couple have expressed their grief over the fire and said they would cooperate fully with the investigation. More than half of the 40 people killed in the blaze were teenagers and a further 116 people were injured, many of them seriously.

"We are devastated and overcome with grief, our thoughts are constantly with the victims, their loved-ones who have been bereaved so brutally and prematurely, and all those who are fighting for their lives," they said in a January 6 statement.

Prosecutors said last weekend that the legal criteria to detain the couple had so far not been met.

Witnesses and prosecutors have said the blaze appeared to have been started by the use of sparkling candles that set foam soundproofing on the basement ceiling alight.

Questions remain about oversight at the bar, which the local mayor admitted this week had missed multiple safety checks.

Twenty-one of the dead were from Switzerland , seven from France, and six from Italy. There was also a Swiss-French dual national and a French-British-Israeli national.

The presidents of France and Italy are expected to attend Friday's ceremony in the nearby town of Martigny to mark the tragedy and remember the victims.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 10:50:47 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7XLGTPIENRP4LBQGA76XERVLUE.jpg?auth=eaf695f31d2a1feb85b6a41e7a6964d78528947464c181265d943bdd2aed2e2b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Yemen's southern separatists have disbanded, delegate to talks in Saudia Arabia says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/yemens-southern-separatists-have-disbanded-delegate-talks-saudia-arabia-says-2026-01-09/</link><description>DUBAI, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Yemen's main southern separatist group has decided to disband, one of its members said in a statement broadcast on state media on Friday in Saudi Arabia, where a delegation from the group, which appears to be splitting, has been attending peace talks.

There was no immediate comment from those members of the separatist group - the Southern Transitional Council (STC) - who are not taking part in the Riyadh talks, which were aimed at ending a crisis between Gulf powers Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates over developments in Yemen .

The UAE -backed leader of STC, Aidarous al-Zubaidi, fled Yemen on Wednesday instead of heading to Saudi Arabia for the talks, which follow a sweeping advance through southern Yemen by the STC close to Saudi Arabia's border, which angered the Saudi government.

The Saudi-led coalition later said he had escaped with the help of UAE officers on a flight that ultimately landed at a military airport in Abu Dhabi.

A member of the delegation in Riyadh read a statement outlining the decision to disband the group on Saudi Arabia's state al Ekhbariya TV and media in Yemen.

The STC had said it had lost contact with all members of the delegation in Riyadh, indicating a split was emerging within the group.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 10:51:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CRJ2WKRJUBM5NKDJLV3ONIF5UQ.jpg?auth=0531549c42eccba4def23b076a73176ee52f795019c411b46e010fc40d11afb8&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israeli military says it is attacking Hezbollah targets in several areas in Lebanon</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-military-says-it-is-attacking-hezbollah-targets-several-areas-lebanon-2026-01-09/</link><description>Jan 9 (Reuters) - Israeli military said on Friday it is attacking Hezbollah targets in several areas in Lebanon.

Cebu city Mayor Nestor Archival said in a Facebook post that search and rescue operations were ongoing at the Binaliw landfill, where 110 workers were on site when the accident occurred at 4:17 p.m. on January 8.

Photos shared by the mayor on Facebook showed that several structures at the site, including facilities operated by the landfill operator, were damaged during the collapse.

Archival said disaster response units, police, fire brigades, and the military have been deployed, along with ambulances, fire trucks and lighting towers.

Officials are coordinating with national agencies and landfill management to assess the situation and provide assistance to the families of victims, he said.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 10:51:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>At least one killed, dozens missing in landfill collapse in central Philippines</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/least-one-killed-dozens-missing-landfill-collapse-central-philippines-2026-01-09/</link><description /><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 10:52:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Venezuela releases imprisoned opposition figures and activists</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/venezuela-releases-imprisoned-opposition-figures-and-activists</link><description /><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 10:52:49 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/54d74dd2-ed3d-11f0-be1a-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260109-080527-080719-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Khamenei says Iran 'will not back down' in face of 'saboteurs'</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260109-khamenei-says-iran-will-not-back-down-in-face-of-saboteurs</link><description>Iran 's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Friday insisted that the Islamic Republic would "not back down" in the face of protesters who he called "vandals" and "saboteurs", in a speech broadcast on state TV.

Speaking to supporters in his first comments on the escalating protests, Khamenei said US President Donald Trump 's hands "are stained with the blood of more than a thousand Iranians" and predicted the "arrogant" US leader would be "overthrown" like the imperial dynasty that ruled Iran up to the 1979 revolution.

The Iranian leader's snap speech came as protesters shouted and marched through the streets into Friday morning despite the regime cutting off internet and telephone services.

Short online videos shared by activists purported to show protesters chanting against Iran’s government around bonfires as debris littered the streets in the capital, Tehran, and other areas.

Iranian state media broke its silence Friday over the protests, alleging “terrorist agents” of the US and Israel set fires and sparked violence. It also said there were “casualties", without elaborating.

The full scope of the demonstrations could not be immediately determined due to the communications blackout, though it represented yet another escalation in protests that began over Iran’s ailing economy and that has morphed into the most significant challenge to the government in several years. The protests have intensified steadily since beginning December 28.

Iran's fragmented external opposition factions ​called for more protests on Friday evening with Reza Pahlavi, exiled son of the late ruling shah, telling Iranians in a ​social media post: "The eyes of the world are upon you. Take to the streets."

Demonstrations have included cries in support of the shah, something that could bring a death sentence in the past but now underlines the anger fueling the protests that began over Iran’s ailing economy.

So far, violence around the demonstrations has killed at least 42 people while more than 2,270 others have been detained, said the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency.

Internet monitor Netblocks said authorities had imposed a total connectivity blackout late Thursday and added early Friday that the country has "now been offline for 12 hours ... in an attempt to suppress sweeping protests".

AFP verified videos of crowds of people, as well as vehicles honking in support, filling a part of the vast Ayatollah Kashani Boulevard late on Thursday.

The crowd could be heard chanting "death to the dictator" in reference to Khamenei who has ruled the Islamic Republic since 1989.

Other videos showed significant protests in other cities, including Tabriz in the north and the holy city of Mashhad in the east as well as the Kurdish-populated west of the country, including the regional hub Kermanshah.

Several videos said protesters had set fire to the entrance to the regional branch of state television in the central city of Isfahan. It was not immediately possible to verify the images.

Flames were also seen in the governor's building in Shazand, the capital of the Markazi province in central Iran, after protesters gathered outside, other videos showed.

The protests late Thursday were the biggest in Iran since 2022-2023 rallies nationwide sparked by the custody death of Mahsa Amini , who had been arrested for allegedly violating the Islamic Republic's strict dress code.

Iran has faced rounds of nationwide protests in recent years. As sanctions tightened and Iran struggled after the 12-day war, its rial currency collapsed in December, reaching 1.4 million to $1. Protests began soon after, with demonstrators chanting against Iran’s theocracy.

It remains unclear why Iranian officials have yet to crack down harder on the demonstrators. Trump warned last week that if Tehran “violently kills peaceful protesters", America “will come to their rescue".

In an interview with talk show host Hugh Hewitt aired Thursday, Trump reiterated his pledge.

Iran has “been told very strongly, even more strongly than I’m speaking to you right now, that if they do that, they’re going to have to pay hell", Trump said.

Trump demurred when asked if he’d meet with Pahlavi.

“I’m not sure that it would be appropriate at this point to do that as president,” Trump said. “I think that we should let everybody go out there, and we see who emerges.”

Speaking in an interview with Sean Hannity aired Thursday night on Fox News, Trump went as far as to suggest 86-year-old Khamenei may be looking to leave Iran.

“He's looking to go someplace,” Trump said. “It's getting very bad.”</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 10:52:52 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/82d51986-ed37-11f0-91e1-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/05fbcacf9e2755337547defa2a68b5406a6be8e7.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Before fatal ICE shooting, Minnesota had become Trump target</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/before-fatal-ice-shooting-minnesota-had-become-trump-target-2026-01-09/</link><description>Jan 9 (Reuters) - Months before a U.S. immigration agent fatally shot a motorist in Minnesota on Wednesday, President Donald Trump had fixated on the state, repeatedly criticizing its Democratic leaders and the large Somali-American community there.

The president called Somali immigrants “garbage ,” railed against a sprawling welfare-fraud scandal and ridiculed Governor Tim Walz, a Democrat who ran on the party’s ticket in the 2024 presidential election against Trump. Minneapolis also was one of several Democratic-led cities subject to major immigration crackdowns.

The agent who shot Renee Nicole Good , 37 and a U.S. citizen, was among 2,000 federal officers flagged for deployment to the Minneapolis–St. Paul area, home to the largest Somali diaspora in the United States. The Department of Homeland Security has called the operation its most expansive ever. The agent’s name has not been released by DHS.

The shooting, which inflamed the already charged political climate and sparked protests , unfolded against a backdrop of what political analysts describe as mounting animus toward a state led by Walz, whose conflict with the president traces to the unrest that followed George Floyd's killing by a Minneapolis police officer in 2020 during Trump’s first term.

"There's no secret that the president of the United States does not like Governor Walz and has paid particular attention to the fraud that occurred here," said Marc Osler, a professor at the University of St. Thomas School of Law in Minneapolis.

Osler said Minnesota seems to "trigger" Trump in several ways, pointing to his repeated attacks on Representative Ilhan Omar, a Somali-American Democrat representing a Minneapolis district, and his losses in all three presidential elections there.

The White House has defended the shooting of Good as self-defense by a law enforcement officer merely doing his job and says the recent surge in federal resources to Minnesota was aimed at rooting out fraud.

White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said President Trump's "only motivation is doing what’s best for the American people."

Trump spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said in a news conference on Thursday that DHS would "continue to operate on the ground in Minnesota, not only to remove criminal illegal aliens, but also to continue conducting door-to-door investigations of the rampant fraud that has taken place in the state."

Launched in December, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operation in the Minneapolis area follows similarly controversial deportation efforts in Los Angeles, Chicago, Charlotte and New Orleans - all Democratic strongholds.

While California and Illinois governors Gavin Newsom and JB Pritzker emerged from their battles with Trump with larger national profiles, Walz this week said he would end his bid for a third term to focus on welfare fraud allegations that have become a rallying point for Trump and his Republican allies.

Nearly 100 people have been charged with felonies for what federal prosecutors say was an abuse by some nonprofit groups of Minnesota's social service programs. Most of the people prosecuted are from the area's Somali community.

Mike Griffin, a community organizer in Minneapolis, said he believes Trump and his allies are putting a new spotlight on a fraud scandal that dates to the Biden administration to paint the city as corrupt and justify his immigration crackdown.

"We can make sure that we end waste, fraud and abuse, but also make sure that we're supporting our immigrant communities and supporting civilians," Griffin told Reuters. "We can focus on those two things, but those are two separate conversations."

Griffin was one of the thousands of protesters who gathered in the streets of Minneapolis on Wednesday night calling for a prosecution of the agent who killed Good.

In a press conference on Thursday, Walz said he would push for the state to be part of the federal investigation into the shooting and that Minnesotans would not accept an investigation where U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem is the "judge, jury and executioner."

"This is a brazen use of force. They want us to bend the knee. They want us to capitulate," Walz said.

Dan Myers, an associate professor of political science at the University of Minnesota, said the showdown between the federal government and the state reflects a second Trump term marked by a more aggressive use of executive power.

Trump, Myers said, has pushed "well past the boundaries of executive authority," using the machinery of the federal government to target political adversaries, even as some states have so far managed to push back.

Francesca Taylor, who lives near where Good was shot, told Reuters she believed the Trump administration was targeting her city and state because of their openness to immigrants and other marginalized groups.

“I think it’s easy for the Trump administration to target a state that’s politically opposed to them,” she said, adding, “Trump hates Tim Walz.”

Dan Hofrenning, a political science professor at St. Olaf College in Minnesota, said it remains to be seen if the administration can retain enough political support to continue its surge of federal resources to Minnesota after the shooting.

"The political question of the hour is: how is it playing out for Donald Trump?" Hofrenning said. "There seems to be growing opposition to the aggressive ICE tactics."</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 11:20:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/QEJTSBNB3FOOVAKLFLUM4V2AMY.jpg?auth=f3e92236437d4dbe7c886177949e432114f1a8e23fef40082a1aba2d8084c5ee&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Supreme Court set to issue rulings as Trump awaits fate of tariffs</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/supreme-court-set-issue-rulings-trump-awaits-fate-tariffs-2026-01-09/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 9 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court could issue at least one ruling on Friday as several major cases remain pending including litigation testing the legality of President Donald Trump 's sweeping global tariffs.

The court may release opinions in argued cases when the justices take the bench during a scheduled sitting at 10 a.m. ET (1500 GMT), according to the court's website. The court does not announce ahead of time which rulings it intends to issue.

The challenge to Trump's tariffs marks a major test of presidential powers as well as of the court's willingness to check some of the Republican president's far-reaching assertions of authority since he returned to office in January 2025. The outcome will also impact the global economy.

During arguments heard by the court on November 5, conservative and liberal justices appeared to cast doubt on the legality of the tariffs, which Trump imposed by invoking a 1977 law meant for use during national emergencies. Trump's administration is appealing rulings by lower court that he overstepped his authority.

Trump has said tariffs have made the United States stronger financially. In a social media post on January 2, Trump said a Supreme Court ruling against the tariffs would be a "terrible blow" to the United States.

Trump invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose so-called "reciprocal" tariffs on goods imported from individual countries - nearly every foreign trading partner - to address what he called a national emergency related to U.S. trade deficits. He invoked the same law to impose tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico, citing the trafficking of the often-abused painkiller fentanyl and illicit drugs into the United States as a national emergency.

The challenges to the tariffs in the cases before the Supreme Court were brought by businesses affected by the tariffs and 12 U.S. states, most of them Democratic-governed.

Other important cases are also awaiting rulings at the court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, including a challenge to a key section of the Voting Rights Act , the landmark 1965 federal law enacted by Congress to prevent racial discrimination in voting. Another involves a challenge on free speech grounds to a Colorado law banning psychotherapists from conducting " conversion therapy " that aims to change an LGBT minor's sexual orientation or gender identity.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 11:20:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/TE2AH3XU3RMG5PXJPCXMTLLIOA.jpg?auth=a558ef5b4bd90c70e655763fb562e0f55142429f5bcc2f6887f36b5e4dcf2890&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Envoy tapped for Trump's Gaza board meets senior Palestinian official in West Bank</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/envoy-tapped-trumps-gaza-board-meets-senior-palestinian-official-west-bank-2026-01-09/</link><description>RAMALLAH, West Bank, Jan 9 (Reuters) - The former U.N. envoy expected to help lead Donald Trump's so-called Board of Peace for Gaza met a top Palestinian Authority official on Friday as the U.S. president pushes ahead with his plan for the enclave's future.

Trump is expected to announce the composition of the board this month, possibly as early as next week, a U.S. official said. Portrayed as part of a transitional government, the board is an important component of Trump's phased plan to halt the war between Israel and Hamas.

The first phase of Trump's plan, which included a ceasefire and hostage release deal, has been shaken by issues including Israeli airstrikes in Gaza that have killed hundreds of people, a refusal by Hamas to disarm and Israeli delays in reopening Gaza's Rafah border crossing with Egypt.

Although the two sides accuse each other of breaching the deal, Trump says he wants to move on to the second phase, a progression that would entail the establishment of the Board of Peace and a yet-to-be-agreed deployment of peacekeeping forces.

Nickolay Mladenov, the former U.N. Middle East envoy who is expected to represent the board on the ground, met senior Palestinian Authority (PA) official Hussein al-Sheikh in the occupied West Bank city of Ramallah on Friday, the Palestinian leader said on X.

The two men discussed "the situation in the Gaza Strip, ways to move to the second phase, and mechanisms for implementing (Trump's) plan," Sheikh said.

Mladenov was not expected to meet PA President Mahmoud Abbas, a source familiar with the matter said. Under Trump's plan, the PA would eventually take control of Gaza from the Board of Peace.

Israel has rejected any involvement by Hamas, which ran Gaza before the war, but has also opposed rule by the PA, the body set up under the Oslo interim peace accords three decades ago that has limited governing power in the West Bank.

On Thursday, Mladenov met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and some of his top advisers in Jerusalem, Netanyahu's office said in a statement. Netanyahu reiterated Israel's position that Hamas must be disarmed and Gaza should be demilitarised, in line with Trump's plan, the statement said.

Netanyahu's office described Mladenov as "set to become the Director of the Gaza Strip Board of Peace."

The board, expected to also comprise officials from U.S. allies in Europe and the Middle East, would oversee a committee of Palestinian technocrats.

Mladenov, a former Bulgarian politician, served as the U.N.'s Jerusalem-based Middle East envoy from 2015-2020.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 11:20:33 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/DV6MTCH4YFKKTJH3CTHMX3A65U.jpg?auth=87c21966a56123a99c2b4f67cb981d5ce76ececd2fceb78a498cc7aac8deb52a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Meloni rules out U.S. military move on Greenland, urges strong NATO Arctic presence</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/meloni-rules-out-us-military-move-greenland-urges-strong-nato-arctic-presence-2026-01-09/</link><description>ROME, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said on Friday she did not believe the United States would use military force to seize Greenland , warning that such a move would have grave consequences for NATO.

At her traditional New Year's press conference, Meloni added that there was a need for a "serious and significant" NATO presence in the Arctic region, including Greenland.

"I continue not to believe in the hypothesis that the United States would launch a military action to take control of Greenland, an option I would clearly not support," Meloni said.

"I believe it would not be in anyone's interest. I think it would not even be in the interest of the United States of America, to be clear," she added.

A weekend U.S. military operation that seized the leader of Venezuela rekindled concerns about U.S. intentions towards Greenland . The White House said on Tuesday that the U.S. was considering a range of options to acquire Greenland, including the use of military force.

Meloni, who is seen as one of U.S. President Donald Trump's closest allies in Europe, said it was "clear to everyone" that any U.S. move on Greenland would have a significant impact on NATO, adding this was the reason she did not think Washington would act on its threats.

However, she said it was important for NATO to boost its presence in the Arctic region, adding that she understood U.S. concerns for the need to prevent "excessive interference from other actors that could even be hostile".</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 11:21:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/3EYEM5EHFNNCPNO6CLSN4OL7Z4.jpg?auth=8243452ba4c73dddd483e1a4156525163e1ab8019efc685efca811e99def3417&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China's top diplomat Wang Yi postpones visit to Somalia</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-top-diplomat-wang-yi-postpones-visit-somalia-2026-01-09/</link><description>Jan 9 (Reuters) - Somalia's foreign affairs ministry said on Friday that China's top diplomat Wang Yi had postponed his planned visit to the East African country.

With voters disgruntled about rising prices and Trump's handling of the economy, some allies fear the president's intense focus on foreign policy could jeopardize the party's tenuous control of Congress in November's midterm elections.

White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, her deputy James Blair and Vice President JD Vance are pressing Trump to prioritize domestic concerns, said two White House officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal matters.

Vance has been the most persistent voice in meetings, repeatedly steering conversations back to kitchen-table issues, they said.

In the wake of last week's Venezuela operation, some top White House aides are "openly frustrated" that Trump and many senior officials continue to talk so much about foreign affairs, one of the officials said. Despite easing inflation, many voters remain focused on affordability as they face high costs for housing, food and health insurance.

Asked for comment, the White House said Trump has always made the economy his top priority, citing his announcements this week aimed at lowering home prices, and said his foreign policy has "consistently put America First."

"The President will always work to bring investments and deliverables back to our country," said spokeswoman Anna Kelly.

Wiles and Blair did not respond to requests seeking comment. A spokeswoman for Vance declined to comment.

The concerns about Trump's priorities are not new, as his focus on foreign policy predates the Venezuela operation. In recent weeks he has made veiled threats to invade Greenland and Panama, bombed targets in Syria and Nigeria, and pushed for peace between Ukraine and Russia.

But the officials say the concerns have taken on greater urgency as the administration enters a pivotal election year, when the White House had planned to shift more aggressively toward domestic messaging and travel.

Trump, who campaigned on curbing inflation, has recently said the issue of affordability is a Democratic "hoax."

In multiple White House meetings focused on the economy since November, officials have shown him polling, surveys and social media posts highlighting voters' concerns about the cost of living and his handling of the economy and have urged him to focus his public remarks on economic issues, the White House officials said.

Trump, one official said, has countered that the economy is strong, warned that focusing on it could play into a Democratic trap to downplay his achievements and maintained that high inflation stems from his predecessor Joe Biden's policies.

After the president announced on Saturday that the U.S. would "run" Venezuela, Republican lawmakers inundated the White House with calls insisting the "only country Trump should be running is the United States," one official said.

The party of a sitting president typically struggles to hold onto seats in Congress in the midterms, and Trump's Republicans hold only slim majorities in both houses. Voter angst over the economy could make this a particularly tough election for the party.

Trump won reelection with an “America First” agenda, promising to avoid foreign entanglements and strengthen the economy. While his supporters have so far mostly backed his intervention in Venezuela, foreign policy is seldom a winning issue in U.S. congressional elections.

In December, just one in three U.S. adults approved of Trump's handling of the economy, his lowest rating on the matter last year, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll. A poll this week found the same share supported Trump's strike on Venezuela, although initial support among Republicans was 65%.

Republicans on Capitol Hill have privately questioned why Trump is not more focused on domestic priorities, even as they publicly support his actions overseas, said the two White House officials and a Republican strategist who is in close contact with members of the Senate and the House of Representatives.

"He needs to stay focused on things that voters care about, not renaming buildings and other things that are not in the kitchen-table category," said the strategist, who asked to remain anonymous to speak freely about private conversations.

At a retreat for House Republican lawmakers on Tuesday, Trump spent more time during his 84-minute speech wandering through past grievances and cultural issues than outlining specific plans or a broad election-year strategy on how he is addressing voters' affordability concerns.

One of the officials said White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller’s recent TV appearances focused on Venezuela and Trump's renewed interest in seizing Greenland were unhelpful distractions.

Miller did not respond to a request for comment.

He and Secretary of State Marco Rubio argue the political impact of the Venezuela mission will depend on how deeply the U.S. becomes involved and how events unfold on the ground, the White House officials said. They say projecting strength abroad can reinforce, rather than clash with, Trump's "America First" agenda.

To test that theory, the White House has commissioned polling to gauge how Trump's "Make America Great Again" base reacts to his attention on Venezuela and Greenland, according to the two White House officials and a Republican pollster familiar with the effort.

The administration has also sought out right-wing influencers to shape the narrative around the Venezuela actions, they said.

The White House views such outreach as critical, given parts of Trump's MAGA coalition are wary of foreign interventions and have shown how quickly support can erode if core promises are seen as broken, such as when the Justice Department reversed course after promising to release files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

Several prominent conservatives who initially questioned the Venezuela operation have since expressed support, said the officials, who cited that shift as an early sign the strategy is working.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 11:21:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/GH4S62UKMFJN7BOI4MBFMCA7LM.jpg?auth=082f4dcf2280512d45117249aa2e0434df1b53466ce25f229a7f29697df46ca7&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Kurdish groups reject Aleppo withdrawal as US pushes to end fighting</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/kurdish-groups-reject-aleppo-withdrawal-us-pushes-end-fighting-2026-01-09/</link><description>ALEPPO, Syria,  Jan 9 (Reuters) - Kurdish groups in Aleppo vowed to defend their neighbourhoods from government forces on Friday, rejecting ceasefire terms declared by Damascus that demand Kurdish fighters withdraw from the Syrian city where clashes have raged this week.

The violence in Aleppo has exposed a deep faultline between President Ahmed al-Sharaa's Islamist-led government and Kurdish forces, which have resisted its efforts to bring their fighters under centralised authority.

At least nine civilians have been killed and more than 140,000 have fled their homes. Neither the government nor the Kurdish forces have announced a toll of casualties among their fighters.

The ceasefire announced by the defense ministry overnight demanded the withdrawal of Kurdish forces to the Kurdish-held northeast. That would effectively end Kurdish control over pockets of Aleppo held by Kurdish forces since the early days of the Syrian conflict which began in 2011.

But in a statement, Kurdish councils that run the Sheikh Maksoud and Ashrafiyah districts of Aleppo said calls to leave were "a call to surrender" and that Kurdish forces would instead "defend their neighbourhoods", accusing government forces of intensive shelling.

The ceasefire said Kurdish forces should withdraw by 9 a.m. (0700 GMT) on Friday, but no one withdrew overnight, according to Syrian security sources.

Tom Barrack, the U.S. envoy for Syria, had earlier welcomed what he called a "temporary ceasefire" and said Washington was working intensively to extend it beyond the 9 a.m. deadline. "We are hopeful this weekend will bring a more enduring calm and deeper dialogue," he wrote on X.

Washington has been closely involved in efforts to promote integration between the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) - which has enjoyed U.S. military support for more than a decade - and the Damascus government.

However, little has been achieved since the sides signed a framework agreement in March, 2025, which had called for the process to be completed by the end of last year.

A Reuters reporter at the scene in Aleppo saw more than a dozen empty buses entering Sheikh Maksoud on Friday morning. Government security sources said they were expected to carry Kurdish fighters towards eastern parts of Syria held by Kurdish forces.

Neighbouring Turkey views the SDF as a terrorist organisation linked to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), and has warned of military action if the group does not honour the integration agreement.

Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan, speaking on Wednesday before the ceasefire was announced, expressed hope that the situation in Aleppo would be normalized "through the withdrawal of SDF elements".

Kurdish fighters of the People's Protection Units (YPG) established autonomous rule across large areas of northern Syria after the eruption of the war in 2011, later becoming the spearhead of the U.S.-backed SDF.

YPG head of media relations Siamand Ali did not respond to a request for comment on the evacuation.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 11:21:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure

says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/women-bearing-brunt-sudans-acute-hunger-crisis-un-says-2026-01-09/</link><description>GENEVA, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Women are bearing the brunt of the humanitarian crisis in Sudan, with the majority of female-headed households not having enough food to eat, the U.N. said on Friday.

"Female-headed households are now three times more likely to be food insecure. Three quarters of these households report not having enough to eat," Jens Laerke, spokesperson for the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) told reporters in Geneva.

"Hunger is becoming increasingly gendered," he added, pointing to pre-existing gender inequalities in the country being exacerbated by the ongoing conflict, which entered its 1,000th day on Friday.

U.N. Women has previously warned that women face the risk of sexual violence while searching for food.

U.N. agencies called for immediate international action to provide aid to the Darfur city of al-Fashir, taken by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in late October, as well as to Kadugli, another besieged city in Sudan's south. Both cities are facing famine .

More than 100,000 are estimated to have fled al-Fashir since the RSF took control there following an 18-month siege.

OCHA said it is looking to make Sudan the first country to sign an agreement with the United States to receive part of the $2 billion in assistance it pledged at the end of December.

More than 21 million people are currently estimated to be acutely food insecure across the country. Some 34 million people are in need of humanitarian support, half of whom are children, according to the U.N.

OCHA said it did not yet have an update on further plans to visit al-Fashir, after international aid staff accessed the city for the first time in December since its takeover by the RSF.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 12:46:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/IDB5FJMPRVOVPIB4QC2HDICJYI.jpg?auth=5f3956719f3d849ecec40ac27a19c655789799b05cb5fcc205b198c76ec3f35b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Exclusive: Pakistan nears $1.5 billion deal to supply weapons, jets to Sudan, sources say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/pakistan-nears-15-billion-deal-supply-weapons-jets-sudan-sources-say-2026-01-09/</link><description>ISLAMABAD, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Pakistan is in the final phases of striking a $1.5-billion deal to supply weapons and jets to Sudan, a former top air force official and three sources said, promising a major boost for Sudan's army, battling the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces.

Their conflict has stoked the world's worst humanitarian crisis for more than 2-1/2 years, drawing in myriad foreign interests, and threatening to fragment the strategic Red Sea country, a major gold producer.

The deal with Pakistan encompasses 10 Karakoram-8 light attack aircraft, more than 200 drones for scouting and kamikaze attacks, and advanced air defence systems, said two of the three sources with knowledge of the matter, who all sought anonymity.

It was a "done deal", said Aamir Masood, a retired Pakistani air marshal who continues to be briefed on air force matters.

Besides the Karakoram-8 jets, it includes Super Mushshak training aircraft, and perhaps some coveted JF-17 fighters developed jointly with China and produced in Pakistan, he added, without giving figures or a delivery schedule.

Pakistan's military and its defence ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

A spokesman for Sudan’s army did not immediately respond to a message requesting comment.

Assistance from Pakistan, especially drones and jets, could help Sudan's army regain the air supremacy it had towards the start of its war with the RSF, which has increasingly used drones to gain territory, eroding the army's position.

Sudan's army accuses the RSF of being supplied by the United Arab Emirates, which has denied supplying weapons.

The sources did not say how the deal was being funded but Masood said it was possible the finances would come from Saudi Arabia.

"Saudi Arabia may favour and support all the favourable regimes in Gulf for procurement of Pakistani military equipment and training," he said.

One of the sources said the Saudis brokered the deal but added there was no indication they were paying for the weapons. Another source said Saudi was not providing funds.

Reuters has reported that Islamabad is in talks with Riyadh for a defence deal that could be worth between $2 billion and $4 billion.

Masood said the weapons for Sudan could be included in such an agreement, without confirming discussions with Saudi Arabia.

The Saudi government media office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the UAE are part of the U.S.-led quad grouping of nations that has tried to push Sudan's army and the RSF towards peace talks.

On recent visits, Sudan's army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan requested Saudi assistance in the war, according to Sudanese and Egyptian sources.

Riyadh and Abu Dhabi are embroiled in a major feud sparked by recent events in Yemen.

The two most powerful countries in the Gulf have sharp differences on a range of volatile Middle East issues, from geopolitics to oil output.

Their difference burst into the open with an advance of UAE-backed southern Yemeni separatists in early December that brought them into conflict with Saudi-backed forces.

The deal is another feather in the cap for Pakistan's growing defence sector, which has drawn growing interest and investment, particularly since its jets were deployed in a conflict with India last year.

Last month, Islamabad struck a weapons deal worth more than $4 billion with the Libyan National Army, officials said, for one of the South Asian nation's largest arms sales, which includes JF-17 fighter jets and training aircraft.

Pakistan has also held talks with Bangladesh on a defence deal that could includes the Super Mushshak training jets and JF-17s, as ties improve ties with Dhaka.

The government sees Pakistan's burgeoning industry as a catalyst to secure long-term economic stability.

Pakistan is now in a $7-billion IMF programme, following a short-term deal to avert a sovereign default in 2023. It won IMF support after Saudi Arabia and other Gulf allies provided financial and deposit rollovers.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 12:46:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ABJLGNM5GNN6NDP5QX5XK3JVOM.jpg?auth=18b1f46ea9dea8b6d1a7f0487fdd7d60c7b8d7771ba5988261690634a59b1859&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Meloni urges Europe to talk to Russia, sees no swift return to G8</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/meloni-urges-europe-talk-russia-sees-no-swift-return-g8-2026-01-09/</link><description>ROME, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Europe should reopen dialogue with Russia, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said on Friday, adding that it was far too soon to discuss welcoming Moscow back into the Group of Eight leading nations.

Meloni said she agreed with French President Emmanuel Macron, who recently called for Europe to engage with Moscow as efforts continue to end the war in Ukraine .

"I think Macron is right on this. I believe the time has come for Europe to also speak with Russia," she said at her traditional New Year's press conference.

"Because if Europe decides to take part in this phase of negotiations by talking only to one of the two sides, I fear that in the end the positive contribution it can make will be limited," she added.

Talks to bring the almost four-year war to an end have accelerated since November. However, Moscow has yet to signal willingness to make concessions after Kyiv pushed for changes to a U.S. proposal that initially backed Russia's main demands.

Moscow has also given no public sign that it would accept a peace deal with the security guarantees envisaged by Ukraine's allies, including having Western troops inside Ukraine.

Meloni said the European Union should appoint an envoy to deal directly with Russian President Vladimir Putin and avoid confusion.

"If we were to make the mistake of deciding, on the one hand, to reopen dialogue with Russia, and on the other, to proceed in a disorganised way, we would be doing Putin a favour," she said. "We have had this problem from the start. Too many voices speaking, too many formats," she added.

Among proposals put forward by the United States in November was for Russia to be readmitted to the Group of Seven wealthy nations club, reviving the now-defunct G8.

Meloni said it was "absolutely premature" to talk about welcoming Russia back into the G7 fold. She also reiterated that Italy had no intention of sending troops to Ukraine to help guarantee any peace deal.

France and Britain last month signed a declaration of intent on the future deployment of multinational forces into Ukraine once a ceasefire is reached.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 12:47:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/MKORPEJX7FI2NIPZ7RPML4RKCE.jpg?auth=595e881055cf371704687dd27d3b5da9daffd21e1915f2d655d959128ff9cad4&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Munich Security conference head defends inviting German far-right party</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/munich-security-conference-head-defends-inviting-german-far-right-party-2026-01-09/</link><description>BERLIN, Jan 9 (Reuters) - The head of the Munich Security Conference defended a decision to invite the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) to this year's meeting in February after repeated U.S accusations that European states and institutions were suppressing free speech .

The annual gathering of security experts and policymakers comes at a time of exceptional uncertainty for Europe, as its leaders struggle to adjust to the upending of decades of trans-Atlantic policy assumptions by U.S. President Donald Trump .

Wolfgang Ischinger, the former German diplomat who heads the conference, said including two or three foreign policy specialists from the AfD, which has not been invited for the past two years, would do no harm and would be "levelling the playing field".

"It will not allow the AfD to proclaim again that they're being victimised and that they are marginalised and excluded from German political life," he told Reuters in an interview in Berlin late on Thursday.

In a report last year, Germany's intelligence services classified the anti-immigration AfD, which polls indicate has the largest backing of any party in the country, as an " extremist" group .

But Ischinger said the broad support for the party, the main opposition group in Germany's parliament, made it difficult to explain to foreign attendees why it was not possible to meet its representatives at the conference.

He said he was critical of AfD foreign policy, which is opposed to Western military support for Ukraine .

"But maybe by attending some of these speeches in Munich, they'll have an educational experience," he said.

The AfD has been leveraging ties with Trump's MAGA - Make America Great Again - movement over the past year and poses a direct challenge to Chancellor Friedrich Merz's conservatives in a series of state elections in 2026.

Last year's conference was marked by U.S. Vice President JD Vance's attack on European leaders , whom he accused of censoring free speech and failing to control immigration.

The comments by Vance, who met AfD party leader Alice Weidel , were the first of a series of harsh criticisms of Europe by members of the Trump administration over the past year that have deeply unsettled Washington's allies.

European governments have agreed to U.S. demands for increased military spending and accepted the need to shoulder more responsibility for defence.

But open talk by U.S. officials of using military force to seize Greenland, an autonomous territory of NATO ally Denmark, has shocked European leaders .

Ischinger, who said it was not yet clear if Vance would be attending this year's gathering, said the conference existed to "deal with difficult transatlantic issues".

"So I would hope that if he comes, he would use the opportunity to explain current and future U.S. foreign policy decisions, some of which need a lot of explaining here in Europe," he said.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 12:47:22 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Musk's AI bot Grok limits image generation on X to paid users after backlash</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/musks-ai-bot-grok-limits-image-generation-x-paid-users-after-backlash-2026-01-09/</link><description>Jan 9 (Reuters) - Elon Musk's startup xAI has restricted the image generation function on its Grok chatbot on social media platform X to paid subscribers, after the tool's use of AI to create sexualized images sparked a widespread backlash.

The chatbot's image generation had allowed users on X to edit or create sexualized photos, which Reuters found was used to generate images of women and children in minimal clothing, often without the consent of the individuals depicted.

A torrent of semi-nude images on X led to European lawmakers urging legal action, with German media minister Wolfram Weimer describing them as the "industrialisation of sexual harassment" and the European Commission calling them illegal.

Grok told X users on Friday that image generation and editing features were now available only to paying subscribers.

The standalone Grok app, which operates separately from X, still allows users to generate images without a subscription.

A Reuters reporter asked Grok on X to convert a picture of himself into one wearing a bikini, echoing what has become a common request over the last week by users. The bot did not do so and posted in reply that the tool was only available to paying subscribers of the social media platform.

In what seemed to be an automated response, xAI replied to an emailed Reuters request for comment by saying "Legacy Media Lies". X did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The European Commission said on Monday such images circulating on X were unlawful and appalling, while Britain's data regulator said it had asked the platform to explain how it was complying with data protection laws following concerns that Grok was generating sexually abusive images of women.

Musk said last week that anyone using Grok to create illegal content would face the same consequences as uploading such material directly.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 12:47:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/VU3G4YSWZ5IXNEEIEXVW57Q4PY.jpg?auth=2447f678233cef3c084f4db8550947448bcf93a719c4d2a91806742d3df320ac&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Asylum applications drop to 40 year low in Sweden, government says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asylum-applications-drop-40-year-low-sweden-government-says-2026-01-09/</link><description>STOCKHOLM, Jan 9 (Reuters) - The number of people applying for asylum in Sweden dropped by 30% in 2025 to the lowest level since 1985, with the right-of-centre government saying it planned to further tighten rules this year ahead of an election in September.

The ruling minority coalition, which is supported by the anti-immigration Sweden Democrats, has made cutting the number of asylum seekers a key policy platform since taking power in 2022.

It blames a surge in gang crime on decades of loose asylum laws and failed integration measures under previous Social Democrat-led governments.

"The change isn't just about numbers in terms of lower immigration, it's also about the way that's made up, who is coming to Sweden with the proportion from asylum at a record low," Immigration Minister Johan Forssell told reporters.

The number of immigrants, excluding refugees from Ukraine, dropped to 79,684 last year from 82,857 in 2024, figures from the Migration Board showed. Asylum seekers and their family members made up just 6% of the total, compared to 31% in 2018 when total immigration was 133,000.

The number of people either returning voluntarily to another country or expelled by authorities was also up.

"This is an area which is a high priority for us," Forssell said.

The government has cracked down on asylum seekers, made it more difficult to gain residency and citizenship and introduced financial incentives for immigrants to leave the country since it came to power.

Forssell said the government planned to further tighten rules in the coming year including a new law to boost the number of returnees and tighter citizenship rules, among other things.

Swedes will vote in what is expected to be a tight general election in September.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 12:47:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/NE2OU6E4GVJGLNJ7OAEWPPSRUY.jpg?auth=d914c11eab4f5dbf0df0c84c63cf13a327740bd69c49c46a15327ce9b3a0b89b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Widespread power cuts, travel disrupted as Storm Goretti hammers northern Europe</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/widespread-power-cuts-travel-disrupted-storm-goretti-hammers-northern-europe-2026-01-09/</link><description>PARIS/LONDON/BERLIN, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Storm Goretti battered northern Europe on Friday, knocking out power to thousands of homes, shutting schools and suspending rail services in France, Britain and Germany as heavy snow and gale-force winds compounded a week of freezing weather.

Across northern Europe emergency services were left scrambling to deal with heavy snowfall and severe winds from Goretti, which slammed into Britain on Thursday before moving eastwards. In snowbound Germany, one official said it was one of the most severe weather events in the region in recent years.

The powerful storm left around 380,000 households without electricity in France, mainly in Normandy and Brittany, as it rolled into continental Europe.

Some 57,000 homes lost power across Scotland and parts of central England overnight according to the National Grid. In the Netherlands, flights were cancelled as heavy snowfall was set to return after a one-day reprieve.

Winds of more than 150 kph (93 mph) were recorded overnight in France’s northwestern Manche region, with a record 213 kph in Barfleur, forcing the SNCF rail operator to suspend services between Paris and Normandy.

French state-owned energy company EDF said that Storm Goretti had hit electricity production at the Flamanville nuclear plant, taking reactors 1 and 3 offline following the loss of a high-voltage line. The storm's strength, which tore off roofs and uprooted trees, was "exceptional", Manche prefect Marc Chappuis told BFM TV.

In central England, rail operators warned passengers not to travel and suspended some services as the storm moved through.

The disruption spread into northern Germany, where state-owned Deutsche Bahn halted long-distance train services until further notice, citing one of the most severe winter weather events in the region in many years.

"So far, we have been able to avoid situations where passengers are left stranded on the open track for long periods of time," a Deutsche Bahn spokesperson told a press conference at Berlin’s central station, adding that crews were working to clear the tracks quickly and safely.

At Hamburg Airport, northern Germany's busiest air terminal, about 40 flights were cancelled.

The Netherlands' KLM carrier said it had cancelled 80 flights to and from Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport scheduled for Friday. Schiphol had earlier this week cancelled hundreds of flights because of freezing weather.

In Hungary, the military was called out to assist motorists trapped in heavy snow.

Western Balkan countries have seen widespread disruption since Sunday. One person was found dead in Albania on Thursday, which has been hit by extensive flooding, while gale-force winds ripped roofs off buildings in northeastern Turkey.

Hundreds move in unison as Father Guilherme Peixoto looks out over the crowd - not from a pulpit, but from behind turntables.

Peixoto, who hails from Portugal, has played at some of the world's most famous clubs. Now he's touring Latin America, filling venues from Colombia to Mexico - home to the world's second-largest Catholic population.

Each time Peixoto, a career clergyman, steps onto the stage, the moment carries weight.

"It's a different energy and I think in our life the balance is very important," Peixoto said backstage at the downtown Monterrey venue, packed shoulder-to-shoulder with about 300 young revelers and a few priests there to enjoy his set.

"We have time for silence, time to listen to the voice of God ... and also time to share the message of God," he added.

Peixoto is touring Latin America while promoting his latest EP, Si Tuvieras Fe, released on Dec. 5. He has gained international recognition and built a global following as a DJ, particularly among young people in Latin America, where the Church's numbers have been in decline over the past decade.

That balance between "adrenaline" and "contemplation" remains central to how he views his dual roles. His electronic tracks - heavy beats layered with spiritual messages - include hits like "Lift up the fallen" and "Protegeme Senor".

His sets feature religious symbols glowing across the club, videos of the late Pope Francis and, in his Mexico shows, images of the revered Virgin of Guadalupe.

Peixoto's unlikely rise to fame began two decades ago, when he launched a "parish bar" in Portugal to help pay off church debts. As popularity for the events exploded, he enrolled in DJ classes.

For Peixoto, it has never been about breaking Church rules, but about building community. If his sold-out shows are an indication, the message has resonated.

"For me, there is always something special in electronic music. It's the respect, there is no judgment on the dance floor," Peixoto said. "As I always say, it's an amazing image for the world."

In Monterrey, Peixoto plays for a couple of hours, wrapping up around 2 a.m. The night continues, but Peixoto doesn't stay for the after party. Instead, bright and early the next morning, he stands beside Mexican Archbishop Rogelio Cabrera for mass at Monterrey's metropolitan cathedral, just three blocks from the venue of his show the night before.

Passing out the Eucharist in traditional robes, it would be hard to guess that Peixoto was behind the turntables just a few hours earlier.

"I know it is not normal for a priest to have this kind of opportunity," Peixoto said. "So it's gratitude and a responsibility to share something special."</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 12:47:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CODT5LEG55LMJCXRB3CUFMOEQ4.jpg?auth=cc15bad80874196a4343b662bec6e6bcfe72af009b7f4da085d085071de58c02&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Hamburg trial tests German law after US child’s suicide linked to murder charge</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/hamburg-trial-tests-german-law-after-us-childs-suicide-linked-murder-charge-2026-01-09/</link><description /><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 12:48:31 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Munich Security conference head defends inviting German far-right party</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/munich-security-conference-head-defends-inviting-german-far-right-party-2026-01-09/</link><description>BERLIN, Jan 9 (Reuters) - The head of the Munich Security Conference defended a decision to invite the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) to this year's meeting in February after repeated U.S accusations that European states and institutions were suppressing free speech .

The annual gathering of security experts and policymakers comes at a time of exceptional uncertainty for Europe, as its leaders struggle to adjust to the upending of decades of trans-Atlantic policy assumptions by U.S. President Donald Trump .

Wolfgang Ischinger, the former German diplomat who heads the conference, said including two or three foreign policy specialists from the AfD, which has not been invited for the past two years, would do no harm and would be "levelling the playing field".

"It will not allow the AfD to proclaim again that they're being victimised and that they are marginalised and excluded from German political life," he told Reuters in an interview in Berlin late on Thursday.

In a report last year, Germany's intelligence services classified the anti-immigration AfD, which polls indicate has the largest backing of any party in the country, as an " extremist" group .

But Ischinger said the broad support for the party, the main opposition group in Germany's parliament, made it difficult to explain to foreign attendees why it was not possible to meet its representatives at the conference.

He said he was critical of AfD foreign policy, which is opposed to Western military support for Ukraine .

"But maybe by attending some of these speeches in Munich, they'll have an educational experience," he said.

The AfD has been leveraging ties with Trump's MAGA - Make America Great Again - movement over the past year and poses a direct challenge to Chancellor Friedrich Merz's conservatives in a series of state elections in 2026.

Last year's conference was marked by U.S. Vice President JD Vance's attack on European leaders , whom he accused of censoring free speech and failing to control immigration.

The comments by Vance, who met AfD party leader Alice Weidel , were the first of a series of harsh criticisms of Europe by members of the Trump administration over the past year that have deeply unsettled Washington's allies.

European governments have agreed to U.S. demands for increased military spending and accepted the need to shoulder more responsibility for defence.

But open talk by U.S. officials of using military force to seize Greenland, an autonomous territory of NATO ally Denmark, has shocked European leaders .

Ischinger, who said it was not yet clear if Vance would be attending this year's gathering, said the conference existed to "deal with difficult transatlantic issues".

"So I would hope that if he comes, he would use the opportunity to explain current and future U.S. foreign policy decisions, some of which need a lot of explaining here in Europe," he said.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 12:49:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Musk's AI bot Grok limits image generation on X to paid users after backlash</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/musks-ai-bot-grok-limits-image-generation-x-paid-users-after-backlash-2026-01-09/</link><description>Jan 9 (Reuters) - Elon Musk's startup xAI has restricted the image generation function on its Grok chatbot on social media platform X to paid subscribers, after the tool's use of AI to create sexualized images sparked a widespread backlash.

The chatbot's image generation had allowed users on X to edit or create sexualized photos, which Reuters found was used to generate images of women and children in minimal clothing, often without the consent of the individuals depicted.

A torrent of semi-nude images on X led to European lawmakers urging legal action, with German media minister Wolfram Weimer describing them as the "industrialisation of sexual harassment" and the European Commission calling them illegal.

Grok told X users on Friday that image generation and editing features were now available only to paying subscribers.

The standalone Grok app, which operates separately from X, still allows users to generate images without a subscription.

A Reuters reporter asked Grok on X to convert a picture of himself into one wearing a bikini, echoing what has become a common request over the last week by users. The bot did not do so and posted in reply that the tool was only available to paying subscribers of the social media platform.

In what seemed to be an automated response, xAI replied to an emailed Reuters request for comment by saying "Legacy Media Lies". X did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The European Commission said on Monday such images circulating on X were unlawful and appalling, while Britain's data regulator said it had asked the platform to explain how it was complying with data protection laws following concerns that Grok was generating sexually abusive images of women.

Musk said last week that anyone using Grok to create illegal content would face the same consequences as uploading such material directly.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 12:49:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/VU3G4YSWZ5IXNEEIEXVW57Q4PY.jpg?auth=2447f678233cef3c084f4db8550947448bcf93a719c4d2a91806742d3df320ac&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Asylum applications drop to 40 year low in Sweden, government says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asylum-applications-drop-40-year-low-sweden-government-says-2026-01-09/</link><description>STOCKHOLM, Jan 9 (Reuters) - The number of people applying for asylum in Sweden dropped by 30% in 2025 to the lowest level since 1985, with the right-of-centre government saying it planned to further tighten rules this year ahead of an election in September.

The ruling minority coalition, which is supported by the anti-immigration Sweden Democrats, has made cutting the number of asylum seekers a key policy platform since taking power in 2022.

It blames a surge in gang crime on decades of loose asylum laws and failed integration measures under previous Social Democrat-led governments.

"The change isn't just about numbers in terms of lower immigration, it's also about the way that's made up, who is coming to Sweden with the proportion from asylum at a record low," Immigration Minister Johan Forssell told reporters.

The number of immigrants, excluding refugees from Ukraine, dropped to 79,684 last year from 82,857 in 2024, figures from the Migration Board showed. Asylum seekers and their family members made up just 6% of the total, compared to 31% in 2018 when total immigration was 133,000.

The number of people either returning voluntarily to another country or expelled by authorities was also up.

"This is an area which is a high priority for us," Forssell said.

The government has cracked down on asylum seekers, made it more difficult to gain residency and citizenship and introduced financial incentives for immigrants to leave the country since it came to power.

Forssell said the government planned to further tighten rules in the coming year including a new law to boost the number of returnees and tighter citizenship rules, among other things.

Swedes will vote in what is expected to be a tight general election in September.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 12:49:17 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/NE2OU6E4GVJGLNJ7OAEWPPSRUY.jpg?auth=d914c11eab4f5dbf0df0c84c63cf13a327740bd69c49c46a15327ce9b3a0b89b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Widespread power cuts, travel disrupted as Storm Goretti hammers northern Europe</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/widespread-power-cuts-travel-disrupted-storm-goretti-hammers-northern-europe-2026-01-09/</link><description>PARIS/LONDON/BERLIN, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Storm Goretti battered northern Europe on Friday, knocking out power to thousands of homes, shutting schools and suspending rail services in France, Britain and Germany as heavy snow and gale-force winds compounded a week of freezing weather.

Across northern Europe emergency services were left scrambling to deal with heavy snowfall and severe winds from Goretti, which slammed into Britain on Thursday before moving eastwards. In snowbound Germany, one official said it was one of the most severe weather events in the region in recent years.

The powerful storm left around 380,000 households without electricity in France, mainly in Normandy and Brittany, as it rolled into continental Europe.

Some 57,000 homes lost power across Scotland and parts of central England overnight according to the National Grid. In the Netherlands, flights were cancelled as heavy snowfall was set to return after a one-day reprieve.

Winds of more than 150 kph (93 mph) were recorded overnight in France’s northwestern Manche region, with a record 213 kph in Barfleur, forcing the SNCF rail operator to suspend services between Paris and Normandy.

The trial - which is being held in private due to the age and vulnerability of the victims - marks a precedent in Germany as the first time someone has gone on trial for murder in a suicide that occurred in a different jurisdiction.

The defendant, who allegedly used the online pseudonym "White Tiger," faces charges including one count of murder and five counts of attempted murder, according to the prosecution.

The defendant is accused of 204 offences committed between January 2021 and September 2023 against more than 30 victims.

The trial is scheduled to run until December, with 82 hearings planned. No verdict is expected this year.

If found guilty, the defendant can only be sentenced to between 6 months and 10 years in prison due to the fact that he was a minor at the time the crimes were committed, Judge Marayke Frantzen said shortly before the trial started on Friday.

A murder usually carries a 15-year sentence in Germany.

Also speaking ahead of the trial, defence lawyer Christiane Yueksel said that the fact that her client was being accused of indirectly committing a murder and other crimes "is a construct that is factually incorrect and cannot be proven."

Authorities allege the defendant led a group of cybercriminals named "764" that targeted children aged 11 to 15 across Germany, Canada, Finland and the United States, coercing them to self-harm and recording the acts for blackmail.

Prosecutors say the accused made particularly vulnerable children emotionally dependent on him via social media, exploiting this trust to produce child sexual abuse material and escalate the level of harm.

The case was launched after a tip-off from the FBI, which was investigating the death by suicide of the teenage boy in the United States.

Hamburg police arrested the suspect in his parents' home last summer.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 12:49:54 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4PHPMXWHTJMFNDJFQ5UUPSRWCU.jpg?auth=dd2acc340696759d41246ccbbf0d29f43c813ee7d1e61791f0ef9ca8c397e16f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'Forgotten' French farmers seek justice as they mobilise for fair trade, ecology and local produce</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/forgotten-french-farmers-seek-justice-as-they-mobilise-for-fair-trade-ecology-and-local-produce</link><description /><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 12:51:17 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/94a4f784-ed56-11f0-b5e5-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260109-081209-082005-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item></channel></rss>
