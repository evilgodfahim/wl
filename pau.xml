At least 30 senior leaders of the National Citizen Party (NCP) have openly opposed its alliance with Jamaat-e-Islami , announced on Sunday, with several resigning in protest.

The Muslim-majority South Asian nation goes to the polls on February 12.

Before the deal, opinion polls had predicted Jamaat finishing a close second behind the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) of former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, while the NCP lagged far behind in third place.

"The NCP presented itself as a youth-driven alternative to traditional power structures. That identity is now under serious strain," said H.M. Nazmul Alam, an academic. "Youth-based movements do not collapse only because they lose elections. They collapse when they lose clarity and internal unity."

The NCP was formed earlier this year by leaders of the protests that ousted long-time Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in August, 2024, forcing her to flee to India. Driven by Gen-Z activists born after the late 1990s, it says it aims to free the nation from decades of nepotism and the dominance of Hasina's Awami League and the BNP.

With the Awami League banned, the vote will be effectively a direct contest between the BNP and Jamaat, which has trailed the other two in the past and had not been allowed to contest any elections since 2013 after a court said its registration as a political party conflicted with Bangladesh's secular constitution.

An interim government led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus revoked , opens new tab all the restrictions on Jamaat in August 2024.

The NCP's struggle shows the challenges of turning street power into votes and holds lessons for neighbouring Nepal, where similar youth-led protests ousted the government this year and fresh elections are due in March, political analysts have said.

NCP chief Nahid Islam told a press conference late on Sunday that the recent killing of 32-year-old Sharif Osman Hadi , a key figure in the uprising, forced his party to seek an alliance to keep at bay forces trying to derail the election through violence.

"The dictatorship we overthrew is attempting to sabotage the election. Therefore, for the sake of greater unity, we have reached an electoral understanding with Jamaat,” said Nahid, 27.

"This was a majority decision within the party, but some may be opposed to it and they are free to take their own decisions."

Hadi was shot in the head by masked assailants in Dhaka earlier in December while launching his election campaign as an independent candidate. Police say they have identified the killers but have not apprehended them.

Nahid earlier told Reuters his organisation was weak because it had not had enough time to build itself. It was also hampered by scarce funds and an unclear stance on key issues such as rights for women and minorities, Reuters reported in early December, citing party leaders who said alliance talks had been underway for some time.

One senior NCP leader to have resigned is Tasnim Jara, a doctor who left a career in Britain to join the party. She is now seeking the support of nearly 5,000 voters to be allowed to contest as an independent.

"I promised you and the people of this country that I would fight for you and for building a new political culture," she said on Facebook. "Whatever the circumstances, I am determined to keep that promise."

Political analyst Asif Shahan, a professor at the University of Dhaka, said the NCP was "doomed".

"If you go with Jamaat, it will help Jamaat, not you," he said. "It will give them a liberal cover, and in return, you will become a force for the right. Your centrist idea and ideology - already poorly defined - will simply vanish."</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 09:31:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/OIKRZJV43BO5DAIZHUTJNKJYCM.jpg?auth=132cc1b6e546b04f409d1cb80d882cfbc792b522bfc9bf471c11d5b0d2996049&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Zelenskiy says 20-point peace plan should be put to referendum in Ukraine</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/zelenskiy-says-20-point-peace-plan-should-be-put-referendum-ukraine-2025-12-29/</link><description>KYIV, Dec 29 (Reuters) - Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Monday that a 20-point peace plan to end Russia's war should be put to a referendum in Ukraine.

"As a small, export-oriented country, we simply cannot afford to forgo such an opportunity," Kocher told Austrian news agency APA in an interview.

Austrian lawmakers in 2019 passed a resolution setting the country against a Mercosur trade deal, since when the government has repeatedly said it must uphold that position.

The EU and the bloc of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay reached agreement last December to create the EU's largest ever trade accord, some 25 years after negotiations were launched. However, the bloc is struggling to win support from Italy and deal critics France, Poland and Hungary.

Approval of the accord requires a qualified majority of 15 EU members representing 65% of the EU population.

Kocher said plenty had changed since Austrian lawmakers voted to oppose a deal six years ago, and that the present agreement had significant safeguards for farmers.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 09:33:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/UOEEXK3FEROZZK2PVJWATQGGR4.jpg?auth=5424a46be2b26d427b76b5188279cccc8a760e91cf31aae353cdb2e692283b3c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Indonesian authorities recover body during search for drowned Spanish soccer coach and his children</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/indonesian-authorities-recover-body-during-search-drowned-spanish-soccer-coach-2025-12-29/</link><description>JAKARTA, Dec 29 (Reuters) - Indonesian rescuers on Monday found a body during the search for Spanish soccer coach Fernando Martin and his children after their boat sank near the coast of a popular tourist spot on Friday, the country's rescue agency said.

Martin was a coach with the Spanish club Valencia CF, which said he and his three children died "in the tragic boat accident in Indonesia, as confirmed by local authorities."

The boat Martin and his family were on capsized on Friday after suffering engine failure during bad weather in the Padar Island Strait, close to the resort town of Labuan Bajo, authorities said. The location is near the Komodo National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage site where the rare Komodo dragons live.

Fathur Rahman, the chief of a local search and rescue agency, said they have recovered the body of a female "highly suspected of being a victim" of the accident. Authorities are currently trying to secure an identification, he added.

The search for the bodies of Martin and his children are ongoing despite strong currents and tall waves, Fathur said, adding it will also continue going into Tuesday.

Martin's wife and one daughter, as well as four crew members and a tour guide, survived the accident. The boat was carrying 11 people.

Indonesia has placed a temporary ban on tour boats sailing in the waters of Labuan Bajo and the Komodo Islands, its tourism ministry said on Sunday.

Separately, a speedboat carrying 21 people capsized in the waters near Indonesia's Papua, with 17 people missing and one dead, a local search and rescue agency official said on Monday.

Boats and ferries are a regular mode of transport in Indonesia, an archipelago of more than 17,000 islands, with accidents caused by bad weather and lax safety standards that often allow vessels to be overloaded.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 10:25:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BGNSZUREVNKXFPWEDQO6XIZGVQ.jpg?auth=205f201e024fd6d70315ae6d305333c4af0529ceef3d3905c74a57920124700e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Malaysia raids several firms as part of anti-graft probe into army procurement</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/malaysia-raids-several-firms-part-anti-graft-probe-into-army-procurement-2025-12-29/</link><description>KUALA LUMPUR, Dec 29 (Reuters) - Malaysia's anti-graft agency said on Monday that it has raided several firms alleged to be involved in bribery linked to army procurement projects, days after the country's army chief was placed on leave pending an investigation into the matter.

Azam Baki, chief commissioner at the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission, said the agency had also frozen six bank accounts belonging to a suspect and their family members as part of the probe.

He did not provide details about the suspect or the companies involved, but said investigations were being carried out under an anti-corruption law related to corporate liability for bribery.

"MACC officers have conducted searches at several companies believed to be involved to obtain relevant documents and evidence," Azam said in a statement.

Malaysia's army chief Muhammad Hafizuddeain Jantan was put on immediate leave on Saturday to allow room for authorities to fully investigate allegations involving him "without any conflict of interest", defence minister Mohamed Khaled Nordin said in a statement over the weekend, without providing specifics.

Citing sources, state news agency Bernama reported last week that MACC had recorded statements from three people as part of a probe into army procurement projects between 2023 and 2025.

A preliminary review found that several firms had repeatedly secured high-value contracts, Bernama quoted one of the sources as saying. Reuters was unable to independently verify the report.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 10:25:33 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/OLJHUEBV7VOT5K25SKRCVCDFFI.jpg?auth=acd396a94c9b8d82e794d77754008fe6064b21badc7ef5210d19f6bbfc4e3995&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Egyptian-British activist Abd el-Fattah apologises for past social media posts</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/egyptian-british-activist-abd-el-fattah-apologises-past-social-media-posts-2025-12-29/</link><description>Dec 29 (Reuters) - Activist Alaa Abd el-Fattah, freed from prison in Egypt and now in Britain, apologised on Monday for his "shocking and hurtful" social media posts made more than a decade ago, which have led to calls for his deportation from opposition British politicians.

Abd el-Fattah, 44, became Egypt's most prominent political prisoner after spending much of his adult life in and out of detention due to his activism and was a rare symbol of opposition during a far-reaching crackdown under President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.

He arrived in Britain last Friday after obtaining British citizenship in 2021 through his mother, with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer saying he was "delighted" by the news.

In the following days, British newspapers ran stories about posts made by Fattah on the former Twitter platform between 2008 and 2014, seen by Reuters, which endorsed violence against "Zionists" and police.

In a statement, Abd el-Fattah said many of his tweets had been misunderstood but that others were unacceptable.

"Looking at the tweets now - the ones that were not completely twisted out of their meaning - I do understand how shocking and hurtful they are, and for that I unequivocally apologise," Fattah said.

"They were mostly expressions of a young man's anger and frustrations in a time of regional crises - the wars on Iraq, on Lebanon and Gaza - and the rise of police brutality against Egyptian youth."

Nigel Farage, leader of the right-wing Reform UK party which currently tops opinion polls, called for Abd el-Fattah's deportation from Britain. Kemi Badenoch, the leader of the opposition Conservative Party, said the country should consider it.

The Board of Deputies of British Jews said his posts were of "profound concern" and showed a lack of due diligence among British authorities.

Britain's foreign office said it condemned Abd el-Fattah's historic tweets and called them "abhorrent", in a statement published on Sunday.

Abd el-Fattah was most recently serving a five-year sentence in Egypt imposed in December 2021, after he shared a social media post about a prisoner's death.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 10:25:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/QK76DQG2HVNC5LEUBHVEPACXME.jpg?auth=5cf49f84ff6c118c612ab2b6e20b24978573a6b58d7e099e4cda93131f6cf9fd&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Zaporizhzhia power plant could restart in 18 months once the war ends, head says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/zaporizhzhia-power-plant-could-restart-18-months-once-war-ends-head-says-2025-12-29/</link><description>MOSCOW, Dec 29 (Reuters) - The head of the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southeastern Ukraine said on Monday the facility could restart power generation by the middle of 2027 if the war concludes in the near future.

"If this (the end of the conflict) happens tomorrow, we will be ready to start up in mid-2027," Ramil Galiyev was cited as saying by Russia's RIA state news agency.

The nuclear plant, Europe's largest, has been under Russian control since March 2022, when Russian forces overran much of southeastern Ukraine. It is not currently producing electricity but relies on external power to keep the nuclear material cool and avoid a meltdown.

Power line repairs are currently underway at the plant under the watch of a team from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and are expected to last a few days.

Galiyev said "serious issues" at the plant would have to be addressed before it could go online, including replenishing the cooling pond and preparing railway tracks.

Both Russia and Ukraine regularly accuse one another of shelling the plant, risking a nuclear disaster.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 10:25:42 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4G3ZSP2FQJLVJCVJUTH77ISEZU.jpg?auth=d67762e0ceecda8e582464dbdb667325e0464e9babe76e6a28911c25a7900967&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China's war games around Taiwan over the years</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-war-games-around-taiwan-over-years-2025-12-29/</link><description>Dec 29 (Reuters) - China launched its most extensive war games around Taiwan on Monday called "Justice Mission 2025" to showcase Beijing's ability to cut off the island from outside support in a conflict.

The People's Republic of China has claimed Taiwan through its "one China" policy since the Chinese civil war forced the defeated Republic of China government to flee to the island in 1949, and has vowed to bring Taiwan under Beijing's rule, by force if necessary.

The government in Taiwan strongly rejects the Chinese sovereignty claims, saying it is already an independent country called the Republic of China, and that only its people can decide their future.

Here are some facts on military tensions between China and Taiwan and previous Chinese military exercises.

- China and Taiwan have nearly gone to war several times since 1949. The two sides last joined battle on a large scale in 1958, when Chinese forces bombed the Taiwan-controlled Kinmen and Matsu islands for more than a month, alongside naval and air combat.

- Ahead of Taiwan's first direct presidential election in 1996, China carried out missile tests in waters close to the island, hoping to prevent people voting for Lee Teng-hui, whom China suspected of harbouring pro-independence views. Lee won convincingly.

- In August 2022, furious at a visit to Taipei by then-U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, China held several days of war games around Taiwan, including launches of ballistic missiles, some of which flew over Taipei, and simulated sea and air attacks in surrounding skies and waters.

- In April 2023, China held three days of drills around Taiwan, saying they had tested integrated military capabilities under combat conditions, having practised precision strikes and blockading the island. Those drills came after Taiwan's then-President Tsai Ing-wen returned to Taipei following a meeting in Los Angeles with Kevin McCarthy, who at the time was U.S. House speaker.

- In August 2023, China launched military drills around Taiwan as a "serious warning" to "separatists" in an angry but widely expected response to then-Vice President Lai's visit to the United States.

- In May 2024, shortly after Lai's inauguration as president, China launched "punishment" drills dubbed "Joint Sword - 2024A" around Taiwan in what it said was a response to "separatist acts", sending up heavily armed warplanes and staging mock attacks.

- In October 2024, China held one day of "Joint Sword - 2024B" war games around Taiwan in response to a national day speech by Lai. Taiwan said China used a record number of military aircraft in those exercises.

- In December 2024, Taiwan reported a large rise in Chinese air force and navy activity around the island and in waters in the region, though China never officially confirmed it was holding exercises.

- In April 2025, China held " Strait Thunder-2025 ", saying it was a "stern warning" against separatism.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 10:25:48 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/S7NRXODZ2ZKO5IELAYZ7U6B4UU.jpg?auth=8696306dbe01c73d3bfb33e06a18d2f019c38a5b4fb941de61f27f4b3b802c80&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Zaporizhzhia power plant could restart in 18 months once the war ends, head says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/zaporizhzhia-power-plant-could-restart-18-months-once-war-ends-head-says-2025-12-29/</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 10:26:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>China's war games around Taiwan over the years</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-war-games-around-taiwan-over-years-2025-12-29/</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 10:26:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Thailand's army says Cambodia violated truce with more than 250 drones</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20251229-thailand-s-army-says-cambodia-violated-truce-with-more-than-250-drones</link><description>Thailand 's army on Monday accused Cambodia of violating a newly signed ceasefire agreement, reached after weeks of deadly border clashes, by flying more than 250 drones over its territory.

The Thai army said "more than 250 unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) were detected flying from the Cambodian side, intruding into Thailand's sovereign territory" on Sunday night, according to a statement.

"Such actions constitute provocation and a violation of measures aimed at reducing tensions, which are inconsistent with the Joint Statement agreed" during a bilateral border committee meeting on Saturday, it added.

Cambodian Foreign Minister Prak Sokhonn said in remarks aired on state television on Monday that the two sides had discussed the incident and agreed to investigate and "resolve it immediately".

Prak Sokhonn described it as "a small issue related to flying drones seen by both sides along the border line".

Thailand and Cambodia agreed to the "immediate" ceasefire on Saturday, pledging to end renewed border clashes that killed dozens of people and displaced more than a million this month.

The reignited fighting spread to nearly every border province on both sides, shattering an earlier truce for which US President Donald Trump took credit.

Under the agreement signed on Saturday, the Southeast Asian neighbours agreed to cease fire, freeze troop movements and co-operate on demining efforts and combatting cybercrime.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 10:26:39 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/e7a98c9a-e498-11f0-892e-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25360527101264.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Kremlin says Ukraine should withdraw troops from Donbas, and a Putin-Trump call expected soon</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/kremlin-says-ukraine-should-withdraw-troops-donbas-putin-trump-call-expected-2025-12-29/</link><description>MOSCOW, Dec 29 (Reuters) - The Kremlin said on Monday that Ukraine should withdraw its troops from the part of Donbas that it still controls if it wanted peace, and that if Kyiv did not strike a deal then it would lose yet more territory.

Putin and Trump spoke on Sunday ahead of Trump's meeting in Miami with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said another call was planned very soon.

Peskov refused to comment on the idea of a free economic zone in Donbas or on the future of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which is controlled by Russia, saying that the Kremlin felt it was inappropriate.

When asked about Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov's remarks about the decision that Kyiv needed to take on Donbas, Peskov said that Ukraine should withdraw its troops from the parts they still controlled.

"We are talking about the withdrawal of the regime's armed forces from the Donbas," Peskov said. When asked it that applied to the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions too, he refused to discuss details.

Russia currently controls a fifth of Ukraine, including Crimea which it annexed in 2014, about 90% of Donbas, 75% of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions, and slivers of the Kharkiv, Sumy, Mykolaiv and Dnipropetrovsk regions, according to Russian estimates.

Russia claims Donbas, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson as part of Russia, though most countries consider the regions to be part of Ukraine.

Peskov said no call between Putin and Zelenskiy was being discussed.

Peskov paraphrased Trump's remarks that Ukraine could lose more territory to Russia over coming months unless Kyiv struck a deal.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 10:49:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/SB7XZLJKLNJZPDNPOEUMI72S4M.jpg?auth=fd16f403ab4d121951b0fd7dcead01ca67230583a5c242c573234435c2f84321&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iraq's newly elected parliament holds first session</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iraqs-newly-elected-parliament-holds-first-session-2025-12-29/</link><description>BAGHDAD, Dec 29 (Reuters) - Iraq's newly elected parliament convened on Monday for its first session since the November national election, opening the way for lawmakers to begin the process of forming a new government.

The programme is aiming to reach around 55 million recipients by early January, Zulkifli Hasan told reporters after a meeting with government bodies to discuss food reserves for 2026.

The scheme was President Prabowo Subianto's flagship campaign promise in 2024, with the aim of distributing food to as many as 83 million school children and pregnant women, but it has been controversial due to its high costs and mounting food safety concerns.

Since its launch in January, more than 11,000 children nationwide have been affected by food poisoning, according to data from the agency overseeing the programme.

Prabowo had originally targeted the programme's full roll-out by the end of 2025. However, in October the target was scaled back to around 70 million as a result of a kitchen shortage.

Zulkifli did not explain why the targets have been scaled back again.

Indonesia has earmarked 171 trillion rupiah ($10.19 billion) for the programme this year under the original target, and the allocation for 2026 is set to be doubled to 335 trillion rupiah.

Hundreds of people surrounded the site at Muan International Airport where the Boeing (BA.N) , opens new tab 737-800 crash-landed without wheels deployed, slammed into the barrier and exploded into a fireball on December 29, 2024.

Relatives - who have said they are outraged by the lack of progress in finding out what went wrong - sobbed on Monday as they lit candles on a cake and sang 'Happy Birthday' for the 16 victims who were born in December.

"We will not stop until the truth is finally revealed and those responsible are held accountable so that the lives of the 179 were not lost for nothing," Kim Yu-jin, representing the families, said at a memorial service in the airport.

Addressing mourners, government officials and the Parliament speaker, Kim accused the government of focusing its energies on clearing up the aftermath of the crash rather than carrying out a proper investigation.

Relatives laid flowers on a memorial altar and looked on as the names of the dead were read out and displayed on a screen, written on cards in the shape of boarding tickets.

"I hope the investigation will be conducted thoroughly, so that those who deserve to be punished ... are punished,” Ryu Kum-Ji, who lost both her parents in the crash, told Reuters.

President Lee Jae Myung - who came to office six months after the disaster - apologised to the families in a statement earlier on Monday and said it was his duty to make sure there was no repeat of the tragedy.

"The disaster clearly revealed the systematic problems and limitations of our society," Lee said.

"What's needed now is not perfunctory promises or empty words but rather real change and action."

The government-led Aviation and Railway Accident Investigation Board has failed to meet a one-year deadline to release a report into the accident.

It said in a preliminary report in January that both of the plane's engines sustained bird strikes in an earlier approach to the airport.

In July, investigators said the left engine, which sustained less damage than the right one following the bird strikes, was shut down before the crash landing.

Few other details have emerged since then , with questions remaining about the design of the runway including the heavy embankment, and what actions the pilots may have taken in the last few minutes of the flight.

Representatives of the families have raised questions about the board's independence and expertise and said investigators appear to be blaming the pilots rather than looking into other factors.

Parliament has been reviewing a plan to overhaul the board.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 11:19:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/EQUOPCLLYFP4RCWEKWRSJ2RX6U.jpg?auth=7ef5075ddedbc119cbf9caaae973a8044a166e47e1e5b3c2bd4638bc8301ed7e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US pledges $2 billion in humanitarian support to UN, State Department says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-pledges-2-billion-humanitarian-support-un-state-department-says-2025-12-29/</link><description>GENEVA, Dec 29 (Reuters) - The United States has made a $2 billion pledge for U.N. humanitarian aid, a U.S. State Department official said on Monday, following major foreign aid cuts by the Trump administration in 2025.

The U.S. slashed its aid spending this year, and leading Western donors such as Germany also pared back assistance as they pivoted to increased defense spending, triggering a severe funding crunch for the United Nations.

The U.S. is pledging to commit $2 billion in funding to the U.N. for humanitarian aid, the U.S. State Department official said. No further details were provided on how the money would be allocated or if additional pledges would follow.

U.N. data shows total U.S. humanitarian contributions to the U.N. fell to about $3.38 billion in 2025, equating to about 14.8% of the global sum. This was down sharply from $14.1 billion the prior year, and a peak of $17.2 billion in 2022.

Earlier in December, the United Nations launched a 2026 aid appeal for $23 billion to reach 87 million people at risk - half the $47 billion sought for 2025, reflecting plunging donor support despite record global needs.

U.N. aid chief Tom Fletcher has said the U.N.'s humanitarian response is overstretched and underfunded, meaning "brutal choices" had to be made to prioritise those most in need.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 11:19:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/IJR273B4RBNXHGOCXUMHN5YYW4.jpg?auth=33f6e1048905cd59dabbb9bcb82195072afa8c0e9925ef7fad0b7dfab27a8754&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Explainer: Is peace in Ukraine any closer after Trump-Zelenskiy talks?</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/is-peace-ukraine-any-closer-after-trump-zelenskiy-talks-2025-12-29/</link><description>MOSCOW/KYIV, Dec 29 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump met his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Sunday and said the two were "maybe very close" to a deal to end the war with Russia.

But they gave few details on how the most contentious issues between the warring parties would be resolved, namely territorial concessions and security guarantees for Ukraine.

Here are some of the main sticking points after weeks of intense diplomacy:

Russia, which invaded Ukraine in February 2022, controls about 116,000 square km (44,800 square miles), or about 19.2%, of Ukrainian territory.

That is roughly 1.2% more than three years ago, according to pro-Ukrainian maps. Russia's forces have advanced in 2025 at the fastest pace since 2022.

Russia says Crimea, which Moscow annexed in 2014, the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk - together known as Donbas - plus Zaporizhzhia and Kherson are now legally part of Russia. Most of the international community says they were annexed illegally.

But Russia has not achieved its main aim of taking the whole of Donbas and on Monday it repeated demands that Ukraine withdraw from the area of Donetsk it still holds - about 5,000 square km - if it wants peace.

The Kremlin added that if Kyiv did not strike a deal it would lose more territory.

Kyiv rejects the idea of ceding territory it has been defending for nearly four years, saying it wants the fighting to be halted along current front lines.

Both Trump and Zelenskiy said on Sunday the future of Donbas had not been settled, although the U.S. president said discussions were "moving in the right direction."

Under its initial 28-point peace plan , the United States, seeking compromise, proposed a free economic zone if Ukraine left the area, although it remains unclear how any such zone would function in practice.

Russia also does not control all of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions, while it has taken small parts of Kharkiv, Sumy, Mykolaiv and Dnipropetrovsk regions.

Russia's Kommersant newspaper reported that Putin said he might be open to swapping some territory controlled by Russian forces elsewhere in Ukraine in exchange for all of Donbas.

Ukraine, wary of failed assurances from allies in the past, says it needs robust security guarantees to prevent another Russian attack.

Zelenskiy said on Monday a draft peace framework to end Russia's war envisages U.S. security guarantees for Ukraine for 15 years. He added he had asked Trump to provide guarantees of up to 50 years.

Trump wants Europe to take on the lion's share of providing any guarantees, albeit with U.S. backing, although what form they take remains unclear. Russia, for example, has stated that any foreign troop deployment in Ukraine would be unacceptable.

Russia has also demanded caps on the size of Ukraine's army and protection for Russian speakers and Orthodox believers in Ukraine, and says Ukraine should be neutral.

Kyiv says Russian speakers are protected and that Ukraine adheres to EU legislation. Under a Ukrainian 20-point peace proposal , Ukraine would maintain its armed forces at their present strength of 800,000 personnel.

One of Putin's central demands for ending the war is that Western leaders pledge in writing to stop enlarging the U.S.-led military alliance NATO eastwards.

The initial U.S. peace proposals included a clause that NATO would not expand further, that Ukraine would enshrine in its constitution that it will not join NATO and that NATO would include in its statutes a provision that Ukraine will not be admitted in the future.

Ukraine would get short-term preferential access to the European market while its bid to join the European Union was being considered.

Under Ukraine's framework peace proposal, the United States, NATO and European countries would provide Ukraine with security guarantees that mirror Article 5, the mutual-defence clause of NATO's founding treaty.

The initial U.S. proposals state that Russia, under Western sanctions over the war, would be reintegrated into the global economy and invited to be part of the G8.

The United States said in its initial proposals that it will strike a long-term agreement with Russia to develop "energy, natural resources, infrastructure, artificial intelligence, data centres, rare-earth metal extraction projects in the Arctic, and other mutually beneficial corporate opportunities."

European Union leaders decided in December to borrow cash to loan 90 billion euros ($105 billion) to Ukraine to fund its defence against Russia for the next two years.

They decided not to use frozen Russian assets, sidestepping divisions over an unprecedented plan to finance Kyiv with Russian sovereign cash.

Peace moves could possibly entail Russia and the United States agreeing to resume talks on strategic nuclear arms control.

The future of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station , which is in Ukrainian territory controlled by Russia, is unclear.

There has been media speculation that Russia might offer U.S. companies stakes in its vast natural resources sector.

Washington has floated the idea of holding elections in Ukraine. Putin says the Kyiv leadership lost legitimacy after refusing to hold elections when Zelenskiy's elected term expired. Kyiv says it cannot hold elections while under martial law and defending its territory against Russia.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 11:43:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HCPI5OLYDJJLNOSFEJJWP7GI5Q.jpg?auth=57c69ea45ff15746995f2d1e4c30125cc8b04f95a0698a58d09e7ed14238f555&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iranian shopkeepers protest, shut stores as currency hits record low</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20251229-iranian-shopkeepers-protest-shut-shop-as-currency-hits-record-low</link><description>Iranian traders and shopkeepers staged a second day of protests Monday after the country’s currency plummeted to a new record low against the US dollar.

Videos on social media showed hundreds taking part in rallies in Saadi Street in downtown Tehran as well as in the Shush neighborhood near Tehran's main Grand Bazaar, which played a crucial role in the 1979 Islamic Revolution that ousted the monarchy and brought Islamists to power.

Witnesses told The Associated Press that traders shut their shops and asked others to do the same. The semiofficial ILNA news agency said many businesses and merchants stopped trading even though some kept their shops open.

There was no reports of police raids though security was tight at the protests, according to witnesses.

On Sunday, protest gatherings were limited to two major mobile market in downtown Tehran, where the demonstrators chanted anti-government slogans.

Iran 's rial on Sunday plunged to 1.42 million to the dollar. On Monday, it traded at 1.38 million rials to the dollar.

The rapid depreciation is compounding inflationary pressure, pushing up prices of food and other daily necessities and further straining household budgets, a trend that could worsen by a gasoline price change introduced in recent days.

According to the state statistics center, inflation rate in December rose to 42.2% from the same period last year, and is 1.8% higher than in November. Foodstuff prices rose 72% and health and medical items were up 50% from December last year, according to the statistics centre. Many critics see the rate a sign of an approaching hyperinflation.

Reports in official Iranian media said that the government plans to increase taxes in the Iranian new year that begins March 21 have caused more concern.

Iran’s currency was trading at 32,000 rials to the dollar at the time of the 2015 nuclear accord that lifted international sanctions in exchange for tight controls on Iran’s nuclear programme. That deal unraveled after US President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew the United States from it in 2018.

There is also uncertainty over the risk of renewed conflict following June’s 12-day war involving Iran and Israel . Many Iranians also fear the possibility of a broader confrontation that could draw in the United States, adding to market anxiety.

In September, the United Nations reimposed nuclear-related sanctions on Iran through what diplomats described as the “snapback” mechanism. Those measures once again froze Iranian assets abroad, halted arms transactions with Tehran and imposed penalties tied to Iran’s ballistic missile programme.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 12:46:54 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/cd09a586-e4b2-11f0-9085-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP22357588236786.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump-Zelenskiy talks yield no progress on Ukraine-Russia territorial issues</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/trump-zelenskiy-talks-yield-no-progress-ukraine-russia-territorial-issues-2025-12-29/</link><description>KYIV, Dec 29 (Reuters) - Russia and Ukraine on Monday remained far apart on territorial issues that are blocking a peace deal, despite progress on security guarantees for Kyiv at talks between U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskiy.

Trump said after his talks with the Ukrainian president on Sunday that they were "getting a lot closer, maybe very close" to an agreement to end Russia's war in Ukraine but that "thorny issues" were still there.

Zelenskiy said two main issues outlined in a 20-point peace proposal remained to be resolved - control of Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station , which is in Russian hands, and the fate of the Donbas area of eastern Ukraine.

"Two questions remain: the station - how will the station operate? - and the territory," Zelenskiy told reporters on Monday.

Underlining how far apart Kyiv and Moscow are on territory, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Ukraine must withdraw its troops from the small part of Donbas that it still controls, and that Kyiv would lose more land if it did not agree to a deal.

"We are talking about the withdrawal of the regime's armed forces from the Donbas," Peskov said.

He said a call was planned soon between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, but did not say when.

Trump 's decision to hold talks with Zelenskiy in Florida on Sunday had widely raised hopes of at least some progress being made towards ending what has become Europe's deadliest conflict since World War Two.

Russia controls about a fifth of Ukraine, including the Crimean peninsula, which it annexed in 2014. It claims Donbas - comprising the Donetsk and Luhansk regions - as well as the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions, although they are all internationally recognised as Ukraine's sovereign territory.

Russia wants Kyiv to withdraw troops from parts of the Donetsk region it has failed to occupy in four years of war since its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Kyiv wants fighting halted along current front lines, and Washington has proposed a free economic zone if Ukraine pulls troops back.

"There is no detailed concept for a free economic zone yet," Zelenskiy said.

Russia has rejected the idea of a ceasefire to allow a referendum to be held on any territorial concessions by Ukraine.

One sign of progress on Sunday came when Zelenskiy said a bilateral agreement had been reached on security guarantees for Kyiv although Trump said they were only 95% ready.

"I told (Trump) that we have been at war for almost 15 years, and would very much like the guarantees to be for longer," Zelenskiy said, adding that he had asked Trump to consider a security deal for up to 50 years.

Trump said on Sunday he expected European countries to "take over a big part" of that effort with U.S. backing. Agreement on such moves could be complicated as Russia has said any foreign troop deployment in Ukraine would be unacceptable.

French President Emmanuel Macron said progress was being made on security guarantees, and countries in the so-called "Coalition of the Willing" would meet in Paris in early January to "finalise concrete contributions".

Despite the recent peace overtures, and some exchanges of prisoners of war, mistrust runs deep between Ukraine and Russia.

Russia launched a heavy attack on Ukraine before the talks in Florida began, and has stepped up attacks on Ukraine's energy facilities as winter approached. Large parts of the capital Kyiv were without power on Monday after the strike as temperatures were below freezing.

Trump repeated on Sunday after his call with Putin that he believed the Russian leader wants the war to end.

"In my opinion, (Putin's) actions do not coincide with the seemingly peaceful rhetoric he uses in his dialogue with the U.S. president," Zelenskiy said, questioning Putin's commitment to peace.

Zelenskiy said he was open to any format of communication with Russia, and a meeting would be possible after Trump and European leaders agree on the framework for peace. Peskov said no call between Putin and Zelenskiy was being discussed.

Putin has said Russia will achieve its aims in Ukraine by force if Kyiv does not want to resolve the conflict diplomatically - making clear it must accept Moscow's demands.

Several Ukrainians who spoke to Reuters in Kyiv on Monday voiced scepticism about prospects for a lasting peace.

"Putin doesn't need territory; he doesn't need Donbas — he wants to destroy the Ukrainians. He destroys us as a nation," said Nadiia Yevtushenko, a 57-year-old Kyiv resident.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 13:37:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/TIQQZVFAUZLC7AALHROSZIDXKY.jpg?auth=66d75f21ac9cddf8c0be51efbeb50922907b90bddc26584d1a68b7978fdcd493&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Putin amends law to let Russia ignore foreign criminal courts</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/putin-amends-law-let-russia-ignore-foreign-criminal-courts-2025-12-29/</link><description>MOSCOW, Dec 29 (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin on Monday signed into law changes that give Russia the right to ignore judgements in criminal cases issued by foreign and international courts amid Ukrainian and European attempts to punish Moscow for its actions in Ukraine.

The move, which comes as U.S. President Donald Trump is trying to broker a peace deal in Ukraine, appears to be a response to several initiatives to go after Russian officials and military officers for alleged war crimes in Ukraine, something Moscow denies its forces are guilty of.

Ukraine and the Council of Europe human rights body signed an agreement in June forming the basis for a special tribunal, and Europe this month launched an International Claims Commission for Ukraine in an effort to ensure Kyiv is compensated for hundreds of billions of dollars in damage from Russian attacks and alleged war crimes.

The International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague has also issued arrest warrants for Putin and five other Russians, accusing them of illegally deporting hundreds of children from Ukraine.

The Kremlin, which called the ICC move outrageous, says the allegation is false and that Moscow has only acted to remove children from a conflict zone for their own safety.

Under the changes to Russian law backed by Putin on Monday, Moscow will formally have the right under its own domestic legislation to disregard rulings in criminal cases taken by foreign courts on behalf of foreign governments without Russia's participation.

Rulings issued by international legal bodies whose authority is not based on an international agreement with Russia or a U.N. Security Council resolution can also be ignored under the changes.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 13:38:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/U7BSDZTPBBKVTKVY2LY6FL77AI.jpg?auth=e83a7516e7fbcac2c3a4fe63a029031fd49270f21ee506d12950338fd6ed8bbc&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Kosovo's 'political earthquake' election sees Kurti resurgent</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/kosovos-political-earthquake-election-sees-kurti-resurgent-2025-12-29/</link><description>PRISTINA, Dec 29 (Reuters) - An emphatic election victory for Kosovo's Prime Minister Albin Kurti marks a resurgence for the nationalist leader, ending a political deadlock in Europe's youngest state and potentially determining its domestic and international agenda for years.

The win strengthens Kurti's mandate to push through domestic reforms, including welfare expansion and higher salaries for public workers, although he faces major problems including tensions with Serbia and health and education systems that lag Kosovo's Balkan neighbours.

With nearly all the votes counted, Kurti's Vetevendosje Party led with more than 49% of Sunday's vote, official results show, meaning he only requires some very small coalition partners to form a majority.

It signals a turnaround for Kurti, whose failure to win enough votes in the last poll in February or form a coalition with larger opposition parties meant that parliament did not function for most of 2025, an impasse that led to delays in the delivery of around 1 billion euros in international funding vital for one of Europe's poorest countries.

The exact outcome of another term for Kurti is unclear, but at stake is Kosovo's relations with its historic international allies, including the United States, and its attempts to join the European Union, which Kurti supports.

"It's a political earthquake that has shattered the opposition parties, and we are going to feel the consequences of this result for the next decade," said political commentator Ilir Deda.

"Kosovo has decided to replace this political pluralism with a model of very strong government and weak opposition, like other countries in the Western Balkans."

Sunday's poll took place over the holiday period when Kosovo's diaspora are typically at home in force, which may have aided Kurti, who was previously elected in 2021. According to an exit poll conducted by Ubo Consulting, 61.7% of people from the diaspora voted for the prime minister's party.

"We are tired of this nine-month blockade that has cost us our nerves, cost Kosovo millions of euros, and set back our development. With this result there is a solution, which is why we are happy," said Tahir Shabani, 58, who lives in Germany but returned to Pristina to vote.

Still, others wanted to see immediate changes after the impasse, especially in quality of life, healthcare, and education.

"Institutions must be established and the state must continue to function. We have a lot of work to do, just as the Prime Minister said. The budget must be approved, we must approve international agreements, and progress must be made," said Pristina voter, Skender Halimi, 52.

Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008 with U.S. backing, including a 1999 NATO bombing campaign against Serbian forces trying to crush an uprising by the 90% ethnic Albanian majority.

Despite international support, the country of 1.6 million has struggled with poverty, instability and organised crime. While over 100 countries recognise Kosovo's statehood, Serbia, Greece, Spain, Russia and many others do not.

Tensions with Serbia flared violently in 2023, prompting the EU to impose sanctions on Kosovo - in part due to Kurti's policies against the Serb minority that still live in northern Kosovo. The measures likely cost Kosovo .

While that hit Kurti's reputation at home and abroad, the EU said it would lift the sanctions just as campaigning began this month.

"I think the electorate interpreted it as a sign that there are no problems between the Kurti government and the West," Deda said.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 13:38:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/PPYKFGOLEJN2HDWAWGTCAOZ264.jpg?auth=dc342393df8f9eb949db09b8af8bf9250e4c5f47e0f2f2ff7d019c7011d173eb&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>British boxer Joshua hurt in fatal car crash in Nigeria</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sports/briton-joshua-hurt-fatal-car-crash-nigeria-local-paper-reports-2025-12-29/</link><description>Dec 29 (Reuters) - British former heavyweight boxing champion Anthony Joshua was involved in a car accident in Nigeria's Ogun State that killed two people, local police said on Monday.

The three eastern Mediterranean nations have drawn closer over the past decade through joint military drills, defence procurement and energy cooperation, developments closely watched by regional rival Turkey.

Greece’s armed forces general staff (GEETHA) said senior military officials from the three countries signed a joint action plan for defence cooperation last week in Cyprus. It gave no further details.

The deal follows a meeting in Jerusalem between Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at which they signed a deal to strengthen maritime security cooperation and advance energy interconnection projects.

A senior Greek official familiar with the matter said the military deal would encompass joint naval and air exercises and the transfer of know-how from Israel to Greece and Cyprus to address both “asymmetrical” and “symmetrical” threats.

“Greece and Israel will intensify joint exercises after the ceasefire in Gaza , with Cyprus participating,” the official said, adding that Greece plans to join Israel’s Noble Dina naval exercise in the coming months in the eastern Mediterranean.

There was no immediate comment from the Cypriot government, but a key opposition party, the Communist AKEL, expressed misgivings. "Mr Christodoulides proceeds to deepen military-political cooperation with Israel without considering the risks and consequences of this choice," it said in a statement.

Greece and Cyprus have already purchased missile systems from Israel worth billions of euros. Athens is also in talks to buy from Israel medium- and long-range anti-aircraft and anti-ballistic missile systems for a planned multi-layer air and drone defence system known as the “Achilles Shield”, estimated to cost about 3 billion euros ($3.5 billion).

This month, the Greek parliament approved the purchase of 36 PULS rocket artillery systems from Israel to bolster defences along Greece’s northeastern border with Turkey and on Greek islands in the Aegean Sea.

"Tomorrow ... scheduled flights, including about 296 international departures, around 265 international arrivals and roughly 296 transit flights," will be affected, the administration said, adding it anticipated the hitches would snarl travel for "more than 100,000 passengers".

China's military on Monday dispatched air, navy and rocket troops to conduct joint military drills around the island of Taiwan, a move Beijing called a “stern warning” against separatist and “external interference” forces. Taiwan said it was placing its forces on alert and called the Chinese government “the biggest destroyer of peace".

The first of two days of drills came after Beijing expressed anger at US arms sales to the territory and a statement by Japan’s prime minister, Sanae Takaichi , saying its military could get involved if China were to take action against Taiwan, the self-governing island that the world’s second-biggest economy says must come under its rule. The Chinese military did not mention the United States and Japan in its statement on Monday morning.

Taiwan’s Defense Ministry said in a post on X that rapid response exercises were under way, with forces on high alert to defend the island. In a separate statement, it said it had deployed appropriate forces in response, conducting combat readiness drills.

“The Chinese Communist Party’s targeted military exercises further confirm its nature as an aggressor and the biggest destroyer of peace,” the ministry said.

Senior Col. Shi Yi, spokesperson of China's People's Liberation Army's Eastern Theater Command, said the drills would be conducted in the Taiwan Strait and areas to the north, southwest, southeast and east of the island.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 13:38:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/db87c414-e4b5-11f0-ae4e-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP24276120271264-1.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Hamas confirms deaths this year of armed wing spokesperson Abu Ubaida and Gaza chief Sinwar</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/hamas-confirms-deaths-this-year-armed-wing-spokesperson-abu-ubaida-gaza-chief-2025-12-29/</link><description>Dec 29 (Reuters) - Hamas confirmed on Monday that its armed wing spokesperson, Abu Ubaida, and then Gaza chief Mohammed Sinwar were killed in the Gaza war earlier this year.

The actress, who became a symbol of 1950s and 60s France, made her home in the resort where she said she found solace among animals and dedicated her life to their welfare.

"She was lovely, lovely, there's no other word. Yes, we will really miss her," Saint-Tropez resident Philippe Volmier told Reuters on Monday.

Volmier said he had known her for 30 years and used to see her walking her dogs on the beach. "One time, she fell into the water with her dog. I had to pick her out," he added. "She was a friend who helped people a lot."

President Emmanuel Macron said on Sunday Bardot embodied "a life of freedom". "A French existence, a universal radiance. She moved us. We mourn a legend of the century," he added.

For much of the latter part of her life, she lived alone behind high walls in the resort, surrounded by a menagerie of cats, dogs and horses.

She told French weekly Paris Match in 2024 that she wanted to be buried in her garden.

The Var Prefecture told Reuters it had not received any request for a private burial, which would have been needed to bury her in her garden.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 14:49:22 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KRLTKBNT7VIFJOA24XKFQDILXY.jpg?auth=882a7b9e7e9c27d9e1769f8f619ca19b0ffb61d7fda831c5a03a7dad7bdefaa2&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Aid workers find little life in Sudan's al-Fashir after paramilitary takeover</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/aid-workers-find-little-life-sudans-al-fashir-after-paramilitary-takeover-2025-12-29/</link><description>Dec 29 - International aid staff who accessed Sudan's al-Fashir for the first time since its takeover by a paramilitary force found the city largely deserted, with a few people sheltering in buildings or under plastic sheets, a senior U.N. official said on Monday.

More than 100,000 are estimated to have fled al-Fashir since late October after the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces took control there following an 18-month siege that plunged the city into famine.

Survivors reported ethnically-motivated mass killings and widespread detentions during and after the takeover. Many people remain unaccounted for in al-Fashir and surrounding areas.

In an interview with Reuters on Monday, Denise Brown, the U.N. Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Sudan, described al-Fashir as a "crime scene".

"The town was not teeming with people. There were very few people that (they) were able to see," she said, describing a visit to al-Fashir by U.N. staff on Friday that lasted several hours.

U.N. requirements of safe passage and free movement took weeks to negotiate, despite RSF attempts to portray the city as back to normal soon after its takeover.

Brown said it was not possible to give a precise number of those remaining in al-Fashir. Those who U.N. staff did see were living inside empty buildings or in rudimentary camps using basic plastic sheets.

There was a small market functioning, but with few items, mainly locally grown vegetables.

"We have photos of people, and you can see clearly on their faces the accumulation of fatigue, of stress, of anxiety, of loss," Brown said.

Other aid workers have previously said that those remaining are most likely those too old, sick, or injured to leave.

Satellite imagery from December 16 analysed by the Yale Humanitarian Research Lab showed signs of the removal of bodies but few signs of life.

At the Saudi Hospital , which the World Health Organization says was the site of a massacre of 460 people, Brown said medical personnel were observed, but they had no supplies.

Brown said villages around the city appeared to be deserted.

The attack on al-Fashir was one of the most violent episodes of a war that has raged since April 2023 between the RSF and the Sudanese army. It allowed the RSF to consolidate control over the Darfur region in Sudan's west, a push that continued in the northwest of the state this month.

Brown said Friday's visit was aimed at assessing whether al-Fashir could be accessed safely as the U.N. looks into what basic supplies can go in. "But to be honest, we're still very concerned about those who are injured, who we didn't see, those who may be detained," she said.

Later visits will look at water and sanitation, she said.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 14:50:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KMVVSRF2UJKBXCMM37GA4NAOOE.jpg?auth=3cc228b8c3dde4a0b324932542609aa81329f9a64a9a92bb786008b6990b5264&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>First UN visit to Sudan's El-Fasher finds traumatised civilians amid reports of mass atrocities</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/africa/20251229-first-un-visit-to-sudan-el-fasher-finds-traumatised-civilians-amid-reports-mass-atrocities-rsf</link><description>A small UN humanitarian team was able to visit Sudan 's El-Fasher, a city that fell to the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in October amid reports of mass atrocities. They found traumatised civilians living without water or sanitation in a city haunted by famine, according to UN aid coordinator Denise Brown.

El-Fasher fell to the paramilitary RSF in October after more than 500 days of siege, and last Friday a small UN humanitarian team was able to make its first short visit in almost two years.

The capture of the city was reportedly accompanied by mass atrocities, including massacres, torture and sexual violence. Satellite pictures reviewed by AFP show what appear to be mass graves.

Brown described the city as a "crime scene", but said investigations would be carried out by human rights experts while her office focuses on restoring aid to the survivors.

"We weren't able to see any of the detainees, and we believe there are detainees," she said.

From a humanitarian point of view, she said, El-Fasher remains Sudan's "epicentre of human suffering" and the city – which once held more than a million people – is still facing a famine.

"El-Fasher is a ghost of its former self," Brown said in an interview.

"We don't have enough information yet to conclude how many people remain there, but we know large parts of the city are destroyed. The people who remain, their homes have been destroyed."

"These people are living in very precarious situations," warned Brown, a Canadian diplomat and the United Nations' humanitarian coordinator in Sudan.

"Some of them in abandoned buildings. Some of them... in very rudimentary conditions, plastic sheeting, no sanitation, no water. So these are very undignified, unsafe conditions for people."</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 14:51:02 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/1964d254-e4c0-11f0-8e41-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25338411988211.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Putin tells army to press on with campaign to take southern Ukrainian region</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/putin-tells-army-press-with-campaign-take-southern-ukrainian-region-2025-12-29/</link><description>MOSCOW, Dec 29 (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin on Monday told his army to press on with a campaign to take full control of the Zaporizhzhia region in southern Ukraine after a Russian commander said Moscow's forces were 15 kilometres (9.3 miles) from its biggest city.

Putin made the comments a day after speaking to U.S. President Donald Trump about the prospects for a peace deal in Ukraine and was speaking at a televised Kremlin meeting with top military commanders and Andrei Belousov, the defence minister.

Colonel-General Mikhail Teplinsky, commander of Russia's Dnieper military grouping, told Putin that Russian forces were getting closer to the city of Zaporizhzhia, which had a pre-war population of over 700,000 people.

The wider Zaporizhzhia region - which Moscow controls around 75% of - is one of four Ukrainian provinces which Putin claimed as part of Russia in 2022, a move denounced by Kyiv and many Western countries as an illegal land grab.

"Frontline (Russian) units are located about 15 kilometres from the southern outskirts of the city of Zaporizhzhia," Teplinsky told Putin who responded:

"We understand and are aware that the enemy directly opposite you has been preparing its defence for many years, and we know how difficult the situation is there. But nevertheless, you are managing to accomplish the tasks facing the grouping."

The Kremlin chief told Teplinsky that he wanted more of the same.

"In the near future, it is necessary to continue the offensive, together with the East grouping to liberate Zaporizhzhia," said Putin.

General Valery Gerasimov, the chief of Russia's General Staff, had earlier told Putin that Moscow's forces were advancing along nearly the entire front line, while Kyiv's forces were focused on defence and attempting to counter attack.

Gerasimov reported that Russian forces in 2025 had captured 6,640 square kilometres (2,563 square miles) of territory in Ukraine, including 334 villages, and that advances notched up in December were the fastest this year.

Lavrov said that on Dec. 28-29, Ukraine had attacked the Russian president's state residence in the Novgorod region with 91 long-range drones which were all destroyed by Russian air defences.

"Such reckless actions will not go unanswered," Lavrov said, adding that the attack amounted to "state terrorism."

He said that targets had already been selected for retaliatory strikes by Russia's armed forces.

Lavrov noted that the attack took place during negotiations about a possible Ukrainian peace deal and that while Russia would not leave the negotiations, Moscow's position will be reviewed.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the accusation was a lie, adding that Moscow was preparing the ground to strike government buildings in Kyiv.

It was not immediately clear if Putin was in the residence at the time.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 15:45:12 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/TDKA4EZPEVKUVLOEWMUCEBIMYY.jpg?auth=1ec45a9063500ee0520858e67785f5289bdfae66734a7d2700d6a6d19fd9571a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Washington pipe bomb suspect has confessed, prosecutors say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/washington-pipe-bomb-suspect-has-confessed-prosecutors-say-2025-12-29/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Dec 29 (Reuters) - The man accused of planting pipe bombs in Washington the night before the January 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol attack confessed to the FBI and told investigators he thought the 2020 election had been “tampered with,” according to a court filing from federal prosecutors.

Brian Cole, 30, of Virginia admitted to planting the devices , neither of which exploded, outside the headquarters of the Democratic and Republican national committees following his arrest earlier this month , according to the filing, which was made public on Sunday.

Cole told FBI agents “something just snapped” and that he wanted to do something “to the parties” because of their influence in U.S. politics, adding “I really don’t like either party at this point,” according to excerpts of his interview cited in the filing.

Prosecutors revealed new details about the investigation as they argued that Cole should be detained while awaiting a trial. A hearing is scheduled for Tuesday in Washington federal court.

Cole is facing two explosives-related charges. He has not yet entered a plea.

Cole’s arrest nearly five years after the incident came after top officials at the FBI ordered a fresh look at a case that had long vexed investigators and became fodder for right-wing theories tied to the Capitol riot.

Cole denied in the FBI interview that the placement of the bombs on January 5, 2021 was connected to the certification of the election in Congress on the following day.

The pipe bombs were not discovered until about 1 p.m. on January 6, diverting police resources just as a mob of supporters of President Donald Trump surged into the Capitol.

He initially denied planting the devices, telling the FBI that he had been in Washington to attend a protest to support Trump's false claims that his defeat in the 2020 election was the result of rampant voter fraud.

Cole told the FBI that powerful people needed to speak out if “something as important as voting in the federal election is being tampered with.”</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 16:27:49 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/VAJWJVTBVNNW7A2LU2CNZ4444E.jpg?auth=4ef2a32979395681a8ac49221a00bf365b263e4d5ac0af92f76922db1948d8c1&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Egyptian-British activist apologises for past social media posts as police launch review</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/egyptian-british-activist-apologises-past-social-media-posts-police-launch-2025-12-29/</link><description>Dec 29 (Reuters) - Activist Alaa Abd el-Fattah, freed from prison in Egypt and now in Britain, apologised on Monday for his "shocking and hurtful" social media posts made more than a decade ago, which counter terrorism police said they are assessing.

Abd el-Fattah, 44, became Egypt's most prominent political prisoner after spending years in and out of detention and a rare symbol of opposition during a crackdown under President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.

He arrived in Britain last Friday after obtaining British citizenship in 2021 through his mother, with Prime Minister Keir Starmer saying he was "delighted" by the news.

In the following days, British newspapers ran stories about posts he made on the former Twitter platform between 2008 and 2014, seen by Reuters, which endorsed violence against "Zionists" and police.

In another he called British people "dogs and monkeys".

Counter Terrorism Policing said the posts were being assessed following referrals from the public.

In a statement, Abd el-Fattah said many of his tweets had been misunderstood but that others were unacceptable.

"Looking at the tweets now - the ones that were not completely twisted out of their meaning - I do understand how shocking and hurtful they are, and for that I unequivocally apologise," he said.

He added they were mostly "expressions of a young man's anger and frustrations" at wars in Iraq, Lebanon and Gaza, and "the rise of police brutality against Egyptian youth."

Nigel Farage, leader of the right-wing Reform UK party which tops opinion polls, called for Abd el-Fattah's deportation. Kemi Badenoch, the leader of the opposition Conservative Party, said the country should consider it.

A spokesperson for Starmer said he was not aware of the tweets when he campaigned for Abd el-Fattah's release and called the comments "abhorrent".

But the spokesperson added the government has a record of helping its citizens overseas.

The Board of Deputies of British Jews said his posts were of "profound concern."

Abd el-Fattah was most recently serving a five-year sentence in Egypt imposed in December 2021, after he shared a social media post about a prisoner's death.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 16:28:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/QK76DQG2HVNC5LEUBHVEPACXME.jpg?auth=5cf49f84ff6c118c612ab2b6e20b24978573a6b58d7e099e4cda93131f6cf9fd&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Egyptian-British activist apologises for past social media posts as police launch review</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/egyptian-british-activist-apologises-past-social-media-posts-police-launch-2025-12-29/</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 16:28:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>External power line to Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant has been restored, management says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/external-power-line-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-has-been-restored-management-says-2025-12-29/</link><description>Dec 29 (Reuters) - An external power link has been restored to the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station in Ukraine after the completion of repairs, the plant's Russian management said on Monday.

A statement said the line had been put out of action by "fire from the Ukrainian armed forces". Repairs were carried out with monitors present from the U.N. nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency. It said the situation at the plant was under control, with normal radiation levels.

The station is connected to the power grid by two lines -- the second had remained in operation through the repair work.

In September and October, the plant was without external power for 30 days, relying on backup diesel generators, until a damaged line was reconnected during a local ceasefire arranged with the IAEA's help.

Russian forces seized the nuclear plant, Europe's largest, in the early weeks of Moscow's invasion of Ukraine and each side regularly accuses the other of actions endangering safety there.

The plant is not producing electricity but relies on external power to keep nuclear fuel cool and avoid a meltdown.

The future of the plant's operations is one of the sticking points in talks to resolve the nearly four-year-old conflict pitting Moscow against Kyiv.

Almost all countries consider that it belongs to Ukraine but Russia says it is owned by Russia and a unit of Russia's state-owned Rosatom nuclear corporation runs the plant.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in December that the U.S. had proposed joint trilateral operation of the nuclear power plant with an American chief manager.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 16:50:22 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/TPR4EJB3NRP77ORUJE5FNMEOIM.jpg?auth=a0634d7c12f492c874fb792d5fe4458a35783a0f2b08ba7516bf8f6e698dba89&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Putin told Trump that Russia's position will change after Ukrainian drone attack on residence</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/putin-told-trump-that-russias-position-will-change-after-ukrainian-drone-attack-2025-12-29/</link><description>MOSCOW, Dec 29 (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin told U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday that Russia would review its position in peace negotiations after what Moscow said was a Ukrainian drone attack on a Russian presidential residence, the Kremlin said.

The regulation, which goes into effect on Wednesday, allows U.S. authorities to bar asylum based on "emergency public health concerns generated by a communicable disease," according to a copy posted in the Federal Register on Monday.

The restrictions would not have any immediate effect but would provide the Trump administration with another tool to turn away would-be asylum seekers at the U.S.-Mexico border. The number of migrants caught crossing illegally dropped to the lowest levels in decades after Trump took office in January and implemented a sweeping asylum ban at the border.

When COVID-19 took root in 2020 during Trump's first term, his administration used a U.S. health authority known as Title 42 to rapidly expel migrants crossing the border back to Mexico, saying it was needed to limit the spread of the virus. Former President Joe Biden, a Democrat who followed Trump in 2021, kept the Title 42 restrictions in place until 2023 , partly due to legal challenges that stalled attempts to end it.

Advocates have criticized the use of health emergencies to broadly deny access to asylum, saying U.S. law has been twisted to fulfill Trump's goal of turning away migrants.

"Considering the large amount of discretion the regulation grants the administration, and the president’s hyperfixation on immigration enforcement, we can expect this new authority to be overused and abused," said Sarah Pierce, director of social policy at the center-left group Third Way.

The Biden administration postponed the effective date of the regulation five times, but did not take steps to terminate it.

In addition to asylum, the measure also allows federal agencies to deny another form of protection known as "withholding of removal."</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 16:50:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/D36XCNWKNZIWXKBFJN57YSPP6Y.jpg?auth=9e52782b4c66d7612badbe21c4628c8da1a294ea8d47f7e9a8677b61fd6197c7&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukraine bonds at post-restructuring highs as investors see some progress in peace talks</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-bonds-post-restructuring-highs-investors-see-some-progress-peace-talks-2025-12-29/</link><description>LONDON, Dec 29 (Reuters) - Ukraine's government bonds rallied on Monday as investors saw some positive signs in talks on a deal to end the war with Russia, with some bonds hitting their highest since emerging from last year's $20 billion sovereign debt restructuring.

There was progress on security guarantees for Kyiv at talks between U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Sunday but Russia and Ukraine on Monday remained far apart on the main territorial issues blocking a peace agreement.

Ukraine's bonds have surged in the last 1-1/2 months amid a renewed push to halt the near four-year-old war and most added another 1 cent on the dollar , , , on Monday, following a busy weekend of diplomacy.

U.S. President Donald Trump said on Sunday that he and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy were now "getting a lot closer, maybe very close " to an agreement to end the war.

Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin held a call on Monday with Moscow also saying Ukraine had tried to attack Putin's Dolgiye Borody, or Long Beards, residence in northern Russia, an accusation that Kyiv denied.

Hopes for peace have been repeatedly dashed over the last year, but the moves in Ukraine's bonds have signalled renewed optimism, among investors at least, that a truce might now be within reach.

Monday's gains notably left Ukraine's 4.5% coupon 2034 and 2035 bonds - two of its most widely-traded - almost exactly where they were in early February before Trump's branding of Zelenskiy as a "dictator" and then scolding of him in the Oval Office triggered a major collapse in prices.

The bonds have also been boosted over the last six weeks by plans for a new four-year, $8.2 billion International Monetary Fund programme and a 90 billion euro ($105.83 billion) European Union loan to shore up the government's finances.

Kyiv has also just struck a long-awaited deal to replace the so-called 'GDP warrants' that helped it clinch is 2015 post-Crimea annexation debt restructuring, but had risked draining its finances once the current war ends.

Despite their widespread gains, not all of Ukraine's bonds are above or back to their early February highs.

Two where the payments are linked to the country's future economic growth rather than via regular coupons, and that won't mature for at least another 10 years , , remain well below, at roughly 57 cents on the dollar, compared to almost 70 cents back in February.

The confirmation of the visit follows a report published on Monday by British newspaper The Telegraph that said Milei planned to visit Britain.

The president's office did not provide details on the purpose of the visit or who Milei would meet with.

The Telegraph said that Milei confirmed in an interview that talks had begun to lift a ban on weapons sales stemming from the conflict over the British-run Falkland Islands.

Milei has previously maintained that Argentina should try to take back the islands, known in Argentina as the Islas Malvinas, through diplomatic channels.

Argentina has long claimed sovereignty over the islands, which Britain and Argentina fought a war over in 1982. The islands are in the South Atlantic about 600 kilometers from the Argentine mainland.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 16:51:03 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/JYDEIPIUHRK55OEHM5SDJN546A.jpg?auth=8a32c0bca714c40a95f585fd06b169a17ff192e20c0a4ae255a73e0cd55a9435&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukraine bonds at post-restructuring highs as investors see some progress in peace talks</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-bonds-post-restructuring-highs-investors-see-some-progress-peace-talks-2025-12-29/</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 16:51:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Argentina's Milei to visit UK this year</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/argentinas-milei-visit-uk-this-year-2025-12-29/</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 16:51:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Hamas armed wing confirms spokesman Abu Obeida killed by Israeli strike in August</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20251229-hamas-armed-wing-confirms-spokesman-abu-obeida-killed-by-israeli-strike-august</link><description>Hamas 's armed wing confirmed on Monday the death of its spokesperson, Abu Obeida, months after Israel announced he had been killed in an air strike in Gaza.

The Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades released a video statement on its Telegram channel, saying: "We pause in reverence before... the masked man loved by millions... the great martyred commander and spokesperson of the Qassam Brigades, Abu Obeida."

Israel previously announced it had killed Abu Obeida in a strike on Gaza on August 30.

During the war, Abu Obeida, whose real name was Hudhayfa Samir al-Kahlout, emerged as a central figure eagerly awaited by Gazans, as well as by Arab and international media, for official statements from Hamas's military wing, particularly those related to prisoner-exchange operations.

Born on February 11, 1985, and raised in the Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza, Abu Obeida joined Hamas at an early age before becoming a member of the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades.

He later became the group's sole spokesman, delivering video statements in military uniform with his face consistently concealed by a red keffiyeh.

He had been the target of multiple Israeli assassination attempts.

According to Hamas officials, Abu Obeida embodied what they describe as "resistance" and was known for fiery and impactful speeches, many of which included threats against Israel or announcements of military operations.

"For many years, only a very small circle of Hamas officials knew his true identity," a Hamas official told AFP.

Israel has decimated Hamas's leadership, saying it seeks to eradicate the group following Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack on Israel, which triggered the war.

The video announcing Abu Obeida's death was delivered by a masked man dressed in the former spokesperson's distinctive style, who said he would adopt his predecessor's name for future statements.

In the same video, he also announced the deaths of four other Hamas commanders in Israeli attacks during the war.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 16:51:44 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/fded5282-e4d1-11f0-b132-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP100326133624.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>What's next for Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant?</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20251229-what-next-for-ukraine-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-plant-russia-peace-plan</link><description>The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant , Europe's largest, is one of the main sticking points in the US peace plan to end the war between Russia and Ukraine. The issue is one of 20 points laid out by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a framework peace plan that he discussed with his American counterpart Donald Trump in Florida on Sunday.

Here are some of the issues regarding the facility:

Russia took control of the plant, which lies close to the front ​lines, in March 2022 and announced plans to connect it to its power grid.

Almost all countries consider that it belongs to Ukraine but Russia says it is owned by Russia ‍and a unit of Russia's state-owned Rosatom nuclear corporation runs the plant.

Zelensky stated in December that the US had proposed joint trilateral operation of the nuclear power plant with an American chief manager.

Zelensky said the Ukrainian proposal envisages Ukrainian-American use of the plant, with the US itself determining how ​to use 50% of the energy produced.

Russia has considered joint Russian-US use of the plant, according to the Kommersant newspaper.

After his talks with Zelenskiy on ​Sunday, Trump said negotiators had made progress on deciding the fate of the plant, which can "start up almost immediately". The US president said "it's a big step" that Russia had not bombed the facility.

The plant is located in Enerhodar on the banks of the Dnipro River and the Kakhovka Reservoir, 550 km (342 miles) southeast of the capital Kyiv.

The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has six Soviet-designed reactors with a total capacity of 5.7 gigawatts, according to an International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) database.

It is not currently producing electricity but relies on external power to keep the nuclear material cool and avoid a meltdown.

The plant's equipment is powered by electricity supplied from Ukraine. Over the past four years these supplies have been interrupted at least 11 times due to breaks in power lines, forcing the plant to switch to emergency diesel generators.

Both Russia and Ukraine accuse each other of striking the nuclear plant and of severing power lines ‍leading to it.

IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi says fighting a war around a nuclear plant has put nuclear safety and security in constant jeopardy.

The Russian head of the station said on Monday the facility could restart power generation by mid-2027 if the war concluded soon.

Russia has been preparing to restart the station but says that doing so will depend on the situation in the area. Rosatom chief Alexei Likhachev has not ruled out the supply of electricity produced there to parts of Ukraine.

Oleksandr Kharchenko, director of the Energy Research Centre in Kyiv, said Moscow intended to use the plant to cover a significant energy deficit in ‌Russia's south.

In December, Russia's Federal Service for Environmental, Technological and Nuclear Supervision issued a license for the operation of reactor No. 1, a key step towards restarting the reactor.

Ukraine's energy ministry called the move illegal and irresponsible, risking a nuclear accident.

Russia has been pummelling Ukraine's energy infrastructure throughout the war. In ‍recent months, Russia has sharply increased the scale and intensity of its attacks, plunging entire regions into darkness.

Analysts say Ukraine's generation capacity deficit is about 4 gigawatts, or the equivalent of four Zaporizhzhia reactors.

Kharchenko says it would take Ukraine five to seven years to build the generating capacity to compensate for the loss of the Zaporizhzhia plant.

Kharchenko said that if Kyiv regained control of the plant, it would take at least two to three years to understand what condition it was in and another three years to restore the equipment and return it to full operation.

Both Ukrainian state nuclear operator Energoatom and Kharchenko said Ukraine did not know the real condition of the nuclear power plant today.

In the long term, there is the unresolved problem of the lack of water resources to cool the reactors after the vast Kakhovka hydro-electric dam was blown up in 2023, destroying the reservoir that supplied water ‍to the plant.

Besides reactors, there are spent fuel pools at each reactor site used to cool down used nuclear fuel. Without water supply to the pools, the water evaporates and temperatures increase, risking fire.

An emission of hydrogen from a spent fuel ‌pool caused an explosion in Japan's Fukushima ​nuclear disaster in 2011.

Energoatom said the level of the Zaporizhzhia power plant cooling pond had dropped by more than 15%, or 3 metres, since the destruction of the dam, and continued to fall.

Ukrainian officials previously said the available water reserves may be sufficient to operate one or, at most, two nuclear reactors.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 17:22:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/75da110e-9ec8-11f0-91d6-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/2025-09-30T193638Z-1410058750-RC2GJ1AWM0PS-RTRMADP-3-UKRAINE-CRISIS-ZAPORIZHZHIA.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Syria: Construction of new tunnels in Raqqa sparks fears of renewed conflict</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20251229-syria-construction-new-tunnels-raqqa-sparks-fears-renewed-conflict</link><description>Raqqa , located on the eastern bank of the Euphrates River in northeast Syria , has experienced every stage of the war in Syria. It was the first large city to join the uprising against former president Bashar al-Assad in 2013. Then, it was taken over by the Islamic State group in 2014, becoming its de facto capital. In October 2017, after a destructive campaign led by an international coalition, the town was taken back by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF).

However, many of its residents now say that they are worried. Images and videos taken since spring 2025 show heavy machinery being used to dig the entrances to tunnels in a number of residential areas. So far, there has been no official explanation given by local authorities, who are affiliated with the SDF.

This construction is taking place as the December 31 expiration date approaches quickly for the deal signed on March 10, 2025, between the SDF and the Syrian government. The agreement was meant to establish the progressive integration of the Kurds’ civil and military institutions into the central government.

Analysts say that there are two possible outcomes. Either the deal will be extended in the hopes that the SDF can be integrated into the national government, or the new Syrian government may launch an offensive to recapture the areas under SDF control.

Several people died when clashes between the SDF and the Syrian government forces broke out on December 22 in Aleppo .

Salamah (not his real name) lives in Raqqa and has been observing the recent activity with trepidation.

“After the agreement was signed last March between the SDF and the new Syrian government, I noticed that I was seeing more and more tunnel entrances in the city’s streets. Wherever I go, I see workers coming out of these openings.

The sound of digging is audible even when you are inside your house because these tunnels go under civilian residences.

Back in May, there was a collapse on al-Wadi street . Dozens of families have left the al-Firdous neighbourhood because of the construction of tunnels. This neighbourhood is strategic because it sits above the rest of the city.”

Salamah says that there are at least 30 visible tunnel entrances in the city. Workers involved in the excavation work come and go from some of the tunnel entrances, in particular those near Raqqa’s National Hospital.

A video published on April 6 shows excavation work being carried out near the entrance to the National Hospital. You can see three workers gathering around a winch positioned on a metal frame. At a certain point in the video, one of the workers seems to disappear into a hole.

The mounds of earth visible in the image look like what is removed when a tunnel is dug out. The metal frame is what is known in Syria as a “raf‘a”: you affix a motor onto it and then use it to lower down a wheelbarrow then lift it back up filled with dug-out earth.

Aside from the building site near the National Hospital, people also observed other sites near Al-Mawasi Hospital , near the city’s municipal stadium and in residential neighbourhoods , as shown in the photos posted online. Local people were able to verify the authenticity of the images for us.

A photo published on Facebook on June 11, 2025, shows a truck carrying concrete supports . The caption explains that the blocks will be used to provide reinforcements for Raqqa’s tunnels. Another post, this one from November 9, 2025, shows the SDF opening a centre for making concrete blocks in Al-Aqtan Place, in the north of the city. Residents say that the centre is in constant operation.

Our team reached out to the SDF officials to ask them about the existence, the nature and the goals of the tunnels dug in the city of Raqqa. They had not responded to our questions by the time of publication.

According to an analyst specialised in the region, these building sites are part of an old strategy often used in zones under the control of the SDF. Back in 2014, it was adopted by the YPG, the Syrian Kurdish militia, whose full name is the People’s Protection Units.

“The People's Protection Units (YPG) started to dig tunnels beginning in mid-2014 in the region of Hassaké when the region was being bombarded with Turkish strikes. Initially, the aim was to protect themselves from the Turkish planes. [After the SDF was created in 2015], digging operations intensified in all the regions under their control, including Manbij, Afrin and Hassaké.”

According to another analyst, based in Raqqa, the building work began to accelerate after March 2025, despite the deal reached with Damascus . He said the building sites are being run by entrepreneurs – most of them Kurdish – who responded to a call for applications. He describes the creation of a giant, regional subterranean network.

“The tunnels have been dug in order to prepare for urban fighting, to fortify positions and to build secret passages that allow for mobility during military clashes. The tunnels are divided into three categories: there are galleries meant for the displacement of personnel, corridors that are large enough to allow vehicles to pass and still other tunnels are meant to be used as shelters and command centres.

Because the tunnels are connected, the collapse of just one could lead to the collapse of dozens of buildings and lead to mass civilian casualties.”

Locals say there is a palpable disquiet. Salamah explained this to us.

“I have the sense that the SDF is preparing the city for some kind of resistance. Like many other residents, I fear a new war.”

Another city resident, whom we are calling Qassem, says that he is worried about the structural integrity of the buildings with tunnels under them:

“The situation is frightening. A few months ago, the SDF kicked out a family living near Raqqa’s municipal stadium because they wanted to create a tunnel starting in a room in their house.

It’s catastrophic. The tunnels are everywhere – under mosques, hospitals, public gardens. All of that seems to indicate preparation for a military confrontation with the army.”

Raqqa’s predominantly sandy soil sits close to the groundwater table. It’s also an area prone to seismic activity. All of this frightens residents. Collapses are common.

Photos posted on November 15 show a collapse in a residential neighbourhood near Al-Furusiyah, located to the north of the city. Locals blamed the collapse on tunnels under the ground.

Trump made the comments on Friday, December 26 in an interview with John Catsimatidis, a billionaire talk show host, on the WABC radio station in New York. They were discussing Washington's campaign to target vessels in the Caribbean and off the coast of Venezuela suspected of trafficking drugs to the U.S.

"They have a big plant or a big facility where the ships come from,” Trump said on the radio show. “Two nights ago we knocked that out.”

If Trump's statement is accurate, it would mark the first known U.S. land attack related to the administration’s campaign against Venezuela.

Trump did not say which facility the U.S. had targeted, nor did he make clear if this operation was conducted by a branch of the military or some other entity. Trump has previously said that he has authorized the CIA to carry out covert operations in Venezuela.

The Central Intelligence Agency, the White House and the Pentagon have not publicly elaborated on Trump’s comments and declined to comment on questions posed by Reuters. It is unusual for the administration to decline to address questions related to on-the-record statements made by Trump, especially about Venezuela.

The Venezuelan government has not commented on the incident Trump described and there have been no independent reports from Venezuela of it.

The administration has previously touted its success in taking out suspected drug trafficking vessels. The Pentagon has even posted footage of several of its strikes on social media.

The lack of response by U.S. national security agencies raises questions about whether the incident Trump mentioned was carried out covertly. Such an operation would likely limit the ability of U.S. officials to speak on the matter.

Last month Reuters reported that the U.S. was poised to launch a new phase of Venezuela-related operations, as the Trump administration escalates pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's government.

At the time, two U.S. officials said covert operations would likely be the first part of the new action against Maduro.

The U.S. mission has primarily focused on military strikes against suspected drug trafficking vessels and has prompted intense oversight from Congress. More than 100 people have been killed in more than 20 strikes in the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific.

Earlier this month, U.S. military leaders briefed lawmakers on an incident in September in which an American strike killed 11 people but left several survivors. They were killed in a second strike ordered by Admiral Frank Bradley.

Democrats on Capitol Hill have questioned whether the second strike was conducted in accordance with international law.

Trump's comments come amid a massive U.S. military build up in the Caribbean, including more than 15,000 troops.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 18:31:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/T2RMY6MV3ROH7OP5JMZP4ZZ4QA.jpg?auth=ee561b5215605a15c7d96a1828588a661b2043fe06f2736028986c35209d10ab&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Italy backs Ukraine military aid through 2026 after coalition clash</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/italy-backs-ukraine-military-aid-through-2026-after-coalition-clash-2025-12-29/</link><description>ROME, Dec 29 (Reuters) - Italy's cabinet on Monday approved a decree to keep military aid flowing to Ukraine through 2026, sealing a coalition compromise after weeks of debate that exposed divisions over foreign policy within Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's government.

The accord followed threats by the far-right League, which had close ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin before Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine , to abstain on the measure and thereby exacerbate rifts over Italy's stance on the war.

League leader Matteo Salvini, who serves as deputy prime minister, had argued that dispatching additional military aid to Ukraine could fuel corruption in Kyiv and would not help end the war. Critics accused him of promoting Putin's agenda.

The new decree is similar to bills approved in the past three years, stating that the government will transfer military vehicles, materials and equipment to Ukraine.

However, the League said that in a change from the 2025 text, the new decree stated that priority would be given to logistical and medical items for civilian use, and for equipment needed to defend against missile, drone and cyber attacks.

Meloni's office did not immediately release the text.

Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani, who heads the coalition Forza Italia party, welcomed the new bill, which has to be approved by parliament within two months.

"It's an absolutely balanced decree, like the previous ones. Italy will continue to support Ukraine militarily, economically, financially, and politically," he was quoted as saying by Corriere della Sera daily.

Since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Italy has sent 12 packages of military aid to Kyiv, although it has never revealed exactly what it has dispatched, saying this is classified information.

Defence Chief of Staff General Luciano Portolano told Il Sole 24 Ore newspaper on Sunday that Italy had so far sent supplies worth more than 3 billion euros ($3.5 billion).

While Italy has been a consistent contributor of aid to Ukraine, it has lagged behind other major European economies, notably Germany, which has sent more than 15 billion euros in military supplies to Ukraine, with billions more promised.

Trump made the comments as he greeted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.

"There was a major explosion in the dock area where they load the boats up with drugs. They load the boats up with drugs. We hit all the boats, and now we hit the area," Trump said, without providing any further details.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 19:17:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/J2OT46IMSVO2LHG3HHCW3T5WGM.jpg?auth=1bb42dc711388997fd45b2f1aac58ca16ebd233c55b315fd77faa5f6343d7aff&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump says US hit Venezuela dock where drugs were allegedly loaded</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-says-us-hit-venezuela-dock-where-drugs-were-allegedly-loaded-2025-12-29/</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 19:18:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>George Clooney, his wife Amal and children become French citizens</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20251229-george-clooney-his-wife-amal-and-children-become-french-citizens</link><description>Hollywood star George Clooney has become French, along with his wife Amal Alamuddin Clooney and their two children, according to an official decree seen by AFP on Monday.

The publication, in France 's government gazette, confirms an ambition Clooney alluded to early in December when he hailed French privacy laws that keep his family shielded from paparazzi.

"I love the French culture , your language, even if I'm still bad at it after 400 days of courses," the 64-year-old actor told RTL radio at the time – in English.

"Here, they don't take photos of kids. There aren't any paparazzi hidden at the school gates. That's number one for us," he said.

The now-dual US-French citizen has a long attachment to Europe, which even pre-dates his 2014 marriage to Amal, a British-Lebanese human rights lawyer who speaks fluent French.

Clooney owns an estate in Italy's picturesque Lake Como region, purchased in 2002, and he and Amal bought a historic manor in England.

Their property in southern France – a former wine estate called the Domaine du Canadel, near the village of Brignoles – was purchased in 2021.

They also own a New York apartment and a property in Kentucky, but reportedly sold homes in Los Angeles and Mexico over the past decade.

The glamorous couple are parents to eight-year-old twins.

Clooney told RTL that although the family jet-sets around, their French home "is where we're happiest".

Clooney is also a director and producer, and has two Oscars to put on whichever mantlepiece suits: one for best supporting actor in 2006's "Syriana" and as a producer on 2012's "Argo".

On top of his cinema pay cheques, he has raked in millions for celebrity endorsements, including for Nespresso, and got a windfall pay-out for selling his stake in a tequila brand.

Clooney is not the only Hollywood luminary to want to go French: US director Jim Jarmusch on Friday told France Inter radio that he plans to apply for French nationality.

"I would like a place that will allow me to escape from the United States," he said, also saying he was attracted to French culture.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 19:18:26 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/fdc226ea-e4d9-11f0-9783-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/000-78E38F3.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Judge grants release of redacted transcript of Charlie Kirk case hearing</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/judge-grants-release-redacted-transcript-charlie-kirk-case-hearing-2025-12-29/</link><description>Dec 29 (Reuters) - A Utah judge overseeing the trial of the accused killer of conservative activist Charlie Kirk on Monday ordered the release of most of the transcript and audio of a closed-door hearing on safety and security measures for the proceedings, but said media outlets who had asked for the records did not need special status to cover the proceedings.

Judge Tony Graf made his two rulings on media requests during a video hearing that suspect Tyler Robinson attended by audio link. Robinson spoke only once, replying "yes, your honor," when asked by Graf whether he was present.

Robinson is accused of firing a single round from a rooftop that killed Kirk as he debated students on a stop on a U.S. university tour.

Robinson is charged with seven criminal counts, including aggravated murder, obstruction of justice for disposing of evidence, and witness tampering for asking his roommate to delete incriminating texts. Prosecutors said they would seek the death penalty .

Media outlets covering the case had asked for records of a closed hearing on Oct. 24 that dealt with what safety restraints and clothing Robinson was required to wear in court. The judge on Monday ordered the redaction of about one page worth of text of the 80-page transcript and the corresponding audio.

Graf has ruled Robinson may appear in court in regular clothes but must be physically restrained, and prohibited media from filming or photographing Robinson's handcuffs and shackles after his lawyers said such images could prejudice potential jurors.

Media outlets had asked for status that would have ensured they received notice of attempts to close hearings or otherwise limit access to the proceedings to give them time to challenge restrictions. Graf denied that request, citing a prior order that lawyers for both sides must notify the media before attempting to have future hearings held behind closed doors.

At a February hearing, Graf will consider a defense request to ban cameras from the courtroom.

Kirk's death sparked denunciations of political violence across the ideological spectrum.

The doctors carried out a "phrenic nerve block procedure" on Bolsonaro to block his left phrenic nerve, after he had undergone a similar surgery on Saturday to treat the right one.

In medical literature, the phrenic nerve is described as a vital nerve originating in the neck that controls the diaphragm, the primary muscle for breathing.

The surgery at the DF Star hospital in capital Brasilia lasted for about an hour and was concluded near 3 p.m. local time (1800 GMT), according to information provided by his wife, former First Lady Michelle Bolsonaro, on social media.

A medical note on the surgery is expected to be released later.

Bolsonaro, 70, had been hospitalized on Wednesday for hernia surgery on Christmas Day. His doctors then decided to also carry out procedures to treat his hiccups during his hospital stay.

The ex-president has faced health problems since a stabbing he suffered in September 2018, during a presidential campaign event in the town of Juiz de Fora, in Minas Gerais state.

Bolsonaro was convicted and sentenced to over 27 years in prison by Brazil's Supreme Court in September for plotting a coup to overturn his 2022 election loss. He started to serve his sentence last month.

"I don't like it. It's not good," Trump told reporters when asked if he was worried the allegation could affect his efforts to broker peace. "I learned about it from President Putin today. I was very angry about it."

"It's a delicate period of time. This is not the right time. It's one thing to be offensive, because they're offensive. It's another thing to attack his house. It's not the right time to do any of that," he said.

When asked if there was any evidence of such an attack, Trump said: "We'll find out."

He described his call with Putin earlier on Monday as a "very good talk."

"We have a few very thorny issues," Trump said about talks to end the war in Ukraine.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 19:38:56 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5E7PFYTYA5OP5HANBXUIJ42DEI.jpg?auth=38f6541c9ce2621f762e6908e721dc118076245a383f1c8e567fb3b47be42eb1&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump says Netanyahu pardon 'on its way'; Herzog's office disputes it</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-says-netanyahu-pardon-on-its-way-herzogs-office-disputes-it-2025-12-29/</link><description>PALM BEACH, Florida, Dec 29 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday that Israeli President Isaac Herzog had told him a pardon for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was “on its way,” an assertion Herzog’s office was quick to challenge.

"He's a wartime prime minister who's a hero. How do you not give a pardon?" Trump told reporters while standing beside Netanyahu before a meeting in Florida. "I spoke to the president ... he tells me it's on its way."

Asked about the U.S. president's remarks, Herzog's office said the Israeli president had not had any conversations with Trump since a pardon request was submitted several weeks ago.

Herzog's office said Herzog had spoken to a representative for Trump then and it was explained that any decision would be made in accordance with established procedures.

Netanyahu, Israel's first sitting prime minister to be charged with a crime, denies bribery, fraud and breach of trust charges dating back to his 2019 indictment.

His own request for a pardon, submitted on November 30, argued that frequent court hearings impair his ability to govern and that clemency serves the national interest.

The appeal was lodged following the start of a U.S.-brokered ceasefire in Gaza, as his government sought to bring an end to Hamas' rule under Trump's plan to end two years of war and expand diplomatic ties across the region.

The request by the six-time prime minister had drawn fierce criticism from opponents, who said that pardoning him mid-trial would be a total breach of the rule of law.

According to Israeli law, the president has authority to pardon convicts. But there is no precedent for issuing a pardon mid-trial.

Netanyahu's pardon quest has been boosted by Trump, a close ally who wrote a formal letter to Herzog in November urging him to grant clemency and describing the case as "political, unjustified prosecution."</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 20:25:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/6EHQLLIIAVPJZIA4AGNAVAZFBU.jpg?auth=c131b08858f1b901247fe8b349dc633030dae904734e745b75b1055f707a3974&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Winter Storm Ezra snarls US travel as meteorologists warn of 'bomb cyclone'</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/winter-storm-ezra-snarls-us-travel-meteorologists-warn-bomb-cyclone-2025-12-29/</link><description>Dec 29 (Reuters) - Winter Storm Ezra disrupted holiday travel across the U.S. Northeast, Midwest and Great Lakes for a third straight day on Monday, causing thousands of flight delays and hundreds of cancellations as airlines scrambled to recover and meteorologists warned of a brewing "bomb cyclone" that could further snarl trips ahead of the New Year's holiday.

Nearly 6,000 flights were delayed and 751 canceled as of 3:25 p.m. ET, according to flight tracking website FlightAware. Since Friday, weather disruptions have canceled over 3,600 flights and delayed more than 30,000 others.

The storm hit during one of the year's busiest travel periods, when airlines operate near capacity with limited flexibility to rebook passengers. Holiday travelers faced long waits, rebooking difficulties and accommodation challenges as airlines coped with severe winter weather.

AccuWeather meteorologists warned the powerful storm would intensify into a "bomb cyclone" through Monday night, bringing blizzard conditions, dangerous ice, flooding rain and strong winds from Wisconsin to Maine.

A bomb cyclone occurs when rapidly dropping atmospheric pressure produces hurricane-force winds and heavy precipitation. The arctic cold front driving the storm brought with it wild swings in temperatures. In Philadelphia, temperatures, which soared close to 60 degrees on Monday, were expected to drop into the 20s overnight.

Major travel disruptions, regional power outages and hazardous conditions were expected through early Tuesday.

The harsh weather also disrupted road travel, with poor visibility, icy surfaces and blowing snow contributing to several multi-vehicle pileups and prompting authorities in parts of the region to urge drivers to avoid non-essential travel.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency warned travelers that driving could be dangerous as blizzard-like conditions, high winds and ice descend across the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes.

The Federal Aviation Administration issued a ground stop at Washington's Dulles International Airport until 4:15 p.m. ET due to high winds. Delays at airports in Boston and Newark, New Jersey, which serves New York City, were imposed due to low visibility and windy conditions.

Detroit-bound flights faced additional disruption after the FAA ordered a ground stop at Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport through 8 a.m. ET on Monday. The halt, affecting only Delta Air Lines (DAL.N) , opens new tab flights, was imposed for undisclosed operational reasons, and delays were expected to continue until midnight.

Delta had the highest share of cancellations and delays on Monday, and its shares fell nearly 3% in afternoon trading.

Shares of United Airlines (UAL.O) , opens new tab , American Airlines (AAL.O) , opens new tab and Alaska Air Group (ALK.N) , opens new tab were each down about 2%.

The FAA also said departures from Albany, Bangor, Burlington and Minneapolis-St. Paul were delayed as ground crews cleared snow and ice from planes.

Airline operations are tightly interlinked, meaning canceled flights can leave aircraft and crews out of position, complicating efforts to restore normal schedules.

American Airlines, United Airlines, JetBlue Airways and Delta told Reuters they had waived change fees for passengers affected by weather-related disruptions.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 21:19:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HE7D4GGTAVJCZDVEECIBX63CZU.jpg?auth=ab0e2969a8dfb5f889fba7031d628a6ca13de2e3a1b0e6b37ba7222004f69d32&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>North Korea leader Kim says multiple rocket launch system key to artillery, KCNA says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/north-korea-leader-kim-says-multiple-rocket-launch-system-key-artillery-kcna-2025-12-29/</link><description>SEOUL, Dec 30 (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un inspected a munitions factory and said the multiple rocket launcher system being produced there will be the mainstay of modernized long-range artillery for fast precision strikes and strategic attacks, KCNA news agency reported on Tuesday.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 21:41:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/J2OT46IMSVO2LHG3HHCW3T5WGM.jpg?auth=1bb42dc711388997fd45b2f1aac58ca16ebd233c55b315fd77faa5f6343d7aff&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Lavrov: the West must recognise that Russia holds strategic initiative in Ukraine</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/lavrov-west-must-recognise-that-russia-holds-strategic-initiative-ukraine-2025-12-29/</link><description>Dec 29 (Reuters) - Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, in an interview published late on Monday, said the West must understand that Russia holds the strategic initiative in Ukraine as discussions move forward on a possible settlement.

Lavrov told RIA news agency that the West had to come to terms with the territorial realities on the ground nearly four years after the launch of Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, which it describes as a "Special Military Operation".

He said the United States now supported the notion, which had become clear to all, that with the expiry of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's mandate, a new election was needed.

Lavrov also again stressed that a settlement required an end to any notion of a NATO presence in Ukraine and that the country had to adopt a neutral, non-aligned status.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 22:21:27 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BU6HN5ZAA5JUBMGAJ7NDMOEXPU.jpg?auth=d344103e5e8e372d83a88fd0215888cb16929a93b6562d8d9b6fd4a98676cb74&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump says he and Netanyahu don't fully agree on West Bank</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-says-he-netanyahu-dont-fully-agree-west-bank-2025-12-29/</link><description>PALM BEACH, Florida, Dec 29 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday that he and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not agree fully on the issue of the Israeli-occupied West Bank but the Republican leader did not lay out what the disagreement was.

In a briefing after a meeting with Netanyahu at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, Trump was asked if he had a message for Netanyahu about the West Bank and if he was concerned that settler violence in the West Bank could undermine peace.

"We have had a discussion, big discussion for a long time on the West Bank. And I wouldn't say we agree on the West Bank 100%, but we'll come to a conclusion on the West Bank," Trump said.

"I don't want to do that, it will be announced at an appropriate time," Trump said when asked what the disagreement between them was. Netanyahu "will do the right thing," Trump added.

Israel has been under mounting international pressure to curb attacks by settlers on Palestinians in the West Bank. Home to 2.7 million Palestinians, the West Bank has long been at the heart of plans for a future Palestinian state alongside Israel.

The United Nations, Palestinians and most countries regard settlements as illegal under international law. Israel disputes this, citing biblical ties to the land and security concerns. Around half a million Israeli settlers live in the West Bank.

The United Nations' highest court said last year Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories and settlements there were illegal and should be dismantled.

Over a thousand Palestinians were killed in the West Bank between October 2023 and October 2025, mostly in operations by security forces and some by settler violence, the U.N. has said. In the same period, 57 Israelis were killed in Palestinian attacks.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 22:44:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/J6LGPNNTLZIH5LLYSE46AGZ6GA.jpg?auth=512ced44653cc6822ab889b363e156e762ff9ff7c1027fc24771318d680327f4&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Peru shamans foretell illness for Trump, Maduro's exile in 2026</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/peru-shamans-foretell-illness-trump-maduros-exile-2026-2025-12-29/</link><description>LIMA, Dec 29 (Reuters) - Shamans in Peru gathered for an annual New Year's ritual on Monday where they made predictions for the year to come, including illness for U.S. President Donald Trump and the downfall of Venezuelan counterpart Nicolas Maduro.

"The United States should prepare itself because Donald Trump will fall seriously ill," Juan de Dios Garcia proclaimed as he gathered with other shamans on a beach in southern Lima, wearing colorful ponchos and sprinkling flowers on the sand.

The shamans carried large posters of world leaders, over which they crossed swords, burned incense and some of which they stomped on.

As well as Trump and Maduro, shamans waved posters of Russian President Vladimir Putin, Chinese President Xi Jinping, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.

"We see Nicolas Maduro defeated," said Garcia. "Nicolas Maduro will flee Venezuela. He will not be captured."

Closer to home, Garcia predicted that Keiko Fujimori , the daughter of former President Alberto Fujimori, will emerge victorious in Peru's presidential election after three failed bids.

"The woman who dreams of ruling Peru, I have been able to see through the wachuma (ancestral plant) that Keiko Fujimori will be president in 2026," he said.

The shamans also foretold the end of Russia's war in Ukraine . "I see that the conflict will end, they will raise the flag of peace," Garcia predicted.

The ceremony is performed every year in late December. The shamans had previously predicted an end to the Ukraine war - in 2023.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 22:44:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/72QYNORCWBJZBJKTSVYIA62SZE.jpg?auth=aec74af66887c09c82050e1c0bd5b660175ef8322f50d44af52721ce9ce40a46&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israel defends Somaliland move at UN amid concerns over Gaza motives</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-defends-somaliland-move-un-amid-concerns-over-gaza-motives-2025-12-29/</link><description>UNITED NATIONS, Dec 29 (Reuters) - Israel defended on Monday its formal recognition of the self-declared Republic of Somaliland, but several countries at the United Nations questioned whether the move aimed to relocate Palestinians from Gaza or to establish military bases.

Israel became the first country to recognize Somaliland as an independent and sovereign state on Friday.

The 22-member Arab League, a regional organization of Arab states in the Middle East and parts of Africa, rejects "any measures arising from this illegitimate recognition aimed at facilitating forced displacement of the Palestinian people or exploiting northern Somali ports to establish military bases," Arab League U.N. Ambassador Maged Abdelfattah Abdelaziz told the U.N. Security Council.

"Against the backdrop of Israel's previous references to Somaliland of the Federal Republic of Somalia as a destination for the deportation of Palestinian people, especially from Gaza, its unlawful recognition of Somaliland region of Somalia is deeply troubling," Pakistan's Deputy U.N. Ambassador Muhammad Usman Iqbal Jadoon told the council.

Israel's U.N. mission did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the remarks or address any of them in its statement at the council meeting. In March, the foreign ministers of Somalia and Somaliland said they had not received any proposal to resettle Palestinians from Gaza.

U.S. President Donald Trump's peace plan for Gaza states: "No one will be forced to leave Gaza, and those who wish to leave will be free to do so and free to return."

Israel's coalition government, the most right-wing and religiously conservative in its history, includes far-right politicians who advocate the annexation of both Gaza and the West Bank and encouraging Palestinians to leave their homeland.

Somalia’s U.N. Ambassador Abukar Dahir Osman said council members Algeria, Guyana, Sierra Leone and Somalia "unequivocally reject any steps aimed at advancing this objective, including any attempt by Israel to relocate the Palestinian population from Gaza to the northwestern region of Somalia."

Somaliland has enjoyed effective autonomy - and relative peace and stability - since 1991 when Somalia descended into civil war, but the breakaway region has failed to receive recognition from any other country.

"It is not a hostile step toward Somalia, nor does it preclude future dialogue between the parties. Recognition is not an act of defiance. It is an opportunity,” Israel’s Deputy U.N. Ambassador Jonathan Miller told the council.

In September, several Western states, including France, Britain, Canada and Australia announced they would recognize a Palestinian state, joining more than three-quarters of the 193 U.N. members who already do so.

Deputy U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Tammy Bruce said: "This council’s persistent double standards and misdirection of focus distract from its mission of maintaining international peace and security."

Slovenia's U.N. Ambassador Samuel Zbogar disputed her argument, saying: "Palestine is not part of any state. It is illegally occupied territory ... Palestine is also an observer state in this organization."

He added: "Somaliland, on the other hand, is a part of a U.N. member state and recognizing it goes against ... the U.N. Charter."

Israel said last week that it would seek immediate cooperation with Somaliland in agriculture, health, technology and the economy. The former British protectorate hopes Israeli recognition will encourage other nations to follow suit, increasing its diplomatic heft and access to global markets.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 23:41:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/JXXSK76A4VPXDLWZF3RPF5QBCQ.jpg?auth=b98e2b50a883851882f8af976a00c317a9efd53194cb0af6f45987f407c7e58c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US military says two men killed in strike on suspected drug vessel in Pacific</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us-military-says-two-men-killed-strike-suspected-drug-vessel-pacific-2025-12-29/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Dec 29 (Reuters) - The U.S. military said it killed two men in a strike on a boat suspected of carrying drugs in international waters in the eastern Pacific Ocean on Monday.

"This contract provides for the design, integration, instrumentation, test, production, and delivery of 25 new F-15IA aircraft for the Israeli Air Force with an option for an additional 25 F-15IA aircraft," the Pentagon said.

The Pentagon said the contract involved foreign military sales to Israel. The U.S. has long been by far the largest arms supplier to its closest Middle East ally.

Pro-Palestinian and anti-war protesters around the U.S. had demanded an end to Washington's military support for Israel due to its devastating assault on Gaza but those demands have not been met in the administrations of President Donald Trump and former President Joe Biden .

Contract work will be performed in St. Louis, and was expected to be complete by Dec. 31, 2035, the Pentagon said in a statement.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 23:42:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/6NFGAGOGNBPBLFCWB7R67HHIWM.jpg?auth=fde69e2929e327957ef43a7057ee56c03ffc0de49e0de6503965db79e38797df&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Bangladesh's first female prime minister, Khaleda Zia, dies at 80</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/bangladeshs-first-female-prime-minister-khaleda-zia-dies-80-2025-12-30/</link><description>DHAKA, Dec 30 (Reuters) - Bangladesh's first female prime minister, Khaleda Zia, died after a prolonged illness, her opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party said on Tuesday.

The Eastern Theatre Command said the drills would take place until 6 p.m. (1000 GMT) in the sea and airspace of five locations surrounding the island, demonstrating the Chinese military's resolve to "combat separatism and promote unification without hesitation."

China's Maritime Safety Administration on Monday designated two further zones within which live-firing would take place, making the "Justice Mission 2025" drills the largest to date by total coverage and in areas closer to Taiwan than previous exercises.

The war games began 11 days after the U.S. announced a record $11.1 billion arms package to Taiwan, drawing the Chinese defence ministry's ire and warnings that the military would "take forceful measures" in response.

The exercises - China's sixth major round of war games since 2022, when then-U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited the democratically governed island - are intended to rehearse a rapid encirclement of the island to destroy its weapons stockpile and obstruct efforts to resupply Taiwan from Japan or nearby U.S. bases, analysts say.

"This constitutes a blatant provocation of the international situation," said a senior Taiwan security official, who requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. "As one of the world's most critical shipping lanes, they seek to reshape the international order according to their own agenda."

The official said Taipei is closely monitoring whether China would seek "further provocation" in the drills on Tuesday, including flying missiles over Taiwan, similar to the Chinese drills in 2022.

"China is trying to make progress in asserting dominance over the entire island chain through extreme pressure tactics in various ways," the official said.

The Chinese military said it had deployed destroyers, bombers and other units to drill sea-based assaults, air defence and anti-submarine operations on Tuesday, to "test sea and air forces' ability to coordinate for integrated containment and control."

Taiwan rejects China's claimed sovereignty, maintaining that only its people can decide the island's future.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 01:44:32 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/EJAH5A42ZVN35GDPA6TTVRMAZM.jpg?auth=5b127bd16b75cce009ebd974404fd085526e5f10ced4433b19733844d5b4db25&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukrainians withstand days-long power cuts in crowded 'resilience' shelters</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/ukrainians-withstand-days-long-power-cuts-crowded-resilence-shelters-2025-12-30/</link><description>VYSHHOROD, Ukraine, Dec 30 (Reuters) - For three days, after the latest Russian air attacks on Ukraine, Olena Pazhydaieva has had no power or heat in her apartment in Vyshhorod, a satellite town 20 km (12 miles) north of Kyiv.

With night-time temperatures dipping to -3 C (27 Fahrenheit), she now spends much of the day with her six-year-old son in a shelter the size of a small shack, but with heating and power to connect the devices she needs to work.

About 20 people crowd into the building - dubbed "islet of warmth and power" on the sign outside - with mobile phones and laptops charging in order to keep working and connected.

"After the last attack, we haven't had electricity for the third day, power hasn't appeared at all, and now we're forced to work here in a shelter, where we can charge our stations, charge our laptops," Pazhydaieva said.

"It's good that there's internet. We can work. I’m not the only person here, there are many people."

Russian drone and missile attacks have long targeted energy facilities throughout Ukraine, triggering blackouts.

The latest massive attack knocked out power to 19,000 customers in Kyiv region surrounding the capital, according to Ukraine's Energy Ministry.

The shack is one of a large network of "resilience points" set up by authorities to keep people warm and able to function.

But family life without power can be complicated.

"We go to an after-school group and they usually take the kids in on holidays, too," Pazhydaieva said. "But when we went there today, we went inside, it was super cold and all the kids were wearing jackets...At least it's warm here."

Each family finds new ways to cope.

For Pazhydaieva, that means spending time at the "islet" to recharge devices and then trying to connect the water heater at home to a portable power station to keep everyone warm.

She has little faith in the U.S.-backed talks on resolving the conflict, particularly U.S. President Donald Trump's remark at a meeting on Sunday in Florida that Russian President Vladimir Putin "wants Ukraine to succeed".

"When Trump says that Putin wants prosperity for Ukraine as missiles are flying at us, somehow these two statements don't really match up," she said.

"If it were up to me, I would stay for 10 more years," Bukele said in a video interview published by Spanish YouTuber TheGrefg on Monday. He noted that he had initially agreed with his wife that he would leave politics in 2029.

El Salvador is expected to hold its next presidential election in 2027, to decide who will run the country through to 2033.

Bukele will be eligible to run for a third term, after the ruling party-controlled Congress pushed through a constitutional reform in July to abolish term limits, bring forward the next election and extend presidential terms from five to six years.

Legal experts at home and abroad have questioned the legality of Bukele's attempts to extend his term. The country's constitution prohibits presidents' consecutive reelection in at least six of its articles.

Early in 2024, Bukele won his second term with a landslide victory despite a constitutional ban.

The wildly popular 44-year-old publicist enjoys some of the world's highest approval ratings thanks to a hardline approach to crime which has helped drastically reduce murder rates.

Critics say this has come at the expense of civil rights and people have been arbitrarily detained, tortured and even killed in custody.

Bukele, who once described himself on his Twitter account as "the world's coolest dictator," said he did not plan to establish a dictatorship in El Salvador and it would be up to Salvadorans to decide whether he should continue in power.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 01:44:49 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ZPN432ZXFVMHJODMOTYD7TBFY4.jpg?auth=0fc740cd9c27241c3ae578df52e71800f18b21caeef78e3c5d6d1bde5bd63564&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Explainer: What is 'Taiwan independence' and is Taiwan already independent?</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/what-is-taiwan-independence-is-taiwan-already-independent-2025-12-30/</link><description>TAIPEI, Dec 30 (Reuters) - China said on Tuesday it would "never hesitate to combat separatism" as it held a second day of war games around Taiwan, describing the drills it calls "Justice Mission 2025" as a warning against independence and foreign interference.

Below are some questions and answers about what is meant by the term "Taiwan independence".

Previously known as Formosa, the island has been home to indigenous people for thousands of years, before the Dutch and Spanish briefly ruled parts of it in the 1600s.

The Qing dynasty incorporated Taiwan as part of Fujian province in 1684 and only declared it a separate Chinese province in 1885.

Following the Qing's defeat in a war with Japan, it became a Japanese colony in 1895. In 1945, it was handed over to the Republic of China government at the end of World War Two.

In 1949 after being defeated by Mao Zedong's communist forces, the Republic of China government fled and moved its capital to Taiwan, and Republic of China remains the island's formal name.

Mao set up the People's Republic of China, and claimed it was the only legitimate Chinese government for the whole of China, including Taiwan, as the Republic of China's successor state.

For decades, the Republic of China in Taipei also claimed to be the legitimate Chinese government, but in 1971 Beijing took over the China seat at the United Nations from Taipei.

Currently only 12 countries maintain formal ties with Taipei, mostly small and poorer developing nations such as Belize and Tuvalu.

Most major Western countries and U.S. allies maintain close unofficial ties with Taiwan by recognising the Republic of China passport and having de facto embassies in each other's capitals. Taiwanese citizens can freely travel to most countries using their Taiwanese passports.

The U.S. severed official ties with Taipei in 1979 but is bound by law to provide the island with the means to defend itself. The U.S. officially takes no position on Taiwan's sovereignty under Washington's "One China" policy.

China says it will not renounce the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control. Beijing has offered Taiwan a "one country, two systems" model similar to Hong Kong, which promised the city a high degree of autonomy, though no major political party in Taiwan supports that.

Opinion polls in Taiwan have repeatedly shown most Taiwanese wish to maintain the current status quo in relations with China.

China also says that United Nations resolution 2758, passed in 1971, means the world legally recognises Taiwan belongs to China. The resolution states that the People's Republic of China is the only legitimate government of China, and resulted in Taipei losing China's U.N. seat to Beijing,

The government in Taipei says that is nonsense given the resolution made no mention of Taiwan or its status.

Taiwan, whose people elect their own leaders and whose government controls a defined area of territory with its own military, passport and currency, enjoys de facto independence even if that is not formally recognised by most countries.

Taiwan's government says the Republic of China is a sovereign state and that Beijing has no right to speak for or represent it given the People's Republic of China has no say in how it chooses its leaders and has never ruled Taiwan.

It would be very difficult and require parliamentary approval of a constitutional amendment and then a referendum, rather than a simple declaration by President Lai Ching-te.

At least 75% of lawmakers would need to pass that amendment, and the ruling Democratic Progressive Party and main opposition party the Kuomintang (KMT) currently have an equal number of seats.

The DPP, which has been in power since 2016, has not made an attempt to change the constitution. The KMT strongly opposes any attempts to change the name of Republic of China.

China detests Lai and calls him a "separatist". Before Lai was elected president he made comments about being a "practical worker for Taiwan independence". Lai maintains he simply meant Taiwan is already an independent country.

Since taking office in 2024, Lai has said on several occasions that the Republic of China and People's Republic of China are "not subordinate to each other", which Beijing says means he believes the two are separate countries and so he is therefore pushing an independence narrative.

In 2005, China's largely rubber-stamp parliament passed the Anti-Secession Law that gives the country the legal basis for military action against Taiwan if it secedes or if the "possibilities for a peaceful reunification should be completely exhausted", but the law is vague and does not give details.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 01:45:03 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/S7NRXODZ2ZKO5IELAYZ7U6B4UU.jpg?auth=8696306dbe01c73d3bfb33e06a18d2f019c38a5b4fb941de61f27f4b3b802c80&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump says US destroyed dock used by Venezuelan drug traffickers</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20251230-trump-says-us-destroyed-dock-used-by-venezuela-drug-traffickers</link><description>The United States has hit and destroyed a docking area for alleged Venezuela drug boats, President Donald Trump said Monday, in what could amount to the first land strike of the military campaign against trafficking from Latin America.

The US leader's confirmation of the incident comes as he ramps up a pressure campaign against Venezuela's leftist President Nicolas Maduro , who has accused Trump of seeking regime change.

"There was a major explosion in the dock area where they load the boats up with drugs," he told reporters at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida as he hosted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

"So we hit all the boats and now we hit the area, it's the implementation area, that's where they implement. And that is no longer around."

The US leader would not say if it was a military or CIA operation or where the strike occurred, saying only that it was "along the shore."

Asked if he had spoken to Maduro recently, following an earlier phone call in November, Trump said they had talked "pretty recently" but said that "nothing much comes out of it."

Trump had been asked to elaborate on apparent throwaway comments he made in a radio interview broadcast Friday that seemed to mention a land strike for the first time.

"They have a big plant or a big facility where they send, you know, where the ships come from," Trump told billionaire supporter John Catsimatidis on the WABC radio station in New York.

"Two nights ago we knocked that out. So we hit them very hard."

Trump did not say in the interview where the facility was located or give any other details.

There has been no official comment from the Venezuelan government.

The Pentagon earlier referred questions to the White House. The White House did not respond to requests for comment from AFP.

Trump has been threatening for weeks that ground strikes on drug cartels in the region would start "soon," but this is the first apparent example.

US forces have also carried out numerous strikes in both the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean since September, targeting what Washington says are drug-smuggling boats.

The administration has provided no evidence that the targeted boats were involved in drug trafficking, however, prompting debate about the legality of these operations.

International law experts and rights groups say the strikes likely amount to extrajudicial killings, a charge that Washington denies.

After Trump spoke Monday, the US military announced on X that it had carried out another deadly strike on a boat in the Eastern Pacific, killing two and bringing the total killed in the maritime campaign to at least 107.

The Trump administration has been ramping up pressure on Maduro, accusing the Venezuelan leader of running a drug cartel himself and imposing an oil tanker blockade.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 01:45:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/58a4b490-e518-11f0-8bab-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25362800912978.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Bondi gunmen acted alone, no evidence they were part of militant cell, Australian police say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/bondi-gunmen-acted-alone-no-evidence-they-were-part-militant-cell-australian-2025-12-30/</link><description>SYDNEY, Dec 30 (Reuters) - Two gunmen who allegedly opened fire on a Jewish celebration on Sydney's Bondi Beach earlier this month acted alone and there was "no evidence" they were part of a militant cell, police said on Tuesday.

Naveed Akram and his father Sajid Akram are alleged to have killed 15 people at a Hanukkah event on December 14, Australia's worst mass shooting in almost three decades that shocked the nation and led to immediate reforms of already strict gun laws.

Police have previously said the men were inspired by Islamic State, with home made flags of the militant group found in their car after the attack, and a month-long trip by the pair to a Philippines island previously plagued by militancy a major focus of investigation.

But on Tuesday, Australian Federal Police Commissioner Krissy Barrett said there was no indication the men had received formal training on the November trip to Mindanao in the Philippines.

"There is no evidence to suggest these alleged offenders were part of a broader terrorist cell, or were directed by others to carry out an attack," Barrett told a news conference.

She added the findings were an initial assessment, and authorities in Australia and the Philippines were continuing their investigation.

"I am not suggesting that they were there for tourism," she said, referring to the Philippines trip.

Sajid Akram was shot dead by police during the attack, while his son Naveed, who was also shot by police, was charged with 59 offences after waking from a days-long coma earlier this month. Naveed Akram faces charges ranging from 15 counts of murder to terror and explosives offences.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 03:28:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/EATWMSVCXBJ7JCLVEZC3CHYNHM.jpg?auth=a5bf430308c2f8106c9b3157ba572471636cfb071b39d8c663b76727cd2247d4&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Khaleda Zia, Bangladesh's first female prime minister, dies at 80</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/obituary-khaleda-zia-bangladeshs-first-female-prime-minister-dies-80-2025-12-30/</link><description>DHAKA, Dec 30 (Reuters) - Khaleda Zia, who became Bangladesh's first female prime minister in 1991 and went on to develop a bitter rivalry with Sheikh Hasina as they spent decades trading power, died on Tuesday after a long illness. She was 80.

Her opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) said that she died after a prolonged illness. She had advanced cirrhosis of the liver, arthritis, diabetes, and chest and heart problems, her doctors said.

She went to London for medical treatment in early 2025, staying for four months before returning home.

Though Khaleda had been out of power since 2006 and had spent several years in jail or under house arrest, she and her centre-right BNP continued to command much support.

The BNP is seen as the frontrunner to win the parliamentary election slated to take place in February. Her son and acting chairman of the party, Tarique Rahman, 60, returned to the country last week from nearly 17 years in self-exile and is widely seen as a strong candidate to become prime minister.

Since August 2024, after a student-led uprising led to the ouster of Hasina, Bangladesh has been run by an interim government headed by Muhammad Yunus, the Nobel peace laureate and microfinance pioneer.

In November, Hasina was sentenced to death in absentia for her deadly crackdown on the student protests.

Known by her first name, Khaleda was described as shy and devoted to raising her two sons until her husband, military leader and then-President Ziaur Rahman, was assassinated in an attempted army coup in 1981.

Three years later she became the head of the BNP, which her husband had founded, and vowed to deliver on his aim of "liberating Bangladesh from poverty and economic backwardness".

She joined hands with Hasina, daughter of Bangladesh's founding father and head of the Awami League party, to lead a popular uprising for democracy that toppled military ruler Hossain Mohammad Ershad in 1990.

But their cooperation did not last long. Their bitter rivalry would lead to the two being dubbed "the battling Begums" - a phrase that uses an Urdu honorific for prominent women.

Supporters saw her as polite and traditional yet quietly stylish, someone who chose her words carefully. But they also viewed her as a bold, uncompromising leader when it came to defending her party and confronting her rivals.

Hasina, by contrast, was far more outspoken and assertive. Their opposite personalities helped fuel the rivalry that dominated Bangladesh’s politics for decades.

In 1991, Bangladesh held what was hailed as its first free election. Khaleda won a surprise victory over Hasina, having gained the support of the country's largest Islamic party, Jamaat-e-Islami.

In doing so, Khaleda became Bangladesh's first female prime minister and only the second woman to lead a democratic government of a mainly Muslim nation after Benazir Bhutto, elected to lead Pakistan three years earlier.

Khaleda replaced the presidential system with a parliamentary one, so that power rested with the prime minister. She also lifted restrictions on foreign investment and made primary education compulsory and free.

She lost to Hasina in the 1996 general election but came back five years later with a surprise landslide win.

Her second term was marred by the rise of Islamist militants and allegations of corruption.

In 2004, a rally that Hasina was addressing was hit by grenades. Hasina survived but over 20 people were killed and more than 500 wounded. Khaleda's government and its Islamic allies were widely blamed.

In 2018, after Hasina had reclaimed Bangladesh's highest office, Rahman was tried in absentia and sentenced to life for the attack. The BNP denounced the trial as politically motivated.

Although Khaleda later clamped down on Islamist radical groups, her second stint as prime minister ended in 2006 when an army-backed interim government took power amid political instability and street violence.

The interim government jailed both Khaleda and Hasina on charges of corruption and abuse of power for about a year before they were both released ahead of a general election in 2008.

Khaleda never regained power. With the BNP boycotting the 2014 and 2024 elections, her vitriolic feud with Hasina continued to dominate Bangladeshi politics.

Tension between their two parties often led to strikes, violence and deaths, impeding the economic development of Bangladesh, a poverty-stricken country of about 175 million that is low-lying and prone to devastating floods.

In 2018, Khaleda, Rahman and aides were convicted of stealing some $250,000 in foreign donations received by an orphanage trust set up when she was last prime minister - charges that she said were part of a plot to keep her and her family out of politics.

She was jailed but moved to house arrest in March 2020 on humanitarian grounds as her health deteriorated.

Khaleda was freed from house arrest in August 2024 after Hasina's ouster.

In early 2025, Khaleda and Rahman were acquitted by Bangladesh's Supreme Court in the corruption case that resulted in the 2018 jail sentences. Rahman had been acquitted of the 2004 grenade attack on Hasina a month earlier.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 03:28:39 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LTFVWONNVROGJPEP2PMVMMUXOY.jpg?auth=3fbc932da9cb22772b802d36bb4ad7ab1ecdacca442d5bb4fd3d6016cfd19635&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UN ambassadors condemn Israel's recognition of Somaliland</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20251230-un-security-council-members-condemn-israel-recognition-of-somaliland-somalia-international-law</link><description>Israel defended on Monday its formal recognition of the self-declared Republic of Somaliland , but several countries at the United Nations questioned whether the move aimed to relocate Palestinians from Gaza or to establish military bases.

Israel became the first country to recognise Somaliland as an independent and sovereign state on Friday.

The 22-member Arab League, a regional organisation of Arab states in the Middle East and parts of Africa, rejects "any measures arising from this illegitimate recognition aimed at facilitating forced displacement of the Palestinian people or exploiting northern Somali ports to establish military bases," Arab League UN Ambassador Maged Abdelfattah Abdelaziz told the UN Security Council.

"Against the backdrop of Israel's previous references to Somaliland of the Federal Republic of Somalia as a destination for the deportation of Palestinian people, especially from Gaza , its unlawful recognition of Somaliland region of Somalia is deeply troubling," Pakistan's Deputy UN Ambassador Muhammad Usman Iqbal Jadoon told the council.

Israel's UN mission did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the remarks or address any of them in its statement at the council meeting. In March, the foreign ministers of Somalia and Somaliland said they had not received any proposal to resettle Palestinians from Gaza.

US President Donald Trump's peace plan for Gaza states: "No one will be forced to leave Gaza, and those who wish to leave will be free to do so and free to return."

Israel's coalition government, the most right-wing and religiously conservative in its history, includes far-right politicians who advocate the annexation of both Gaza and the West Bank and encouraging Palestinians to leave their homeland.

Somalia’s UN Ambassador Abukar Dahir Osman said council members Algeria, Guyana, Sierra Leone and Somalia "unequivocally reject any steps aimed at advancing this objective, including any attempt by Israel to relocate the Palestinian population from Gaza to the northwestern region of Somalia."

Somaliland has enjoyed effective autonomy - and relative peace and stability - since 1991 when Somalia descended into civil war, but the breakaway region has failed to receive recognition from any other country.

"It is not a hostile step toward Somalia, nor does it preclude future dialogue between the parties. Recognition is not an act of defiance. It is an opportunity,” Israel’s Deputy UN Ambassador Jonathan Miller told the council.

In September, several Western states, including France, Britain, Canada and Australia announced they would recognise a Palestinian state, joining more than three-quarters of the 193 UN members who already do so.

Deputy US Ambassador to the UN Tammy Bruce said: "This council’s persistent double standards and misdirection of focus distract from its mission of maintaining international peace and security."

Slovenia's UN Ambassador Samuel Zbogar disputed her argument, saying: "Palestine is not part of any state. It is illegally occupied territory ... Palestine is also an observer state in this organisation."

He added: "Somaliland, on the other hand, is a part of a UN member state and recognising it goes against ... the UN Charter."

Israel said last week that it would seek immediate cooperation with Somaliland in agriculture, health, technology and the economy. The former British protectorate hopes Israeli recognition will encourage other nations to follow suit, increasing its diplomatic heft and access to global markets.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 03:29:04 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/06921c66-e521-11f0-b452-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/Somali-Ambassador.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Saudi-led coalition launches air strike at Yemen's Mukalla port</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/saudi-led-coalition-yemen-calls-civilians-mukalla-port-evacuate-saudi-state-news-2025-12-30/</link><description>Dec 30 (Reuters) - The Saudi-led coalition in Yemen launched a limited air strike targeting what it called foreign military support at Mukalla port, days after it warned the main southern separatist group against making military moves in the eastern province of Hadramout.

An offensive by Yemen's southern separatists earlier this month pitted the United Arab Emirates-backed Southern Transitional Council (STC) against Saudi-supported Yemeni government troops, bringing the two nations closer than they have ever been to an all-out conflict. Yemen has been mired in a civil war since 2014.

A coalition spokesperson said two ships arriving from the UAE port of Fujairah entered Mukalla port on Saturday and Sunday without authorisation from the coalition, disabled their tracking systems and unloaded large quantities of weapons and combat vehicles "to support the (STC)."

The coalition said there were no casualties or collateral damage from the strike at Mukalla port, Saudi state media reported.

The UAE's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Acting on a request from the head of Yemen’s Presidential Leadership Council, Rashad al-Alimi, to protect civilians in Hadramout and al-Mahra, coalition air forces carried out a limited military operation early on Tuesday targeting the unloaded weapons and vehicles, Saudi state media said citing Turki al-Malki, the coalition spokesperson.

Two sources told Reuters that the strike targeted the dock where the cargo of the two ships was unloaded.

The STC separatists were initially part of the Saudi-led alliance that intervened in Yemen in 2015 against the Houthis. But they subsequently decided to seek self-rule in the south.

Since 2022, they have been part of an alliance that controls southern areas outside Houthi control under a Saudi-backed power-sharing initiative.

At present, UAE-backed forces control large swathes of land in the south including the strategically important Hadramout province.

Hadramout is on the border with Saudi Arabia and they have cultural and historical ties; many prominent Saudis trace their origins to the area.

The Houthis control the northern part of the country, including the capital Sanaa, after forcing the Saudi-backed government to flee south.

"We will continue to prevent any military support from any country to any Yemeni faction without coordination with the legitimate government," the coalition added.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 04:24:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Malaysia's jailed ex-PM Najib files appeal against 1MDB conviction</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/malaysias-jailed-ex-pm-najib-files-appeal-against-1mdb-conviction-2025-12-30/</link><description>KUALA LUMPUR, Dec 30 (Reuters) - Jailed former Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak has filed an appeal against his conviction last week on corruption charges related to the multibillion-dollar 1MDB scandal, which saw him sentenced to an additional 15 years in prison, his lawyer said on Tuesday.

Najib, 72, has been in jail since 2022 on graft offences linked to allegations that about $4.5 billion was stolen from 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) , a state fund he co-founded while serving as premier in 2009.

U.S. and Malaysian investigators have said more than $1 billion of the misappropriated funds made their way into accounts linked to Najib, who has consistently denied wrongdoing.

On December 26, Najib was found guilty of four charges of abuse of power and 21 counts of money laundering for illegally receiving about 2.3 billion ringgit ($567.90 million) originating from 1MDB, in the biggest trial he has faced.

He was sentenced to 15 years in prison and slapped with a record fine of nearly $3 billion. The court ordered Najib to begin serving the additional sentence after his current six-year jail term ends in 2028, though the term may be reduced by one-third for good behaviour.

Najib's lawyer Muhammad Farhan Shafee confirmed in a brief text message that an appeal had been filed on Monday night against both the verdict and the sentence.

Najib has also filed an appeal against a separate court ruling this month denying his bid to serve the remainder of his current prison term under house arrest, media reports said.

Both court decisions have stoked tensions within Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim's ruling alliance, with some members of Najib's party, the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), expressing disappointment with the verdicts.

UMNO campaigned against Anwar in a 2022 election but joined his coalition to form a government after the poll resulted in a hung parliament. Anwar last week urged calm, calling on parties to accept the court's decisions with "full patience and wisdom".

As Zelensky faced a verbal lashing from his hosts for not “thanking” Trump enough, heads of state, multinational corporations and international institutions across the world took note – and many responded by adopting baroque levels of “flattery diplomacy” to deal with the US president.

Pomp, splendour and courtesy have long greased diplomatic wheels. But with Trump this year, it was taken to personal – often incredible – levels that critics say crossed the line into servility and vassalage.

Here are some of 2025's top moments of Trump praise:

The prize never existed before, but after Trump waged a war of words against the Democrat-led US cities chosen to host next year’s World Cup , FIFA President Gianni Infantino decided to act. And how.

Infantino, a Trump ally, tapped into the US president’s disappointment over being skipped for the Nobel Peace Prize and cooked up a new, made-to-order award. On a plinth emblazoned with an all-cap “Donald J. Trump”, a metal globe perched atop five gnarled hands: the FIFA Peace Prize.

“This is your prize – this is your prize, your peace prize,” Infantino gushed as Trump beamed on the John F. Kennedy Center stage.

It didn’t end there. “There is also a beautiful medal for you that you can wear everywhere you want to go,” Infantino continued as Trump plucked the shiny object up and promptly put it on, like a modern-day Napoleon crowning himself.

In a year that saw world leaders tripping over themselves to sign deals with the US, Qatar went the furthest, gifting Trump a luxury Boeing valued at $400 million to update Air Force One; his presidential aircraft.

The offer was first reported by US media on the eve of Trump’s Middle East visit in May to Saudi Arabia , Qatar and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).

The gift, the most expensive – and controversial – ever received by a US president in the country’s nearly 250-year history, kicked up a storm, with Democrats warning about ethical implications and legality and security concerns.

Trump however scoffed away the dismay, noting that Qatar's offer was a nice gesture that would be "stupid" to turn down.

With the Trump administration threatening to disengage from NATO , it was essential to keep the US president on board at the bloc’s 2025 summit in The Hague.

But NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte went overboard.

In a private message to Trump before the summit, Rutte noted, “You are flying into another big success in The Hague ... Europe is going to pay in a BIG way, as they should, and it will be your win.”

Trump promptly posted Rutte’s message on his Truth Social platform, sparking cringes in many quarters.

But there was more. At a June 25 joint press conference during the NATO summit, Trump was asked about the Israel-Iran war , which was then raging.

The US president responded by likening the two countries to "kids in a schoolyard".

Rutte, in obsequious overdrive, couldn’t leave it at that. "Daddy has to sometimes use strong language to get them to stop," said the head of the world’s most powerful military alliance.

As the “Daddy” quote grabbed headlines, Trump was asked if he views NATO allies as children. "No, [Rutte] likes me,” the US president replied. “I think he likes me. If he doesn't, I'll let you know. I'll come back and I'll hit him hard, OK? He did it very affectionately, 'Daddy, you're my Daddy.'"

Trump’s obsession with winning a Nobel Peace Prize saw a number of world leaders trip over themselves to nominate the US president for the prize his predecessor, former president Barack Obama , won back in 2009.

None did it with as much flourish as Israeli Prime Benjamin Netanyahu . Before a dinner at the White House Blue Room in July, Netanyahu kicked off the proceedings with a monologue as the cameras rolled.

“I want to express the appreciation and admiration not only of all Israelis, but of the Jewish people,” began Netanyahu. As US and Israeli teams beamed, the Israeli prime minister held up a letter. “I want to present to you, Mr. President, the letter I sent to the Nobel prize committee,” said Netanyahu.

“Oh,” said Trump as he took the letter from Netanyahu.

“It’s nominating you for the Nobel Peace Prize, which is well-deserved,” explained Netanyahu. “I think you should get it.”

The Nobel committee didn’t think so. The 2025 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado .

Handing letters to the king became a thing this year. In February, “King Donald” – as some critics have dubbed Trump – received one from the real McCoy. In a desperate bid to maintain the US-UK “special relationship”, Britain’s Labour Prime Minister Keir Starmer ceremoniously handed Trump a state visit invitation from his sovereign, King Charles III .

At an Oval Office meeting, the cameras rolled with the praises. Reaching into his jacket breast pocket, Starmer extricated an envelope proclaiming, “It is my pleasure to bring from his majesty, the king, a letter.”

“Thank you very much,” said Trump as he took the letter. And held it. As the agonising seconds stretched, the court held its breath. The future of Ukraine , Europe, the transatlantic alliance, world order hung in the balance.

“Am I supposed to read it now?” asked Trump, uncharacteristically deferential when handed an authentic royal object.

“Yes, please do,” Starmer replied.

The seconds stretched again as Trump silently read the letter. It was left to Starmer to explain that it was a “really special” invitation to an “unprecedented” second state visit.

Having admired the British monarch’s “beautiful” signature, Trump accepted the invitation, sparking months of excruciating “Royal Household prepares for state visit” coverage. A nine-minute royal family video even featured the elaborate prep work by livery officers, chefs, gardeners, military musicians and other staff.

They did their jobs. The visit in September took place without a royal hitch.

It was left to the British newspapers to examine if it was all worth the glitz. In its editorial, The Guardian concluded that, “there was an inverse relationship between the pomp and ceremony of this trip and its real import”.

The editorial however acknowledged that, “in the world of President Trump, a diplomatic interaction that avoids the outright disaster of a public dressing down, or doubling of tariffs , is now regarded as a triumph by US allies”.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 06:35:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/0c94f066-da8b-11f0-87e2-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/2025-EN.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Live: Trump 'very angry' about alleged Ukrainian attack on Putin's home</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20251230-live-trump-very-angry-about-alleged-ukrainian-attack-on-putin-s-home</link><description>Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Ukraine had tried to attack Putin's residence in the Novgorod region west of Moscow on December 28-29 with 91 long-range drones which were all destroyed by Russian air defences.

"Such reckless actions will not go unanswered," Lavrov said in a statement, describing the attack as "state terrorism" and adding that targets had already been selected for retaliatory strikes by Russia's armed forces.

US President Donald Trump said Putin had told him about the alleged attack targetting one of his residences in a phone call on Monday morning, which had angered him.

"It's one thing to be offensive," Trump told reporters. "It's another thing ​to attack his house. It's not the right time to do any of that. And I learned about it from President Putin today. I was very angry about it."

Police conducted an eight-hour siege at a house in the town of Yalova, on the Sea of Marmara coast south of Istanbul, a week after more than 100 suspected IS members were detained in connection with alleged plans to carry out Christmas and New Year attacks.

Eight police officers and another security force member were wounded in the raid on the property, which was one of more than 100 addresses targeted by authorities on Monday.

In Tuesday's operation, police carried out raids on 114 addresses in Istanbul and two other provinces, arresting 110 of the total 115 suspects that they sought, the prosecutor's statement said. It said various digital materials and documents were seized.

Turkey has stepped up operations against suspected IS militants this year, as the group returns to prominence globally.

The U.S. carried out a strike against the militants in northwest Nigeria last week, while two gunmen who attacked a Hanukkah event at Sydney's Bondi Beach this month appeared to be inspired by IS , Australian police have said. On December 19, the U.S. military launched strikes against dozens of IS targets in Syria in retaliation for an attack on American personnel.

Almost a decade ago, the jihadist group was blamed for a series of attacks on civilian targets in Turkey, including gun attacks on an Istanbul nightclub and the city's main airport, killing dozens of people. Turkey was a key transit point for foreign fighters, including those of IS, entering and leaving Syria during the war there.

Police have carried out regular operations against the group in subsequent years and there have been few attacks since the wave of violence between 2015-2017.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 07:25:04 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7ZWI7FCWMNOE5BHQ376UM3YURI.jpg?auth=d0478b0a65f25f74709106c87ebbfb78bb672236d285c49d33d0a98ac8419edd&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Insight: Facing Alawite backlash, Syria’s new leaders take controversial steps to win loyalty</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/facing-alawite-backlash-syrias-new-leaders-take-controversial-steps-win-loyalty-2025-12-30/</link><description>QARDAHA, Syria, Dec 30 (Reuters) - He carried no weapons and helped keep government security forces alive, but Khairallah Dib still needed a promise of amnesty to come out of hiding.

He had been lying low for weeks after Alawite fighters staged a March insurrection against Syria’s new Islamist-led rulers. The uprising by loyalists of ousted President Bashar al-Assad killed more than 200 Syrian security forces and triggered days of vengeance .

The killings by government-affiliated forces left nearly 1,500 Alawites dead and led tens of thousands to flee out of fear for their lives. It broke the fragile relationship between Alawites, the sect from which Assad hailed, and the new government.

Syria’s new rulers have since tried to undo the damage by providing amnesty to people like Dib and others swept into the March violence, and offering limited economic aid to the wider community.

Reuters accompanied 
 people working with 
 the 
 government 
 committee 
 created 
 to oversee that process in the coastal provinces of Latakia and Tartous, speaking to dozens of Alawite
 s who have received 
 its support and 15 Alawite former security officials now working with 
 Syria’s government. 
 The body is formally known as the Supreme Committee for the Preservation of Civil Peace.

Both the committee and its beneficiaries 
 described a fledgling and controversial attempt to win the loyalty of Syria’s Alawites,
 
 many of whom also suffered 
 poverty
 under Assad despite
 privileged access to state jobs given 
 their shared sect. Securing their allegiance could help the 
 new 
 government exert control over the region and 
 show progress on
 President Ahmed al-Sharaa
 ’s promise
 to govern for all Syrians.

Run by ex-militant leaders on opposing sides during Syria’s brutal 14-year war, the initiative offers financial help, jobs and medical services to hundreds of Alawites, including dozens of men who received amnesties in exchange for promising not to fight again or to help demobilize other fighters.

In response to questions for this story, civil peace committee member Hassan Soufan told Reuters the government was calibrating its efforts for Alawites with the vast needs of the wider Syrian population, including Sunnis harmed by Assad’s government.

“There is a balance we must strike” 
 to ensure everyone feels treated fairly
 , he said in an interview.

Soufan acknowledged some public anger that new authorities were cooperating with members of the fallen dictator’s security establishment. But he said Syria’s leadership took a longer view.

“The Syrian people should go forward. That doesn’t mean accepting the big crimes that took place. Those who committed serious crimes should be held accountable. But the vast majority of Syrians are innocent,” he said.

Dib has been one beneficiary of that forgiving approach.

He denied taking part in any violence during the March insurrection. He said h
 is only role was communication and that he additionally helped keep scores of security forces taken hostage by insurgents in Qardaha alive 
 and mediated their return.
 His account was confirmed by a government official familiar with his settlement.

“I decided to do something for the future,” Dib said from the cafe he set up in Assad’s hometown of Qardaha with money from the initiative.

A Reuters visit arranged by the committee found the cafe 
 frequented 
 by students, the unemployed and local elders.

The cafe helped Dib scrape together enough money to get engaged, which he had never been able to afford under Assad. He’s planning for kids.

“I want girls though. They're sweeter and cuter,” he said. “The boys always want to carry guns.”

THE UNLIKELY PEACEMAKERS

Those steering the committee have their own history of warfare.

Soufan, 
 a Sunni from Latakia, 
 is a former rebel commander.

Another is Khaled al-Ahmad, who helped Assad recapture territory during the war through surrender deals, then fell out with the dictator and eventually switched sides to back Sharaa, his childhood friend.

Ahmad’s man on the ground is Fadi Saqr, an Alawite who commanded an infamous pro-Assad militia known as the National Defense Forces, which was accused by rights groups of committing massacres, looting and extortion. Saqr is blacklisted by the U.S. , opens new tab and European Union for his role in wartime massacres.

Saqr denied any role in massacres in comments to Reuters but declined to answer further questions. Soufan has acknowledged Syria’s government is working 
 with Saqr
 , saying he helped prevent bloodshed when Assad fell.

Saqr’s involvement has led to criticism of the initiative as a skin-deep effort by the new government to cement its rule while allowing notorious regime figures to walk free.

“Who are you to forgive those who killed our people in the ugliest ways? And even more, you elevate them to become symbols of civil peace,” said Osama Othman, who more than a decade ago helped smuggle out thousands of pictures of dead detainees in Assad’s prisons, known as the “Caesar files.”

The government says amnesty candidates are vetted to ensure no one who committed serious crimes during the civil war is pardoned. But the process itself is opaque.

The Syrian Network for Human Rights says the committee’s power to grant amnesties and free detainees undermines transparency, accountability and an independent judiciary.

“Fadi Saqr’s efforts have done a lot to maintain literal peace but not much to ease fears and build trust in communities compared to other grassroots initiatives working with local officials,” said Gregory Waters, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Syria Program.

The work of the committee is also opposed by many in the Alawite community, including hardliners who see cooperation with Syria’s Islamist-led authorities as tantamount to treason. Individuals linked to the committee told Reuters they know they could be targeted by Alawite militants. An Alawite candidate in state-organized parliamentary elections was shot dead in September.

While Reuters was reporting on the committee’s work in Dalieh, 
 a remote and picturesque mountain village
 where the March insurrection began, an anti-government Alawite Facebook page alleged Saqr had brought the reporters there as part of “disgusting plans.” The journalists were followed out of the town by a car with tinted windows, which was ultimately warned off by a government security patrol.

Saqr was not present during the reporting trip, but members of his civil peace team were nearby during interviews with residents. Reuters later followed up with those residents by phone.

Some Alawites initially saw Assad's ouster last year as a potential opening for their broadly destitute community. Tens of thousands of former soldiers signed temporary settlements with the new government and relinquished their weapons.

But mass layoffs and killings of Alawites in the ensuing months left them feeling increasingly sidelined and fearful. Then, the March killings hardened distrust of Sharaa, who led Al Qaeda’s Syrian branch before disavowing the organization.

In a goodwill gesture, the committee has granted amnesty to at least 50 Alawite men linked to the March violence, Tartous governor Ahmed al-Shami told Reuters.

“We told them: ‘you were deceived ... were hasty and implicated yourself, we will be merciful with you and give you a second chance,’” Shami said.

The committee has also freed hundreds of Assad-era soldiers detained after his ouster and arranged more than 90 family visits to some of the thousands of others still imprisoned, a committee official said.

A mother of three former soldiers who are in prison said she was able to visit one of them in September, with the small but still unaffordable cost of travel covered by the committee.

The mother, who asked not to be named, said it was painful to observe her son through a pane of glass and she was only allowed to provide him with underwear.

“They haven't seen the new Syria yet,” she said, tears rolling down her cheeks. “They don’t know anything. They just know that they are in prison.”

Forgiven fighters provide information on people who might still be plotting attacks and help authorities find hidden caches of light arms and ammunition, according to Shami and a statement by the security chiefs of Latakia and Tartous. They also convince others not to fight.

After striking a settlement in April, one of Saqr’s former militiamen was given a job in carpentry. While he said he still wanted revenge for the Alawite blood spilled, the fighter, who asked not to be named for fear of reprisal, said no one wanted to fight anymore.

“People are tired. They just want security and to feed their kids,” he told Reuters.

Alawite residents on the coast said the efforts are too small to address vast damage from the March violence as well as entrenched poverty and persistent insecurity in the coastal areas. Soufan acknowledged the financial constraints.

“We are doing something symbolic that clears the air and gets us moving forward,” he told Reuters.

More than nine months after the violence, the committee says it has refurbished less than 10% of roughly 1,000 damaged homes.

Osama Twayyer, a 32-year-old Alawite in the Jableh countryside, said his extended family had 13 houses torched and livestock stolen in March. The committee has been unable to locate two of his relatives who have been missing since then, he said.

The committee began basic repairs in some of his relatives’ homes. But after Reuters visited in September, Twayyer said repairs ground to a halt.

He said fears of renewed violence were keeping people away from his garage, slashing his income.

“After 6 p.m., my own brother could knock on the door and I wouldn’t open it,” Twayyer said.

Alawite rallies in recent days and last month showed the challenges the committee faces.

On December 28, thousands of Alawites chanted for decentralized rule and the release of detainees. Their demonstration barely lasted an hour before they were confronted by a pro-government protest. Gunfire from security forces broke up that gathering
 
 and one last month with similar demands.

Authorities have launched public trials over the March violence. Their results remain a litmus test for accountability in the new Syria.

Wael Hasan, a 59-year-old farmer whose charred home the committee has promised to repair, told Reuters there was a long way to go before Syria’s communities could live together without fear.

“Deep inside, we’re ready for it. But right now it feels far away because justice and law must come first,” he said.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 07:25:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LU5K6IVSTRMHDMH5P6WVCZMJXY.jpg?auth=8e3e97c8b315cb59cbc4b891cee741d8f0805debcd46fface0cbfbea746f14d6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran's president urges government to listen to protesters 'legitimate demands'</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20251230-iran-s-president-urges-government-to-listen-to-protesters-legitimate-demands</link><description>Iran 's president urged his government to listen to the "legitimate demands" of protesters, state media reported Tuesday, after several days of demonstrations by shopkeepers in Tehran over economic hardships.

Shopkeepers in the capital had shut their stores for the second day in a row on Monday, after Iran's embattled currency hit new lows on the unofficial market.

The US dollar was trading at around 1.42 million rials on Sunday – compared to 820,000 rials a year ago – and the euro nearing 1.7 million rials, according to price monitoring websites.

"I have asked the Interior Minister to listen to the legitimate demands of the protesters by engaging in dialogue with their representatives so that the government can do everything in its power to resolve the problems and act responsibly," President Masoud Pezeshkian said, according to the state-run IRNA news agency.

Protesters "are demanding immediate government intervention to rein in exchange-rate fluctuations and set out a clear economic strategy", the pro-labour news agency ILNA reported Monday.

Price fluctuations are paralysing the sales of some imported goods, with both sellers and buyers preferring to postpone transactions until the outlook becomes clearer, AFP correspondents noted.

"Continuing to do business under these conditions has become impossible," ILNA quoted protesters as saying.

The conservative-aligned Fars news agency released images showing a crowd of demonstrators occupying a major thoroughfare in central Tehran, known for its many shops.

Another photograph appeared to show tear gas being used to disperse protesters.

"Minor physical clashes were reported ... between some protesters and the security forces," Fars said, warning that such gatherings could lead to instability.

Iranian Chief Justice Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei called for "the swift punishment of those responsible for currency fluctuations", the justice ministry's Mizan agency reported Monday.

The government has also announced the replacement of the central bank governor.

"By decision of the president, Abdolnasser Hemmati will be appointed governor of the Central Bank," presidency communications official Mehdi Tabatabaei posted on X.

Hemmati is a former economy and finance minister who was dismissed by parliament in March because of the sharp depreciation of the rial.

Pezeshkian delivered on Sunday the budget for the next Persian year to parliament, vowing to fight inflation and the high cost of living.

In December, inflation stood at 52 percent year-on-year, according to official statistics. But this figure still falls far short of many price increases, especially for basic necessities.

The country's economy, already battered by decades of Western sanctions, was further strained after the United Nations in late September reinstated international sanctions linked to the country's nuclear programme that were lifted 10 years ago.

The retired retail worker was learning how to use her new metal detector when it started bleeping by the moss-covered ruins of a building. After Plumridge dug the nugget out of the shallow dirt with a plastic trowel, a guide estimated it was around 0.2 of a gram of gold, worth about A$40 ($26.58).

“But to me, it’s worth a million dollars,” said the 63-year-old, who had bought the detector only a few days before. “My heart is singing.”

Plumridge's story is becoming more common, as hobbyists flock to Australia's 9,600 sq km "golden triangle" in the heart of Victoria state, known as one of the world's most prospective regions for gold nuggets.

Prospectors have been spurred on by record gold prices, social media, the success of TV show Aussie Gold Hunters, and a love for the outdoors, according to Reuters interviews with a dozen gold hunters.

Plumridge's detector, Minelab's Gold Monster 2000, which she bought for A$2,999, sold out across the country within weeks of its October 20 launch, according to Leanne Kamp, joint owner of Lucky Strike Gold, a prospecting shop in Geelong.

"It’s a great price point and we have seen a big jump in sales this year, partly because the gold price has got everyone’s interest," said Kamp, who has led prospecting tours since 2007.

"We get a lot of internationals. Next week we have some Germans coming. Germans love the gold. The Swiss seem to love the gold too. And we have some coming over from the U.S.,” she said.

The chance of finding nuggets on historic sites improves with each iteration of detectors, which is why there is a rush for new models as soon as they are released, she added.

Hobbyists have flocked to 19th-century gold rush towns like Ballarat, which laid the foundation for Melbourne's early wealth and helped make Australia one of the world's top three gold producers.

The region has yielded the world's biggest nugget, the Welcome Stranger at 72 kg, found in the 1860s, as well as the Hand of Faith, the largest nugget found with a metal detector at 27.2 kg in 1980. As recently as February 2023, an amateur prospector unearthed a 4.6 kg nugget in the region with a detector, according to the state government.

The lure of large nuggets is one of the draws for Damian Duke, 39, who works in construction. Duke used to go prospecting with his father who died three years ago. Now he takes his own son, Ethan.

The 11-year-old inherited his grandfather’s detector, and Duke has recently upgraded his machine, he told Reuters.

“Where prices are now, you do have the chance of striking a life-changing piece of gold," he said.

Gold has chalked up successive records this year, surging above $4,500 a troy ounce on Friday. Goldman Sachs expects prices will reach $4,900 by the end of 2026, with further gains likely if private investors continue diversifying their portfolios amid geopolitical and fiscal uncertainty.

In Victoria, fossickers must buy a permit from the state government. The permit allows them to fossick using only hand tools and to keep any gold they find.

Demand for the miner's right permits, which cost A$28.60 each and last for a decade, has hit all-time highs, at almost 16,000 by November, from nearly 11,000 last year, according to figures from Victoria's Department of Energy, Environment and Climate Action, supplied exclusively to Reuters.

In total, there are more than 100,000 active miner’s right permits in Victoria.

A dream of riches may drive people to get out, but they stay out because of the psychological benefits that come from the focus on the hunt, being outside in nature, and connecting with others, prospectors said.

"It's really good for your mental health, being out here. You take it all in, you can't think about anything else - I love looking at all the wildflowers," said Kelly Smith, a 50-year-old from the country town of Koondrook, who was prospecting with her partner on a training session organised by The Gold Centre in Maryborough.

"You're not guaranteed to find anything. But you're not going to find anything at all if you don't look."

Victoria's latest gold rush is part of a broader phenomenon, said Ben Harvey, executive general manager of Minelab at Adelaide-headquartered Codan (CDA.AX) , opens new tab , which is the world's largest maker of hand-held metal detectors.

Alongside Codan's communications division, strong detector sales in its home market of Australia as well as in Africa and the Americas have helped double the firm's share price this year.

In Africa, demand may be led by artisanal miners working in cooperatives to improve their standard of living, Harvey said. In Latin America, there is also recreational interest from hobbyists searching for coins and other treasure, he told Reuters in an interview.

Behind the success is a push by Codan's team of engineers to improve technology to cut down on background noise so detectorists can focus on the gold, he said.

"What a prospector is looking for is, when they go out, they want to find gold, and they want to find more gold than they found last time," he said.

The downgrade comes at a delicate time for Budapest, which is run by the liberal mayor Gergely Karacsony, as nationalist Prime Minister Orban will likely face parliamentary elections in April. The centre-right opposition Tisza party is leading most polls.

"The action follows the disclosure of Budapest's liquidity position highlighting concerns about the city's capacity to repay all of its obligations as required by 31 December 2025," Moody's said late on Monday.

"Uncertainty around the timing and receipt of ordinary transfers, together with very weak liquidity to absorb unexpected cash flow gaps, materially increases the city's near-term credit risk."

Moody's put Budapest's rating on review for a further downgrade "to reflect the increased risk of default and the potential acceleration of repayment of the city's long-term debt due to liquidity concerns."

On Facebook, Karacsony said the downgrade was the result of "the government's irrational and narrow-minded tax policy."

Budapest's leadership has been in conflict with Orban's government over the "solidarity tax," a levy the city has to pay to the state. Moody's said the tax rose 31% from a year earlier to 76 billion forints ($231.50 million) in 2024 and is expected to be 89 billion forints in 2025, or 21% of projected revenues.

"Ongoing legal disputes over the tax amount, which exceeds the funding received from the central government, add system instability and jeopardize the budgeting process and cash balances," Moody's said, adding the ratings also reflected the partial freezing of European Union funds to Hungary.

The EU has suspended billions of euros in funds to Hungary over the government's erosion of democratic rights, allegations that Orban denies.

Orban has said the government was ready to throw a financial lifeline to Budapest.

Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, a staunch ally of President Vladimir Putin who has also embarked on talks with the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, announced the deployment of the intermediate-range ballistic earlier this month.

Some Western experts have said that the deployment, which would make it slightly faster for Russian nuclear missiles to reach European targets in the event of a war, underscores the Kremlin’s growing reliance on the threat of nuclear weapons as it seeks to deter NATO members from supplying Kyiv with weapons that can strike deep inside Russia.

Two U.S. researchers have said that, according to their study of satellite images, Moscow is likely stationing the missiles and their mobile launchers at a former airbase in eastern Belarus.

Video released by the Belarusian Defence Ministry on Tuesday did not disclose the location of the missile systems, but showed mobile launchers and their crews driving along forest roads and specialist troops camouflaging the systems with netting.

A senior officer was shown telling troops that the systems had officially been placed on combat duty and, as light snow fell in the background, speaking of regular training and reconnaissance routines for the missile crews.

Moscow tested a conventionally armed Oreshnik – Russian for Hazel tree - against a target in Ukraine in November 2024.

The investigation looked into an alleged payment of 1.5 million euros ($1.8 million) for security at two homes in the Bavarian lakeside community of Rottach-Egern between April and September 2022.

Prosecutors also claimed that Usmanov failed to declare jewellery, paintings and wines to Germany's export control office, BAFA, in accordance with European Union sanctions rules. Usmanov has denied any wrongdoing.

Usmanov, who has a net worth of $18.8 billion according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, is subject to EU and U.S. sanctions and a travel ban, which were imposed after the start of the war in Ukraine.

Usmanov's lawyers said he had no links to the companies involved in the alleged payments nor did he own or control the properties in question, adding that the EU sanctions were not directly applicable to the probe. Prosecutors were expected to release a statement on the matter later on Tuesday.

His lawyers said it was agreed to close the case to save time and resources. They added that their statement had been coordinated with the prosecutors.

They said Usmanov had agreed to pay 10 million euros split between the German state budget and German charity groups as part of an arrangement to close the probe. They said that the payment was neither a fine nor a form of punishment.

In November 2024, German prosecutors dropped a money laundering investigation against Usmanov on similar terms.

The Southeast Asian neighbours agreed on a ceasefire that took effect at noon (0500 GMT) on Saturday, halting 20 days of fighting that killed at least 101 people and displaced more than half a million on both sides, and included fighter-jet sorties, exchanges of rocket fire and artillery barrages.

The border clashes reignited early this month, following the breakdown in a ceasefire deal that U.S. President Donald Trump and Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim helped broker to halt a previous round of conflict in July.

Under the agreement signed by the defence ministers of both countries on Saturday, Thailand said that after the ceasefire held for 72 hours it would release 18 Cambodian soldiers who have been in detention since July. By mid-afternoon on Tuesday there was no news on the status of the soldiers.

Earlier in the day, Thai Foreign Minister Sihasak Phuangketkeow said the ceasefire was fragile and needed both sides to ensure that it was sustained and that bilateral relations were gradually repaired.

"The ceasefire has only just been agreed so there is fragility," Sihasak told reporters. "We should avoid instigation or things that could diminish the ceasefire," he said.

On Monday, the Thai army said Cambodia had breached the ceasefire by flying more than 250 drones over Thailand on Sunday night, and threatened to reconsider the decision to hand over the detained Cambodian soldiers.

Cambodian authorities strongly rejected the accusation, and issued an order prohibiting the use of drones across the country.

The Thai Foreign Ministry also sent a formal protest to Cambodia after a Thai soldier lost a limb on Monday in a landmine blast at a border area.

Landmine incidents were a catalyst for the renewed clashes.

China's Foreign Minister hosted two days of talks with his Thai and Cambodian counterparts, reaching an agreement on Monday that the two countries would work to rebuild mutual trust and gradually consolidate the ceasefire.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 08:55:58 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BHVGJP6QLNMRLHFJOW3TUDRSUE.jpg?auth=6f0652db4ee00b2625ebfb2d205b0862764680589960204c349ebdca6ae03148&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>ASEAN to assess post-election developments in Myanmar, Malaysia PM says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/asean-assess-post-election-developments-myanmar-malaysia-pm-says-2025-12-30/</link><description>KUALA LUMPUR, Dec 30 (Reuters) - Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said on Tuesday that leaders from the Southeast Asian bloc ASEAN will consider developments in Myanmar following the first phase of its election over the weekend.

The polls are being held in several phases amid an ongoing civil war that has ravaged parts of Myanmar and led to one of Asia's worst humanitarian crises .

The election has been widely derided by the United Nations, Western governments and human rights groups as a sham and an attempt by the ruling junta to entrench military rule through political proxies.

The junta has denied the charge, saying the election was not being conducted through coercion or force and has public support.

Anwar, the current chair of the 11-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations, said the bloc's leaders will monitor the situation in Myanmar with care, including steps underway that relate to the political process.

"Any assessment will proceed in a sequenced manner, guided by the need to reduce violence, avoid actions that could deepen divisions or confer premature legitimacy, and preserve the possibility of an inclusive and credible pathway forward," he said in a televised press conference.

Malaysia's foreign minister has previously said that ASEAN wants the election to be fair and inclusive, and also urged the Myanmar junta to adhere to a peace agreement it agreed with the bloc in 2021.

The "Five-Point Consensus" peace plan has been largely seen as a failure, with Myanmar's military rulers refusing to meet with opponents it deemed to be terrorists.

Myanmar has been in turmoil since the military overthrew a civilian democratic government in a 2021 coup, triggering an armed rebellion that has captured large swathes of territory across the country.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 09:28:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/EQNX7VTE4ZN5FPPQPSGSZBCDYA.jpg?auth=47d280b0eb7fa0754212d15f8cdfd3dc2334bd252cb0c7a9f903eabd9d758ad6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Exclusive: China mandates 50% domestic equipment rule for chipmakers</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-mandates-50-domestic-equipment-rule-chipmakers-sources-say-2025-12-30/</link><description>SINGAPORE, Dec 30 (Reuters) - China is requiring chipmakers to use at least 50% domestically made equipment for adding new capacity, three people familiar with the matter said, as Beijing pushes to build a self-sufficient semiconductor supply chain.

The rule is not publicly documented, but chipmakers seeking state approval to build or expand their plants have been told by authorities in recent months that they must prove through procurement tenders that at least half their equipment will be Chinese-made, the people told Reuters.

The mandate is one of the most significant measures Beijing has introduced to wean itself off reliance on foreign technology, a push that gathered pace after the U.S. tightened technology export restrictions in 2023, banning sales of advanced AI chips and semiconductor equipment to China.

While those U.S. export restrictions blocked the sale of some of the most advanced tools, the 50% rule is leading Chinese manufacturers to choose domestic suppliers even in areas where foreign equipment from the U.S., Japan, South Korea and Europe remain available.

Applications failing the threshold are typically rejected, though authorities grant flexibility depending on supply constraints, the people said. The requirements are relaxed for advanced chip production lines, where domestically developed equipment is not yet fully available.

"Authorities prefer if it is much higher than 50%," one source told Reuters. "Eventually they are aiming for the plants to use 100% domestic equipment."

China's industry ministry did not respond to a request for comment. The sources did not wish to be identified as the measure is not public.

China's President Xi Jinping has been calling for a "whole nation" effort to build a fully self-sufficient domestic semiconductor supply chain that involves thousands of engineers and scientists at companies and research centers nationwide.

The effort is being made across the wide supply-chain spectrum. Reuters reported earlier this month that Chinese scientists are working on a prototype of a machine capable of producing cutting-edge chips, an outcome that Washington has spent years trying to prevent.

"Before, domestic fabs like SMIC would prefer U.S. equipment and would not really give Chinese firms a chance," a former employee at local equipment maker Naura Technology (002371.SZ) , opens new tab said, referring to the Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (0981.HK) , opens new tab .

"But that changed starting with the 2023 U.S export restrictions, when Chinese fabs had no choice but to work with domestic suppliers."

State-affiliated entities placed a record 421 orders for domestic lithography machines and parts this year worth around 850 million yuan, according to publicly available procurement data, signaling a surge in demand for locally developed technologies.

To support the local chip supply chain, Beijing has also poured hundreds of billions of yuan into its semiconductor sector through the "Big Fund ", which established a third phase in 2024 with 344 billion yuan ($49 billion) in capital.

The policy is already yielding results, including in areas such as etching, a critical chip manufacturing step that involves removing materials from silicon wafers to carve out intricate transistor patterns, sources said.

China's largest chip equipment group, Naura, is testing its etching tools on a cutting-edge 7nm (nanometre) production line of SMIC, two sources said. The early-stage milestone, which comes after Naura recently deployed etching tools on 14nm successfully, demonstrates how quickly domestic suppliers are advancing.

"Naura's etching results have been accelerated by the government requiring fabs to use at least 50% domestic equipment," one of the people told Reuters, adding that it was forcing the company to rapidly improve.

Advanced etching tools had been predominantly supplied in China by foreign firms such as Lam Research (LRCX.O) , opens new tab and Tokyo Electron (8035.T) , opens new tab , but are now being partially replaced by Naura and smaller rival Advanced Micro-Fabrication Equipment (AMEC) (688012.SS) , opens new tab , sources say.

Naura has also proven a key partner for Chinese memory chipmakers, supplying etching tools for advanced chips with more than 300 layers. It developed electrostatic chucks — devices that hold wafers during processing — to replace worn parts in Lam Research equipment that the company could no longer service after the 2023 restrictions, sources said.

Naura, AMEC, YTMC, SMIC, Lam Research, and Tokyo Electron did not respond to requests for comment.

China's progress is being viewed with concern by global competitors, as foreign suppliers are squeezed out of the China market.

Naura filed a record 779 patents in 2025, more than double what it filed in 2020 and 2021, while AMEC filed 259, according to Anaqua's AcclaimIP database, and verified by Reuters.

That's also translating into strong financial results. Naura's revenue for the first half of 2025 jumped 30% to 16 billion yuan. AMEC reported a 44% jump in first-half revenue to 5 billion yuan.

Analysts estimate that China has now reached roughly 50% self-sufficiency in photoresist-removal and cleaning equipment, a market previously dominated by Japanese firms, but now locally led by Naura.

"The domestic equipment market will be dominated by two to three major manufacturers, and Naura is definitely one of them," said a separate source.

Once the twin pillars of regional security, the two Gulf heavyweights have seen their interests diverge on everything from oil quotas to geopolitical influence.

Here is a timeline of how the relationship has evolved:

2011: As the Arab Spring spreads, the two form a unified front against Islamist movements, deploying joint forces to Bahrain to quell an uprising and coordinating support for Egypt’s 2013 military overthrow of the Muslim Brotherhood government.

March, 2015: They launch a military intervention in Yemen to restore the government ousted by the Iran-aligned Houthis. UAE troops lead ground operations, while Saudi air power controls the skies.

June, 2017: The allies lead a boycott of Qatar , accusing Doha of supporting terrorism, charges it denies. The move cements the alignment between Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) and UAE leader Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed (MBZ).

2019: The UAE draws down troops in Yemen , shifting strategy but retaining influence through the separatist Southern Transitional Council (STC), leaving Riyadh to shoulder the war against the Houthis.

September, 2020: The UAE normalizes ties with Israel under the U.S.-brokered Abraham Accords. Saudi Arabia, the custodian of Islam's two holiest sites, declines to follow suit , insisting on Palestinian statehood first, giving Abu Dhabi a unique diplomatic channel to Washington.

January, 2021: Saudi Arabia leads the Al-Ula summit to end the Qatar dispute . The UAE signs reluctantly, maintaining a cooler stance toward Doha.

February, 2021: Riyadh challenges Dubai's commercial dominance, telling foreign firms to move regional HQs to the kingdom by 2024 or lose state contracts.

July, 2021: Economic rivalry spikes. Riyadh removes tariff concessions for goods from free zones, undercutting the UAE’s trade model. Simultaneously, a rare dispute erupts at OPEC as the UAE blocks a Saudi-led deal, demanding a higher crude oil production baseline.

April, 2023: In Sudan's war , Riyadh hosts ceasefire talks supporting the army, while UN experts accuse the UAE of arming the rival Rapid Support Forces, which Abu Dhabi denies.

December 8, 2025: Tensions peak in Yemen as the UAE-backed STC seizes oilfields in Hadramout, crossing a Saudi "red line."

December 30, 2025: Saudi jets strike a vessel in Mukalla. The coalition says the ship was delivering heavy weapons to separatists, marking the first direct engagement between the partners' interests.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 10:24:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/PVGTQMDLPZIFTJ5RUZWZ6N6I7M.jpg?auth=78fff262d6359146e45043485648c5ffd5bd306337ff28128d1b4e528cf2ef05&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Kremlin says Russia is toughening its stance on Ukraine after drone attack</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/kremlin-says-russia-is-toughening-its-stance-ukraine-after-drone-attack-2025-12-30/</link><description>MOSCOW, Dec 30 (Reuters) - The Kremlin said on Tuesday that a Ukrainian drone attack on a presidential residence in the Novgorod region would toughen Russia's position on a possible peace deal to end the fighting.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has dismissed the Russian accusations as "another round of lies" aimed to justify additional attacks against Ukraine and to prolong the war.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov noted Ukraine's denial of the drone attack - and said that many Western media were playing along with Kyiv's denial.

"This terrorist action is aimed at collapsing the negotiation process," Peskov told reporters. "The diplomatic consequence will be to toughen the negotiating position of the Russian Federation."

The Russian military, he said, knew how and when to respond.

"We see that Zelenskiy himself is trying to deny this, and many Western media outlets, playing along with the Kyiv regime, are starting to spread the theme that this did not happen," Peskov said. "This is a completely insane assertion."

Peskov declined to say where Putin was at the time of the attack, saying that in light of recent events such details should not be in the public domain.

When asked if Russia had physical evidence of the drone attack, he said air defences shot the drones down but that the question of wreckage was for the defence ministry.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 10:24:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4VEKYATHCNKTZBIGCDOQ6ODCGA.jpg?auth=f4b6179aaf0154ca9c834db678db97623c1d79457f510815d663d578507fdf72&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Kremlin says Russia is toughening its stance on Ukraine after drone attack</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/kremlin-says-russia-is-toughening-its-stance-ukraine-after-drone-attack-2025-12-30/</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 10:24:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>George Clooney, his wife Amal and their children obtain French citizenship</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/george-clooney-his-wife-amal-their-children-obtain-french-citizenship-2025-12-30/</link><description>PARIS, Dec 30 (Reuters) - Hollywood star George Clooney and his wife, human rights lawyer Amal Clooney, have obtained French citizenship, along with their two children, official French government documents show.

Clooney told broadcaster RTL earlier this month that it was essential for him and his wife that their eight-year-old twins Alexander and Ella could live in a place where they had a chance to live a normal life.

“Here, they don’t take photos of kids. There aren’t any paparazzi hidden at the school gates. That’s number one for us,” he told RTL on December 2.

The couple purchased a house on a vineyard, with an estimated value of around 9 million euros ($10.59 million), in the southern French town of Brignoles in 2021.

The property also includes a swimming pool and a tennis court, according to French media.

"We also have a house in the United States, but our happiest place is on this farm where the kids can have fun," he said.

U.S. film director Jim Jarmusch on Friday told France Inter radio that he would also make an application to obtain French citizenship.

"I would like to have another place to escape from America if necessary," he told France Inter.

"And France, and Paris, and French culture are very deep in me. So I think I would be very honored if I could have a French passport," he said.

"It is essential for Turkey to play a role of facilitator, constructively and aimed at dialogue ... This is crucial for both regional peace and to strengthen its own internal peace," Ocalan, founder of the Kurdistan Workers' Party ( PKK ) militant group, said in a message relayed by Turkey's pro-Kurdish DEM party.

Earlier this year, the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) ended its four-decade armed struggle against Turkey at the urging of its jailed founder Abdullah Ocalan, shifting its focus to a democratic political struggle for the rights of Turkey's Kurdish minority.

The ongoing process has raised hopes among Kurds across the region, notably in Syria where the Kurds control swathes of territory in the north and northeast.

Turkey has long been hostile to the Kurdish SDF force that controls swathes of northeastern Syria, seeing it as an extension of PKK, and pushing for the US-backed force to integrate into the Syrian military and security apparatus.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 10:51:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/43654ba8-e55e-11f0-bad3-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25328691950897.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran's government offers dialogue to protesters</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/irans-government-offers-dialogue-protesters-2025-12-30/</link><description>DUBAI, Dec 30 (Reuters) - Iran's government said on Tuesday it would seek dialogue with protest leaders after demonstrations in Tehran and other cities over a plunge in the currency's value that has accelerated inflation, with the central bank chief resigning.

Protests, which included shopkeepers in Tehran's Grand Bazaar, were held on Sunday and Monday according to Iranian state media, the latest demonstrations in the Islamic Republic where bouts of unrest have repeatedly erupted in recent years.

President Masoud Pezeshkian said in a social media post late on Monday that he had asked the interior minister to listen to "legitimate demands" of protesters. Government spokeswoman Fatemeh Mohajerani said a dialogue mechanism would be set up and include talks with protest leaders.

"We officially recognise the protests ... We hear their voices and we know that this originates from natural pressure arising from the pressure on people's livelihoods," she said on Tuesday in comments carried by state media.

The Iranian rial has been falling as the economy has suffered from the impact of Western sanctions, sinking to a record low on Monday at around 1,390,000 to the U.S. dollar, according to websites monitoring open market rates.

"We have fundamental measures on the agenda to reform the monetary and banking system and maintain the purchasing power of the people," Pezeshkian posted on X.

Iranian media have said the government's recent economic liberalisation policies have put pressure on the open-rate rial market, where ordinary Iranians buy foreign currency.

In 2022, Iran was buffeted by protests across the country over price hikes, including for bread, a major staple .

Over the same period and into 2023, the country's clerical rulers faced the boldest unrest in years touched off by the death of a young Iranian Kurdish woman, Mahsa Amini, in the custody of the morality police, who enforce strict dress codes.

Iranian security services suppressed previous rounds of protests with violent crackdowns and widespread arrests rather than dialogue.

Iran remains under intense international pressure, with U.S. President Donald Trump saying on Monday that he might back another round of Israeli airstrikes if Tehran resumed work on ballistic missiles or any nuclear weapons programme.

The U.S. and Israel carried out 12 days of airstrikes on Iran's military and its nuclear installations in June aimed at stopping what they believe were efforts to develop the means to build an atomic weapon.

Iran says its nuclear energy programme is entirely peaceful and that it has not tried to build a nuclear bomb.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 11:19:47 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/46ZYRWDPDNNVHOCZ3AMQSHRKOE.jpg?auth=203722e36d4bb544c44b0b6cca9f5449a1115ae6282b84a6b8a1dc53669da1e6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ivory Coast's ruling party increases its majority in weekend vote</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/ivory-coasts-ruling-party-increases-its-majority-weekend-vote-2025-12-30/</link><description>ABIDJAN, Dec 30 (Reuters) - Ivory Coast's ruling party increased its majority in parliament in elections held at the weekend, while the main opposition party, led by former Credit Suisse CEO Tidjane Thiam, lost half of its seats, provisional results showed.

The strong showing for the Rally of Houphouëtists for Democracy and Peace, or RHDP, should make it easier for President Alassane Ouattara to implement his agenda that includes luring private investment to French-speaking West Africa's largest economy, the world's biggest cocoa grower.

Ouattara, an 83-year-old former deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund who secured a fourth term in October, has also said he would use his mandate to prepare the way for a new generation of political leaders.

The RHDP took 197 of 255 seats in the National Assembly in Saturday's elections, according to provisional results announced on Monday by the electoral commission, up from 163.

Thiam's Democratic Party of Ivory Coast, or PDCI, won 32 seats, down from 65, while independent candidates won 23 seats.

Voter turnout was 35.04%, down from 37.88% during the last legislative elections in 2021.

Ouattara first came to power in 2011 after a four-month war.

He was re-elected with more than 89% of the vote in the presidential contest on October 25 in which Thiam and former President Laurent Gbagbo were barred from running.

Gbagbo's party boycotted this year's legislative elections, saying they would not be credible.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 11:21:02 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/X63UQXNYKBPEPEGTVPU4DRLZWU.jpg?auth=2951cab850ee3f67df798c16db92b6b8cc87e1fd4a956795a3811d5a5a1125ac&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia attacks Ukraine's Black Sea ports, damages civilian ship, Kyiv says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/russia-attacks-ukraines-black-sea-ports-damages-civilian-ship-kyiv-says-2025-12-30/</link><description>KYIV, Dec 30 (Reuters) - Russia attacked infrastructure in Ukraine's Odesa region on Tuesday, damaging a civilian ship and facilities in the Black Sea ports of Pivdennyi and Chornomorsk, Deputy Prime Minister Oleksiy Kuleba said.

Kuleba said a civilian Panama-flagged ship loaded with grains was damaged, and that oil storage tanks were also hit. One person was wounded, he said on the Telegram app.

"This is yet another targeted attack by Russia on civilian port infrastructure. The enemy is trying to disrupt logistics and complicate shipping," Kuleba said.

Despite the attacks, both ports continued to operate, he said.

Odesa and the wider nearby region are home to the Black Sea ports that are crucial for Ukraine's foreign trade and the survival of its wartime economy.

Ukraine is a major global producer and exporter of agricultural products. During nearly four years of the war, the role of Odesa and its two other ports - Pivdennyi and Chornomorsk - as major trading hubs grew as other Ukrainian ports were destroyed, occupied, or disrupted by Russia's forces.

In the past several months, maritime warfare between Ukraine and Russia has intensified. Both sides have attacked naval and commercial assets in the Black Sea and beyond.

Ukraine is increasingly using its sea drones for attacks on ships connected to Russia’s shadow fleet.

At the same time, Russia has stepped up its attacks on the city of Odesa and its port infrastructure.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 12:44:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Syria imposes curfew in Latakia days after protests turn violent, state media says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/syria-imposes-curfew-latakia-days-after-protests-turn-violent-state-media-says-2025-12-30/</link><description>Dec 30 (Reuters) - Syrian security forces imposed a curfew on Latakia city, a bastion of the country's Alawite minority, state media reported on Tuesday, days after four people were killed in protests that spiralled into violence.

Syria has been rocked by several episodes of sectarian bloodshed since longtime leader Bashar al-Assad, who hails from the Muslim Alawite community, was ousted by a rebel offensive last year and replaced by a Sunni-led government.

State media said the curfew was set to last from 5 p.m. (1400 GMT) on Tuesday until 6 a.m. (0300 GMT) on Wednesday.

Security forces reinforced their deployment in a number of neighborhoods in Latakia city on the Mediterranean coast, which witnessed riots on Monday that injured about a dozen people.

Thousands of Alawite protesters gathered on Sunday in Azhari Square in Latakia city to demand a decentralized political system in Syria and the release of thousands of Alawite prisoners.

A similar protest in November lasted barely an hour before being confronted by a rival protest in support of Syria's new government. Syrian security forces used gunfire to break up both.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 12:44:21 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/W4GNKFLRVBM67IXHUZNGDUSBTQ.jpg?auth=7a270c0266c936ad246352c4395399e5d176cb5b30730cfd5427ce187de5fe6c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Polish prime minister says peace could be achieved in Ukraine within weeks</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/polish-prime-minister-says-peace-could-be-achieved-ukraine-within-weeks-2025-12-30/</link><description>WARSAW, Dec 30 (Reuters) - Peace could be achieved in Ukraine in a matter of weeks, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said on Tuesday after talks with other European leaders, Canada and NATO.

He made his remarks despite the Kremlin saying its negotiating position would toughen after accusing Kyiv of attacking a Russian presidential residence, an allegation that Kyiv said was baseless and intended to prolong the conflict.

"Peace is on the horizon, there is no doubt that things have happened that give grounds for hope that this war can end, and quite quickly, but it is still a hope, far from 100% certain," Tusk told a government meeting.

"When I say peace is on the horizon, I'm talking about the coming weeks, not the coming months or years. By January, we'll all have to come together... to make decisions about the future of Ukraine, the future of this part of the world."

Tusk said security guarantees offered to Kyiv by the United States were a reason to hope the conflict could end soon, but that Kyiv would need to compromise on territorial issues.

U.S. President Donald Trump said after talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Sunday that they were "getting a lot closer, maybe very close" to an agreement to end the war although "thorny issues" remained.

Zelenskiy said control of Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station , which is in Russian hands, and the fate of the Donbas area of eastern Ukraine were still unresolved.

Russia wants Kyiv to withdraw troops from parts of the Donetsk region it has failed to occupy in almost four years of war since its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Kyiv wants fighting halted along current front lines, and Washington has proposed a free economic zone if Ukraine pulls troops back.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 12:44:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7HXPSKOM55MPDPWRBBUIMRKGKA.jpg?auth=53aefb95827b48a5d74a1a924343f46da8f6a356587af3234183e0ba43a9af95&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>What do we know about Russian accusations that Ukraine attacked Putin residence?</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/what-do-we-know-about-russian-accusations-that-ukraine-attacked-putin-residence-2025-12-30/</link><description>MOSCOW, Dec 30 (Reuters) - Moscow has accused Kyiv of trying to strike a presidential residence in northern Russia, an allegation that Ukrainian leaders have dismissed as a lie aimed at allowing Moscow to continue the war in Ukraine.

WHAT IS RUSSIA'S ACCUSATION?

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Monday accused Ukraine of attacking a presidential residence in the Novgorod region overnight with 91 long-range attack drones and said Russia would retaliate.

He said no one was injured and that although Moscow was not quitting talks on ending the war in Ukraine, its negotiating position was being reviewed following the attack, which he described as "state terrorism".

Lavrov did not provide any evidence for the accusation. He said Russia had already identified targets in Ukraine.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy dismissed the Russian accusations as "another round of lies" aimed at justifying additional attacks on Ukraine and to prolong the war under way since President Vladimir Putin sent troops into Ukraine in February 2022.

"This alleged 'residence strike' story is a complete fabrication intended to justify additional attacks against Ukraine, including Kyiv, as well as Russia’s own refusal to take necessary steps to end the war. Typical Russian lies," he said.

Russia has often launched hundreds of drones as well as firing missiles in almost daily attacks on Ukraine.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha urged world leaders on Monday to condemn Russia over its allegations, and added on Tuesday: "Almost a day passed and Russia still hasn’t provided any plausible evidence to its accusations of Ukraine’s alleged 'attack on Putin’s residence'. And they won’t. Because there’s none. No such attack happened."

The Valdai residence, also known as "Uzhin" or "Dolgiye Borody", is a heavily guarded complex on the shores of Lake Valdai about 360 km (225 miles) north of Moscow.

It was unclear where Putin was at the time of the alleged attack but he held meetings on Saturday and Monday in the Kremlin. Putin has yet to comment in public on the situation and Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Tuesday that in light of recent events such details should not be in the public domain.

Shortly before Lavrov released his statement, Putin held a meeting in the Kremlin with Defence Minister Andrei Belousov, Federal Security Service Director Alexander Bortnikov and top generals about the war in Ukraine. He did not mention any Ukrainian drone attack on the residence.

Putin informed Trump of the attack on Monday.

"I don't like it. It's not good," Trump told reporters.

"It's one thing to be offensive," Trump said. "It's another thing to attack his house. It's not the right time to do any of that. And I learned about it from President Putin today. I was very angry about it."

After Lavrov's statement, Russia's defence ministry said 91 drones had been downed on their way to the presidential residence, including 49 shot down over the Bryansk region which is 450 km from Valdai, one over the Smolensk region and 41 over the heavily forested Novgorod region.

The defence ministry had not mentioned any attack on the residence in its earlier reports of military action. The governor of Novgorod, Alexander Dronov, had said air defence and fighter jets were shooting down Ukrainian drones.

Asked if Russia had physical evidence of the drone attack, Peskov said on Tuesday the question of wreckage was for the defence ministry.

Russia accused Ukraine in 2023 of attacking the Kremlin with drones in what it said was an attempt to assassinate Putin. Ukraine denied any involvement in the incident and accused Russia of manufacturing a pretext for an escalation of the war.

The New York Times later reported that U.S. intelligence agencies believed Ukraine's security services were behind the attack but that it was unclear whether Zelenskiy or his top officials were aware of the operation. Some officials believed Zelenskiy was not aware, it reported.

Russia said on Monday it would retaliate and that it will review its position in peace talks although it said it was not quitting the negotiations.

"The diplomatic consequence will be to toughen the negotiating position of the Russian Federation," Peskov said on Tuesday. He did not say what targets Russia might strike but that the military knew when and how to respond.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 12:44:43 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/TDKA4EZPEVKUVLOEWMUCEBIMYY.jpg?auth=1ec45a9063500ee0520858e67785f5289bdfae66734a7d2700d6a6d19fd9571a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Spain exempts Airbus from Israeli tech ban</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/spain-exempts-airbus-israeli-tech-ban-2025-12-30/</link><description>MADRID, Dec 30 (Reuters) - Spain has granted Airbus (AIR.PA) , opens new tab exceptional permission to produce aircraft and drones using Israeli technology at its Spanish plants even though it banned military and dual-use products from Israel two months ago over its war in Gaza .

Approved last Tuesday by the cabinet and defended by several ministers this week, the exemption reflects the pressure from companies and domestic interests that some of Europe's toughest critics of Israel's recent war have faced as they attempt to impose trade sanctions.

It also risks increasing tensions within the ruling coalition between the Socialists and their hard-left partner Sumar when the government is already weakened by internal disputes and scandals over corruption and accusations of sexual harassment.

Neither Airbus nor the defence ministry was immediately available for comment.

Spain in September passed a law to take "urgent measures to stop the genocide in Gaza", banning trade in defence material and dual-use products from Israel, as well as imports and advertising of products originating from illegal Israeli settlements.

Its consumer ministry on Tuesday ordered seven tourist accommodation websites to remove 138 advertisements for holiday homes in occupied Palestinian territories or face the threat of sanctions in Spain.

Spain has already blocked 200 attempts to buy material linked to Israel, its digital transformation minister Oscar Lopez told national broadcaster TVE on Tuesday.

Airbus, which employs about 14,000 people in Spain and accounts for 60% of its air and defence exports, was granted the first exception in a cabinet meeting last week, written minutes showed, citing the "great industrial and export potential" of its aircraft "considered essential ... for preserving thousands of highly skilled jobs in Spain".

The European aerospace company produces its A400M and C295 transport planes, an A330 MRTT refuelling aircraft and SIRTAP surveillance drones at its sites in Madrid and Seville, all using Israeli technology.

The company is working with Spain's Ministry of Defence on a "plan to disconnect from Israeli technology", according to the minutes published last Tuesday, which did not provide further details.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 14:22:16 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/NZV6T6A56FP5ZNXBF6Z3WRAV4Q.jpg?auth=2e742ec4ca5152205ad0be6bd51ae11432199dd1ade5cca1d2b3a95df5fc821b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US, partner forces killed or captured nearly 25 Islamic State operatives since strikes in Syria</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-partner-forces-killed-or-captured-nearly-25-islamic-state-operatives-since-2025-12-30/</link><description>Dec 30 (Reuters) - The United States and its partner forces killed or captured nearly 25 Islamic State operatives since it launched retaliatory strikes in Syria earlier this month, the U.S. military said on Tuesday.

U.S. District Judge Angel Kelley in Boston granted , opens new tab an emergency request by several South Sudanese nationals and an immigrant rights group to prevent the temporary protected status they had been granted from expiring as planned after January 5.

Kelley, who was appointed by Democratic former President Joe Biden, issued the order after four migrants from South Sudan along with African Communities Together, a non-profit group, sued . The lawsuit alleged that action by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security was unlawful and exposed them to being deported to a country facing a series of humanitarian crises.

South Sudan has been ravaged by conflict since winning independence from Sudan in 2011. Fighting has persisted in much of the country since the end in 2018 of a five-year civil war that killed an estimated 400,000 people, and the U.S. State Department advises citizens not to travel there.

The United States began designating South Sudan for temporary protected status, or TPS, in 2011.

That status is available to people whose home countries have experienced natural disasters, armed conflicts or other extraordinary events. It provides eligible migrants with work authorization and temporary protection from deportation.

About 232 South Sudanese nationals have been beneficiaries of TPS and have found refuge in the United States, and another 73 have pending applications for that same protection, according to the lawsuit.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem published a notice on November 5 terminating TPS for South Sudan, saying the country no longer met the conditions for the designation.

Her department has moved to similarly end temporary protections to foreign nationals from countries including Syria , Venezuela , Haiti , Cuba and Nicaragua, prompting several court challenges.

"With the renewed peace in South Sudan, their demonstrated commitment to ensuring the safe reintegration of returning nationals, and improved diplomatic relations, now is the right time to conclude what was always intended to be a temporary designation," a Homeland Security Department spokesperson said in a statement ahead of the court ruling.

The lawsuit argues the agency's action violated the statute governing the TPS program, ignored the dire humanitarian conditions that remain in South Sudan, and was motivated by discrimination against migrants who are not white in violation of the U.S. Constitution's Fifth Amendment.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 14:49:56 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/IIVEYADSFFPBTPSINDLSK3DXEU.jpg?auth=4624682c77119d5b92492184ef8774bacd7d92318f0c58d3c8b1a92b26d9d7a8&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Power failure halts Channel Tunnel rail traffic, causing travel mayhem</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/eurostar-flags-severe-delays-cancellations-due-power-supply-issues-channel-2025-12-30/</link><description>PARIS, Dec 30 (Reuters) - Train services through the Channel Tunnel linking Britain and continental Europe were suspended on Tuesday following a power supply failure, disrupting peak winter holiday travel.

A spokesperson for Eurostar, which operates high-speed trains linking London to Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam and Disneyland Paris, said services were halted indefinitely. Travellers at Paris' Gare du Nord station were told operations would be interrupted until the end of the day.

Getlink (GETP.PA) , opens new tab , which operates the tunnel infrastructure and the Le Shuttle service carrying cars and trucks, said repairs to the power supply were underway and that traffic was expected to resume gradually from 1400 GMT.

"Due to a problem with the overhead power supply in the Channel Tunnel and a subsequent failed Le Shuttle train, we strongly advise all our passengers to postpone their journey to a different date," Eurostar said in a statement.

The disruption affects one of Europe’s busiest international rail corridors at the height of the New Year travel season.

Several hundred Le Shuttle passengers were stuck in their vehicles after passing through passport checks and security at the terminal in Folkestone.

Officials said that for the time being they could neither go forward - there were no trains - nor backwards, because they had already crossed into the French control zone.

Alison Raby said she had booked a day trip to a theme park in Belgium, but the four-hour delay made the excursion pointless.

"We’re stuck, basically,” she told Reuters.

Fellow passenger Phil Groves, who works for Britain's National Health Service and was en route to Paris for New Year's Eve, said he and his family had been stuck at Folkestone for six hours and were held in a "mammoth queue".

"We've received no information other than the services are suspended," he said.

Britain's Port of Dover said it was operating a 'turn up and go' system for passengers affected by the tunnel disruption and that ferry operators currently had capacity to take extra travellers.

Le Shuttle carried 2.2 million passenger vehicles and 1.2 million trucks through the tunnel in 2024. Eurostar carried 19.5 million customers in the same year, its most successful to date.

Stranded passengers crowded the concourse at London's St Pancras station. One was led away by police, shouting "I just want to know if I'll see my family" after an exchange with a Eurostar worker.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 14:50:07 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/X4FXH77Z55OJZHKBXVBTU5FMQM.jpg?auth=128228a3fde54085106dc8db738fdd128042d7f40634df0d8b1ea482ee1eb635&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Poland acts to improve status of same-sex couples with cohabitation bill</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/poland-acts-improve-status-same-sex-couples-with-cohabitation-bill-2025-12-30/</link><description>WARSAW, Dec 30 (Reuters) - Poland's government approved a bill on Tuesday introducing "cohabitation contracts" for couples living together, a measure of recognition for same-sex unions in one of the few European Union countries with few rights for LGBT people.

Prime Minister Donald Tusk, who took office in 2023 pledging to reverse arch-conservative party policies criticised by Brussels for undermining democracy and minority rights, has struggled to deliver reforms on abortion and LGBT rights.

Those have faced resistance from his conservative junior coalition partner PSL and veto threats from two successive presidents aligned with the right-wing nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party that lost power in the 2023 election.

"We are going to the parliament with a conciliation project for which we believe there is a majority in the lower and upper House," Katarzyna Kotula, the government official overseeing equality issues, told reporters after a cabinet session.

The bill would allow two people, regardless of gender, to sign a cohabitation contract at a notary’s office. It covers housing rights, alimony, access to health information and health insurance, care leave, joint tax returns and tax exemptions.

The measure stops short of legalising same-sex marriage, which remains banned.

Tusk's pro-European government hopes the limited scope of the bill will secure approval from nationalist President Karol Nawrocki. LGBT groups voiced frustration but said the measure might be the only one with any chance to pass in parliament.

"This is not a moment of triumph. After two years of Donald Tusk's government, the ruling coalition has finally developed a joint proposal," the Campaign Against Homophobia said in a statement after the initial publication of the bill.

"This is not the bill we've been fighting for over the years. It's a meagre response to great expectations – and the only one that, in the current situation, can offer any sense of security."

Mostly Catholic Poland remains among the most restrictive EU states on LGBT rights, despite growing public support for legal recognition of same-sex couples.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 14:50:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/3C2VZQBKX5IVBL6YAQYP3E3IAU.jpg?auth=223d7c9ed2b3d60fa561d796128d43df7b4a7a0c61c14fd12d0d584a367f7ffd&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Shootings in Sweden halved in 2025 as police tackle gang crime</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/shootings-sweden-halved-2025-police-tackle-gang-crime-2025-12-30/</link><description>STOCKHOLM, Dec 30 (Reuters) - The number of shootings in Sweden has more than halved since hitting a peak in 2022, reflecting new policing approaches introduced by the right-wing government, which is readying for parliamentary elections next year.

Shooting incidents fell to 147 so far this year, a 63% decrease compared to 2022 when there were 390 shootings and a 49% decrease compared to 2024, according to a Reuters analysis of official figures.

The number of fatalities, however, was unchanged from last year at 43, though lower than the 62 killed in 2022.

The government won the 2022 election on a pledge to stop gang crime and drastically reduce immigration. It trails the opposition in opinion polls ahead of the next election in September, but the gap has narrowed.

Gang-related crime has been high in Sweden for more than two decades and, over that period, the amount of gun violence has risen to among the highest in Europe from among the lowest.

Among those killed this year, 11 died in a school shooting in February, which was not gang-related.

"New tools, resources and methods are starting to hit the criminal networks," Sweden's Minister of Justice Gunnar Strommer told Reuters, but said more needed to be done. "I want to remain humble. This is complicated and we still have levels of violence no decent society can accept."

Legislation that has drawn criticism from lawyers and some politicians has introduced changes such as anonymity for some court witnesses, increased electronic surveillance, tougher sentences and what are known as safety zones, where police can search people even if they are not suspected of any crime.

Johan Olsson, head of the Police National Operations Department, said the measures had allowed police to seize gangs' assets and become more efficient in preventing shootings.

"Where we don't see much success is stopping the recruitment to the gangs," he told Reuters, adding that much of the recruitment happened online.

Sweden has around 17,500 active gang members, according to police figures.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 15:44:48 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KB7AMZVGBRIVVNYTU5SRCPVTWI.jpg?auth=75626b9c8863368fb3f22f0d2dd9851629b096150f2b900b978952dc94de0f68&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukraine, 'Coalition of the Willing' to meet early January, Zelenskiy says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-coalition-willing-meet-early-january-zelenskiy-says-2025-12-30/</link><description>KYIV, Dec 30 (Reuters) - President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Tuesday that Ukraine and the so-called 'Coalition of the Willing' group of nations backing Kyiv plan to hold their next meetings at the start of January.

The move followed a Saudi-led coalition airstrike on the southern Yemeni port of Mukalla.

UAE-backed separatists in Yemen dismissed the calls to withdraw and vowed to hold and reinforce their territory.

"There is no thinking about withdrawal. It is unreasonable for the landowner to be asked to leave his own land. The situation requires staying and reinforcing," said Anwar Al-Tamimi, the spokesman for the separatist Southern Transitional Council (STC), in comments to AFP.

The attack on ‍what Riyadh said was a UAE-linked weapons shipment marked the most significant escalation between Riyadh and Abu Dhabi to date in a widening rift between the two Gulf powers.

Once ​the twin pillars of regional security, the two Gulf heavyweights have seen their interests diverge on ​everything from oil quotas to geopolitical influence.

Declaring its national security a red line, Saudi Arabia earlier on Tuesday alleged the UAE had pressured Yemen's southern separatists to conduct military operations that had reached the kingdom's borders .

It was Riyadh's strongest language yet in the falling-out between the neighbours, who once cooperated in a coalition against Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthis but whose interests in Yemen have steadily grown apart in recent years.

Frictions grew inside the coalition as Abu Dhabi backed southern separatists seeking self-rule while Riyadh kept supporting Yemen's internationally recognised government, eventually creating an open rift ‍between the Gulf allies.

On Tuesday the coalition struck what it said was a dock used to provide foreign military support to the UAE-backed separatists. The head of Yemen's Saudi-backed ​presidential council gave Emirati forces an ultimatum of 24 hours to leave.

The UAE said in a statement that it had been surprised by the airstrike, and that the shipment that had been attacked did not contain weapons and was ‌destined for Emirati forces.

Yemen's presidential council head, Rashad al-Alimi, cancelled a defence pact with the UAE, the Yemeni state news agency said, and accused the UAE in a televised speech of fuelling strife in ‍Yemen with its support for the separatist Southern Transitional Council.

"Unfortunately, it has been definitively confirmed that the United Arab Emirates pressured and directed the STC to undermine and rebel against the authority of the state through military escalation," he said.

The UAE earlier stressed that "dealing with recent developments must be done responsibly and in a way that prevents escalation, based on reliable facts and existing coordination between the concerned parties".

Major stock indexes in the Gulf fell. Saudi Arabia and the UAE are both major players in the OPEC+ oil exporters' group, and any disagreements between ‍the two could hamper consensus on oil output decisions.

They and six other OPEC+ members are meeting online on Sunday, and OPEC+ delegates say they will ‌continue their current policy for ​no change in first-quarter production.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 15:46:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/1284f68c-e590-11f0-962b-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/Yemen-new-1.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US issues sanctions related to Iran and Venezuela weapons trade</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/us-issues-sanctions-related-iran-venezuela-weapons-trade-2025-12-30/</link><description>Dec 30 (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury said on Tuesday it has added 10 individuals and entities based in Iran and Venezuela to its sanctions list, citing their aggressive weapons program.

"Urdaneta, on behalf of EANSA, has coordinated with members and representatives of the Venezuelan and Iranian armed forces on the production of UAVs in Venezuela," Treasury said in a statement.

"We will continue to take swift action to deprive those who enable Iran’s military-industrial complex access to the U.S. financial system," said John Hurley, the department's undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence.

The statement, published online by the British Foreign Office, said Israel should allow non-governmental organisations to work in Israel in a sustained and predictable way, and ensure the U.N. could continue its work in the Palestinian enclave.

"(We) express serious concerns about the renewed deterioration of the humanitarian situation in Gaza which remains catastrophic," read the statement from the foreign ministers of Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Iceland, Japan, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.

It also said Israel should lift what it called "unreasonable restrictions" on certain imports including medical and shelter equipment, and open border crossings to increase the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza.

Israel and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire in October after two years of intense Israeli bombardment and military operations in Gaza that followed a deadly attack by Hamas-led fighters on Israeli communities in October 2023.

A global hunger monitor said on December 19 that there was no longer famine in Gaza after access for humanitarian and commercial food deliveries improved following the ceasefire.

But humanitarian agencies say far more aid needs to get into the small, crowded territory and that Israel is blocking needed items from entering. Israel says more than enough food gets in and that the problems are with distribution within Gaza.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 16:29:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/J3TUJE2K6RNWXLBR67XGE6HVFE.jpg?auth=537314f481a89b38d0ea7a8684cdeefb5f43afdd3eefb3aa88ca70dd1351af35&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Turkey's Erdogan says Israeli decision to recognise Somaliland unacceptable, illegal</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/turkeys-erdogan-says-israeli-decision-recognise-somaliland-unacceptable-illegal-2025-12-30/</link><description>ANKARA, Dec 30 (Reuters) - Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said on Tuesday that Israel's decision to formally recognise of the self-declared Republic of Somaliland was an illegal and unacceptable step, adding that it was trying to drag the horn of Africa into destabilisation.

Nasralla finished second to conservative candidate Nasry Asfura, who was backed by U.S. President Donald Trump and was declared the winner on Christmas Eve, more than three weeks after the November 30 election.

Less than 1% of votes separated the two candidates, according to the CNE, Honduras' electoral authority.

Nasralla's legal team filed an appeal with Honduras' Electoral Justice Tribunal (TJE) on Monday, prompting the tribunal to issue a resolution late on Monday evening calling for additional documentation before it decides whether to admit the challenge.

"There have been too many inconsistencies in this electoral process," Nasralla's lawyer Karla Romero said on Monday night, asserting that in many departments of the country, votes for Asfura had been "inflated."

Nasralla's lawyers have not made evidence of fraud presented in the appeal publicly available.

Asfura's party has denied Nasralla's accusations of fraud.

Nasralla, a centrist who has unsuccessfully run for president twice before, is seeking a comprehensive review and recount of presidential ballots in at least 12 of Honduras' 18 departments.

The TJE has set a 48-hour deadline for the CNE to submit paperwork pertaining to the recount requests.

The challenge unfolds amid heightened political tension and public mistrust in the electoral process.

Nasralla, who also disputed his loss in the 2017 general election, rejected the CNE's declaration of Asfura's victory last week, saying the electoral authority had excluded ballots that should have been counted.

The head of the Honduran Congress, from the ruling Libre party, has also rejected the results. Libre supporters demonstrated outside the CNE headquarters in Tegucigalpa on Monday.

Asfura is due to take office on January 27 for the 2026-2030 term.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 17:22:08 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/44N6V3BKIVP6RI47F4XWMBSRZA.jpg?auth=573923b6834399a0cebb9b6ed1abf1bead6cb326789989f2e8f678954a6fc04f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Why China is bringing out the big guns for military drills around Taiwan</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20251230-why-china-is-bringing-out-the-big-guns-for-military-drills-around-taiwan</link><description>On the first day of a massive military exercise around the island of Taiwan on Monday, menacing, AI-generated scenes frame the narrative in a propaganda video released by China : An eagle transforms into an attack drone, fish become frigates and destroyers and wolves running through a forest turn into robot soldiers storming a ravaged city.

The clip, which was shared by the China Daily English-language newspaper and other platforms, presents a dehumanised, victimless vision of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, which Beijing considers part of its sovereign territory.

“I suppose the animals represent the natural, almost instinctive, nature of the military operation, while the machines and weapons symbolise the controlled and precise aspect of the invasion. The message is that this is not a political choice, but a natural, inevitable and bloodless process,” said Simona Grano, head of research on China-Taiwan relations at the University of Zurich’s Institute of Asian and Oriental Studies.

China ended the year with two days of war games, code-named "Justice Mission 2025" and involving a massive show of force with the deployment of frigates, destroyers, fighter jets, bombers, drones and missiles as well as heavy artillery.

They were accompanied by bellicose official statements, including a “stern warning” by the Chinese military to “separatist” and “external interference” forces that might be “plotting” Taiwan’s independence.

In one post on the Chinese social media site Weibo, the military's Eastern Theatre Command, which is responsible for the Taiwan Strait, thundered that, “All those plotting independence will be annihilated upon encountering the shield of justice!”

Watch more Chinese military releases footage of drills around Taiwan

On the second day of its most extensive war games to date, China fired rockets that fell into Taiwan’s contiguous zone, according to Taiwan’s defence ministry, referring to the waters off the democratically self-governed island.

“Justice Mission 2025” also featured live-fire exercises, which have not been conducted since April.

“These manoeuvres are all the more significant because they are a joint operation involving land, naval, air and rocket forces,” noted Jonathan Sullivan, a China specialist at the University of Nottingham. But overall, “the Chinese military is not demonstrating anything it has not demonstrated before”, he said.

Beijing has stepped up its military drills since the summer of 2022, when Nancy Pelosi , then speaker of the US House of Representatives, visited Taiwan, an act Beijing viewed as a provocation.

Since then, the Chinese military has been keen to demonstrate “its ability to quickly organise a complete air and sea blockade of the island in preparation for a [land] invasion”, explained Zeno Leoni, a specialist in Chinese security issues at King's College London.

Grano notes that over the past few years, “the Chinese armed forces are moving a little closer to Taiwan's territorial waters, which is in line with Beijing’s gradual strangulation tactic”.

Beyond the impressive military mobilisation, the latest exercises are significant because they come at a crucial moment for Chinese President Xi Jinping . “The geopolitical context has changed a lot since the last exercises nine months ago,” noted Grano.

“Relations between China and the United States, which were particularly poor in April due to the tariff war, improved slightly after the meeting between Xi Jinping and Donald Trump at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation ( APEC ) summit at the end of October,” Sullivan said.

The easing of ties after the Trump-Xi meeting didn’t last very long. Earlier this month, the Trump administration announced a huge arms sale worth around $11 billion to Taiwan, which includes advanced rocket-launchers, self-propelled howitzers and a variety of missiles. It was the second package of arms sales to Taipei since Trump returned to the White House in January.

The Chinese authorities “felt betrayed by Washington's approval of one of the largest arms sales to Taiwan last week”, Sullivan explained.

Beijing felt compelled to set the record straight and reiterate its determination to eventually integrate Taiwan into its territory.

For more US arms package to Taiwan seen as a 'move to use Taiwan to contain China'

The US was not the only major player to offend Chinese nationalist sensibilities in recent weeks. Beijing also took issue with Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi 's statement in November that any conflict in Taiwan would be a matter of national security for Japan .

“China perceived this statement as a threat of Japanese intervention on Taiwan's side in the event of a conflict, which it considers unacceptable,” said Leoni. “It is true that, given its proximity to the Japanese islands, the fate of this territory is important to Japan. But in the current context, Sanae Takaichi's statements may appear diplomatically clumsy,” he added.

For Beijing, the Japanese leader’s statement along with the US arms sales announcement was viewed as “external interferences”, representing “a setback for the Chinese diplomatic narrative, which insists on the internal nature of the Taiwan issue”, Grano explained.

But China’s latest show of force near Taiwanese ports is not just a signal to foreign powers tempted to strongly support Taipei. It is also a way of hitting Taiwan where it hurts.

“These military exercises are intended to further weaken [Taiwan’s] President Lai Ching-te , who is already under strong internal pressure from opposition parties,” said Grano.

“He faces impeachment proceedings next May. Opposing him, the Kuomintang party has been given a boost by public opinion, which is clearly wary of Lai Ching-te's hardline anti-China stance. This Beijing-friendly party also recently appointed a new chairwoman, Cheng Li-wun, who is more openly pro-China than her predecessor,” explained Sullivan.

“It's a message to the Taiwanese people saying, ‘Look what's in store for you if you continue to support someone like Lai Ching-te,’” said Grano.

Practically speaking, the Chinese army also needs to reassure itself and others. These exercises are the first major test for Yang Zhibin, who was appointed commander-in-chief of the Eastern Theatre Command in September. “It is one of the most sensitive and important positions in the Chinese army,” said Leoni.

His predecessor, Lin Xiangyang, was accused of corruption and dismissed from the army, while the political commissar for the Eastern Theatre Command, Liu Qingsong, has simply disappeared for several months. A large-scale military exercise “allows the Chinese public to see that the military command is strong and that the page has been turned on the scandals”, said Grano.

And this messaging is not just catering to domestic audiences. “The purges of military personnel have led to speculation in the West that Xi Jinping was losing control of his army,” Sullivan noted. Organising highly ambitious manoeuvres just two months after the arrival of a new commander-in-chief of the Eastern Theatre Command is Beijing's way of saying, ‘Move along, there's nothing to see here.’”

Three police officers were killed Monday during an operation against the group in Yalova, in northwestern Turkey .

Zelenskiy told the media in a WhatsApp chat that Kyiv was committed to continuing talks on how to end the war triggered by Russia's 2022 full-scale invasion and he was ready to meet Putin in any format.

U.S. President Donald Trump said on Sunday he and Zelenskiy were "maybe very close" to an agreement to end the war although "thorny" territorial issues lingered. He was more cautious than Zelenskiy on security guarantees, but said they were 95% of the way to such an agreement and that he expected European countries to "take over a big part" of that effort with U.S. backing.

On Tuesday, Russia said its negotiating stance would toughen after it accused Kyiv of attacking one of Putin's Russian presidential residences - an allegation that Kyiv said was baseless and intended to scuttle arduous peace talks.

Zelenskiy said in his WhatsApp chat that a U.S. troop presence in Ukraine would be a major security boost for Kyiv.

"Of course, we are discussing this with President Trump and with representatives of the (Western) coalition (supporting Kyiv). We want this. We would like this. This would be a strong position of the security guarantees," he said.

The White House had no comment on the issue of dispatching U.S. troops to Ukraine under any peace settlement with Russia.

Zelenskiy said he was willing to meet Putin despite the deep lack of mutual trust he underlined on Monday.

"I told President Trump, European leaders I am ready for any format of meeting with Putin. I am not afraid of any format ... The main thing is for Russians not to be afraid."

Russia said on Monday Kyiv had targeted a presidential residence in the Novgorod region with 91 long-range attack drones, all of which it said it had intercepted.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov described the alleged attack as "state terrorism" and said Moscow had already identified targets for retaliatory strikes in Ukraine.

The Kremlin provided no physical evidence of the alleged incident, saying it would retaliate and review its negotiating stance but would not quit talks on a possible peace deal.

Zelenskiy said earlier on Tuesday: "This alleged 'residence strike' story is a complete fabrication intended to justify additional attacks against Ukraine, including Kyiv, as well as Russia’s own refusal to take necessary steps to end the war. Typical Russian lies."

In Paris, a source close to French President Emmanuel Macron said there was no substance to corroborate Moscow's accusation of an attack on Putin’s residence.

"Ukraine and its partners are committed to a path of peace, while Russia has chosen to continue and intensify its war against Ukraine. This is in itself an act of defiance against President Trump's peace agenda," the source said.

The White House declined further comment on the reported attack on Putin's residence after Zelenskiy said he brought it up with Trump, who on Monday said he was informed of the matter by Putin and was angry about it. Asked if there was evidence of such an attack, Trump said, "We'll find out."

In Warsaw, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said on Tuesday peace could be achieved in Ukraine within weeks thanks to U.S. security guarantees although success remained "far from 100% certain".

Tusk also hinted at the possibility of U.S. troops being sent to the line of contact between Ukraine and Russia, but he gave no details of such a proposal and the White House did not immediately comment on his remarks.

Tusk, whose country is one of Kyiv's closest Western allies, underlined the need for movement on territorial issues. Russia had demanded Ukrainian forces withdraw from the last part of the Donbas area in eastern Ukraine that they still hold nearly four years after Russia's invasion. Kyiv wants fighting halted along current front lines.

Amid the intensifying peace diplomacy, Russia launched more waves of drones against port infrastructure and civilian ships in Ukraine's Odesa region on Tuesday, Ukrainian navy and government officials said.

Odesa and the wider region nearby are home to the Black Sea ports that are crucial for Ukraine's foreign trade and the survival of its wartime economy.

In the past several months, maritime warfare between Ukraine and Russia has intensified. Both sides have attacked naval and commercial assets in the Black Sea and beyond.

Ukraine is increasingly using its sea drones for attacks on ships connected to Russia’s sanctions-busting shadow fleet.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 18:32:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CYSOHZ7XKZPWNK3TUM77ZDUMJI.jpg?auth=41a3d03035d4c141280cc48ebb2b52a67f924bccc5e3af030ce6d74b5e2ee3f9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Thieves drill into German bank vault and make off with millions</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/thieves-drill-into-german-bank-vault-make-off-with-millions-2025-12-30/</link><description>BERLIN, Dec 30 (Reuters) - Thieves used the quiet Christmas period to drill their way into the vault of a German retail bank and make off with at least 10 million euros' worth of money and valuables from customers' deposit boxes, police said on Tuesday.

The perpetrators drilled through a thick concrete wall at a branch of Sparkasse bank in the western city of Gelsenkirchen and then broke into several thousand safe deposit boxes and stole a sum estimated in the double-digit millions of euros, the police said in a statement.

Most shops and banks close in Germany over the Christmas period starting from the evening of December 24, and police only discovered the hole after a fire alarm went off in the early hours of Monday, December 29.

Dozens of angry customers gathered in front of the bank on Tuesday loudly chanting "Let us in!".

"I couldn't sleep last night. We're getting no information," one man told the Welt broadcaster as he waited outside the branch, adding that he had been using the safe for 25 years and that it contained his savings for old age.

Another man said he used his deposit box to store cash and jewellery for his family.

A spokesperson for the Sparkasse bank in Gelsenkirchen did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Police said witnesses have reported that they saw several men on Saturday night carrying large bags in the stairwell of an adjacent parking garage.

There were also reports of a black Audi RS 6 leaving the garage early on Monday morning with masked men inside. The vehicle's licence plate was that of a car stolen in Hanover, more than 200 kilometres to the northeast of Gelsenkirchen, police said.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 18:32:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/FNHIFKWLSNOS5NM5MU4NXYTEFM.jpg?auth=931def1bf922e267777e1c57e72e6aca860e437a5bcf9f75e02a16530c760a8c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Mexico train derailment piles pressure on Sheinbaum over safety of megaprojects</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/mexico-train-derailment-piles-pressure-sheinbaum-over-safety-megaprojects-2025-12-30/</link><description>MEXICO CITY, Dec 30 (Reuters) - Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum deferred questions on Tuesday about the record of a passenger train that derailed over the weekend, killing 13 people and injuring 98 others, the latest in a series of accidents that have put pressure on her government to improve the safety of flagship projects.

The conductor of the train, who survived, has been taken in for questioning, and opposition lawmakers have called for an investigation.

"The prosecutor's office has already interviewed the operator and several other people - they will have to report what happens next," Sheinbaum said at her regular press conference on Tuesday.

The crash in the southern state of Oaxaca marks the third train accident this year in Mexico. The new tourist-focused Mayan Train in the Yucatan Peninsula has suffered two derailments. No one was killed in those accidents.

Mexico's military operates both the Mayan Train and the Interoceanic Train that derailed on Sunday, which has led some to question both its role and what the Sheinbaum government is doing to deliver safety on flagship infrastructure projects.

"The government should be very concerned with the safety record and go to great lengths to determine the cause of the derailment," said Gustavo Flores-Macias, dean of the University of Maryland School of Public Policy.

Survivors told local news outlets that Sunday's crash happened as the train rounded a curve. It occurred on the Interoceanic Railway of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, a narrow stretch of land connecting the Pacific Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico.

The railway forms part of a trade and transit project known as the Interoceanic Corridor, which was launched in 2023 by Sheinbaum's predecessor and mentor, former President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, with the aim of creating an alternative to the Panama Canal.

But the project has faced multiple allegations of corruption, weak oversight and potential conflicts of interest.

Mexico's federal audit office reported irregularities in four Interoceanic Train construction contracts, including overpayment for materials, in a 2020 report.

Following Sunday's crash, local media outlets also reported that companies linked to associates of Lopez Obrador's sons may have benefited from government contracts tied to major infrastructure projects, including the Interoceanic Train.

Lopez Obrador has denied the accusations, calling them politically motivated.

Opposition lawmakers called for an independent investigation into the accident. Alejandro Moreno, leader of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), urged the government to suspend all projects linked to the former president's sons and their business partners.

Senator Mario Vazquez of the opposition National Action Party (PAN) called the derailment "criminal negligence."

The accident risks denting confidence in Sheinbaum's broader infrastructure agenda, said Antonio Ocaranza, a Mexican political consultant.

"The discussion surrounding this accident could trigger a broader and more damaging conversation about other projects," Ocaranza said, highlighting the Mayan Train and the Olmeca refinery , both megaprojects with ballooning budgets.

"If these accidents become more frequent and the causes are deemed unreliable, there will be increased public scrutiny and a higher cost to the government," he said.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 18:32:44 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/MLPUUCUJFRM25KHBLMQNHLSAKM.jpg?auth=a67911477701fdd1172c819aced4cf706d55af68a5d4fba88a1205161dcf7032&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Brazil's Bolsonaro undergoes new procedure to treat hiccups</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/brazils-bolsonaro-undergoes-new-procedure-treat-hiccups-2025-12-30/</link><description>SAO PAULO, Dec 30 (Reuters) - Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro was undergoing an unscheduled procedure on Tuesday to treat persistent hiccups, his wife Michelle said on social media.

Monday's lawsuit , opens new tab marked the latest in a campaign by U.S. President Donald Trump's administration to challenge state laws that extend tuition and financial aid benefits to non-citizens living in their states regardless of their immigration status.

The lawsuit targets a Virginia law that has since 2022 allowed immigrants who entered the country unlawfully to access reduced, in-state tuition rates at public universities and colleges if they can establish they reside in the state.

Supporters of the measure, which was signed into law in 2021 by then-Governor Ralph Northam, a Democrat, argued it would remove financial barriers that had limited the ability of immigrant students in the state to pursue higher education like other Virginia residents.

The Justice Department argues the measure conflicts with federal immigration law in violation of the U.S. Constitution because it gives educational benefits to illegal immigrants that are denied to U.S. citizens from other states.

The lawsuit cites the federal Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, which restricts states' ability to grant immigrants in the country illegally certain postsecondary education benefits.

"This is a simple matter of federal law: in Virginia and nationwide, schools cannot provide benefits to illegal aliens that they do not provide to U.S. citizens," U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in a statement. "This Department of Justice will not tolerate American students being treated like second-class citizens in their own country."

The Justice Department filed the lawsuit in Richmond federal court days before Republican Governor Glenn Youngkin leaves office and hands control to Democrat Abigail Spanberger. His office did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.

At least 21 other states and the District of Columbia have similar "tuition equity" laws and policies that allow certain students who graduated from high schools in their states to pay in-state tuition regardless of their immigration status, according to the National Immigration Law Center.

According to the immigrant rights group, 14 states, including Virginia, also provide state financial aid to eligible students regardless of their immigration status.

Under Trump, the Justice Department has filed at least six lawsuits challenging similar policies in Texas, Kentucky, Illinois, Oklahoma, Minnesota and California.

Texas and Oklahoma, both led by Republican governors, quickly settled by agreeing to consent decrees blocking enforcement of their state laws.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 18:33:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CECJ53VF3FOLPAD36EQ2BS36C4.jpg?auth=ccbbf6a01a72c88cb50f4453d481a6397e2ae6949aaaa95e24f715e33dd3f9ad&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Yemen strike shows depth of distrust between Saudi Arabia and UAE</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/yemen-strike-shows-depth-distrust-between-saudi-arabia-uae-2025-12-30/</link><description>DUBAI, Dec 30 (Reuters) - The withdrawal of Emirati forces from Yemen following a Saudi airstrike may help defuse a confrontation between the UAE and Saudi Arabia, but the incident has exposed simmering distrust between two Gulf oil powers with long-running differences.

The airstrike by a Saudi-led coalition early on Tuesday on the southern Yemeni port of Mukalla was followed by calls on all UAE forces to leave Yemen, and a statement from Riyadh that its national security was a red line.

The UAE said it was surprised by the strike, shortly before announcing that it was pulling its remaining forces from Yemen for their safety.

The crisis, precipitated by the surprise advance of UAE-backed separatists through southern Yemen in early December, brings to the surface years of divisions between the two Gulf heavyweights on everything from oil quotas to geopolitical influence.

A Gulf source familiar with Saudi thinking told Reuters that the escalation had been triggered by a misperception resulting from talks in Washington in November between Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and U.S. President Donald Trump about the war in Sudan.

High-level talks including phone calls between Saudi Arabia and the UAE had taken place since December though they had not yet yielded results on the ground, the source said.

Any further conflagration between Saudi Arabia and the UAE would bode ill for the financially powerful Gulf, which prides itself on being an island of stability in a turbulent Middle East. Disagreements between Saudi Arabia and the UAE could hamper consensus on oil output decisions. The two are preparing for a virtual meeting with other OPEC+ members on Sunday.

"Relations between the two states are never easy, but the friction does appear to be at its most intense for years," said Neil Quilliam, associate fellow at think tank Chatham House.

Following their sudden advance in early December, the UAE-backed Southern Transitional Council (STC) forces now hold large swathes of land in Yemen, including in the strategically important Hadramout province.

The STC had previously been an important part of the coalition fighting alongside the Saudi-backed, internationally-recognized government against the Iran-aligned Houthi movement, which holds Yemen's capital Sanaa and the heavily populated northwest.

Their sweep through the south brought the STC within reach of Yemen's border with Saudi Arabia, in an area to which many prominent Saudis trace their origins, lending it cultural and historical significance for them.

It also put Saudi Arabia and the UAE on opposing sides of a smouldering civil war that erupted in Yemen in 2014.

Both Saudi Arabia and the UAE have publicly said they are in talks with Yemeni groups to try and bring the situation under control, but the coalition has now carried out airstrikes in the province twice in the last few days.

The STC has been rejecting calls by the Saudi coalition for its forces to withdraw from the areas it seized, saying it will continue securing Hadramout and Mahra province to its east.

In a statement on the strike in Mukalla, the UAE said it had tried to de-escalate since the STC's advance and denied being behind any operations that would undermine Saudi security or target its borders.

"Both countries like to play down friction in the relationship and argue that competition amongst states is a normal state of affairs," said Quilliam. "But the intensity of the competition has certainly sharpened in the past year and is playing out in multiple theatres."

One such place is Sudan, a country engulfed in civil war and one of the world's worst humanitarian crises since April 2023.

The Quad, which groups Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the U.S. and the UAE, has led diplomacy on the conflict, but the war has raged on.

Sudan is a sensitive issue for the UAE. U.N. experts and members of the U.S. Congress have accused the country of sponsoring Sudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), who are fighting the Sudanese army. The UAE denies backing either side.

Trump and the Saudi Crown Prince discussed Sudan at the November meeting in Washington.

The Gulf source said the UAE leadership was angered as they had been "misinformed" that during the November meeting the Saudi Crown Prince had not just asked for further sanctions against the RSF, but also for more direct sanctions against the UAE for its alleged support to the group.

The misperception led to the escalation in Yemen, the source said.

The UAE foreign ministry did not confirm or deny this account and referred Reuters to an earlier statement issued on Friday in which the UAE had welcomed Saudi Arabia's efforts to support security and stability in Yemen and said it also remained committed to backing stability in the country.

Anwar Gargash, diplomatic advisor to the UAE president, said on Saturday in a post on X that dialogue and political solutions that preserve friendships and alliances were essential in what he called a "critical stage". He did not clearly reference Yemen or Saudi Arabia in his remarks.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment when asked about the issue.

The Gulf has witnessed instability in the past.

In 2017, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Bahrain, Oman and Egypt choked off Qatar's economy with a boycott, accusing it of backing terrorists, a charge Doha denied.

The latest flare-up appears unlikely to spur a repeat of the Qatar crisis.

"We do have differences over Yemen 100%, and the difference has gone to a higher level with current escalation," said Abdulkhaleq Abdullah, an Emirati academic.

"Allies clash ... But they mend their differences and build on what they have in common."</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 19:17:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/37CKWWVHZBOFPF5VX7GUF4SIEM.jpg?auth=f7889bd00b17bf6a03761c06ea2a974f89edb5add0113916b36c965b8dda8677&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Oil tankers still arriving in Venezuela despite US blockade, data shows</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/oil-tankers-still-arriving-venezuela-despite-us-blockade-data-shows-2025-12-30/</link><description>Dec 30 (Reuters) - At least two oil tankers have made their way to Venezuela in recent days and others are navigating towards the country, a sign of state-run PDVSA's effort to expand floating storage and keep selling crude even as a U.S. blockade has reduced exports to a minimum.

U.S. President Donald Trump this month announced a blockade of all sanctioned vessels going in or out of Venezuelan waters as part of a strategy to pressure Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. The U.S. move has cut oil exports this month to about half of their November level.

The U.S. has seized two fully loaded cargoes of Venezuelan oil and its ships are patrolling the Caribbean Sea. The pressure has scared many vessel owners, prompting re-routings and u-turns. Only a fraction of ships have kept on course to the OPEC country.

Some tanker owners have insisted. At least two ships under sanctions have arrived in Venezuela over the last few days and two more that are not under sanctions are approaching its coast, according to monitoring service TankerTrackers.com.

As part of swaps and arrangements made since the country was first placed under U.S. energy sanctions in 2019, Maduro's administration pays for a long list of purchases and services with oil, including debt service to China.

The two vessels approaching Venezuela are part of a fleet used by China and Venezuela to pay debt service with crude bound for Chinese ports. It was unclear whether China will press for a U.S. waiver to secure delivery of those cargoes.

PDVSA did not reply to a request for comment. Venezuela's oil ministry and Maduro have said oil exports will continue.

PDVSA has been negotiating price discounts and contract changes with customers this month to avoid cargo returns or crude production cut-backs. But many buyers are growing impatient as there are no real alternatives to get oil cargoes out of the country, even in non-sanctioned tankers, company sources said.

A cyberattack forced PDVSA to shut down its centralized administrative system this month. The company is now delivering cargoes at its ports at a slower pace, both to fulfill loading windows for export and to store crude and fuel in ships, expanding its storage capacity.

The only loaded vessels departing are Chevron's tankers, which continue setting sail for the U.S. under Washington's authorization, and small ships carrying oil byproducts and petrochemicals, shipping data and PDVSA documents showed.

A similar situation in 2020, when Washington ramped up pressure on Maduro by imposing sanctions on PDVSA's main trading partners, forced the country to switch to little-known intermediaries to keep selling its oil to Chinese buyers.

Those U.S. measures triggered oil output cuts, oilfield shutdowns and severe scarcity of motor fuel. It took Venezuela years to reach 1 million barrels per day (bpd) of output again, recover some refining capacity and stabilize exports.

As of this week, almost two dozen tankers were visible from shore near the Jose port waiting for loading windows or for departure instructions. The volume of oil stuck in undeparted tankers increased to some 16 million barrels, from 11 million barrels in mid-December, according to the data and documents.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 19:17:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/L4THJSUB6FKTTBTJME3URXEE3U.jpg?auth=a7bb3d87f6ad4126d219cc50b274ef4207b6a175f442fedaf79ff55eab3da616&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US NATO envoy casts doubt on Russian claim that Ukraine attacked Putin’s residence</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/us-nato-envoy-casts-doubt-russian-claim-that-ukraine-attacked-putins-residence-2025-12-30/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Dec 30 (Reuters) - U.S. ambassador to NATO Matthew Whitaker cast doubt on Tuesday on Russia’s accusation that Ukraine attacked President Vladimir Putin’s residence, saying he wants to see U.S. intelligence on the incident.

"It is unclear whether it actually happened," Whitaker told Fox Business "Varney &amp; Co." in an interview about an alleged incident which Ukraine has denied.

"It seems to me a little indelicate to be this close at a peace deal, Ukraine really wanting to get a peace deal done, and then to do something that would be viewed as reckless or not helpful," he said.

Russia said on Monday that Ukraine had attacked a presidential residence in the Novgorod region with 91 long-range attack drones. It said it would retaliate and that its negotiating stance would toughen in the talks.

Ukraine called Russia's accusations "lies" aimed at justifying more attacks on Ukraine, and its foreign minister said on Tuesday that Russia had not provided any evidence "because there's none."

U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday that Putin told him in a phone call that Ukraine tried to attack the residence. Trump said he was "very angry" about it. Asked if there was evidence of such an attack, Trump said, "We'll find out."

The White House declined further comment on the alleged incident, while officials from the U.S. intelligence community have been close-lipped about the incident. The CIA declined to comment.

"We're going to get to the bottom of the intelligence. And for me, the most important thing is what the United States and our allies' intelligence services say about whether or not this attack actually happened," Whitaker said.

After a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Florida on Sunday, Trump said he and Zelenskiy were "maybe very close" to an agreement to end the war although the most contentious territorial issues lingered.

Zelenskiy said earlier on Tuesday : "This alleged 'residence strike' story is a complete fabrication intended to justify additional attacks against Ukraine, including Kyiv, as well as Russia’s own refusal to take necessary steps to end the war. Typical Russian lies."

Russia, which invaded Ukraine in February 2022, controls just under a fifth of its neighbour's territory and says its troops are advancing.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 19:38:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HAGI4TWH55OCHKSG4CWNCYAXQA.jpg?auth=57c8de43fe3cb11262a28e95c4319e9f627dc057ad2462d2456b70dd01010c79&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Court allows Trump-backed cuts to Planned Parenthood's Medicaid funding in 22 states</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/court-allows-trump-backed-cuts-planned-parenthoods-medicaid-funding-22-states-2025-12-30/</link><description>BOSTON, Dec 30 (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Tuesday allowed President Donald Trump's administration to enforce in a collection of Democratic-led states a provision of his signature tax and domestic policy bill that deprives Planned Parenthood health centers of Medicaid funding if they perform abortions.

A three-judge panel of the Boston-based 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals at the administration's request put on hold , opens new tab an injunction issued by a lower-court judge who barred the law from being enforced in 22 states and the District of Columbia.

It marked the latest instance of the appeals court lifting an order by U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani preventing the law from being implemented, after the 1st Circuit on December 12 overturned a ruling she issued in another case brought by Planned Parenthood declaring the law unconstitutional.

A provision in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, passed by the Republican-led Congress, bars Medicaid funding for tax-exempt organizations that provide family planning and reproductive health services if they perform abortions and received more than $800,000 in Medicaid funds during the 2023 fiscal year.

Planned Parenthood says the law was passed with it in mind and is already having devastating effects, resulting in at least 20 of its health centers closing since Trump signed the measure into law in July.

After the 1st Circuit earlier this year paused Talwani's initial injunction in Planned Parenthood's favor, a group of Democratic state attorneys general asked her to block the law's enforcement again but on different grounds.

The judge, who was appointed by Democratic President Barack Obama, agreed to do so on December 2 , saying the states were likely to succeed in establishing that the law constitutes an unconstitutional retroactive condition on their participation in the Medicaid healthcare program.

But Tuesday's 1st Circuit panel, comprised only of judges appointed by Democratic presidents, said the Trump administration had demonstrated it was likely to prevail on the merits when its appeal is ultimately heard.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 22:21:27 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/TBJACYTI5BL5XEPY5ZGCFPXBJQ.jpg?auth=883bda5d4dbea185bac2804f20f2edeb1cac5556e56978f87b2d46abce2fdead&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Germany's Merz tells Europe to assert itself to safeguard peace, prosperity</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/germanys-merz-tells-europe-assert-itself-safeguard-peace-prosperity-2025-12-30/</link><description>BERLIN, Dec 31 (Reuters) - Europe must assert its interests more strongly to ensure peace and prosperity in 2026 amid challenges from Russian aggression, global protectionism and changing ties with the U.S., German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said in his annual address.

Since taking office in May, Merz has helped spearhead European efforts to support Ukraine against Russia's invasion. Berlin has also ramped up defence spending since 2023 in a bid to show it is ready to assume more responsibility.

In his New Year's speech, Merz pulled no punches, saying the "terrible" war raging on Europe's doorstep posed a direct threat to continental freedom and security.

"We are seeing more and more clearly that Russia’s aggression was and is part of a plan targeted against the whole of Europe," said Merz, adding that Germany faced sabotage, espionage and cyberattacks on a daily basis.

He said a further challenge came from protectionism in the global economy, and that Europe's dependence on imported raw materials was increasingly being wielded as a political lever against it.

Struggling to revive its export-oriented economy , Germany is trying to reduce reliance on China as it also grapples with global trade tensions and the effects of U.S. President Donald Trump 's trade tariff policies.

Europe's biggest economy has also been hit by what many economists say has been a lack of domestic reform and investment in recent years, and is expected to grow only modestly this year after two years of contraction.

Merz also addressed a more difficult partnership with the United States, long the reliable guarantor of German and European security, since Trump returned to the White House in January 2025.

"For us Europeans, this means that we must defend and assert our interests much more strongly by ourselves," said Merz.

However, he said Europe must be guided by confidence, not fear, and must take matters into its own hands.

"This can be a decisive year for our country and for Europe. It can be a year in which Germany and Europe, with new strength, reconnect with decades of peace, freedom and prosperity."</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 23:20:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BWQBPRB7WZKUJE6GUTOFZXASCU.jpg?auth=be98dcf0a7c92b5b3418ad2e086b6a52b8f94ce2459da49933d3ea9c52024155&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Guinea coup leader Doumbouya wins presidential election, results show</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/guinea-coup-leader-doumbouya-wins-presidential-election-provisional-results-show-2025-12-30/</link><description>CONAKRY, Dec 30 (Reuters) - Guinea coup leader Mamady Doumbouya has been elected president, according to provisional results announced on Tuesday, completing the return to civilian rule in the bauxite- and iron ore-rich West African nation.

The former special forces commander , thought to be in his early 40s, seized power in 2021, toppling then-President Alpha Conde, who had been in office since 2010. It was one in a series of nine coups that have reshaped politics in West and Central Africa since 2020.

The provisional results announced on Tuesday showed Doumbouya winning 86.72% of the December 28 vote, an absolute majority that allows him to avoid a runoff.

The Supreme Court has eight days to validate the results in the event of any challenge.

Doumbouya's victory, which gives him a seven-year mandate, was widely expected. Conde and Cellou Dalein Diallo, Guinea's longtime opposition leader, are in exile, which left Doumbouya to face a fragmented field of eight challengers .

The original post-coup charter in Guinea barred junta members from running in elections, but a constitution dropping those restrictions was passed in a September referendum.

Djenabou Toure, the country's top election official who announced the results on Tuesday night, said turnout was 80,95%. However voter participation appeared tepid in the capital Conakry, and opposition politicians rejected a similarly high turnout figure for the September referendum.

Guinea holds the world's largest bauxite reserves and the richest untapped iron ore deposit at Simandou, officially launched last month after years of delay.

Doumbouya has claimed credit for pushing the project forward and ensuring Guinea benefits from its output.

His government this year also revoked the licence of Emirates Global Aluminium's subsidiary Guinea Alumina Corporation following a refinery dispute, transferring the unit's assets to a state-owned firm.

The turn toward resource nationalism - echoed in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger - has boosted his popularity, as has his relative youth in a country where the median age is about 19.

Political debate has been muted under Doumbouya. Civil society groups accuse his government of banning protests, curbing press freedom and restricting opposition activity.

The campaign period was "severely restricted, marked by intimidation of opposition actors, apparently politically motivated enforced disappearances, and constraints on media freedom," U.N. rights chief Volker Turk said last week.

On Monday, opposition candidate Faya Lansana Millimono told a press conference the election was marred by "systematic fraudulent practices" and that observers were prevented from monitoring the voting and counting processes.

The government did not respond to a request for comment.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 23:40:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/73B43QSNTNJSTP3WAUASZ5YNYE.jpg?auth=b730cc1cbdef69831b2dc9802ba055fab4d732c7141c0b1fc4a5916571625b94&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Syria arrests suspects in Latakia after sectarian violence, curfew imposed</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20251230-syria-arrests-latakia-sectarian-violence-curfew-imposed</link><description>Authorities in Syria ’s Latakia province arrested 21 people allegedly linked to former president Bashar al-Assad ’s rule on Tuesday, state media said, as a curfew blanketed the provincial capital following sectarian violence the previous night.

Monday’s attacks in predominantly Alawite neighbourhoods of Latakia city came after three people, including a member of the security forces, were killed a day earlier, as thousands protested in the minority community’s coastal heartland over a deadly mosque bombing .

State television said security forces in coastal Latakia province arrested 21 “former regime remnants who are involved in criminal acts , sectarian incitement and targeting internal security forces”.

The report followed the imposition of an overnight curfew until 6:00 am (0300 GMT) on Wednesday in Latakia, a mixed city in Syria’s Alawite coastal heartland that also includes several Sunni -majority neighbourhoods.

AFP correspondents saw residents cleaning up on Tuesday after the previous night’s attacks, during which cars were damaged and shops vandalised.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said a young Alawite man was shot dead during the unrest “after being chased” by several men.

Syrian authorities said on Monday that security forces had reinforced their deployment in Latakia.

Interior ministry spokesman Noureddine al-Baba said on Tuesday that Syria rejected “any acts of sabotage or attacks that affect the dignity of citizens or their property”, adding that the necessary legal measures would be taken against those responsible.

Since the ousting of Assad, himself an Alawite, in December last year, the minority group has been the target of repeated attacks.

A bombing at a mosque in a predominantly Alawite area of the central Syrian city of Homs on Friday killed eight people.

The Saraya Ansar al-Sunna Islamist militant group, which analysts say acts as a front for Islamic State (IS) jihadists, claimed responsibility for the attack.

Emergency crews were dispatched to repair the damage, the operational headquarters of the Krasnodar region said on the Telegram messaging app. The port's berth had been damaged, it added.

SHOT, a Telegram news channel with sources in Russia's security services, said a series of explosions was heard over Tuapse late on Tuesday and that residents in one district reported a fire.

Several Ukrainian media, including the RBC-Ukraine media outlet, posted photos on Telegram appearing to show a large fire burning in the distance at night, with a communications mast silhouetted in the foreground.

There was no immediate official comment from Ukraine about the attack. Reuters could not independently verify the report or the extent of the damage.

Tuapse is one of Russia’s key Black Sea outlets for oil products, anchored by Rosneft’s (ROSN.MM) , opens new tab export-oriented Tuapse refinery, which has capacity to process about 240,000 barrels per day and supplies products such as naphtha, fuel oil and diesel.

The port and the refinery have been hit repeatedly by Ukrainian drone attacks during the war that Russia launched nearly four years ago, with past strikes reported to have sparked fires and at times disrupted operations.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 01:45:02 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US government audits cases of Somali US citizens for potential denaturalization</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-government-audits-cases-somali-us-citizens-potential-denaturalization-2025-12-31/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Dec 30 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's administration said on Tuesday it was auditing immigration cases involving U.S. citizens of Somali origin to detect fraud that could lead to denaturalization, or revocation of citizenship.

"Under U.S. law, if an individual procures citizenship on a fraudulent basis, that is grounds for denaturalization," Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that was first reported by Fox News and reposted by the White House on social media.
Denaturalization cases are rare and can take years. According to the Immigrant Legal Resource Center, about 11 cases were pursued per year between 1990 and 2017.

Since taking office in January, Trump, a Republican, has pursued a hardline immigration policy , opens new tab involving an aggressive deportation drive, revocations of visas and green cards , and screening of social media posts and past speeches of immigrants.

Human rights groups widely condemn Trump's policies, saying they curb rights like due process and free speech. Trump and his allies say the policies aim to improve domestic security.

Federal officials in recent weeks have portrayed Minnesota's Somali community as a hotspot for fraud involving millions of federal dollars intended for social services. Immigrant-rights advocates say the administration is using the fraud investigations as an excuse to target Somali immigrants more broadly.

FBI Director Kash Patel said on Sunday the bureau has "surged" investigative resources and personnel to Minnesota in the latest instance of the Trump administration's fraud investigations that have targeted the state's Somali immigrants.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services separately said on Tuesday it has frozen all child care payments to Minnesota. It said that going forward all payments from the department's Administration for Children and Families nationwide "will require a justification and a receipt or photo evidence before we send money to a state."

In response, Minnesota's Democratic Governor Tim Walz said his state government has "spent years cracking down on fraudsters" and that Trump was "politicizing the issue to defund programs that help Minnesotans."</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 01:45:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/JXQ3ZA2UJZPXVLYDCQFMO47H2Q.jpg?auth=c5d259f2c3df010d40e4f97e347ca2c14c49c235b67462124e598f28e8531a69&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Head-on train crash near Peru's Machu Picchu kills driver, injures dozens</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/head-on-train-crash-near-perus-machu-picchu-kills-driver-injures-dozens-2025-12-30/</link><description>LIMA, Dec 30 (Reuters) - A train driver was killed and 40 more people were injured on Tuesday after two trains collided head-on on the railway leading to the Inca citadel of Machu Picchu, the Andean nation's top tourist site that draws well over 1 million visitors each year.

Police are investigating the collision between trains operated by Inca Rail S.A. and PeruRail S.A., which mainly transport tourists to the iconic site. A health official said about 20 people were in relatively serious condition.

A police officer added that foreign tourists were among the injured.

"China's military exercises around Taiwan this week increase cross-strait tensions and the risk of escalation," a foreign office spokesperson said in a statement.

"We consider the Taiwan issue one to be settled peacefully by the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait through constructive dialogue, without the threat or use of force or coercion. We do not support any unilateral attempts to change the status quo or any activity that risks destabilising it."

"We continue to call for restraint and the avoidance of any further actions that risk undermining peace and stability."

Russia's air defence units destroyed a total of 27 Ukrainian drones in the three-hour period starting at 8 p.m. (1700 GMT), including three over the Moscow region, the Russian defence ministry said on the Telegram messaging app.

Andrei Vorobyov, governor of the Moscow region, said on Telegram that 21 Ukrainian drones were downed during the day over the region. One civilian person was injured as a result of the attack.

The reported attacks came a day after Russia accused Ukraine, without providing evidence, of trying to attack President Vladimir Putin’s residence .

Kyiv dismissed the allegations as baseless and aimed at derailing peace talks in the war that Russia launched against Ukraine nearly four years ago.

There were no immediate reports of damage from the strikes. Russia rarely discloses the full extent of damage from Ukrainian attacks unless civilians or civilian infrastructure are affected.

Separately, a power outage hit a town outside Moscow after a technical fault at a regional power facility, RIA reported, citing power authorities.

The SHOT Telegram news channel, which has sources among Russia's security services, said about 100,000 residents were affected.

There was no immediate evidence the outage was linked to Ukraine.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 01:45:22 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukraine targets Moscow with drones, Russia says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-targets-moscow-with-drones-russia-says-2025-12-30/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 01:45:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Guinea coup leader Doumbouya elected president in provisional results</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/africa/20251231-guinea-coup-leader-doumbouya-elected-president</link><description>Guinea coup leader Mamady Doumbouya has been elected president, according to provisional results announced on Tuesday, completing the return to civilian rule in the bauxite- and iron ore-rich West African nation.

The former special forces commander, thought to be in his early 40s, seized power in 2021, toppling then president Alpha Conde, who had been in office since 2010. It was one in a series of nine coups that have reshaped politics in West and Central Africa since 2020.

Provisional results announced on Tuesday showed Doumbouya winning 86.72% of the December 28 vote, an absolute majority that allows him to avoid a runoff.

The Supreme Court has eight days to validate the results in the event of any challenge.

Doumbouya’s victory, which gives him a seven-year mandate, was widely expected. Conde and Cellou Dalein Diallo , Guinea’s longtime opposition leader, are in exile, leaving Doumbouya to face a fragmented field of eight challengers.

Guinea’s original post-coup charter barred junta members from running in elections , but a new constitution dropping those restrictions was passed in a September referendum.

Djenabou Toure, the country’s top election official who announced the results on Tuesday night, said turnout was 80.95%. However, voter participation appeared tepid in the capital, Conakry, and opposition politicians rejected similarly high turnout figures reported for the September referendum.

Guinea holds the world’s largest bauxite reserves and the richest untapped iron ore deposit at Simandou, officially launched last month after years of delay.

Doumbouya has claimed credit for pushing the project forward and ensuring Guinea benefits from its output.

His government also revoked the licence of Emirates Global Aluminium’s subsidiary, Guinea Alumina Corporation, this year following a refinery dispute, transferring the unit’s assets to a state-owned firm.

The turn towards resource nationalism — echoed in Mali , Burkina Faso and Niger — has boosted his popularity, as has his relative youth in a country where the median age is about 19.

Political debate has been muted under Doumbouya. Civil society groups accuse his government of banning protests , curbing press freedom and restricting opposition activity.

The campaign period was “severely restricted, marked by intimidation of opposition actors, apparently politically motivated enforced disappearances, and constraints on media freedom,” UN rights chief Volker Turk said last week.

On Monday, opposition candidate Faya Lansana Millimono told a press conference the election was marred by “systematic fraudulent practices” and that observers were prevented from monitoring the voting and counting processes.

The government did not respond to a request for comment.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 01:46:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/460e279e-e518-11f0-b3f1-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25362497163705.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Congo president Sassou Nguesso to seek re-election in March 2026</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/africa/20251230-congo-president-sassou-nguesso-seeks-re-election-2026</link><description>Congo ’s President Denis Sassou Nguesso will stand for re-election in March next year, his party said on Tuesday after choosing the 82-year-old for the contest, an AFP journalist reported.

Sassou Nguesso led the small, oil-rich country under a one-party system from 1979 to 1992, before Pascal Lissouba defeated him in the country’s first democratic election . He returned to power in 1997 after a civil war that ousted Lissouba and has ruled ever since.

The Congolese Labour Party (PCT) said it had endorsed Sassou Nguesso as its candidate following a three-day congress, according to congress rapporteur Antoinette Kebi.

“The president is being elevated to the rank of the ‘very great comrade’ of the party,” Kebi said.

More than 3,000 people attended the PCT conference, although the president himself was not present.

The election is due to take place on March 22, 2026. Members of the military will vote five days earlier so that soldiers can maintain public order on polling day — a measure used in previous elections.

After winning elections in 2002 and 2009, Sassou Nguesso secured further terms in 2016 and 2021 following a constitutional change in 2015 that removed the original age limit of 70 and increased the number of five-year terms to three.

In April 2023, three opposition parties joined forces to form the “Alliance for Democratic Change in 2026”, aiming to overhaul the country’s electoral oversight bodies.

The alliance brings together the Rally for Democracy and Development (RDD), founded by former Marxist-Leninist president Jacques Joachim Yhombi-Opango, the Republicans’ Movement (MR) and the People’s Party (PAPE).</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 01:46:16 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/191997e0-e5d7-11f0-b64f-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25267812730611.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>MH370 search resumes in Indian Ocean nearly 12 years after plane's disappearance</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20251230-mh370-search-resumes-in-indian-ocean-years-after-plane-disappearance</link><description>Nearly 12 years after Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 vanished with 239 people on board, the search for answers to one of aviation ’s most haunting riddles resumed on Tuesday in the remote southern Indian Ocean.

Armed with cutting-edge deep-sea robots and refined data analysis, US investigators are scouring the seabed for clues that have eluded governments, experts and grieving families for more than a decade.

MH370 took off from Kuala Lumpur just after midnight on March 8, 2014, bound for Beijing on what should have been an uneventful six-hour flight.

Less than an hour later, its transponder went dark, wiping the Boeing 777 from civilian radar. Military screens later showed the aircraft veering sharply west, crossing back over Malaysia before heading south over the vast Indian Ocean .

What followed was the most ambitious and costly search in aviation history, as multinational teams combed more than 46,000 square miles (120,000 square kilometres) of seabed off Western Australia with ships, aircraft and sonar.

They found nothing.

The hunt was called off in 2017, leaving families with heartbreak and a mystery that spawned theories ranging from hijacking to deliberate pilot action.

Now, the Malaysian government has given the green light for a fresh attempt led by Texas-based marine robotics firm Ocean Infinity under a “no find, no fee” contract, according to a statement from Malaysia’s transport ministry.

“The latest development underscores the government of Malaysia’s commitment in providing closure to the families affected by this tragedy,” it said.

The company will pocket $70 million only if it locates the wreck, reports said.

This new phase, expected to last up to 55 days, targets a tighter search zone of about 5,800 square miles — far smaller than earlier efforts and pinpointed using updated satellite data, drift modelling and expert analysis.

Ocean Infinity is deploying autonomous underwater vehicles that can dive nearly 19,700 feet (6,000 metres) and remain submerged for days at a time.

The drones use high-resolution side-scan sonar, ultrasound imaging and magnetometers to map the seabed in 3D, detect buried debris and pick up traces of metal. If something promising appears, remotely operated vehicles can descend for close inspection.

Ocean Infinity, which also has a control centre in Britain, led an unsuccessful hunt in 2018 before agreeing to launch a new search this year. AFP contacted the company for comment, but there was no immediate response.

Only fragments of MH370 have ever been recovered. Since 2015, fewer than 30 pieces believed to be from the aircraft — including parts of the wing, landing gear and fuselage — have washed ashore thousands of kilometres apart, from Réunion to Mozambique .

No bodies have ever been found.

Malaysia’s official probe concluded in 2018 that the plane was likely deliberately diverted from its course, but stopped short of assigning responsibility.

Relatives from China, Australia, Europe and beyond have fought for years to keep the hunt alive, arguing that closure matters not only for the dead but for global aviation safety.

Governments in Beijing and Canberra have welcomed Malaysia’s decision, pledging support for any practical effort to crack the case.

Chinese national Jiang Hui, who lost his 72-year-old mother Jiang Cuiyun in the disaster, told AFP earlier this month that he remains determined to find answers, despite frustration with the authorities.

“Finding the plane, finding my loved one, and finding the truth — I believe this is something I must do in my life,” he said.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 01:46:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/fa9c533e-e572-11f0-9695-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/capture-6077310146953b7e3bc5a47-37745953.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Taiwan stays on high alert as Chinese ships pull back after massive drills</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/taiwan-stays-high-alert-chinese-ships-pull-back-after-massive-drills-2025-12-31/</link><description>TAIPEI, Dec 31 (Reuters) - Taiwan stayed on high alert on Wednesday after China staged massive military drills around the island the previous day, keeping its emergency maritime response centre running, the head of the island's coast guard said.

The exercises named "Justice Mission 2025" saw China fire dozens of rockets towards Taiwan and deploy a large number of warships and aircraft near the island, in a show of force that drew concern from Western allies including the European Commission and Britain .

Taipei condemned the drills as a threat to regional security and a blatant provocation.

Chinese ships were moving away from Taiwan but Beijing had yet to formally declare the end of the exercises, according to Kuan Bi-ling, head of Taiwan's Ocean Affairs Council.

"The maritime situation has calmed down, with ships and vessels gradually departing. As China has not announced the conclusion of the military exercises, the emergency response centre remains operational," she said in a post on Facebook late on Tuesday.

A Taiwan coast guard official told Reuters all 11 Chinese coast guard ships had left waters near Taiwan and were continuing to move away. A Taiwan security official said emergency response centres for the military and coast guard stayed active.

Taiwan's defence ministry on Wednesday said 77 Chinese military aircraft and 25 navy and coast guard vessels had been operating around the island in the past 24 hours.

Among them, 35 military planes had crossed the Taiwan Strait median line that separates the two sides, it added.

The drills, China's most extensive war games by coverage area to date, forced Taiwan to cancel dozens of domestic flights and dispatch jets and warships to monitor. Soldiers were seen running rapid-response drills including putting up barricades at various locations.

China's state news agency Xinhua published an article summarising "three key takeaways" from the drills, which began 11 days after the United States announced a record $11.1 billion arms package for Taiwan.

The simulated "encirclement" demonstrated the People's Liberation Army's ability to "press and contain separatist forces while denying access to external interference – an approach summarised as 'sealing internally and blocking externally'," the article said, citing Zhang Chi, a professor at the PLA National Defence University.

China claims democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory and has not ruled out using force to take it under Chinese control.

"A woman's IQ is zero when in love," it states on its second page. "As long as the emotions are in place, the client's money will naturally follow."

A second handbook, seized during another law enforcement operation in the country and reviewed by Reuters, gives tips in English and Chinese about how to conduct romance scams.

Together, they provide a window into the psychological techniques criminal gangs use to beguile a victim into believing they are in a romantic relationship, before duping them into fraudulent investments.

This kind of fraud is known as "pig-butchering" because the gangs say targets are led like hapless pigs to slaughter. It is among the most prevalent scams today, according to the FBI.

In a series of stories this year, Reuters documented how these "pig-butchering" scams are often carried out by victims of human trafficking , opens new tab , who are forced to work in industrial-scale scam compounds in Southeast Asia run by Chinese-led gangs. Such cyberfraud has been supercharged by artificial intelligence , opens new tab , which allows scammers to deploy sophisticated tools to make their fraudulent appeals for money more deceptive, the series revealed.

The two manuals, the contents of which Reuters is reporting exclusively, show that gangs have developed detailed guidance for creating fake personas to lure their targets, as well as strategies to handle a victim if they suspect a ruse.

The authenticity of both handbooks was confirmed by a spokesperson for the Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Commission in the Philippines, who said they were recovered from two compounds raided last year in the north of the capital, Manila.

The Chinese manual outlines a seven-day plan to defraud women in China by convincing them to invest in crude oil via a fake platform. It refers to targets as "clients" and the theft as a "sale."

The bilingual handbook targets men. It does not explicitly say how money will be extracted from victims, but suggests the fraudster discuss cryptocurrency with the target.

The first handbook, which is nine pages long, was found in a compound built on land partially owned by a Chinese-born woman named Alice Guo, the PAOCC said.

Authorities also found mobile phones allegedly used for pig-butchering fraud, as well as several hundred people "involved in scams" at the compound. Many of them were trafficking victims, PAOCC said.

Guo is serving a life sentence after being convicted in November of human trafficking. Her lawyer did not respond to questions about the manual and the activities carried out in the compound.

Reuters could not establish if either manual was ever used in a scam. However, the methods they outline are consistent with those described to the news agency by two former workers in scamming compounds. One of the workers, who operated out of Myanmar, said he had used a similar manual to carry out a "pig-butchering" scam.

Such scripts were found in at least two other police raids conducted in 2023 and 2024 in the Philippines and Thailand, according to a 2024 report by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, which shares expertise with national law enforcement agencies.

Two experts who reviewed the Chinese-language manual at Reuters' request said it demonstrated complex manipulation techniques. These include isolating and overwhelming with affection a prospective target, who then becomes hooked on the conversations.

The first step of a "pig-butchering" scam involves creating a fake identity.

An elaborate facade can open the door to an emotional connection with a prospective victim, the Chinese manual says on its first page.

Martina Dove, a U.S.-based psychologist who studies scams and reviewed that manual for Reuters, said her research found that romance scammers often impersonated authority figures when targeting female victims, and then used control against them.

That can translate into a scammer pretending to be a skilled professional like a doctor or lawyer, or a senior uniformed figure like a general, she said.

Britain's Barclays Bank has found that men are slightly more likely than women to fall victim to love scams, though women on average lose more than twice as much money. Its conclusion was based on a review of an unspecified number of scams perpetrated on its customers between January 2023 and May 2024.

The fake persona is grounded in foundational details that the Chinese manual recommends remain constant.

Birthday : Taurus Zodiac is recommended as it is considered most compatible with other signs.

Hometown : Match it to the regional accent of the scammer.

Family : Pretend to have been divorced for six years, with a daughter who lives with the ex-wife.

Job : Say you have a managerial position at Chinese state oil company Sinopec but are currently stationed outside the country.

Sinopec did not return a request for comment about whether it was aware of being identified in any scam manuals or if it had received any complaints.

The Chinese-language playbook suggests altering some details to create common ground with the prospective target.

Age: The scammer should pretend to be one or two years older than the victim.

His mother should live near the target, but not so close that they may have overlapping communities.

The final layer brings the fake persona to life. The Chinese manual prompts the scammer to go beyond basic biographical information. Specifics sell the story, it says.

Examples of suggested hobbies and interests in the handbook include swimming, climbing, cooking, reading and traveling.

Lifestyle details that should be memorized include owning a three-bedroom residence and an upmarket sedan.

Once all the details are in place, the scammer is ready to reach out to a target.

The first day's instructions contain a word-for-word script.

"Hello! My name is XXX, nice to meet you!"

The scammer asks questions to gauge whether the target has been previously defrauded and to assess their interest in investments.

Then it's time for the first phone call, which is an opportunity to start building the relationship by sharing "emotional experiences", the manual says.

The Chinese handbook instructs its reader to adapt their approach to the target's personality.

It states: "Middle‑aged women are, in fact, the group carrying the heaviest burden. Husbands often don't listen patiently, and children are too young to understand the intricacies and difficulties within. So, if you want to build a relationship with middle-aged women, chat with them about the trivial matters in life!"

It shows how scammers probe for circumstances – divorce, or an interest in making money quickly – that may make the target more approachable, said Dove.

"Everybody's vulnerable. You just need to meet the right scam at the right time."

There are many paths the scammer could take to grow the connection.

The handbook untangles the possible routes by sorting victims into distinct personalities.

The path forward with a victim who is:

Cold-hearted: The target has a personality that tends to keep others at a distance.

The scammer responds by teasing to push the victim to drop her aloof facade.

Undermine them slightly and then sweet-talk them afterward.

Career-oriented: Independent and satisfied with how far they've come.

Scammer aims to reflect a glowing attitude towards life. Radiates positivity and competence to appear reliable.

Conservative: The victim presents as having more traditional values.

Scammer pushes an alternative path of excitement. Gives the victim an escape from the daily norm.

The way forward can be plotted based on a victim’s upbringing:

Pampered: Spoiled by parents. Intermittent attention teases the victim into seeking out connection.

Rough: Insecure, lacks confidence. Scammer gives clear and structured directions. Scammer also provides daily encouragement and guidance that the victim may have lacked growing up.

Romantic experience

A lot: Mature and independent. Mirrors victim's actions to avoid seeming needy. Lets the victim come to them.

Very little: Fantasize about future relationship. Uses flirty language and compliments the victim daily to draw them in.

For every personality type, the end goal is the same.

Bring the victim closer to the scammer to grow the relationship, the Chinese manual says.

A key part of the con as described in both manuals involves mimicking the target's interests and language, while showering them with attention.

The script in the Chinese manual instructs its reader to send "daily greetings" to show care, and "make the client fall in love" with the persona.

Give the target small tasks to do, so that they begin to take instructions, the manual says.

The bilingual manual has similar prompts:

"How are you this afternoon?"

"Remember to eat on time when you are busy at work."

"I've always loved playing basketball. I’ve always been a Lakers fan but since Kobe left, I've been afraid to watch Lakers games."

Beth Hyland, who was targeted by a love scam in late 2023, said some of the techniques in the manuals, which were shared with her by a reporter, echoed the tactics she fell victim to.

Reuters couldn't independently ascertain if the individual she was scammed by was familiar with either handbook.

The then-52-year-old was online dating for the first time after a divorce when she met "Richard" on Tinder.

A Tinder spokesperson told Reuters it has a zero-tolerance policy for fraud and is "constantly monitoring our platform to detect and remove any suspicious profiles". The spokesperson added that the company uses AI tools to help warn users of potential scams.

Hyland said "Richard" described himself as a French construction project manager and drew her in with compliments and chats about spirituality.

"He knew how to move fast without suffocating me, without coming on too strong," said Hyland.

Within weeks, they were engaged.

Speed is key: the Chinese handbook is intended to enable a scam in as little as seven days. The two former workers in scam compounds told Reuters that they also worked off scripts for seven-day scams.

By the second day, the scammer should be talking about his interest in investments, that manual says. By Day 5, he should try to establish a romantic relationship. And by the seventh, he should have introduced a fake investment platform for the target to put money into.

The bilingual handbook similarly emphasizes that the scammer should quickly enmesh themselves in the target's life.

The reader should drop a target by the end of the third day if the victim is slow to respond, says the 13-page manual, whose title was partially obscured by a waterstain.

"... In short, don't chat awkwardly. Our mission is to share life and work happily with customers."

That manual, which instructs the scammer to pose as a woman, references contacting male targets at certain times of the day in Brazil.

Brazilian Federal Police declined to comment when asked if they were aware of an instruction manual being used to conduct scams on its citizens, citing ongoing investigations.

A lawyer for Cassandra Ong, the registered representative of the compound where the bilingual handbook was found, said he was not aware of the manual's existence. Ong, who is a fugitive from charges of human trafficking, denies the allegations, he said.

The Chinese manual features answers to common questions that may be raised by wary targets, including "why do you like me?"

The answer: “Because I feel good chatting with you, I really cherish this connection.”

Q: Why can't I withdraw the money?

A: Because the platform has a "detection mechanism," frequent withdrawals might attract the attention of customer service.

So, darling, you must listen to me and follow my lead. When the time comes, we'll withdraw the money together.

Q: Why is the account frozen?

A: Why don't you listen to me? Didn't I tell you whether to withdraw or not? Your random operations led to the account being frozen. Quickly contact customer service to see how to resolve it.

The schemes sometimes involve multiple scammers talking to the same target according to the bilingual manual and interviews with the two former scam workers.

That manual directs the scammer to hand over to a senior Chinese worker when the victim starts talking about their finances. The document does not state what role the Chinese national plays, but one of the scam workers said a team leader often took over when a victim was about to transfer funds. He did not specify why.

After about six weeks of conversation, "Richard" duped Hyland into sending him $26,000 via cryptocurrency to pay an emergency travel fee.

As she was on the verge of sending another $50,000 for what she was told was an activation fee to unlock millions of dollars in funds, her financial advisor warned her she was in the depths of a "classic romance fraud".

Once the fraudster moves to extract money, the facade they have built inevitably collapses.

Sometimes the wake-up call comes in the form of a fraud alert from the bank or a warning from a financial advisor.

Sometimes it does not come as a dramatic revelation but a slow and painful recognition, said Rebecca Cole, a social worker and academic specializing in online victimization and romance scams.

"I just remember my heart dropping," Hyland said. "I couldn't wrap my head around it."

Hyland never got her $26,000 back. And to date, she does not know what "Richard’s" real identity was.

Many victims find themselves trapped in a cycle of shame. Some are isolated by their families, said Monica Whitty, a professor at Monash University in Australia who researches cybercrime.

Meanwhile, the scammer moves on.

"Remember not to hang yourself on one tree," the Chinese manual advises its reader, urging them to constantly send messages and look for new targets.

Even as one victim reels from the theft, the scammer leaves a light on for new connections.

The pilot issued multiple radio challenges to the CRV Tan Suo Er Hao seeking to confirm whether it was conducting marine research without Manila's consent, which would violate Philippine and international law, but received no response, the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) said in a statement.

The 87.25‑metre deep‑sea research vessel, which left China's Hainan province earlier this month and entered the western part of the Philippine Exclusive Economic Zone, was then monitored heading east about 55.8 nautical miles off Santa Ana, Cagayan, the PCG said.

Cagayan, the northernmost province of Luzon near Taiwan, hosts one of nine military bases accessible to U.S. forces under the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA).

On Tuesday, China staged war games around Taiwan, firing rockets into surrounding waters and simulating strikes and blockades in drills dubbed “Justice Mission 2025,” launched days after Washington announced a record $11.1 billion arms package for Taipei.

The PCG said the Chinese research vessel was detected through Canada's satellite-based Dark Vessel Detection system.

She was shocked by what she found.

Her student debt had been double-counted, making it look as though she owed a quarter of a million dollars and putting home ownership out of reach. Jones disputed the items with Experian, one of the major credit reporting agencies, multiple times in writing and over the phone, but got nowhere.

"They kept saying it's been verified, it's been verified…They never investigated. They never tried to remove it," Jones said in an interview.

Eventually, Jones complained to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a federal watchdog created by Congress in 2010 to protect consumers in their financial dealings, helping her lawyers show a judge the lengths she'd gone to mitigate damage to her credit, according to her attorneys, legal papers and a copy of the complaint. That paper trail eventually helped Jones successfully sue Experian to correct her record.

Jones closed on a house purchase in the Memphis suburb of Millington for $300,000 in January.

"If I didn't have this agency to go to, I don't think I'd be in the house right now," said Jones. "It actually changed my life."

Experian and the CFPB did not respond to a request for comment on Jones' case.

In interviews, consumers who had fallen on hard times or known difficulty, lawyers who work with the poor and credit counselors told Reuters the CFPB had been a lifeline for people facing hardship and they feared that, without it, many consumers would be left unprotected from financial predators.

Conceived by Senator Elizabeth Warren to police the type of lending that fueled the 2008 financial crisis, the CFPB has long been a target of conservatives and industry. Congress created the agency as part of post-crash reforms in 2010 as the sole federal body primarily charged with protecting consumers' rights in the financial marketplace.

The CFPB now faces extinction under President Donald Trump's second administration, which says the agency is a political weapon for Democrats and a burden on free enterprise.

Speaking to reporters at the White House in February, Trump said it was "very important to get rid of the agency," claiming, without spelling out evidence, that Warren had "used that as her little personal agency to go around and destroy people."

In an interview, Warren dismissed the criticism as a sign the CFPB was doing its job. "This is not about vendettas. This is about enforcing the law as it is written, so that billionaires and billionaire corporations don't cheat American families. I think that's a pretty good thing," she said.

White House Budget Director Russell Vought, a staunch CFPB critic and the agency's acting head, told "The Charlie Kirk Show" podcast in October he plans to shutter the CFPB. The administration is fighting in court to fire up to 90% of its workers, while planning to move pending investigations and litigation to the Justice Department.

The agency says it is due to run out of money in early 2026 and Vought says he cannot legally seek more until the Federal Reserve returns to what the administration deems "profitability ," a position a federal judge flatly rejected on Tuesday , finding it without legal merit. Congressional Republicans also slashed the CFPB's maximum allowable funding in July.

Together, the administration, congressional Republicans and industry-backed lawsuits have undone a decade's worth of CFPB rules on matters ranging from medical debt and student loans to credit card late fees , overdraft charges and mortgage lending.

The agency has also dropped or paused its probes and enforcement actions , and stopped supervising the consumer finance industries, leading to a string of resignations .

The CFPB and the White House did not respond to requests for comment.

Warren said that as a law professor studying bankruptcy she saw that consumer protections were weak and fragmented, and that America needed a single federal agency dedicated to protecting consumers from unfair, deceptive and abusive practices.

"I was stunned by the number of people in financial trouble who had lost a job or got sick but who had also been cheated by one or more of their creditors," she told Reuters. "For no agency was consumer protection a first priority, it was somewhere between fifth and tenth, which meant there was just no cop on the beat. If the CFPB is not there, people have nowhere to turn when they get cheated."

Republicans said the agency was redundant, with federal bank watchdogs, like the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and state regulators already looking out for consumers, and that its funding and leadership structure were unconstitutional. Like other banking regulators, the CFPB's funding is not set annually by Congress and does not come directly from taxpayers. Rather, the agency draws on the Federal Reserve and its director was until recently protected from removal at will by the president.

Republicans accused the CFPB's first director Richard Cordray, a Democrat, of using those powers to crush small banks and businesses via overzealous enforcement and complex regulations, and of overstepping the agency's legal authority by trying to regulate companies Congress had exempted from its oversight, such as auto dealerships.

Conservative and industry groups tried several times to curb its powers or extinguish it altogether via the courts. In 2020 the Supreme Court handed the president the power to fire the director, which he has since used . Critics on the political right accused former director Rohit Chopra, a Democrat, of exceeding his authority, flouting the federal rule-making process, and harming consumers with an ill-conceived crackdown on financial firm fees.

Thomas Hoenig, who served as vice chair of the FDIC from 2012 to 2018, said he was skeptical of some of the CFPB's work under prior administrations, but that it still served an important purpose.

"If you take them out of the picture altogether, you're going to get more abuse, not less," he said. "I'm disappointed to see the CFPB just go away."

For some, though, the agency has been a lifeline. Millions of Americans like Jones who are struggling with credit reporting errors, predatory lenders, debt collectors, fraud, discrimination or other challenges, are now filing complaints every year with the agency, which prompts companies to fix the issues, sometimes by paying the complainants, or explain themselves.

When companies repeatedly break the rules, the CFPB punishes them and tries to make their customers whole. To date, it has returned $21 billion to consumers, according to CFPB data.

Morgan Smith, a 31-year-old single mother and social services worker in Issaquah, Washington, turned to those resources when she realized she had been a victim of identity theft.

After her wallet and ID were stolen from her car, she learned that someone had opened up a string of accounts in her name, she said: a rental car that ended up in a crash, an unpaid storage unit and a hotel room at an amusement park. Reuters was unable to confirm Smith's account independently.

"I went straight to the CFPB and I was navigated there to their consumer education tab where I was able to find out how to deal with fraud and scams. It gave me all the information I needed to know...my rights," she said.

"That was very important for me to have this resource."

Without the CFPB, borrowers would once again rely on a hodgepodge of federal, state and other local agencies which lack the CFPB's resources, expertise and legal powers , say consumer groups.

"Prior to the CFPB coming around, we'd have to say, 'write your attorney general, write to the FTC,' whoever it was, and it became this sort of letter-writing campaign," said Sam Hohman, who runs the Nebraska nonprofit Credit Advisors Foundation, which helps people get out of debt and offers consumer education services.

As a result, people like Virginia resident Michael Johnson, 49, may have fewer options in future when they fall into trouble.

After a kidney transplant and leg amputation several years ago left Johnson unable to work, he racked up credit card debt paying for basic expenses, he said. This summer he received court summonses from creditors seeking to collect on that old debt, according to court records.

"I got in over my head unintentionally," Johnson said in an interview.

Using a CFPB database of credit card , opens new tab terms and conditions, Johnson learned that his creditors were required to use arbitration rather than sue in court, which could cost more than the underlying debts. Johnson represented himself in court and says so far one creditor has dropped its complaint while the other is considering its options.

"It adds credibility to your defense that you understand your rights," Johnson said. "Life happens to everybody."</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 04:23:42 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/UDQ2E7LFF5OCJAWUBM76QUIU2M.jpg?auth=e91e7546fce2797bb96fc8767291be6e19a218814a09e4d2fbf491b256b78033&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Thailand frees 18 Cambodian soldiers as ceasefire holds</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/thailand-frees-18-cambodian-soldiers-ceasefire-holds-2025-12-31/</link><description>BANGKOK/PHNOM PENH, Dec 31 (Reuters) - Thailand on Wednesday released 18 Cambodian soldiers it had detained since July under the renewed ceasefire the two countries agreed on the weekend to end a border conflict, Cambodian and Thai authorities said.

The Southeast Asian neighbours agreed on a ceasefire that took effect at noon (0500 GMT) on Saturday, halting 20 days of fighting that killed at least 101 people and displaced more than half a million on both sides, and included fighter-jet sorties, exchanges of rocket fire and artillery barrages.

The soldiers were due to be returned on Tuesday, but Thailand delayed the process over alleged breaches of the ceasefire deal, which Cambodia denied.

Cambodian Defence Ministry spokesperson Maly Socheata said the soldiers were handed over at a border checkpoint at 10 a.m. (0300 GMT) on Wednesday after 155 days in Thai custody.

Thailand's Foreign Ministry said the soldiers had been treated "in accordance with international humanitarian law and principles" during their time in detention.

The border clashes reignited early this month, following the breakdown in a ceasefire deal that U.S. President Donald Trump and Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim helped broker to halt a previous round of conflict in July.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 04:24:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ZOLLUO4ZSNIW5CC2CGKUTVI5KE.jpg?auth=ceab230d5706c839677594d0f120dd855ac930907ccc06bff354728d0a4f322a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Four injured, including three children in Russian attack on Odesa, Ukraine says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/four-injured-including-three-children-russian-attack-odesa-ukraine-says-2025-12-31/</link><description>Dec 31 (Reuters) - Russia launched an overnight drone attack on Ukraine’s Odesa region, damaging residential buildings and infrastructure and injuring four people, including three children, regional authorities said on Wednesday.

Odesa, a major Black Sea port, has been repeatedly targeted by Russian missiles and drones during nearly four years of war , with strikes frequently hitting energy, transport and port infrastructure as well as residential areas.

"Strike drones attacked residential, logistics and energy infrastructure in our region," Oleh Kiper, governor of the Odesa region, said on the Telegram messaging app.

In Odesa city, which is the administrative centre of the broader Odesa region, four people were injured, including a seven-month-old infant, two other children, and a 42-year-old man, Serhiy Lisak, the head of Odesa's military administration, said on Telegram.

He said that drone debris and direct hits damaged facades and windows of several high-rise apartment buildings.

Lisak posted images showing smoke billowing from a multi-storey apartment building at night, with flames visible in several windows and what appears to be a firefighter’s water jet aimed at the facade.

Reuters could not independently verify the reports. There was no immediate comment from Russia about the attacks on Odesa.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 04:24:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Malaysia activists renew reform calls after ex-PM Najib jailed for 1MDB scandal</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/malaysia-activists-renew-reform-calls-after-ex-pm-najib-jailed-1mdb-scandal-2025-12-31/</link><description>KUALA LUMPUR, Dec 31 (Reuters) - Anti-graft activists in Malaysia have renewed calls for sweeping reforms to tackle corruption and prevent a repeat of 1MDB, after former Prime Minister Najib Razak was convicted last week over the $4.5 billion scandal at the state fund.

Najib, 72, already serving a six-year jail sentence for graft in an earlier case linked to 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), was found guilty on December 26 of abuse of power and money laundering in the biggest trial he faced over the fund he co-founded while in office.

The High Court sentenced him to an additional 15 years in prison and a record fine of nearly $3 billion. Najib, who has been in prison since 2022, is appealing the ruling. He denies wrongdoing.

While civil society groups welcomed the verdict, many said it raised fresh questions over the independence of Malaysia's institutions and exposed deep structural problems that have not been addressed since the 1MDB scandal was exposed more than a decade ago.

Transparency International Malaysia President Raymon Ram said the verdict represented a chance for the government to implement long-promised institutional reforms.

These include plans to separate the attorney-general's role as the government's top legal adviser and function as public prosecutor, which has often led to conflicts of interest in politically sensitive cases, he said.

"If parliament and the government deliver on core reforms in 2026, Malaysians can begin to believe that integrity is no longer episodic, but embedded. If not, the risk is clear, accountability will remain selective, reforms will stagnate, and public trust will continue to erode," he said.

Malaysia scored 50 out of 100 in the Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) in 2024, ranking 57th out of 180 countries, with the score stagnating in the last decade.

The CPI results indicate that while reform language has improved, perceptions of accountability and integrity have not shifted decisively, Ram said.

The court verdict has stoked tensions within Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim's ruling alliance over the treatment of Najib, who remains a popular figure within some factions in his party, the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO). UMNO has long campaigned against Anwar, but joined his coalition to form a government after the 2022 elections resulted in a hung parliament.

Anwar, who came to power on an anti-graft platform, has also faced a backlash over the slow pace of reforms with some critics accusing him of betraying allies after prosecutors dropped some graft charges against Najib and key UMNO figures.

Anwar said on Tuesday the government was working hard to address governance issues and eliminate graft, though he acknowledged the challenge of stamping out systemic corruption.

"There are still remnants who are trapped in the framework and patterns of the old corrupt culture," he told a press conference, without going into detail.

He rejected accusations of biased prosecutions, highlighting recent anti-graft investigations into senior government officials, including his own political secretary and the country's army chief .

Malaysia's Centre to Combat Corruption and Cronyism (C4), however, said the case of 1MDB highlighted persistent risks, with the prime minister empowered to appoint key officials, including the attorney-general, its anti-corruption agency chief, and the heads of government-linked companies.

C4 founder Cynthia Gabriel urged the government to pass a proposed law regulating political financing, and raised concerns over Anwar's continued alliance with UMNO, ahead of regional polls due in coming months and a national election that must be held by early 2028.

"As the next general election looms... the government is hard-pressed to regain the confidence of its voters and the big question remains of UMNO's future with the current coalition," Gabriel said.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 04:24:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/YDEE56EZ2VNVDIA67FI4GSVZJE.jpg?auth=b88b85f20fe5a3c6de365bdd4f971aa25d97b8814f3deb004d6cae455c0f02dd&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia's Gerasimov says Putin ordered buffer zone expansion in Ukraine's Sumy, Kharkiv in 2026</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russias-gerasimov-says-putin-ordered-buffer-zone-expansion-ukraines-sumy-kharkiv-2025-12-31/</link><description>Dec 31 (Reuters) - Russian Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov said Russian forces were advancing into Ukrainian defences and that President Vladimir Putin ordered expansion of a buffer zone in Ukraine's Sumy and Kharkiv in 2026, Russian news agencies reported on Wednesday.

The election is the first since a 2021 coup and is taking place during a civil war . Analysts expect the military-aligned Union Solidarity and Development Party, led by retired generals, to be returned to power.

The United Nations, some Western countries and human rights groups have said the vote is not free, fair or credible, given that anti-junta political parties are out of the running and it is illegal to criticise the polls.

Zaw Min Tun, a junta spokesperson, told state media that more than six million people, or 52.13% of enrolled voters, had voted on Sunday across 102 townships.

"Even in developed democratic nations, there are situations where voter turnout does not exceed 50%," Zaw Min Tun said, saying the turnout was a "source of pride".

Turnout was about 70% in Myanmar's 2020 and 2015 general elections, according to the U.S.-based nonprofit International Foundation for Electoral Systems.

Further rounds of voting will be held on January 11 and January 25 , covering 265 of Myanmar's 330 townships, although the junta does not have complete control of all those areas.

The junta's legal framework for the election has no minimum voter turnout requirement, said the Asian Network for Free Elections poll monitoring group.

This is likely to extend the final release of the documents to much later than expected after a December 19 deadline set by Congress, the document said.

The White House and the Justice Department did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.

The Trump administration ordered the Justice Department to release the files tied to criminal probes of Jeffrey Epstein, the late financier and convicted sex offender, who was friends with U.S. President Donald Trump in the 1990s, in compliance with a transparency law passed by Congress last month.

Collectively, the Criminal Division, the National Security Division, the FBI and the US Attorney's office in Manhattan are providing 400 attorneys to review the files, the document said, a more precise, and potentially much larger, figure than previous estimates from the department.

The review will occur between January 5-23, the document added.

Department leaders are offering telework options and time off awards as incentives for volunteers, the document said, adding that lawyers who assist will be expected to devote three to five hours a day to review about 1,000 documents a day.

The DOJ said last week it had uncovered more than a million additional documents potentially linked to Epstein.

So far, the disclosures have been heavily redacted, frustrating some Republicans and doing little to quell a scandal that threatens the party ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.

The law, approved by Congress with broad bipartisan support, requires all Epstein-related files to be made public, despite Trump’s months-long effort to keep them sealed. Under the statute, all documents were to be released by December 19, with redactions to protect victims.

Trump knew Epstein socially in the 1990s and early 2000s. He has said their association ended in the mid-2000s and that he was never aware of the financier's sexual abuse.

Epstein was convicted in Florida in 2008 of procuring a person under the age of 18 for prostitution. The Justice Department charged him with sex trafficking in 2019. Epstein was found dead in 2019 in a New York jail and his death was ruled a suicide.

In a message shared on X last week, the Justice Department said , opens new tab , "We have lawyers working around the clock to review and make the legally required redactions to protect victims, and we will release the documents as soon as possible.

The detention of Sarah Bireete, head of a rights organisation and a frequent anti-government commentator on local TV and radio, was confirmed by police in a post on social media platform X on Tuesday.

"She is in police custody. She will be arraigned before court in due course," the post said, without specifying when she would appear in court or what charges she faces.

Bireete, a lawyer and executive director of the Centre for Constitutional Governance (CCG), has been critical of a range of government actions including what the opposition says are illegal detentions and torture of its supporters.

The CCG could not be immediately reached for comment.

The January election pits incumbent Museveni, 81, who has been in power since 1986, against pop-star-turned-politician Bobi Wine.

Wine, 43, and his National Unity Platform party say hundreds of their members have been detained this year including during the campaigns in a move meant to intimidate his supporters and sap party morale.

Last month, U.N. Human Rights Chief Volker Türk also decried what he described as an "intensifying crackdown" on the opposition in Uganda and said at least 550 NUP supporters had been detained this year.

Another major opposition figure , Kizza Besigye, remains in prison more than a year after he was detained on treason charges.

Wine himself was beaten by security forces as he campaigned in the country's north and while police promised to probe the alleged beating, no report has been produced.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 06:36:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Live: At least four wounded in Russian drone strikes on Odesa, including three children</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20251231-live-at-least-four-wounded-in-russian-drone-strikes-on-odesa-including-three-children</link><description>Russia’s ​top general said its forces were pressing forward in northeastern ⁠Ukraine and President Vladimir Putin had ordered expansion of territory Moscow calls a buffer zone there in 2026, Russian news agencies.

Chief of the General Staff Valery ‍Gerasimov said Putin ordered expansion in 2026 of the buffer zone in Ukraine’s regions ​of Sumy and Kharkiv near the Russian border, ​RIA said, adding that he inspected the “North” troop grouping.

The grouping, formed in early 2024, has operated in northeastern Ukraine, seeking to create a buffer along the border and trying to push back Ukrainian forces there for further advances.

Putin has repeatedly portrayed the buffer zone ‍as a way to push Ukrainian forces and weapons farther from Russia’s border, citing cross-border shelling and drone attacks on regions such as Belgorod and Kursk.

Kyiv has rejected Moscow’s buffer zone calling it an idea Russia is using to justify deeper incursions into ‍Ukrainian territory.

Russia launched an ⁠overnight drone attack on Ukraine’s Odesa region, damaging residential buildings and infrastructure and wounding four people, including three children, regional ​authorities said.

Odesa, a major ‍Black Sea port, has been repeatedly targeted by Russian missiles and ​drones during nearly four years of war, with strikes ​frequently hitting energy, transport and port infrastructure as well as residential areas.

"Strike drones attacked residential, logistics and energy infrastructure in our region," Oleh Kiper, governor of the Odesa region, said on the Telegram messaging app.

In Odesa city, which ‍is the administrative centre of the broader Odesa region, four people ​were injured, including a seven-month-old infant, two other children, and a 42-year-old man, Serhiy Lisak, the head of ‌Odesa's military administration, said on Telegram.

He said that drone debris and direct hits damaged ‍facades and windows of several high-rise apartment buildings.

A Ukrainian drone attack wounded two people and sparked a fire that ⁠was quickly extinguished at the Tuapse oil refinery, the operational headquarters of Russia's Krasnodar region said.

The strike damaged refinery equipment, one port berth ​and five homes – windows were broken in four apartment blocks and ‍a private house – the Krasnodar operational headquarters said on the Telegram messaging app.

Tuapse in the Krasnodar region ​lies in southwest Russia on the Black Sea and about 350km to the nearest parts of Ukraine’s mainland across the Sea of Azov.

The refinery blaze was put out after burning about 300 square metres, it said, but the authorities did not provide details on the extent of the damage to the oil refinery's equipment or whether operations were halted.

Tuapse is one of Russia's ‍key Black Sea outlets for oil products, anchored by Rosneft’s export-oriented Tuapse refinery, which has capacity to ​process about 240,000 barrels of crude oil per day and supplies products such as naphtha, fuel oil and diesel.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 06:38:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/0daf5ff0-e5fc-11f0-9303-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25357373740395-1.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>From science to sport: These are the stories that lifted spirits in 2025</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20251231-from-science-to-sport-these-are-the-stories-that-lifted-spirits-in-2025</link><description>Welcome to 2026! As the new year begins, FRANCE 24 takes a final look back at the stories that lifted spirits in recent months. From scientific breakthroughs to signs of hope for the planet, there was enough to end 2025 on a high note.

Scientists had awaited the moment since the 1950s. In July, NASA released the closest images ever taken of the Sun, captured by the Parker Solar Probe.

In the black-and-white images, untrained eyes may see wisps resembling smoke. Experts, however, identify overlapping plasma eruptions and solar wind captured in unprecedented detail, providing valuable data to better understand space weather and the workings of the star.

There was also cause for optimism in the medical field. In January, a team of US researchers made a major breakthrough on multiple sclerosis, demonstrating a link between the autoimmune disease – which affects more than 2.8 million people worldwide – and the Epstein-Barr virus.

The discovery raised hope that vaccination against the virus could one day eliminate one of the disease’s triggers.

Another positive development concerned HIV prevention. Generic versions of injectable lenacapavir, a preventive treatment against the virus that causes AIDS , are expected to become available at a lower cost in around 100 countries from 2027.

The development is expected to greatly expand access to a treatment considered far more practical than a daily pill, particularly in low-income countries.

"Tobacco is taboo, we’ll beat it", said a French slogan that might just become reality. Last year, the number of smokers in the country declined , especially among young people, according to the French public health agency Santé publique France .

Specialists attributed the trend to anti-smoking policies implemented since 2014.

In 2025, the campaign intensified further , with smoking banned on beaches, in parks and in public gardens. The government’s stated aim is to achieve a tobacco-free generation by 2032.

It was a strong year for marine life. In June, world leaders met to reinforce the protection of the oceans.

Measures discussed included safeguarding the high seas, strengthening efforts against illegal fishing and expanding marine protected areas.

One commitment has already been fulfilled. After decades of negotiations, states (finally) ratified a treaty on protecting the high seas, providing tools to preserve ocean areas beyond national jurisdiction.

The Iberian lynx, recognisable by its pointed ears and spotted coat, recorded a significant recovery. After narrowly avoiding extinction, the species was removed this year from the "endangered" category on the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List of Threatened Species.

This year, there were 2,021 Iberian lynxes worldwide, a significant jump from just 94 recorded in 2001.

The green sea turtle also showed signs of recovery. Long hunted for its eggs and shell, it is no longer classified as endangered, highlighting the effectiveness of conservation measures when properly enforced.

Reproductive rights in Europe also advanced in 2025. On December 17, the European Parliament adopted a resolution urging EU institutions to facilitate access to safe abortions across the bloc.

The move followed a petition signed by more than one million EU citizens. It called for a mechanism enabling people living in countries without access to safe and legal abortion to travel at reduced cost to another EU member state where the procedure is permitted.

The European Commission said it would review the petition before March 2026.

After a century and the Paris Olympic Games , a long-held ambition became reality. This summer, thousands of people swam in specially designed areas of the River Seine in the heart of the French capital.

FRANCE 24's journalists also took part in the experience.

Few observers expected it. Curacao, a Caribbean island with 156,000 inhabitants and an autonomous state within the Kingdom of the Netherlands, qualified for the 2026 Football World Cup .

Another unexpected qualifier was Haiti . One of the world’s poorest countries and plagued by gang violence, Haiti also secured a place at the tournament, marking only the second international competition in its history.

Egypt inaugurated the Grand Egyptian Museum in November, marking a major moment for history enthusiasts.

The museum, dedicated to the Pharaonic civilisation, houses colossal statues, sarcophagi, tools and jewellery. Nearly 100,000 artefacts are displayed across more than 50,000 square metres of exhibition space.

It was the masterpiece no one saw coming. "Clair Obscur: Expedition 33", the debut title from French studio Sandfall Interactive, won multiple awards at the Game Awards ceremony.

It marked a first for a French game and a notable achievement for a fantasy universe inspired by Paris in the 1900s, developed by around 30 people on a modest budget.

The 345-page code was passed in 2022 and replaces a set of laws established during Dutch colonial rule. Its broad definitions drew condemnation from democracy activists concerned it might harm civil liberties and free speech, and put government critics at risk of arrest.

Law Minister Supratman Andi Agtas said the overhaul of the law was timely, but acknowledged there was a risk of the new powers being abused by authorities.

"There will be that," he said over the phone on Tuesday, referring to potential abuses of the code. "We're not blind. But what's important is public control. Anything that's new will not be immediately perfect."

Decades in the making, the revisions to the criminal code were passed in then-President Joko Widodo's final term. At the time, then-U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged Widodo to reconsider some of the provisions .

The code was updated to reflect Indonesia's current legal and cultural norms, citing new policies such as a restorative justice system, Agtas said. "It's our own legal system ... different from other countries," he added.

The law criminalises sex outside marriage with a punishment of up to one year in jail, but only if a spouse, parent, or child of the alleged offender makes a complaint. Currently, only adultery is a crime in Indonesia.

The reporting requirement has eased tourism industry concerns that foreigners could be caught by the law, said Hariyadi Sukamdani, chairman of the Confederation of Indonesia Tourism Association.

Insulting the president or state agencies may result in a prison term of as many as three years under the new law, while people disseminating communism or other ideologies "that are against" Indonesia's state ideology face up to four years in jail.

The new code's definition of "attacking honour or dignity", which it says is where a reputation or self-worth is damaged, includes actions such as libel or defamation.

Asfinawati, a legal expert who goes by one name, said this week that the definition of insults was among the broad provisions that raised concerns for free speech and activist groups.

"This is a new colonial set of laws, made by our own," she said, adding the expansive nature of the code did not guarantee that officials would properly apply it.

Agtas said law officers had been briefed about the new code, and along with a separate criminal procedure code set to take effect on Friday, there were guardrails intended to prevent power abuses.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 07:25:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HHERALX4URNEBEIVRNVKY6CNEA.jpg?auth=4cb754656afd1dd7e1cec7d2681d250d39cbe37d783ae4dc2e1503ebe57f548f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Insight: How Israel’s multi-ton truck bombs ripped through Gaza City</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/how-israels-multi-ton-truck-bombs-ripped-through-gaza-city-2025-12-31/</link><description>GAZA CITY, Dec 31 (Reuters) - In the weeks before the Gaza ceasefire on October 10, Israel widely deployed a new weapon: M113 Armoured Personnel Carriers repurposed to carry between 1 and 3 tons of explosives, Reuters found.

As Israeli troops pushed toward the centre of Gaza City, these powerful bombs, along with airstrikes and armour-plated bulldozers, leveled swathes of buildings, drone footage and satellite images show.

In most cases, but not all, the inhabitants fled ahead of demolitions after Israeli warnings, residents, Israeli security sources and Gaza authorities said.

Hesham Mohammad Badawi’s five-storey home on Dawla Street in the affluent Tel-al-Hawa suburb, damaged by an airstrike earlier in the war, was completely destroyed by an APC explosion on September 14, he and a relative said, leaving him and 41 family members homeless.

Badawi, who was a few hundred meters away, said he heard at least five APCs detonate in roughly five-minute intervals. He said he received no evacuation warning before the demolition and family members escaped “by a miracle” amid explosions and heavy gunfire.

Several buildings in the same block were demolished around that time, satellite images show.

The family is now staying with relatives in different parts of the city, Badawi said, while he lives in a tent by his former home. Israel’s military did not respond to Reuters questions about the incident. Reuters could not establish what Israel targeted in the attack or independently verify all the details of Badawi’s account of the events.

When Reuters visited in November, remains of at least one of the vehicles were strewn among large piles of rubble.

"We could not believe this was our neighbourhood, this was our street,” Badawi said.

To compile a detailed account of the role of APC-based bombs by the Israeli military in Tel-al-Hawa and the neighbouring Sabra district in the six weeks before the ceasefire, Reuters spoke to three Israeli security sources, a retired Israeli military brigadier, an Israeli reservist, Gazan authorities and three military experts.

Seven Gaza City residents said their homes or those of neighbours were levelled or severely damaged by the explosions, which several likened to an earthquake. Analysis of Reuters footage by two of the military experts confirmed wreckage of at least two exploded APCs among the rubble at sites in Gaza City.

Israel packed 1 to 3 tons of ordnance in APCs, three military experts estimated, based on cabin space and wreckage of vehicle armour. Some of the ordnance was likely non–military ammonium nitrate or emulsion, though without chemical testing that conclusion is not certain, they said.

Such a multi-ton explosion could approach an equivalent power to Israel’s largest airborne bombs, the 2,000-pound U.S.-made Mark 84, said two experts, who examined Reuters footage of the blast area and vehicle remains.

It could scatter vehicle fragments hundreds of meters, and break close-by exterior walls and building columns. The blast wave would be strong enough to potentially collapse a multi-storey building, they said.

APCs generally transport troops and equipment on the battlefield. The three military experts consulted by Reuters said use of the vehicles as bombs was highly unusual and risked excessive damage to civilian dwellings.

In response to detailed Reuters questions for this story, Israel’s military said it was committed to the rules of war. Regarding allegations of destruction of civilian infrastructure, it said it used what it called engineering equipment only for “essential operational purposes,” without disclosing further details.

Decisions are guided by military necessity, distinction, and proportionality, it said.

In an interview with Reuters in Gaza for this story, Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem said Israel’s demolitions with armoured vehicles were aimed at the large-scale displacement of the city's residents, which Israel has denied.

The reporting provides new evidence of the power of these low-tech weapons and how they came to be widely used.

Retired reservist Brigadier-General Amir Avivi, founder of the Israel Defense and Security Forum (IDSF), a think tank, called the weapon an “innovation of the Gaza War.” One of the security sources said its increasing use partly responded to U.S. restrictions on transfers of heavy Mark-84 airborne bombs and Caterpillar bulldozers.

Israel’s military and Prime Minister’s Office also did not respond to questions about the reasons for the shift in tactics. The U.S. State Department, White House and Department of War did not respond to Reuters questions for this story.

Before the war, Tel-al-Hawa and Sabra, a historic area of modest houses in south-central Gaza City, bustled with bakeries, shopping malls, mosques, banks and universities.

Now, large parts lie in ruins.

Satellite imagery analysis by Reuters showed that about 650 buildings in Sabra, Tel-al-Hawa and surrounding areas were destroyed in the six weeks between September 1 and October 11.

Two international law scholars, the U.N. human rights office and two of the military experts who reviewed Reuters findings said use of such large explosives in dense residential urban areas may have failed one or more principles of humanitarian law that prohibit attacking civilian infrastructure and using disproportionate force.

“The basis that some of it may be booby-trapped" or once used by Hamas snipers is not enough to justify mass destruction, Ajith Sunghay, head of the U.N. Human Rights Office in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, told Reuters, referring to Israel’s allegation that Hamas placed improvised explosive devices in houses, which Hamas denies.

In some circumstances, buildings could lose legal protection and become targets if Israel had evidence Hamas used them for military advantage, said Afonso Seixas Nunes, Associate Professor in the School of Law at Saint Louis University.

Israel’s military did not respond to Reuters requests to provide such evidence.

If not the result of military necessity, the demolition of civilian infrastructure could amount to wanton destruction of property, which is a war crime, Sunghay said.

The level of ruin reflects a broader trend: 81% of Gaza’s buildings suffered damage or destruction during the war, according to the U.N. Satellite Center. The area including Gaza City experienced most damage since July, with approximately 5,600 newly affected structures, it said in October.

In August, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told reporters Israel was packing tons of explosives into APCs because Hamas had placed explosive devices in “just about every single building” in evacuated areas.

“We detonate them, and they set off all the booby traps. That's why you see the destruction," Netanyahu said.

In response to questions for this story, Qassem, the Hamas spokesman, denied booby trapping buildings, and said Hamas did not have the capacity to set devices at the scale Israel claimed.

Later in August, Israeli forces entered Gaza City with the declared aim of eliminating Hamas and freeing hostages held by militants since the October 7, 2023 attack on Israel that triggered the war.

Israel ordered a full evacuation of the city in September.

As troops advanced, backed by tanks and airstrikes, they extensively damaged eastern suburbs before approaching central areas of the city, where most displaced people were sheltering.

Hundreds of thousands fled south. The U.N. estimated 600,000-700,000 people remained in the city.

Israel’s defense minister has said soldiers demolished 25 towers that Israel said had Hamas tunnels underneath or were used as lookout points. The U.N. human rights office says Israel has provided no evidence the buildings were military targets.

Among the destruction visible in Sabra, Tel-al-Hawa and South Rimal between September 1 and October 11, Reuters identified al-Roya tower, which housed the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights, a prominent human rights office that worked with charity Christian Aid, and al-Roya 2, a mixture of business and flats, brought down by airstrikes on September 7 and 8.

Two wings of the Islamic University of Gaza and a mosque on the campus were destroyed. In one six-block corner of Tel-al-Hawa almost every building was demolished - more than 60 in total.

Beyond the two cases of APC explosions analysed in detail for this story, and airstrikes on towers caught on video, Reuters could not establish what weapons Israel deployed to demolish buildings, or the total number of APCs detonated from August until the ceasefire.

Gaza’s Civil Defense spokesperson Mahmoud Basal said the army detonated hundreds of APCs in that period, as many as 20 daily. Israel’s military did not reply to a question on numbers.

Among the buildings destroyed was Badawi’s family home of four decades, along with more than 20 neighbouring buildings in the same period.

“We didn’t recognize this as our house," he said.

Two military experts said Reuters footage of the area showed remains of at least one detonated APC.

The explosion had torn one APC caterpillar track from its running gear and “physically thrown it onto the roof” of a multi-storey building, a retired senior British military bomb disposal officer said, noting that M113 tracks each weigh hundreds of kilograms.

A thick, ripped piece of metal and a wheel torn in half, both scattered at the property, were consistent with a detonation from within the APC, said Gareth Collett, a retired British Brigadier General and leading authority on explosives and bomb disposal. He said the large size of the fragments was indicative of a commercial low energy explosive.

Bought from the U.S. after the Yom Kippur War in the 1970s, thousands of M113s were deemed to insufficiently protect soldiers and were mothballed, military historian Yagil Henkin said.

FMC Corp, originally the M113’s primary manufacturer, did not respond to Reuters’ requests for comment about its use as a weapon and potential associated human rights concerns.

BAE Systems, which currently provides maintenance for the vehicle globally, did not reply to Reuters questions about Israel's new use of the M113 other than to say it currently had no direct military sales to the country. It said equipment it sold to the U.S. government could reach other countries indirectly.

In May, Israel posted a public tender seeking to sell an unspecified number of M113s internationally, public documents show.

The tender was later cancelled, according to an undated posting on the Ministry of Defence website. The cancellation allowed Israel to scale up repurposing M113s, one of the security sources told Reuters. The military did not respond to Reuters’ questions about the tender.

The first media reports of an APC detonating in Gaza date to mid-2024.

Use accelerated this year when Israel rationed stocks after the U.S. paused deliveries of Mark-84 bombs over concerns about the bombs use in residential areas, the source said.

The increased role of APC-based bombs also coincided with shortages in Israel of U.S. company Caterpillar's giant D9 bulldozer, long used by Israel’s military for demolition, one of the security sources said.

Hamas heavily targeted D9s earlier in the war, killing or injuring soldiers and damaging the vehicles, the source said. Alarmed by their use to demolish homes, the U.S. paused D9 sales to Israel in November 2024, adding to the shortage. Under President Donald Trump, D9 transfers resumed.

Caterpillar did not respond to questions from Reuters about the military use of its machines in Gaza demolitions and has not publicly commented on the matter.

Amid the shortages, the military began using other methods of demolition, including APCs, another of the security sources said.

Danny Orbach, an Israeli military historian, told Reuters demolitions were normal in war, made necessary in Gaza due to tunnels and booby traps. He said Israel’s military was underprepared for the complex fighting, leading to the conclusion there was “no other way to fight such a war except destroying all buildings above ground.”

Israel's military told Reuters targets were reviewed prior to attack and the munition selected “to achieve the military objective while minimizing collateral damage” to civilians and civilian infrastructure.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 08:31:48 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/OZTJPO6M5VM7TALMTY6XMXB4UQ.jpg?auth=760e740bb798aaaf397ee91568137db2f125aadeb07e6a82330e4e504f274a03&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Mali and Burkina Faso announce reciprocal travel ban on US</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/mali-burkina-faso-announce-reciprocal-travel-ban-us-2025-12-31/</link><description>BAMAKO, Dec 31 (Reuters) - Mali and Burkina Faso have said they are imposing a travel ban on U.S. citizens in response to an equivalent measure announced by the Trump administration earlier this month .

In separate statements issued by their foreign ministries late on Tuesday, the two West African countries said they were acting in the name of "reciprocity" after the White House announced on December 16 that U.S. President Donald Trump was adding them and five other countries to a list of those subject to a full travel ban.

The White House said the expanded ban, set to take effect on January 1, applied to "countries with demonstrated, persistent, and severe deficiencies in screening, vetting, and information-sharing to protect the Nation from national security and public safety threats".

Mali said on Tuesday that Washington's decision to add it to the travel ban list had been taken without prior consultation and that the stated rationale was not justified by "actual developments on the ground".

Mali and Burkina Faso are not the first countries to take such measures affecting U.S. citizens after being targeted by Trump's travel restrictions.

On December 25 neighbouring Niger announced it would stop issuing visas to U.S. citizens, the country's state media agency reported, citing a Nigerien diplomatic source.

In June, Chad announced it was suspending visa issuance to U.S. citizens after it was included on an earlier list of 12 countries affected by a travel ban.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 08:56:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Bangladesh's Islamist party open to unity government after February vote</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/bangladeshs-islamist-party-open-unity-government-after-february-vote-2025-12-31/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 09:46:33 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/J72VEBLDTJOF5D5SZJDKKNPNKA.jpg?auth=82afdaa896f041b6209e1cd0d5382f2ba9dd0901d9cefef6ebbc17d0a893b5cd&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran to unleash 'decisive' response if economic protests destabilise country, prosecutor says</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20251231-iran-unleash-decisive-response-economic-protests-destabilise-country-prosecutor</link><description>Iran 's prosecutor general said on Wednesday that economic protests that had gripped the country were legitimate, but any attempt to create insecurity would be met with a "decisive response".

"Peaceful livelihood protests are part of social and understandable realities," Mohammad Movahedi-Azad told state media.

"Any attempt to turn economic protests into a tool of insecurity, destruction of public property, or implementation of externally designed scenarios will inevitably be met with a legal, proportionate and decisive response."

Protesters including shopkeepers and university students have been rallying against economic hardship in Iran since Sunday.

The Iranian rial has dropped against the dollar and other world currencies, forcing up import prices and hurting retail traders.

When the protests erupted on Sunday, the US dollar was trading at around 1.42 million rials, compared to 820,000 rials a year ago.

In December, inflation stood at 52 percent year-on-year, according to official statistics. But this figure still falls far short of many price increases, especially for basic necessities.

The country's economy, already battered by decades of severe Western sanctions, was further strained after the United Nations in late September reinstated international sanctions linked to the country's nuclear programme that were lifted 10 years ago.

President Masoud Pezeshkian – who has less authority under Iran's system of government than supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei – met Tuesday with labour leaders and made proposals to tackle the economic crisis, according to press agency Mehr.

"I have asked the interior minister to listen to the legitimate demands of the protesters by engaging in dialogue with their representatives so that the government can do everything in its power to resolve the problems and act responsibly," he said in a social media post.

According to state television, parliamentary speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, also called for "necessary measures focused on increasing people's purchasing power" but warned against foreign agents and government opponents attempting to exploit the protests.

On Monday, the government announced the replacement of the central bank governor with former economy and finance minister Abdolnasser Hemmati.

Israel 's Mossad spy agency on Wednesday issued a direct call urging Iranians to press on with protests, saying it was supporting them "on the ground" as demonstrations spread in capital Tehran and other Iranian cities.

"Go out into the streets together. The time has come. We are with you," Mossad wrote in a post on its Farsi-language X account, Israel's army radio reported on Wednesday.

While the situation left hundreds of people trapped in their cars in freezing conditions, by the early hours of Wednesday morning traffic was moving again, according to police.

"The difficult situation began yesterday after 4 p.m., when the first trucks on the S7 route... began having trouble approaching the slopes," said Tomasz Markowski, a spokesperson for police in the northern city of Olsztyn.

"This led to a traffic jam stretching approximately 20 kilometres overnight."

Deputy Infrastructure Minister Stanislaw Bukowiec told a press conference that nobody had been hurt as a result of the difficult situation on the roads.

Anna Karczewska, a spokesperson for police in Ostroda, said officers had tried to help drivers who found themselves stuck. Ostroda lies on the highway about 40 km west of Olsztyn.

"We helped as much as we could, and we had coffee and hot tea for the drivers, which the Ostroda City Hall had prepared for us," she said.

State news agency PAP reported that there had also been some disruption to railways and airports, but that services were returning to normal.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 10:23:02 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Queen Camilla describes being assaulted by man as a teenager</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/queen-camilla-describes-being-assaulted-by-man-teenager-2025-12-31/</link><description>LONDON, Dec 31 (Reuters) - Britain's Queen Camilla has described for the first time fighting off an attack by a man on a train when she was a teenager, speaking in an interview with the BBC in which she recounted how furious the assault had left her.

"When I was a teenager, I was attacked on a train … I remember at the time being so angry," she said during a discussion broadcast on Wednesday about violence against women.

"I was reading my book and you know this boy - man - attacked me, and I did fight back."

She said she did not know the man who attacked her.

Camilla, 78, has for many years championed charities and causes that seek to end sexual and domestic violence and to support victims.

The assault was first reported in September when a book about the royal family was serialised in the Times newspaper, but had not previously been confirmed by Buckingham Palace.

"I remember getting off the train and my mother looking at me and saying 'Why is your hair standing on end and why is the button missing from your coat?'" she told the BBC.

"I was so furious about it and it's sort of lurked for many years."

The book said the incident happened on a train to Paddington Station in London when Camilla was about 16 or 17 years old, and she responded by taking off her shoe and using it to hit him in the genitals.

When she arrived at Paddington, she pointed the attacker out to an official and he was arrested, the book said.

Camilla did not confirm those details in the interview.

The democratic socialist's plans for his first day in office on Thursday nod to his politics and priorities, without straying far from his predecessors with a sober official midnight oath-taking followed by a more celebratory ceremony in the afternoon.

New York law spells out that four-year mayoral terms start on the January 1 after elections. To avoid any ambiguity about who's in charge of America's most populous city, it has become a tradition to hold a small midnight swearing-in.

Mamdani has chosen as the site of his midnight oath the Old City Hall subway stop, which was decommissioned in the middle of the previous century and is accessible only a few times a year through guided tours.

The subway site, according to Mamdani’s transition team, reflects his "commitment to the working people who keep our city running every day."

Mamdani, a 34-year-old former state lawmaker, promised a freeze on rents and free buses and childcare, building a campaign around affordability issues that some have seen as a path forward for his Democratic Party around the country ahead of midterm elections.

Mamdani inspired a record-breaking turnout of more than 2 million voters and took 50 percent, nearly 10 points ahead of Andrew Cuomo running as an independent and well ahead of Republican Curtis Sliwa.

New York State Attorney General Letitia James, who was among Mamdani's earliest prominent backers, was to administer the midnight oath to Mamdani. During the first administration of President Donald Trump, James began investigating his business practices in New York, resulting in a judge finding in 2024 that Trump fraudulently overstated his net worth to dupe lenders. The Trump administration has targeted James during his second term, accusing her of mortgage fraud .

Grant Reeher, a Syracuse University political science professor, said the role James was to play in the inauguration sent a message to core supporters that Mamdani is "going to be independent of the president.”

INAUGURATION OF A NEW ERA

The Uganda-born Mamdani, who will be New York City's first Muslim mayor, has been a sharp critic of Trump on issues such as immigration and said his differences with the president were numerous after a warm White House meeting .

But being sworn in by the state attorney general may say more about Mamdani's political alliances than rivalries. In 2014 Bill de Blasio, whom Mamdani regards as the best New York City mayor of his lifetime, was sworn in privately by then-New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman at the start of the first of his two terms.

Senator Bernie Sanders, a progressive, Brooklyn-born Vermont senator whom Mamdani calls his inspiration, presided over de Blasio's public inauguration ceremony in 2018 and will play a similar role for Mamdani. Liberal Democratic U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is also on the inauguration ceremony agenda.

Plans for Mamdani's public inauguration include a ceremony on City Hall's steps and a program of music and speeches in front of 4,000 guests gathered in City Hall Plaza. In addition, tens of thousands of people will be able to watch a livestream of what Mamdani's team has dubbed the “Inauguration of a New Era” in free viewing areas set up along Broadway.

Mamdani raised $2.6 million for the transition and celebrations from nearly 30,000 contributors, more than other mayors on record in this century, both by the total and single donations, according to official campaign data that presents disclosures of inaugural expenses beginning with Michael Bloomberg's first term in 2001.

Sami Zaman, the owner of Astoria's low-key Afghan restaurant Sami's Kabab House, where Astoria resident Mamdani filmed a campaign video with Sanders, was on the inaugural committee alongside filmmakers, writers and activists.

After becoming mayor, Mamdani will move from his one-bedroom Astoria apartment, protected from sharp price hikes by the city rent-stabilization program, to Gracie Mansion, the official residence of New York City mayors on Manhattan's upscale Upper East Side.

Bankers and others in New York, the nation's financial capital , had expressed concern about Mamdani but since his election they have explored how to work with him. The city has had another mayor associated with democratic socialism, David Dinkins. Dinkins did not make much of his association with the Democratic Socialists of America. During his 1990-1993 term he overcame budget deficits and persuaded private businesses to remain in New York, according to city archivists.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 11:21:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/3D5WPQ2ML5JLPLN7WA3UPGQHQI.jpg?auth=dada6cdeb348eb6fa5a8fa906bb7c38d32c6d780405c8a1f1c2cc5ff8b2b9ad9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Italy's Tajani calls for electoral reform with majority bonus before next national vote</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/italys-tajani-calls-electoral-reform-with-majority-bonus-before-next-national-2025-12-31/</link><description>ROME, Dec 31 (Reuters) - Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani said on Wednesday the country's electoral law should be reformed to adopt a more proportional system as the ruling bloc seeks to safeguard its majority ahead of a general election due in 2027.

Tajani, who leads the conservative Forza Italia party and is a key ally in Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's right-wing coalition, said the reform should include a majority premium to guarantee governability.

"We will discuss it. No one wants to exclude the centre-left, but the reform must be done," Tajani was quoted as saying in an interview with the newspaper Il Messaggero.

Key wins for Italy's opposition in southern regional elections show cracks in the ruling conservative bloc's dominance, raising doubts over Meloni's ability to secure a second term in the next national vote.

Under the current system, 36% of lawmakers are elected in first-past-the-post constituencies.

Meloni and her allies swept to power in 2022 after the centre-left failed to form a pre-election alliance, splitting votes in key first-past-the-post races.

Italy has since enjoyed a rare period of political stability.

However, analysts say a centre-left alliance could threaten Meloni's grip on power.

Tajani said that proportional representation would better reflect local interests, especially after the recent cut in the number of lawmakers.

Italy reduced the size of its parliament in 2020, cutting the number of deputies from 630 to 400 and senators from 315 to 200.

The change has intensified debate over how to ensure fair representation under the current mixed electoral system, which combines proportional and first-past-the-post elements.

"With proportional representation, territories would be represented more," Tajani said.

Electoral law has long been a contentious issue in Italy, where frequent changes to voting rules have shaped political dynamics. The current system, introduced in 2017, was designed to balance stability with representation but has faced criticism for producing fragmented parliaments again.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 12:45:04 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/SQED77NV6ZNR7C4CSUO42A3YHY.jpg?auth=72eadcf8cf069a45a749ddfa61cde2753feb5c81577dd222fa5787e211efb6f9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia releases video footage to challenge Kyiv over alleged attack</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/russia-releases-video-footage-challenge-kyiv-over-alleged-attack-2025-12-31/</link><description>MOSCOW, Dec 31 (Reuters) - Russia's defence ministry released video footage on Wednesday of what it said was a downed drone at a briefing intended to show Ukraine tried this week to attack a presidential residence and challenge Kyiv's denials that such an attack took place.

Kyiv says Moscow has produced no evidence to support its allegations and that Russia invented the alleged attack to block progress at talks on ending the war in Ukraine . Officials in several Western countries have cast doubt on Russia's version of events and questioned whether there was any attack.

Video footage released by Russia's defence ministry showed a senior officer, Major-General Alexander Romanenkov, setting out details of how Moscow says it believes Ukraine attacked one of President Vladimir Putin's residences in the Novgorod region.

Romanenkov said 91 drones had been launched from Ukraine's Sumy and Chernihiv regions in a "thoroughly planned" attack that he said was thwarted by Russian air defences, caused no damage and injured no one.

The video released by the ministry included footage of a Russian serviceman standing next to fragments of a device which he said was a downed Ukrainian Chaklun-V drone carrying a 6-kg explosive device which had not detonated.

The ministry did not explain how it knew what the device's target was.

Reuters could not confirm the location and the date of the footage showing fragments of a destroyed device. The model of the destroyed device could not be immediately verified.

Other footage featured a man, identified as Igor Bolshakov from a village in the Novgorod region, saying he had heard air defence rockets in action.

Ukraine did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the Russian defence ministry's footage.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 13:33:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/T74NYN25NJNXTMFNKK4L7GJGCE.jpg?auth=302ee1d252e142b5655f3386c56ad9284a25dd1be2803d420361e592552df2d5&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Sydney brings in New Year with nod to victims of Bondi attack</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/sydney-brings-new-year-with-nod-victims-bondi-attack-2025-12-31/</link><description>SYDNEY, Jan 1 (Reuters) - Australia's Sydney began 2026 with a fireworks display held under an enhanced police presence, weeks after gunmen killed 15 people at a Jewish event in the city.

Sydney's annual New Year's Eve celebrations are known globally for their spectacular fireworks, with 40,000 pyrotechnic effects stretching seven km (four miles) across buildings and barges along its harbour, including the city's iconic Harbour Bridge and Opera House.

Organisers held a minute's silence for the victims of the attack at 11:00 p.m. local time (1200 GMT), with the Harbour Bridge lit up in white and a menorah - a symbol long used to symbolise Judaism - projected onto its pylons.

"After a tragic end to the year for our city, we hope that New Year’s Eve will provide an opportunity to come together and look with hope for a peaceful and happy 2026," Sydney's Lord Mayor Clover Moore said ahead of the event.

The father and son gunmen are alleged to have killed 15 people at a Hanukkah event on December 14, Australia's worst mass shooting in almost three decades that shocked the nation and stoked fears of rising antisemitism in the country.

Traditional Christmas celebrations at Bondi were muted this year, and several New Year events planned there were cancelled.

Around 3,000 police, some carrying long arms, were deployed in the city during the main New Year celebrations, that typically attract over a million revellers.

As president in his second term, he is merging his personal brand with national institutions and government programs, an unusual assertion of power by a sitting U.S. president.

Since returning to office in January, the Republican president has affixed his name to prominent Washington buildings, a planned class of Navy warships, a visa program for wealthy foreigners, a government-run prescription drug website, and federal savings accounts for children.

Some historians see it as a superficial legacy-building effort by the president that may not stand the test of time. A backlash has already begun against the renaming of Washington's premier performance venue as the Donald J. Trump and John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts, with several acts canceling in protest.

"I don't think the naming or renaming guarantees that Trump's name will be affixed to those things until time immemorial," said Austin Sarat, a professor of jurisprudence and political science at Amherst College, who questioned whether Trump's name would remain if Democrats regain power.

Elizabeth Huston, a White House spokeswoman, said the administration was not focused on "smart branding, but delivering on President Trump’s goal of Making America Great Again.”

"Drug pricing agreements, overdue upgrades of national landmarks, lasting peace deals, and wealth-creation accounts for children are historic initiatives that would not have been possible without President Trump’s bold leadership," she said in an emailed statement.

The first year of Trump's second White House term has seen a shock-and-awe policy blitz that expanded presidential power, remade some parts of the federal bureaucracy and economy, and reshaped America's relations with the world.

But one of the most striking features of the past 11 months has been the energy and attention Trump has given to placing his name on buildings and government programs.

Trump's populist moves have alarmed Democrats and civil society watchdogs who worry they create the impression that Trump, rather than the state, is the provider of essential services. Defenders say what Trump is doing is simply an extension of his decades as a savvy marketer.

The biggest outcry came this December when his name was added to the Kennedy Center, named for the late Democratic president in 1964 by an act of Congress to honor him after his assassination.

The center was renamed by its board of trustees, a majority of whom were appointed by Trump.

Just up the Potomac River sits the U.S. Institute of Peace, a government-funded think tank established by Congress and focused on conflict avoidance.

On December 3 the U.S. State Department renamed it the Donald J. Trump Institute of Peace, based on Trump's assertion he has ended eight wars, a claim widely disputed given ongoing conflicts in several of those hotspots. Trump's name has been affixed to the building's exterior.

Washington has many buildings and monuments named after presidents, but that has traditionally occurred well after they have left office and are normally national tributes to them, often established by Congress.

Julian Zelizer, a presidential historian at Princeton University, said while previous presidents were not shy in reminding voters they were responsible for popular policies, including stimulus money or infrastructure programs, "that's very different to what you're seeing today."

"It's a lot easier to get your name on a building or a ship than to pass legislation that's enduring," Zelizer said. In terms of a lasting legacy, however, "it's very thin."

Trump has announced a plan for a new generation of U.S. Navy warships, which he called "Trump-class" battleships and said he will be personally involved in the designs.

If Trump's name appears on any of the ships, or "Trump-class" becomes an official Navy designation for the new battleships, a later name change would be a first, Zelizer said.

But Trump's announcement does not guarantee the ships will be built. The Navy has canceled shipbuilding programs in the past, and the Trump-class ships are still in the design phase of a process that typically takes many years.

Trump's tax and spending cut bill passed in July created a new type of tax-advantageous savings accounts for children, which are now called on the Internal Revenue Service's website "Trump Accounts." , opens new tab

As the accounts were created by an act of Congress, changing their name will likely need congressional approval.

In October, the U.S. Treasury shared draft designs for $1 coins featuring images of Trump to commemorate the 250th anniversary of America's declaration of independence from Great Britain. It has not been confirmed if the Trump coin will be issued next year.

The Trump administration also launched the "Trump Gold Card" , a new immigrant visa program allowing wealthy foreign investors an expedited path to permission to live in the U.S., and TrumpRx.gov , opens new tab , a website offering reduced prices for prescription drugs that will likely launch in 2026.

Even plans for the U.S. Air Force's new fighter jet, the F-47 - while not bearing Trump's name - partly refer to the 47th president, the Air Force said.

Abu Dhabi has used alliances with states or proxies, military intervention and financial support mainly to counter what it views as the destabilising threat of political Islam, specifically from groups linked to the Muslim Brotherhood.

Senior Emirati officials have described the strategy as strengthening nation-states against extremists, though U.N. experts and Western officials have asserted that the approach has at times fuelled conflict, a charge the UAE denies, and critics say it bolsters authoritarian leaders.

Here are details of the UAE's involvement in key countries:

The UAE announced a withdrawal of its troops from Yemen in 2019, but has maintained influence through the Southern Transitional Council (STC), a separatist group it trained and equipped.

It views the STC as a bulwark against the Islah party, a key faction in the Saudi-backed government of Yemen that the UAE regards as a Muslim Brotherhood offshoot, and as a partner in securing maritime access.

Abu Dhabi has been Cairo's most important financial backer since Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi led the military overthrow of the Muslim Brotherhood government in 2013, viewing a secular Egypt as a firewall against an Islamist resurgence.

In 2024, Emirati sovereign wealth fund ADQ signed a $35 billion deal to develop a prime stretch of Egypt's Mediterranean coast - a vital injection of hard currency while Cairo was strapped for cash.

Their shared distrust of the Muslim Brotherhood anchors their political alliance, which has seen them coordinate the 2017 boycott of Qatar and oppose Turkey's influence in Libya.

Turkey's ruling AK Party has close ties to the Brotherhood.

U.N. sanctions monitors have described what they deemed credible allegations that the UAE provided military support to Sudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) led by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti, in the civil war against the Sudanese army.

Analysts have said the UAE distrusts the Sudanese Armed Forces chief, General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, due to the presence within his ranks of Islamists from the regime of longtime former Sudanese strongman Omar al-Bashir, viewing Hemedti - a former partner in Yemen - as a counterweight.

The RSF has been accused, including by the U.S. and rights groups, of committing crimes against humanity and ethnically motivated mass killings in Darfur.

The UAE has strongly denied supplying arms to the RSF, stating in letters to the U.N. that the allegations lack evidence, and emphasizing that its role is strictly humanitarian.

The UAE has strengthened security and economic ties with Chad's transitional President Mahamat Idriss Deby, signing a military cooperation agreement in 2023 and supplying armoured vehicles to the Sahelian state, which it views as a buffer against Islamist insurgents.

Attention has focused on the remote Amdjarass airport near the Sudanese border, where Reuters reported a surge in cargo flights .

While the UAE says it operates a field hospital and delivers aid for Sudanese refugees there, U.N. sanctions monitors and Western officials have alleged that the airstrip serves as a key logistics hub for supplying weapons to the RSF.

The UAE denies the charges, maintaining its operations are purely humanitarian.

The UAE was the primary foreign backer of the east Libya-based commander Khalifa Haftar, providing air support and equipment to his self-styled Libyan National Army (LNA) during a 2019 offensive on Tripoli, according to U.N. experts.

The intervention aimed to topple the Tripoli-based, internationally recognised Government of National Accord, which included Muslim Brotherhood-affiliated factions and was supported militarily by Turkey.

While the civil war has been in a fragile stalemate, the UAE remains a key power broker , maintaining close ties to eastern factions and the Haftar family while engaging in diplomatic efforts to shape a government free of what it terms "extremist militias." However, Haftar’s own coalition includes hardline Salafist factions.

In 2020, the UAE broke with decades of Arab consensus by normalising relations with Israel under the U.S.-brokered Abraham Accords, a move Saudi Arabia has declined to follow without a path to Palestinian statehood.

The pact formalised a strategic alignment against shared adversaries, specifically Iran and Islamist groups like Hamas.

While the Gaza war has cooled public engagement, with Emirati officials frequently criticising Israeli military conduct, Abu Dhabi has maintained its diplomatic ties, viewing the relationship as a critical lever for regional influence and a unique channel to Washington.

The UAE has cultivated deep economic and security ties with the self-declared republic of Somaliland, as Abu Dhabi has frequently viewed the federal Somali government in Mogadishu as being too close to Qatar and Turkey.

The centrepiece of this strategy is DP World's $442 million investment to develop and operate the Port of Berbera, creating a strategic alternative to Djibouti on the Gulf of Aden.

In 2017, Somaliland's parliament voted to allow the UAE to build a military base in Berbera. While the base was later designated for civilian use, the UAE continues to train Somaliland's security forces while maintaining a consulate-level presence in Hargeisa.

Protests over high inflation and a slump in the value of the local rial currency began among shopkeepers in Tehran on Sunday and by Tuesday had spread to several universities in Tehran, with the reported break-in attempt on Wednesday.

"A few hours ago an organised group tried to get into the governorate building in the city of Fasa, their attack failed with the intervention of security forces," state media said. "The leader of these rioters, a 28-year-old woman, was arrested".

Iran's Tasnim news agency cited a local official as saying four "attackers" were detained and three members of the security forces had been wounded during the incident.

A video carried by state media showed a group of people trying to break open the gate of the building. Reuters verified the location of the footage but was not able to independently verify the timing.

The governor of Fasa told state media that "the protests were caused by inflation and economic conditions. Individuals influenced by hostile channels and media participated in them... the situation is back to normal".

Iranian authorities have responded to previous protests over issues ranging from prices, drought, women's rights and political freedoms with forceful security measures and extensive arrests.

This time the government said it would set up a "dialogue mechanism" with leaders of the demonstrations, the first major protests since Israeli and U.S. strikes on Iran in June, which prompted widespread expressions of patriotic solidarity. It has not said how the mechanism would work.

Iran's economy has faced significant challenges for years following the reimposition of U.S. sanctions in 2018, when President Donald Trump withdrew from an international agreement concerning Iran's nuclear program during his first term.

Iran's rial currency has lost nearly half its value against the dollar in 2025, with inflation reaching 42.5% in December in a country where unrest has repeatedly flared in recent years.

In September, United Nations sanctions were reinstated, and Reuters reported in October that Iranian authorities held multiple high-level meetings to address economic instability, find ways to bypass sanctions, and handle public discontent.

In 2022, Iran faced protests across the country over price hikes, including for bread, a major staple.

Over the same period and into 2023, the country's clerical rulers faced the boldest unrest in years triggered by the death of a young Iranian Kurdish woman, Mahsa Amini, in the custody of the morality police, who enforce a strict female dress code.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 14:46:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>In pictures: Sydney helps kick off celebrations as world ushers in 2026</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20251231-in-pictures-spectacular-fireworks-light-up-skies-as-world-ushers-in-2026</link><description>The world is welcoming 2026 with a bang as revellers enjoy fireworks and parties to bring in the New Year .

It suggests prohibiting online platforms from providing any "social networking service to a minor under fifteen years of age" from September 1, 2026.

It also seeks to extend an existing ban on mobile phones from preschool through middle school (which France introduced in 2018) to high schools as well.

The draft legislation says "numerous studies and reports now attest to the various risks associated with excessive use of digital screens by teenagers", and lists particular risks as "exposure to inappropriate content", "cyberbullying" and "sleep disturbances".

MPs, mostly from President Emmanuel Macron’s Ensemble pour la République (EPR) party, put forward the bill on November 18.

Macron, who has voiced support for a ban on social media for under-15s, previously said that the bill could be debated by parliament "as early as January".

A French mother whose 15-year-old son died by suicide launched a legal fight in December against some of the world’s biggest social media platforms, alleging their algorithms were flooded with content that drove him into a “downward spiral”.

Clement had only just started his second year of secondary school when he jumped off a bridge in the northwestern region of Brittany in 2024. His family are now seeking to reopen the investigation into his death and hold social media platforms to account.

They filed a complaint against TikTok and Meta , among other social media companies, in September on charges including incitement to suicide .

The vast majority of the videos on his TikTok "For You" page – where the platform's algorithm recommends content – were "inciting him to death, telling him he didn't matter to anyone", Clement's mother told AFP.

A social media ban for teens took effect earlier this month in Australia , making it the first country to institute such a law.

Children under 16 years old are now banned from using social media platforms, including X, TikTok, Facebook, Threads, Instagram, YouTube and Snapchat.

New accounts for this age group are prohibited and profiles that existed before the ban are being deactivated.

Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the new law aimed to support young Australians and ease the mental health pressures that can come from endless scrolling.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 16:34:56 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/d874de3c-e65f-11f0-9809-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/2025-12-10T065319Z-170299555-RC2HDIAFJUCF-RTRMADP-3-AUSTRALIA-SOCIALMEDIA-TEENMORE.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Aid to Gaza under threat: Dozens of NGOs to be barred under new Israeli rules</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20251231-access-to-gaza-under-threat-msf-among-dozens-of-ngos-to-be-barred-under-new-israeli-rules</link><description>Medical charity Doctors Without Borders ( Médecins ⁠Sans Frontières or MSF ) urged Israel to allow it to operate in Gaza and the occupied West Bank in 2026 amid fears that it – and dozens of other NGOS – could be barred from operating in the Palestinian territories because of new Israeli rules set to come into force on January 1.

The organisation has provided care to nearly half a million people in more than two years of war in Gaza , where it currently supports around 20 percent of the hospital beds and a third of births.

"If MSF is prevented from working in Gaza, it will deprive hundreds of thousands of people from accessing medical care," the group said, highlighting the life and death stakes for civilians already struggling to access health services.

Israel’s said that 37 aid organisations – about 15 percent of the organisations operating in Gaza – have failed to comply with its new framework by a deadline that expires at midnight on Wednesday.

The new rules, announced in March, require aid organisations to “submit a list of their Palestinian employees in order to rule out any links to terrorism” and provide details about funding and operations to continue working in Gaza.

Organisations that refused to comply received notice on Tuesday that their licences would be revoked on January 1, with an obligation to cease all activities by March 1, 2026.

Along with MSF, organisations that will have their licenses revoked include the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC), World Vision International, CARE and Oxfam, according to a list provided by Israel’s Ministry of Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism.

The EU warned on Wednesday that Israel 's threat to suspend the aid groups would block "life-saving" assistance from reaching Gaza's population.

"The NGO registration law cannot be implemented in its current form," EU humanitarian chief Hadja Lahbib wrote on social media. "IHL (international humanitarian law) leaves no room for doubt: aid must reach those in need."

The United Nations rights chief on Wednesday said Israel's proposed ban was "outrageous", calling on states to urgently insist Israel shift course.

"Such arbitrary suspensions make an already intolerable situation even worse for the people of Gaza," Volker Turk said in a statement.

Israel said the ban would have a limited impact on the ground in Gaza, but the affected organisations say the timing – less than three months into a fragile ceasefire – is devastating.

NGOs currently ensure a large proportion of essential services in Gaza, such as the provision of healthcare, water , food and waste collection.

“There are almost no public systems working,” Claire Nicolet, emergency coordinator for MSF in Gaza, told FRANCE 24. “The majority of basic needs are covered by international organisations.”

The NRC said that being deregulated would mean it would likely be forced to shutter its East Jerusalem office and would not be able to bring foreign aid workers into the Palestinian enclave.

It has around 200 local staff as well as 35 international ‍staff across Gaza and the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem.

“The needs in Gaza are enormous and yet we and dozens of other organisations are and will continue to be blocked from bringing in essential life-saving assistance,” said Shaina Low, the NRC's communications adviser.

“Not being able to send staff into Gaza means all of the workload falls on our exhausted local staff,” she added.

Israel said its new framework for aid organisations would prevent "hostile actors or supporters of terrorism" operating in the Palestinian territories, specifically Hamas which it has accused of using aid organisations as a cover for militant activities.

In January, Israel banned the UN Relief and Works Agency, or UNRWA , from operating on its territory after repeatedly accusing it of being infiltrated by Hamas, using the militant group’s facilities and taking aid – accusations UNRWA denied.

Israel this week accused MSF of employing two individuals with links to Hamas and Islamic Jihad .

"They refuse to provide lists of their Palestinian employees because they know, just as we know, that some of them are involved in terrorism or linked to Hamas," spokesman for the Ministry of Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism, Gilad Zwick, told AFP.

MSF denied the claim. “MSF would never knowingly employ people engaging in military activity,” it said.

Some aid groups said they didn’t submit the list of Palestinian staff for fear they’d be targeted by Israel, and because of data protection laws in Europe.

“It comes from a legal and safety perspective. In Gaza, we saw hundreds of aid workers get killed,” added Low.

Since October 2023, more than 500 aid workers have been killed in the Palestinian enclave.

“Agreeing for a party to the conflict to vet our staff, especially under the conditions of occupation, is a violation of humanitarian principles, specifically neutrality and independence,” added Athena Rayburn, the executive director of AIDA, an umbrella organisation representing over 100 organisations that operate in the Palestinian territories.

Rayburn said offered alternatives to submitting staff lists, such as third-party vetting, but that Israel refused to engage in any dialogue and did not confirm that the data collected from the new regulations wouldn't be used for military or intelligence purposes.

The Israeli framework also includes ideological requirements, including disqualifying organisations that have called for boycotts against Israel, denied the October 7 attack or expressed support for any of the international court cases against Israeli soldiers or leaders.

The ban on major aid providers comes as Gaza’s war-torn population is living through harsh winter conditions and bracing for rains and flooding that peak in January and February.

“We are entering the third winter in a row that is really complicated for the population in Gaza. Most of the population is living inside tents, makeshift shelters and destroyed buildings,” Nicolet said, noting that some shelters were so unstable that they had been lost in strong winds.

At the same time, NGOs and the UN say that the amount of aid entering Gaza is already inadequate , with only 100 to 300 trucks allowed in per day.

The October 10 ceasefire agreement stipulated that 600 aid trucks should be allowed into the Palestinian territory every day.

But provision is “not at scale”, and humanitarian organisations are already “not able to respond to the needs” on the ground, said Nicolet.

While MSF continues to provide health services, “we are not able to do what we could do with better materials or better quantities … we are really not able to provide for the population,” she added.

“And maybe now we will do even less in the coming weeks and months.”</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 16:34:58 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/4b015840-e65b-11f0-9cce-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25115623438822.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>France aims to ban under-15s from social media from September 2026, Le Monde reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/france-aims-ban-under-15s-social-media-september-2026-le-monde-reports-2025-12-31/</link><description>PARIS, Dec 31 (Reuters) - France plans to ban children under 15 from social media sites and to prohibit mobile phones in high schools from September 2026, local media reported on Wednesday, moves that underscore rising public angst over the impact of online harms on minors.

President Emmanuel Macron has often pointed to social media as one of the factors to blame for violence among young people and has signalled he wants France to follow Australia, whose world-first ban for under-16s on social media platforms including Facebook (META.O) , opens new tab , Snapchat, TikTok and YouTube (GOOGL.O) , opens new tab came into force in December.

Le Monde newspaper said Macron could announce the measures in his New Year's Eve national address, due to be broadcast at 1900 GMT. His government will submit draft legislation for legal checks in early January, Le Monde and France Info reported.

The Elysee and the prime minister's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the reports.

Mobile phones have been banned in French primary and middle schools since 2018 and the reported new changes would extend that ban to high schools. Pupils aged 11 to 15 attend middle schools in the French educational system.

France also passed a law in 2023 requiring social platforms to obtain parental consent for under-15s to create accounts, though technical challenges have impeded its enforcement.

Macron said in June he would push for regulation at the level of the European Union to ban access to social media for all under-15s after a fatal stabbing at a school in eastern France shocked the nation.

The European Parliament in November urged the EU to set minimum ages for children to access social media to combat a rise in mental health problems among adolescents from excessive exposure, although it is member states which impose age limits.

Various other countries have also taken steps to regulate children's access to social media.

Macron heads into the New Year with his domestic legacy in tatters after his gamble on parliamentary elections in 2024 led to a hung parliament, triggering France's worst political crisis in decades that has seen a succession of weak governments.

However, cracking down further on minors' access to social media could prove popular, according to opinion polls. A Harris Interactive survey in 2024 showed 73% of those canvassed supporting a ban on social media access for under-15s.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 16:50:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LD7CYDK2YFNI5JAHSBKT3DGF2U.jpg?auth=e8e4f4cdea1fd9b8de3fef932a8e378cf83cdd8d109a53a7ee919920e43c02d5&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Finland seizes ship sailing from Russia after suspected undersea cable sabotage</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20251231-finland-seizes-ship-sailing-from-russia-after-suspected-undersea-cable-sabotage</link><description>Finnish police seized on Wednesday a ship sailing from Russia suspected of sabotaging an undersea telecoms cable running from Helsinki to Estonia across the Gulf of Finland , an area hit by a string of similar incidents in recent years.

The seized cargo vessel "Fitburg" was en route ​from the Russian port of St Petersburg to Israel at the time of the incident, Finland's Border Guard authority told a press conference ‍in Helsinki.

"At the moment we suspect aggravated disruption of telecommunications and also aggravated sabotage and attempted aggravated sabotage," Helsinki Chief of Police Jari Liukku told reporters.

Concern is growing in Europe at what officials see as ​an increase in hybrid threats from Russia since it launched its war in Ukraine, which Moscow denies.

Earlier this month, NATO 's ​top military commander said the alliance must be ready to respond to these types of threats to defend its territory.

Hybrid threats refer to both military and non-military tactics designed to undermine an adversary's security. They can include cyberattacks, disinformation campaigns, sabotage of key infrastructure and use of drones or irregular armed groups.

The Fitburg's 14 crew members were from Russia, Georgia, Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan, and were all held by Finnish police, investigators said. The ship sailed under the flag of St Vincent and Grenadines.

According to LSEG data, the owner of the vessel is Fitburg Shipping Company Ltd and the manager is Albros Shipping and Trading Ltd. Reuters was ‍not able to reach either of those companies via telephone.

Eight NATO states border the Baltic Sea, which also borders Russia. They have been on high alert after a string of outages of power cables, ​telecoms links and gas pipelines that run along the relatively shallow seabed since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022.

NATO has boosted its presence in the Baltic with frigates, aircraft and naval drones in recent years.

"We remain in contact with the Finnish authorities, through exchange of information, via the NATO ‌shipping centre located at our Allied Maritime Command in Northwood, UK," an official at the military alliance said.

The Fitburg was dragging its anchor in the sea, and was directed to Finnish territorial waters, the police and Finland's Border Guard said. The cable ‍belongs to Finnish telecoms group Elisa.

Estonia's justice ministry said a second telecoms cable connecting the country to Finland had also suffered an outage on Wednesday. It was not immediately clear if the cable, belonging to Sweden's Arelion, was running parallel to Elisa's.

An Arelion spokesperson confirmed that the company had suffered an outage.

"I'm concerned about the reported damage ... Hopefully it was not a deliberate act, but the investigation will clarify," Estonia's President Alar Karis said on X.

The European Commission was closely monitoring the incident, EU technology commissioner Henna Virkkunen wrote on X.

Finland in December 2024 boarded the Russian-linked oil tanker Eagle S which investigators said had damaged a ‍power cable and several telecoms links in the Baltic Sea by dragging its anchor.

A Finnish court in October dismissed a criminal case against the Eagle S captain and other crew members, ‌ruling prosecutors failed to prove intent ​and that any alleged negligence must be pursued by the ship's flag state or the crew's home countries.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 16:51:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/1e7a5fb0-e660-11f0-9e36-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/000-89CT2Q3.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia's Putin, in New Year address, voices confidence in victory in Ukraine</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/russias-putin-new-year-address-voices-confidence-victory-ukraine-2025-12-31/</link><description>MOSCOW, Dec 31 (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin used his annual televised New Year's address to rally his troops fighting in Ukraine, saying he believed in them and in victory in a war that he has framed as part of an existential struggle with the West.

U.S. President Donald Trump is trying to broker an end to the nearly four-year-old conflict, Europe's bloodiest conflagration since World War Two, with both sides' negotiating stances still far apart.

Dressed in a black coat, Putin - whose forces are advancing slowly but steadily in Ukraine - spoke about Russia's destiny and the unity of its people, which he said guaranteed the sovereignty and security of the "Fatherland".

He paid tribute in particular to his forces fighting in Ukraine, calling them heroes.

"Millions of people across Russia — I assure you — are with you on this New Year's Eve," said Putin.

"They are thinking of you, empathising with you, hoping for you. I wish all our soldiers and commanders a happy coming New Year! We believe in you and our Victory!"

His speech, which was first broadcast in Russia's far east, came as Russia released video footage of what it said was a downed drone, presenting it as evidence that Ukraine had tried this week to attack a presidential residence. Kyiv has dismissed Russia's allegation as a lie designed to derail peace talks.

In another video released on Wednesday, Russia's top general told troops to keep carving out buffer zones in Ukraine's Sumy and Kharkiv regions and said Moscow's forces had advanced faster in December than in any other month in 2025.

Reuters could not verify his battlefield assertion.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 17:19:52 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/IFCZ5KFZLNLVZBKNBIASZ4TYQI.jpg?auth=ad337853fcbac45e7afceea2f7625b2742eb7cd987e04feea6f90db11670773a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>What we know about the Saudi-led air strikes on ships in Yemen</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20251231-strike-ships-yemen-saudi-arabia-uae</link><description>Images of the air strike on Yemen’s port of Mukalla on Tuesday, December 30, 2025, have circulated widely across global media, including flames burning along the shoreline and a column of black smoke rising over the port.

The Saudi-led military coalition that carried out the strike claimed the bombardment targeted “weapons and combat vehicles” unloaded from two ships arriving from the port of Fujairah in the United Arab Emirates . According to the coalition, these arms were intended “to support the Southern Transitional Council (STC) forces”, a separatist group that has been waging an offensive for several weeks against the forces of Yemen’s internationally recognised government.

Saudi Arabia backs the government, which also faces opposition from Houthi rebels , a Shia Islamist movement that controls Yemen’s capital, Sanaa . While officially backing the internationally recognised government, the UAE has faced accusations from both Saudi Arabia and the Yemeni government of supporting STC separatists.

According to the Saudi Press Agency (SPA), the bombardment of the Mukalla port resulted in no casualties, a claim that available footage can neither confirm nor deny.

Regarding physical damage, however, a video released by AFP shows one of the targeted areas within the port. The footage clearly depicts dozens of white and beige vehicles parked near an industrial terminal. While some have been burned and completely destroyed, others appear untouched. Firefighters can be seen working among the charred remains of the vehicles to extinguish the blaze.

The scene can be geolocated to the port of Mukalla. It is one of the primary coastal cities in Hadramaut, the region currently targeted by the STC separatist offensive.

The vehicles appearing in this video are also identifiable as troop carriers manufactured by the UAE-based Streit Group. Specifically, the Spartan and Cougar models from their vehicle lineup can be recognised.

In a statement , the United Arab Emirates denied that the vehicles were bound for STC separatists, asserting that “they were not intended for any Yemeni party, but were shipped for use by UAE forces operating in Yemen ”.

This would not be the first time Streit Group vehicles have been identified in the hands of STC fighters. Several journalists and analysts documented their presence on the ground during the group's recent offensive in Hadramaut.

While the Saudi-led coalition’s statement claimed that cargo from "two ships" was targeted, the footage provided by the coalition to the media only shows one vessel in detail.

The letters "SAMC" are visible on a vessel's hull. According to the caption, the ship is the Greenland, which reportedly departed from the port of Fujairah in the UAE.

Data from maritime traffic-tracking sites confirm that the vessel departed from the United Arab Emirates. The ship called at the ports of Jebel Ali in Dubai and Fujairah. Its last known position was recorded off the coast of Yemen on December 26. Since then, the vessel appears to have disabled its tracking system – a common practice for vessels engaged in illicit economic activities or navigating high-risk waters.

According to MarineTraffic, which utilises a wider range of data sources, the vessel arrived at the port of Mukalla on December 28. It reportedly departed on December 30 for the Emirati port of Fujairah, suggesting the ship was not destroyed in the attack.

The "SAMC" logo on the hull refers to the vessel's owner: the Emirati-based Salem Al-Makrani Cargo Company. The Greenland is listed as part of the fleet on the company’s official website .

A second vessel from the same company followed the same path as the Greenland: the Socotra 3. It also transited through the ports of Jebel Ali and Fujairah before arriving at Mukalla on December 26, a few days before the bombing. This may be the second ship from Fujairah that the coalition mentioned.

As evidenced by footage captured following the attack, it appears that not all vehicles delivered by the two Emirati vessels were destroyed. Video released by the coalition shows several of the vehicles travelling in convoys away from the port.

Additional footage released throughout the day on December 30 shows a convoy of Streit Group-manufactured vehicles. Their models and colours match those delivered by Emirati vessels, with the white Cougar variants being identifiable.

These images were captured in the town of Buwaysh, east of Mukalla, where a local bank branch is visible in the background. While the filming date remains unverified, we could not find any record of the video prior to December 30. This suggests that the delivery of these vehicles to Mukalla was, at least in part, successful.

Following the bombardment of the port of Mukalla, Yemen’s internationally recognised government has cancelled a defence pact with the UAE, ordering its forces to leave the country within 24 hours. This demand, backed by Saudi Arabia, has prompted the UAE to announce the withdrawal of its troops from Yemen.

Some 63 percent of French people did not intend to watch the annual New Year 's address, according to the latest Toluna/Harris Interactive poll for LCI news channel, while the president's approval rating is at its lowest since 2017 at 25 percent.

Macron will attempt to regain some momentum and launch the final projects of his second five-year term during his New Year's address.

Macron "will be keen to show that he will do everything to ensure that 2026 is a year of action, a year of purpose", those close to him said ahead of his speech.

The framework of his address is already in place, with the challenges posed by the war in Ukraine – which will enter its fifth year in February – to figure prominently.

Other topics that will be addressed include social media regulation, the return of a voluntary conscription service in France and legislation on end-of-life care.

Macron wants to ensure that 2026 will be characterised by action and progress on a number of fronts, his entourage said.

Without "falling into blind optimism", Macron will also seek to combat the trend of " French bashing " – denigrating France – which is so often pushed by the "self-proclaimed patriots" on the far right .</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 17:43:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/12b9f8da-e5f6-11f0-965b-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/b0074072e43547de4ba9d58ce152e4051df35bfe.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US held talks with Ukraine, European countries on next steps in ending Ukraine war, Witkoff says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/us-held-talks-with-ukraine-european-countries-next-steps-ending-ukraine-war-2025-12-31/</link><description>Dec 31 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's advisers held talks on Wednesday with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and national security advisers from the UK, France and Germany to discuss the next steps in ending Russia's war in Ukraine, U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff said.

"We focused on how to move the discussions forward in a practical way on behalf of @POTUS' peace process, including strengthening security guarantees and developing effective deconfliction mechanisms to help end the war and ensure it does not restart," Witkoff said in a social media post.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and Ukraine's top negotiator Rustem Umerov also participated.

Zelenskiy said on Tuesday that national security advisers from Kyiv's "Coalition of the Willing" backers would meet in Ukraine on Saturday, and then country leaders would gather in France on January 6.

The Coalition grouping led by Britain and France includes more than 30 nations, though it was not immediately clear which would be taking part in the meetings.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 18:31:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/GKPFOWTLX5LJ3FVAODKEEGMQYE.jpg?auth=f315347f4e9a676528d58b9eb282a8b5d04fb77977eaffec4a8a37edfe62eb9a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US judge blocks Trump move to end protected status for thousands from Honduras, Nepal and Nicaragua</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-judge-blocks-trump-move-end-protected-status-thousands-honduras-nepal-2025-12-31/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Dec 31 (Reuters) - A U.S. federal judge on Wednesday blocked the Trump administration from ending deportation protections for thousands of migrants from Honduras, Nepal and Nicaragua after opponents argued the terminations were motivated by racial hostility.

The administration's decisions to end Temporary Protected Status for some 89,000 migrants failed to adequately consider conditions in the three countries that would prevent them from returning, San Francisco-based District Judge Trina Thompson wrote.

Thompson cited statements by Republican President Donald Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem portraying immigrants as criminals and a drain on U.S. society.

"These statements reflect a stereotyping of the immigrants protected under the TPS program as criminal invaders and perpetuate the discriminatory belief that certain immigrant populations will replace the white population," wrote Thompson, an appointee of Trump's Democratic predecessor, Joe Biden.

TPS provides deportation relief and work permits to people already in the U.S. if their home countries experience a natural disaster, armed conflict or other extraordinary event. Under the program, Noem has the authority to grant, extend or terminate TPS designations for specific countries.

Trump has sought to end most TPS enrollment as part of a broader effort to restrict both legal and illegal immigration. In TPS termination notices, the administration has said that allowing the migrants to remain in the U.S. is contrary to the country's interests.

The Supreme Court in October allowed the Trump administration to proceed with ending TPS for some 300,000 Venezuelans, but lower courts have continued to rule against other terminations. On Tuesday, a federal judge in Boston blocked a move to end protections for hundreds of migrants from South Sudan.

In her ruling, Thompson found that the National TPS Alliance, a group representing the TPS enrollees, had plausibly alleged the terminations were motivated by racial animus.

The program covers some 72,000 Hondurans, 13,000 Nepalese and 4,000 Nicaraguans, according to U.S. Department of Homeland Security estimates.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 19:17:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/PCQU2YOBCRMC7L5CQCSPNEMGRE.jpg?auth=99ca905ba7bf78f96a8aff1e3b3986bbe5af1837910ab40c664bef63636bfb02&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US targets crude oil tankers, firms in new Venezuela-related sanctions, Treasury website shows</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/us-targets-crude-oil-tankers-firms-new-venezuela-related-sanctions-treasury-2025-12-31/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Dec 31 (Reuters) - The United States on Wednesday imposed sanctions on four companies it said were operating in Venezuela’s oil sector as well as associated oil tankers, as President Donald Trump's administration increases pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.

The U.S. Treasury Department in a statement said it imposed sanctions on oil traders engaged in sanctions evasion for Maduro's government. Among the targets were four vessels, some of which the Treasury accused of being part of the so-called "shadow fleet".

"Today’s action further signals that those involved in the Venezuelan oil trade continue to face significant sanctions risks," the Treasury said in the statement.

The sanctions mark the latest action in Trump's pressure campaign on Maduro, which has included a ramped-up military presence in the region and more than two dozen military strikes on vessels allegedly trafficking drugs in the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea near the South American nation.

This month, Trump announced a blockade of all sanctioned vessels going in or out of Venezuelan waters as part of a strategy to pressure Maduro. The U.S. move has cut oil exports this month to about half of their November level.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 19:37:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/AJ54ICZPQFJCTDXBXK2WCMZRIY.jpg?auth=46b83184753bbcca3f47722594826764d364341a43b7a2651a3629bebd246afa&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Macron: allies will make commitments on protecting Ukraine at Jan 6 meeting</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/macron-allies-will-make-commitments-protecting-ukraine-jan-6-meeting-2025-12-31/</link><description>PARIS, Dec 31 (Reuters) - European leaders meeting in Paris on January 6 will make firm commitments towards protecting Ukraine after any peace deal with Russia is brokered, French President Emmanuel Macron said on Wednesday during his New Year Eve's speech.

Macron has convened a meeting of the so-called 'Coalition of the Willing' next Tuesday. The Coalition grouping led by Britain and France includes more than 30 nations.

"On January 6 in Paris, many European states and allies will make concrete commitments to protect Ukraine and ensure a just and lasting peace on our European continent," Macron said.

U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff earlier said that ways to strength security guarantees for Ukraine were discussed during Wednesday talks between U.S. officials, Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelenskiy and national security advisers from the UK, France and Germany.

In mid December, the leaders of several European countries including Germany, France and Britain, said there had been "strong convergence" with the U.S. after talks in Berlin and stated a list of goals for both sides to work towards.

These included commitments to supporting Ukraine's armed forces, a European-led peacekeeping force and guarantees to use force if Ukraine came under attack again.

Kyiv has come under intense pressure from the Trump administration to make concessions to Russia to enable a deal. Ukraine's European allies say any peace accord must ensure robust security guarantees backed by U.S. support.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 20:23:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WLJLF76EJVNJ3JAQXFGZYHG52M.jpg?auth=28e69e052636da73b8808b159bd856aca94ab02f420ef3b4a09028b98c57049e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>One killed, several security forces wounded in Syria's Aleppo after suicide attack</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/explosion-heard-syrias-aleppo-ekhbariya-tv-reports-2025-12-31/</link><description>Dec 31 (Reuters) - A suicide bomber targeted a police patrol in Aleppo in Syria, killing one person and wounding several members of the security forces, Syria's state news agency said on Wednesday.

On Monday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov alleged that Ukraine had tried to attack Putin's residence in the northern Novgorod region with dozens of drones, adding that Moscow would review its negotiating position as a result.

U.S. national security officials have found Ukraine did not target Putin or one of his residences in a drone strike, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday. Reuters could not immediately verify the report.

The paper reported the conclusion was supported by a CIA assessment that found no attempt to target Putin or one of his residences. A CIA spokesperson could not be immediately reached for comment.

U.S. President Donald Trump initially expressed sympathy for the Russian charge, telling reporters on Monday that Putin had informed him of the alleged incident and that he was "very angry" about it.

By Wednesday, he appeared more skeptical, sharing on social media a New York Post editorial accusing Russia of blocking peace in Ukraine.

Ukraine has denied it carried out such an attack, describing the allegation as a Russian disinformation campaign meant to drive a wedge between Kyiv and Washington after a meeting between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy that both sides described as cordial and productive.

In a detailed briefing paper that Ukraine distributed to European Union delegations on Tuesday and seen by Reuters, Kyiv alleged the Russian allegations were designed to "sabotage" agreements made during the South Florida meeting between Trump and Zelenskiy.

On Wednesday, Kaja Kallas, the EU's top diplomat, called Russia's claims "a deliberate distraction."

"No one should accept unfounded claims from the aggressor who has indiscriminately targeted Ukraine's infrastructure and civilians since the start of the war," she wrote on X.

As of Wednesday, there was no independent confirmation of the attack. But Russia's charges - and the European and Ukrainian reaction - underscored how both sides have sought to shape Trump's view of the war in Ukraine, now nearly four years old.

“There is no evidence” that Putin seeks peace and wants Ukraine to be successful, as Trump asserted last weekend after speaking to the Russian leader, said Kurt Volker, a former U.S. ambassador to NATO who served as special representative for Ukraine negotiations during Trump’s first term.

"All evidence is to the contrary,” he added.

The Russian and Ukrainian embassies in Washington did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The White House also did not immediately respond.

On Wednesday, Russia's defense ministry released video footage showing a senior officer, Major General Alexander Romanenkov, setting out details of how Moscow says it believes Ukraine attacked Putin's Novgorod residence.

The video included footage of a Russian serviceman standing next to fragments of a device that he said was a downed Ukrainian Chaklun-V drone carrying a 6-kg explosive device, which had not detonated.

Ukraine's foreign ministry dismissed the footage, saying it was "absolutely confident" no attack took place.

Before Lavrov made his accusation on Monday, Novgorod Governor Alexander Dronov said air defense and fighter jets were shooting down Ukrainian drones.

While Trump said on Monday the attack could have been a Russian false flag operation, he has at times appeared willing to accept controversial statements by Putin at face value.

Earlier this year, Trump repeated Putin’s assertions that Russian forces had encircled Ukrainian forces in Russia’s Kursk region, even as U.S. intelligence indicated that was not true.

The debate over the alleged Ukrainian attack also comes as some Western intelligence officials have quietly argued Russia has sought to delay additional punitive moves by Washington designed to force Moscow into a peace deal.

Reuters was unable to determine if the U.S. intelligence community has already made an assessment of the alleged attack or presented any relevant findings to Congress.

In the Ukrainian briefing paper seen by Reuters, Kyiv noted that in the hours after the alleged attack, various Russian officials made extremely similar comments in public that - in Ukraine's view - suggested pre-coordination among officials in Moscow.

The paper also noted that residents of a town near Putin's Novgorod residence told local media they heard no sounds of air defenses on the night of the alleged attack.

The Russian defense ministry published inconsistent accounts of the alleged Ukrainian drone attacks.

In a statement posted late on Sunday on its channel on the Telegram messaging platform, the ministry said 89 long-range Ukrainian attack drones were intercepted around the country between 7 a.m. the day before and 11 p.m. that evening.

They included 18 that were hit over the Novgorod region, it said, without alleging that any were involved in an attack on Putin’s residence there.

On Monday afternoon, the ministry issued a second statement that its air defenses had intercepted 91 drones, all of them bound for Putin’s residence, including 41 that were hit over Novgorod, between Saturday and Sunday.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 22:20:48 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/NIDEVIWJZJJLTLIUNUX663GJOA.jpg?auth=283b3ae32e71d18ebb64467e7ad56a44ba0f6171242922cd75fa7198da1cedc5&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Zelenskiy says he won’t sign weak deal that will only prolong war</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/zelenskiy-says-he-wont-sign-weak-deal-that-will-only-prolong-war-2025-12-31/</link><description>Dec 31 (Reuters) - Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in his New Year address to the nation, said late on Wednesday that Ukraine wanted the war to end, but not at any cost, adding he would not sign a "weak" peace agreement that would only prolong the war.

"What does Ukraine want? Peace? Yes. At any cost? No. We want an end to the war but not the end of Ukraine," Zelenskiy said in the address from his office, issued just before midnight. "Are we tired? Very. Does this mean we are ready to surrender? Anyone who thinks so is deeply mistaken."

The Trump administration has carried out more than 30 strikes against suspected drug boats in the Caribbean and Pacific since September in a campaign that has killed at least 110 people.

In a statement, the U.S. military's Southern Command said the military had carried out a strike against three vessels.

"Three narco-terrorists aboard the first vessel were killed in the first engagement. The remaining narco-terrorists abandoned the other two vessels, jumping overboard and distancing themselves before follow-on engagements sank their respective vessels," Southern Command wrote on X.

A U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said eight people had abandoned their vessels and were being searched for.

The Coast Guard told Reuters it had deployed a C-130 aircraft to look for survivors and was working with vessels in the area.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 22:21:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>EU warns Yemen developments risk Gulf stability</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/eu-warns-yemen-developments-risk-gulf-stability-2025-12-31/</link><description>Dec 31 (Reuters) - The European Union said on Wednesday that recent developments in the Yemeni provinces of Hadramout and Al Mahra threaten to bring new risks to the Gulf region.

Trump said in a social media post on Wednesday that he was removing the Guard troops for the time being. “We will come back, perhaps in a much different and stronger form, when crime begins to soar again — only a question of time!” he wrote.

Troops had already left Los Angeles after the president deployed them earlier this year as part of a broader crackdown on crime and immigration. They had been sent to Chicago and Portland but were never on the streets as legal challenges played out.

The president has made a crackdown on crime in cities a centrepiece of his second term and has floated invoking the Insurrection Act to prevent opponents from using the courts to block his plans.

He has said he sees his tough-on-crime approach as a winning political issue ahead of next year’s midterm elections .

In November, US Northern Command said it was “shifting and/or rightsizing” operations in Portland, Chicago and Los Angeles, but that there would be a “constant, enduring and long-term presence in each city”.

Trump’s push to deploy troops in Democrat -led cities has been met with legal challenges at nearly every turn.

The Supreme Court in December refused to allow the Trump administration to deploy National Guard troops in the Chicago area as part of its crackdown on immigration. The order was not a final ruling, but it marked a significant and rare setback from the high court for the president’s efforts.

In the nation’s capital, District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb sued to halt the deployment of more than 2,000 guardsmen.

Hundreds of troops from California and Oregon were deployed to Portland, but a federal judge barred them from going on the streets. A judge permanently blocked the deployment of National Guard troops there in November after a three-day trial.

California National Guard troops were removed from the streets of Los Angeles by December 15 after a court ruling. An appeals court had paused a separate part of the order that required control of the Guard to return to Governor Gavin Newsom .

In a court filing on Tuesday, the Trump administration said it was no longer seeking a pause in that part of the order, paving the way for the California National Guard to fully return to state control after Trump federalised the force in June.

California Attorney General Rob Bonta called the development a “major litigation victory” in a press release on Wednesday.

“For six months, California National Guard troops have been used as political pawns by a president desperate to be king,” Bonta said. “There is a reason our founders decided military and civilian affairs must be kept separate; a reason that our military is, by design, apolitical.”

Trump also ordered the deployment of the Tennessee National Guard to Memphis in September to combat crime, a move supported by the state’s Republican Governor Bill Lee and senators. A Tennessee judge blocked the use of the Guard, siding with Democratic state and local officials who sued.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 22:45:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/684d59d2-e0f5-11f0-9372-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2025-12-23T210932Z-1726505758-RC2D8HA495UL-RTRMADP-3-USA-COURT-TRUMP-ILLINOIS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>North Korea's Kim Jong Un attends New Year's celebrations, KCNA says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/north-koreas-kim-jong-un-attends-new-years-celebrations-kcna-says-2025-12-31/</link><description>SEOUL, Jan 1 (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un attended New Year's celebrations in Pyongyang including fireworks, patriotic songs and dances and a taekwondo demonstration, state media KCNA said on Thursday.

North Korea is expected to hold the 9th Congress of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea soon, which will lay out the country's plans for the next five years in various fields such as nuclear and weapons development, as well as the economy.

Kim also sent a New Year's message to North Korean troops fighting on Russia's side in the war in Ukraine, calling them the "greatest strength and pride and a strong pillar" of the country and saying he looks forward to their reunion back home.

The contract has a ceiling value of $328.5 million, with $157.3 million in foreign military sales funds obligated at the time of award, the Pentagon said in a statement , opens new tab .

Washington has formal diplomatic ties with China , but maintains unofficial ties with Taiwan and is the island's most important arms supplier . The U.S. is bound by law to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself, though such arms sales are a persistent source of friction with China.

Taiwan remained on high alert on Wednesday after China staged massive military drills around the island the previous day, keeping its emergency maritime response centre running as it monitored Chinese naval maneuvers, the coast guard said.

"This contract provides for the procurement and delivery of fifty-five Infrared Search and Track Legion Enhanced Sensor pods, processors, pod containers, and processor containers required to meet the urgent operational need of the Taiwan Air Force," the Pentagon said.

It added that the contract's work will be performed in Orlando, Florida, and is expected to be completed by June 2031.

In mid-December, the administration of President Donald Trump announced $11.1 billion in arms sales to Taiwan, the largest ever U.S. weapons package for the island which is under increasing military pressure from China.

China claims democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory, and it has not ruled out using force to take it under Chinese control. Taiwan, which rejects China's claims, condemned the latest drills as a threat to regional security and a blatant provocation.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 23:20:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/B5GS2RJH3JLONEW5ZFI4CHONVU.jpg?auth=223593a14afc23271413a041dd22d190379cb24bac6af393d712a2df3f0c64d0&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US military says three killed in strikes on alleged drug boats</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20251231-us-military-says-three-killed-in-strikes-on-alleged-drug-boats</link><description>The US military announced on Wednesday that three people were killed in strikes on three alleged drug boats in international waters, bringing the death toll in Washington’s campaign against what it says are narcotics traffickers to at least 110.

US Southern Command, which is responsible for American forces operating in Central and South America, said the strikes targeted “three narco-trafficking vessels travelling as a convoy”. All three people killed were on one boat.

The exact location of the strikes was not immediately made clear. Previous strikes have taken place in the Caribbean or the eastern Pacific.

The military said that the targeted vessels were operated by “designated terrorist organisations” that it did not identify.

Accompanying the statement, posted on X, was a video showing three boats travelling together at sea and then hit by a series of explosions.

“Three narco-terrorists aboard the first vessel were killed in the first engagement. The remaining narco-terrorists abandoned the other two vessels, jumping overboard and distancing themselves before follow-on engagements sank their respective vessels,” it said.

The military said it had notified the Coast Guard to “activate the search and rescue system”, without offering more details about the fate of those aboard the other boats.

Since September, the US military has carried out more than 30 such strikes on what it says are boats used to smuggle drugs to the United States, without providing any concrete evidence that the targeted boats are involved in trafficking.

International law experts and rights groups say the strikes likely amount to extrajudicial killings as they have apparently targeted civilians who do not pose an immediate threat to the United States.

In recent months, US President Donald Trump has waged a pressure campaign against Venezuela ’s leftist President Nicolas Maduro , accusing him of running a drug cartel.

Maduro denies the allegation and has accused Washington of seeking regime change to gain access to the Latin American country’s massive oil reserves.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 23:42:02 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/800dbe28-c20e-11f0-9bdd-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/000-74UP2KE.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Taiwan vows to defend sovereignty after China's military drill</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/taiwan-vows-defend-sovereignty-after-chinas-military-drill-2026-01-01/</link><description>TAIPEI, Jan 1 (Reuters) - Taiwan President Lai Ching-te said on Thursday the island is determined to defend its sovereignty and boost defence in the face of China's rising ambition for expansion, after Beijing fired rockets towards the island in a military drill.

Palestinian refugee agency, a U.N. spokesperson said.

The spokesperson said the move would "further impede" the agency's ability to operate and carry out activities.

"The Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations remains applicable to UNRWA ( United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East ), its property and assets, and to its officials and other personnel. Property used by UNRWA is inviolable," Stephane Dujarric, spokesman for the secretary-general, said while adding that UNRWA is an "integral" part of the world body.

UNRWA Commissioner General Phillipe Lazzarini also condemned the move, saying that it was part of an ongoing " systematic campaign to discredit  UNRWA and thereby obstruct" the role it plays in providing assistance to Palestinian refugees.

In 2024, the Israeli parliament passed a law banning the agency from operating in the country and prohibiting officials from having contact with the agency.

As a result, UNRWA operates in East Jerusalem, which the U.N. considers territory occupied by Israel. Israel considers all Jerusalem to be part of the country.

The agency provides education, health and aid to millions of Palestinians in Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria. It has long had tense relations with Israel but ties have deteriorated sharply since the start of the war in Gaza and Israel has called repeatedly for UNRWA to be disbanded, with its responsibilities transferred to other U.N. agencies.

The prohibition of basic utilities to the U.N. agency came as Israel also suspended of dozens of international non-governmental organizations working in Gaza due to a failure to meet new rules to vet those groups.

In a joint statement, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Iceland, Japan, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom said on Tuesday such a move would have a severe impact on the access of essential services, including healthcare. They said one in three healthcare facilities in Gaza would close if international NGO operations stopped.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 01:55:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CGHA6UP6LVNR5BHSCXNXV45BR4.jpg?auth=cd29fc083ea6cf5343277ed24d44c51f9ff06d68713b8d2e62ede9fafe00ad2c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Taiwan vows to defend sovereignty amid Chinese military drills</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260101-taiwan-vows-to-defend-sovereignty-amid-chinese-military-drills</link><description>Taiwan President Lai Ching-te said on Thursday that the island is determined to defend its sovereignty and bolster its defence in the face of China’s growing assertiveness, after Beijing fired rockets towards Taiwan during military drills .

“The international community is watching to see whether the Taiwanese people possess the resolve to defend themselves,” Lai said in a New Year’s speech broadcast live from the presidential office in Taipei.

He urged opposition parties to support his proposal to increase Taiwan’s defence spending by $40 billion, a plan currently stalled amid a political deadlock in the opposition-controlled parliament.

“Whether China can achieve its goals on schedule is one thing,” Lai said when asked about a US report suggesting China could have the capability to win a conflict over Taiwan by 2027.

“The coming year, 2026, will be a crucial one for Taiwan,” he added, saying the island must “make plans for the worst, but hope for the best.”

“We are willing to engage in exchanges and cooperation with China on an equal and dignified basis, promoting a peaceful and shared environment across the strait,” Lai said. “As long as China acknowledges the existence of the Republic of China and respects the Taiwanese people’s desire for a democratic and free way of life.”

China claims democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory and has not ruled out the use of force to bring it under Chinese control. Taiwan rejects these claims.

Lai’s speech came just two days after Chinese exercises named “Justice Mission 2025”. China fired dozens of rockets towards Taiwan and deployed a large number of warships and aircraft near the island, a show of force that drew concern from Western allies including the European Commission and the United Kingdom.

Taipei condemned the drills as a threat to regional security and a blatant provocation. Beijing announced late on Wednesday that it had completed the exercises, stating its military would continue to strengthen combat readiness.

China’s President Xi Jinping struck a familiar tone on Taiwan in his New Year’s address on Wednesday, repeating last year’s warning to what Beijing considers separatist forces that China’s “reunification” with Taiwan cannot be stopped.

The drills, China’s largest by area and the closest yet to Taiwan, forced the island to cancel dozens of domestic commercial flights and dispatch military jets and warships to monitor the exercises.

The Chinese manoeuvres began 11 days after the United States announced a record $11.1 billion arms package for Taiwan. China’s military said for the first time that the drills were aimed at deterring outside intervention.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 03:52:10 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/4a647a80-e510-11f0-b7a1-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25336133707524.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Finland seizes ship sailing from Russia after suspected cable sabotage in Baltic Sea</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/finland-suspects-ship-causing-undersea-cable-damage-president-says-2025-12-31/</link><description>HELSINKI, Dec 31 (Reuters) - Finnish police on Wednesday seized a ship sailing from Russia on suspicion of sabotaging an undersea telecoms cable running from Helsinki to Estonia across the Gulf of Finland, an area hit by a string of similar incidents in recent years.

The seized cargo vessel "Fitburg" was en route from the Russian port of St Petersburg to Israel at the time of the incident, Finland's Border Guard authority told a press conference in Helsinki.

"At the moment we suspect aggravated disruption of telecommunications and also aggravated sabotage and attempted aggravated sabotage," Helsinki Chief of Police Jari Liukku told reporters.

Concern is growing in Europe at what officials see as an increase in hybrid threats from Russia since it launched its war in Ukraine, which Moscow denies.

Earlier this month, NATO's top military commander said the alliance must be ready to respond to these type of threats to defend its territory.

Hybrid threats refer to both military and non-military tactics designed to undermine an adversary's security. They can include cyberattacks, disinformation campaigns, sabotage of key infrastructure and use of drones or irregular armed groups.

The Fitburg's 14 crew members were from Russia, Georgia, Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan, and were all held by Finnish police, investigators said. The ship sailed under the flag of St Vincent and Grenadines.

According to LSEG data, the owner of the vessel is Fitburg Shipping Company Ltd and the manager is Albros Shipping and Trading Ltd. Reuters was not able to reach either of those companies via telephone.

Eight NATO states border the Baltic Sea, which also borders Russia. They have been on high alert after a string of outages of power cables, telecoms links and gas pipelines that run along the relatively shallow seabed since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022.

NATO has boosted its presence in the Baltic with frigates, aircraft and naval drones in recent years.

"We remain in contact with the Finnish authorities, through exchange of information, via the NATO shipping centre located at our Allied Maritime Command in Northwood, UK," an official at the military alliance said.

The Fitburg was dragging its anchor in the sea, and was directed to Finnish territorial waters, the police and Finland's Border Guard said. The cable belongs to Finnish telecoms group Elisa.

Estonia's justice ministry said a second telecoms cable connecting the country to Finland had also suffered an outage on Wednesday. It was not immediately clear if the cable, belonging to Sweden's Arelion, was running parallel to Elisa's.

An Arelion spokesperson confirmed that the company had suffered an outage.

"I'm concerned about the reported damage... Hopefully it was not a deliberate act, but the investigation will clarify," Estonia's President Alar Karis said on X.

The European Commission was closely monitoring the incident, EU technology commissioner Henna Virkkunen wrote on X.

Finland in December 2024 boarded the Russian-linked oil tanker Eagle S which investigators said had damaged a power cable and several telecoms links in the Baltic Sea by dragging its anchor.

A Finnish court in October dismissed a criminal case against the Eagle S captain and other crew members, ruling prosecutors failed to prove intent and that any alleged negligence must be pursued by the ship's flag state or the crew's home countries.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:51:44 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/Z3F6EU7ZYROO5LXWRMIMRGVTHQ.jpg?auth=574d16f439f8dc019ef7217a81e10fb3809e39c926c6a361be0da9bf916e8165&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Several killed after explosion in Swiss ski resort bar, BBC reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/several-killed-after-explosion-swiss-ski-resort-bar-bbc-reports-2026-01-01/</link><description>Jan 1 (Reuters) - Several people were killed and others injured after an explosion in a bar in the Swiss ski resort of Crans-Montana, BBC reported on Thursday, citing police.

Pyongyang has sent thousands of troops to support Russia's nearly four-year invasion of Ukraine, according to South Korean and Western intelligence agencies.

At least 600 have died and thousands more have sustained injuries, according to South Korean estimates that could not be independently confirmed.

On Thursday Kim praised his men fighting in an "alien land", congratulating their "heroic" defence of the nation's honour and instructing them to "be brave", the state-run Korean Central News Agency said.

"As the whole country is enveloped in a festive atmosphere of greeting the new year, I all the more miss you, who are fighting bravely on the battlefields in the alien land even at this moment," he said.

Kim hinted that more overseas action could take place this year, highlighting "remarkable feats you will perform on the overseas battlefields".

Russian air defence units downed five Ukrainian drones headed ​for Moscow ‍on New Year's Eve, Mayor Sergei ​Sobyanin said.

Sobyanin, in a ​series of posts on Telegram over a little more than three hours into early on Thursday morning, said specialist ‍crews were examining fragments from ​the drones at the sites where they had hit the ‌ground.

Sobyanin made no mention of ‍casualties or damage.

Restrictions were placed on Moscow's Domodedovo airport for a time. Other airports in southern and ‍central Russia were also subject to ‌temporary ​restrictions.

Speaking in his New Year address to the nation, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Ukraine ⁠wanted the war to end, but not at any cost. He added that he would not sign a "weak" peace agreement that would only prolong the war.

Zelensky said Ukrainians were exhausted from nearly four years of war.

"What does Ukraine ​want? Peace? Yes. At any cost? No. We want an end to ​the war but not the end of Ukraine," Zelensky, wearing a dark green embroidered Ukrainian shirt, said in the 21-minute address issued just before midnight.

"Are we tired? Very. Does this mean we are ready to surrender? Anyone who thinks so is deeply mistaken."

Zelensky said any signature "placed on weak agreements only fuel the war".

"My signature will be placed on a strong agreement. And that is exactly what every meeting, every phone call, ‍every decision is about now," he said. "To secure a strong peace for everyone, not for a day, a week or two months, ​but peace for years."

Zelensky said weeks of US-led diplomacy, including his talks last weekend with US President Donald Trump in Florida, had produced a peace deal that was nearly ready.

"A ‌peace agreement is 90 percent ready, 10 percent remains," he said. "That 10 percent contains everything, it is the 10 percent that will determine the fate of peace, the ‍fate of Ukraine and Europe and how people will live."

Mamdani, a Democrat , was sworn in as the first Muslim leader of America’s biggest city, placing his hand on a Quran as he took his oath.

“This is truly the honour and the privilege of a lifetime,” Mamdani said in a brief speech.

The ceremony, administered by New York Attorney General Letitia James, a political ally, took place at the old City Hall station, one of the city’s original subway stops, known for its stunning arched ceilings.

In his first speech as mayor, Mamdani said the old subway station was a “testament to the importance of public transport to the vitality, the health and the legacy of our city”, as he announced the appointment of his new Department of Transportation commissioner, Mike Flynn.

The new mayor then closed with a smile. “Thank you all so much, now I will see you later,” he said, before heading up a flight of stairs.

Mamdani will be sworn in again, in grander style, at a public ceremony at City Hall at 1 p.m., to be administered by US Senator Bernie Sanders , one of the mayor’s political heroes. That will be followed by what the new administration is billing as a public block party on a stretch of Broadway known as the “Canyon of Heroes”, famous for its ticker-tape parades.

Mamdani now begins one of the most unrelenting jobs in American politics as one of the country’s most closely watched politicians.

In addition to being the city’s first Muslim mayor, Mamdani is also its first leader of South Asian descent and the first to be born in Africa. At 34, he is also the youngest mayor New York City has had in generations.

In a campaign that helped make “affordability” a buzzword across the political spectrum, the democratic socialist promised transformative change, with policies intended to lower the cost of living in one of the world’s most expensive cities. His platform included free childcare, free buses, a rent freeze for about one million households, and a pilot programme of city-run grocery stores.

But he will also have to contend with the less glamorous responsibilities of City Hall: dealing with rubbish, snow and rats, while being blamed for subway delays and potholes.

Mamdani was born in Kampala, Uganda, the son of filmmaker Mira Nair and academic and author Mahmood Mamdani. His family moved to New York City when he was seven, and he grew up in a post-9/11 city where Muslims did not always feel welcome. He became an American citizen in 2018.

He worked on political campaigns for Democratic candidates in the city before seeking public office himself, winning a state Assembly seat in 2020 to represent part of Queens.

Mamdani and his wife, Rama Duwaji, will leave their one-bedroom, rent-stabilised apartment in the outer boroughs to take up residence in the stately mayoral home in Manhattan.

He inherits a city on the upswing after years of slow recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Violent crime has fallen back to pre-pandemic lows, tourists have returned, and unemployment, which surged during the pandemic years, has also dropped to pre-COVID levels.

Yet deep concerns remain about high prices and rising rents.

Mamdani will also have to deal with Republican President Donald Trump .

During the mayoral race, Trump threatened to withhold federal funding from the city if Mamdani won and mused about sending National Guard troops to New York.

But Trump later surprised supporters and critics alike by inviting the Democrat to the White House for what turned out to be a cordial meeting in November.

“I want him to do a great job and will help him do a great job,” Trump said.

Still, tensions between the two leaders are almost certain to resurface, given their deep policy disagreements, particularly over immigration.

Mamdani also faces scepticism and opposition from some members of the city’s Jewish community over his criticisms of Israel’s government.

Since his election victory, the new mayor and his team have spent weeks preparing for the transition, surrounding Mamdani with seasoned figures who have worked inside or alongside city government.

That included persuading the city’s police commissioner, Jessica Tisch, to remain in her post — a move that helped calm fears in the business community that the new administration might pursue radical changes to policing strategy.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 06:38:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/b4ec0958-bc8a-11f0-bb0d-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25309163715647.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Swiss police say several people have died in fire at bar in ski resort</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/swiss-police-say-several-people-have-died-fire-bar-ski-resort-2026-01-01/</link><description>ZURICH, Jan 1 (Reuters) - Swiss police said on Thursday that several people had died and others were injured due to a fire of unknown causes at a bar called "Le Constellation" in the ski resort of Crans-Montana in southwestern Switzerland.

The governor, Vladimir Saldo, made the allegation in a statement on the Telegram messaging service.

Ukraine's military did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment, and Saldo did not provide visuals or other evidence that would enable Reuters to immediately verify the allegation.

Saldo alleged in his post that three Ukrainian drones had struck the site of new New Year celebrations in Khorly, a coastal village, in what he said was a "deliberate strike".

Russian state news agencies reported that at least 24 people had been killed and 29 more injured, citing the local branch of Russia's emergencies ministry.

Kherson is one of four regions in Ukraine which Russia claimed as its own in 2022, a move Kyiv and most Western countries condemned as an illegal land grab.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 08:30:03 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran Revolutionary Guard member reportedly killed during widening cost-of-living protests</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260101-iran-revolutionary-guard-member-reportedly-killed-during-widening-cost-of-living-protests</link><description>A volunteer member of Iran 's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard was killed in a western province during widening demonstrations sparked by the Islamic Republic's ailing economy , authorities said Thursday, marking the first fatality among security forces during the protests .

Spontaneous protests, driven by dissatisfaction at Iran's economic stagnation, began on Sunday in Tehran's largest mobile phone market, where shopkeepers shuttered their businesses, and have since drawn in students across the country.

The death Wednesday night of the 21-year-old volunteer in the Guard's Basij force may mark the start of a heavier-handed response by Iran's theocracy over the demonstrations, which have slowed in the capital, Tehran, but expanded to other provinces.

The state-run IRNA news agency reported on the Guard member’s death but did not elaborate. An Iranian news agency called the Student News Network, believed to be close to the Basij, directly blamed demonstrators for the Guard member's death, citing comments from Saeed Pourali, a deputy governor in Iran's Lorestan province.

The Guard member “was martyred ... at the hands of rioters during protests in this city in defence of public order”, he reportedly said. Another 13 Basij members and police officers suffered injuries, he added.

“The protests that have occurred are due to economic pressures, inflation and currency fluctuations, and are an expression of livelihood concerns," Pourali said. "The voices of citizens must be heard carefully and tactfully, but people must not allow their demands to be strained by profit-seeking individuals.”

The protests took place in the city of Kouhdasht, more than 400 kilometres southwest of Tehran.

A government building in southern Iran was also attacked on Wednesday, authorities said.

"A portion of the provincial governors' office door and its glass were destroyed in an attack by a number of people," said Hamed Ostovar, the head of the judiciary in the city of Fasa, as quoted by the justice ministry's Mizan agency, without specifying how the attack was carried out.

Iran's civilian government under reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian has been trying to signal it wants to negotiate with protesters . However, Pezeshkian has acknowledged there is not much he can do as Iran's rial currency has rapidly depreciated, with $1 now costing some 1.4 million rials.

Meanwhile, state television separately reported on the arrests of seven people, including five it described as monarchists and two others it said had linked to European-based groups. State TV also said another operation saw security forces confiscate 100 smuggled pistols, without elaborating.

The protests have yet to reach the scale of the 2022 nationwide protests triggered by the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody.

Iran's theocracy had declared Wednesday a public holiday across much of the country, citing cold weather, likely as a bid to get people out of the capital for a long weekend. The Iranian weekend is Thursday and Friday, while Saturday marks Imam Ali's birthday, another holiday for many.

Iran's economy has been in the doldrums for years, with heavy US and international sanctions over Tehran's nuclear programme weighing heavily on it.

The currency, the rial, has also plunged in recent months, losing more than a third of its value against the US dollar since last year.

In December, inflation stood at 52 percent year-on-year, according to official statistics.

Some basic necessities are becoming unaffordable for a portion of the population, which has been suffering from severe international sanctions against Iran for decades.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 08:31:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/722cac02-e6e3-11f0-8a30-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/2025-12-30T123528Z-941861327-RC20RIAYGVT9-RTRMADP-3-IRAN-ECONOMY-PROTESTS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israel says forces open fire on West Bank stone-throwers, one dead</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-says-forces-open-fire-west-bank-stone-throwers-one-dead-2026-01-01/</link><description>Jan 1 (Reuters) - The Israeli military said its forces killed a Palestinian in the occupied West Bank in the early hours on Thursday as they opened fire on people who were throwing stones at soldiers.

Two other people were hit on a main road near the village of Luban al-Sharqiya in Nablus, the military statement added. It described the people as militants and said the stone-throwing was part of an ambush.

Palestinian authorities in the West Bank said a 26-year-old man they named as Khattab Al Sarhan was killed and another person wounded.

Israeli forces had closed the main entrance to the village of Luban al-Sharqiya, in Nablus, and blocked several secondary roads on Wednesday, the Palestinian Authority's official news agency WAFA reported.

More than a thousand Palestinians were killed in the West Bank between October 2023 and October 2025, mostly in operations by security forces and some by settler violence, the U.N. has said.

Over the same period, 57 Israelis were killed in Palestinian attacks.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 09:27:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israel says it will 'enforce' ban on 37 NGOs in Gaza as humanitarian crisis deepens</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260101-israel-says-will-enforce-ban-37-ngos-gaza-humanitarian-crisis-deepens</link><description>Israel said on Thursday that 37 international NGOs operating in Gaza had not complied with a deadline to meet "security and transparency standards," in particular disclosing information on their Palestinian staff, and that it "will enforce" a ban on their activities.

More than 500 aid workers have been killed in the Palestinian territory since October, 2023.

"Organisations that have failed to meet required security and transparency standards will have their licenses suspended," said spokesman for the Ministry of Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism, Gilad Zwick.

Organisations that have had their license revoked will be forced to cease all activities by March 1, 2026.

Organisations that will have their licenses revoked include Doctors Without Borders ( MSF ), the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC), World Vision International, CARE and Oxfam, according to a list provided by Israel’s Ministry of Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism.

In March, Israel gave a ten-month deadline to NGOs to comply with the new rules, which expired on Wednesday night. The UN has warned that the ban will exacerbate the humanitarian situation in Gaza.

The foreign ministers of 10 nations on Tuesday expressed "serious concerns" about a "renewed deterioration of the humanitarian situation" in Gaza, describing the situation "catastrophic" .

"As winter draws in, civilians in Gaza are facing appalling conditions with heavy rainfall and temperatures dropping," the ministers of Britain, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Iceland, Japan, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland said in a joint statement released by the UK's Foreign Office.

"1.3 million people still require urgent shelter support. More than half of health facilities are only partially functional and face shortages of essential medical equipment and supplies. The total collapse of sanitation infrastructure has left 740,000 people vulnerable to toxic flooding," the statement added.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 09:49:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/1d2b48d0-e6f2-11f0-87b2-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25364625314103.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Swiss police believe around 40 died at Swiss bar explosion, Italy says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/swiss-police-believe-around-40-died-swiss-bar-explosion-italy-says-2026-01-01/</link><description>ROME, Jan 1 (Reuters) - Swiss police believe around 40 people died and 100 were injured in a fire during a New Year's Eve party in the resort town of Crans-Montana, the Italian Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Thursday.

State media said on Thursday the person killed was 21-year-old Amirhossam Khodayari Fard, a member of the paramilitary Basij militia which is regularly deployed to suppress unrest, though Reuters was unable to verify this.

The incident in Kuhdasht in Iran's western Lorestan province marks an escalation in the unrest that has spread across the country since shopkeepers began protests on Sunday over inflation and the falling currency.

It comes at a critical moment for Iran's clerical rulers as Western sanctions hammer an economy hit by 40% inflation and after Israeli and U.S. airstrikes in June targeted the country's nuclear infrastructure and military leadership.

Tehran has responded to the unrest with an offer of dialogue , a more conciliatory approach than it has taken during most previous bouts of unrest, though activists have also reported police flooding the streets.

Government spokesperson Fatemeh Mohajerani said on Thursday that the authorities would hold a direct dialogue with representatives of trades unions and merchants, but without giving details.

The activist HRANA news agency said late on Wednesday there was a heavy presence of security forces in cities with arrests, shootings and clashes in some areas. State media said students were detained then released during the demonstrations.

The Basij is a volunteer paramilitary force fiercely loyal to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and affiliated with the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, which said in a statement that 13 of the militia members had been injured.

Many Iranian social media users disputed the authorities' account of the incident and a video widely shared online that Reuters could not immediately verify appeared to show protesters trying to get an injured person into an ambulance.

The Revolutionary Guards statement accused those involved in the unrest in Kuhdasht of "taking advantage of the atmosphere of popular protests".

Merchants, shop owners and students in different Iranian universities have been demonstrating for days and closing major bazaar markets. The government shut down much of the country on Wednesday by declaring a holiday due to cold weather.

Authorities have in recent years quashed protests over issues ranging from high prices, droughts, women's rights and political freedoms, often with tough security measures and extensive arrests.

However, in an unusual response to the latest protests, President Masoud Pezeshkian said he had asked the interior minister to listen to "legitimate demands" of the demonstrators.

Iran's economy has been struggling for years as a result of U.S. and Western sanctions over Tehran's nuclear program. Regional tensions led to a 12-day air war with Israel in June, further straining the country's finances.

The Iranian rial has lost around half its value against the dollar in 2025, with inflation reaching 42.5% in December in a country where unrest has repeatedly flared in recent years.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 11:19:08 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Argentine soccer body in turmoil ahead of World Cup over mystery villa and dirty money claims</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sports/soccer/argentine-soccer-body-turmoil-ahead-world-cup-over-mystery-villa-dirty-money-2026-01-01/</link><description>BUENOS AIRES, Jan 1 (Reuters) - In March 2024, retired Argentine soccer star Carlos Tevez published a tweet , opens new tab hinting at something suspicious going on in a Buenos Aires suburb. The treasurer of the Argentine Football Association, Tevez claimed, was making many trips to Pilar, where he implied the soccer official had buried bags of money and kept a collection of antique cars.

Coalicion Civica, a progressive political party, began investigating after Tevez's post and filed a criminal complaint centered on a mystery villa in Pilar.

As the World Cup approaches, allegations that the villa may have been used for money-laundering have become one of a series of scandals gripping the soccer association that is in charge of the game in Argentina, the current world champions.

In early December, police raided the AFA headquarters and more than a dozen soccer clubs as part of a money-laundering probe that looked at transfers of money tied to clubs and a financial services company.

Three days later, authorities raided the Pilar villa, finding a heliport, stables and 54 vehicles, including luxury cars and collectible cars. In its criminal complaint, Coalicion Civica alleges the property is a front for a money-laundering scheme connected to Chiqui Tapia, the president of the AFA, and its treasurer, Pablo Toviggino.

Last week, in another case, a prosecutor charged Tapia, Toviggino and other AFA leaders for unlawful retention of taxes totaling $13 million following a complaint from Argentina’s tax agency, according to news outlet La Nacion.

The AFA did not respond to an inquiry from Reuters requesting an interview with both Tapia and Toviggino and for comment on the various judicial investigations that have been opened.

In a public statement, the association has said it is being attacked by the government of President Javier Milei, referring to how Milei has pushed for Argentina’s soccer clubs, which have long functioned as nonprofit entities run by their members, to become for-profit companies under private owners.

“We are on the right path,” the AFA said, listing competitions Argentina has won since Tapia became president in 2017, including the World Cup itself in 2022.

A representative for Tevez did not respond to an interview request. Toviggino did not respond to a request for comment.

Despite plaudits for Argentina’s performance on the field, the AFA is going through its biggest crisis in years.

“There are two AFAs,” said Nestor Centra, an Argentine sports journalist, referring to its international success and the instability at home.

Several months after Tevez’s tweet, Matias Yofe, president of Coalicion Civica's branch in Pilar, told Reuters that he and his colleagues talked to about 10 employees who had worked at the Pilar property and presumed that Toviggino or Tapia were the owners.

One person, Yofe said, described Tapia once arriving by helicopter and then gifting employees soccer jerseys.

“What they described was they moved as owners of the place, they got in the pool, used the facilities,” Yofe said. “Everyone indicated that this belongs to people of the AFA.”

Coalicion Civica’s complaint alleged that the property had been purchased in 2024 by a company owned by Ana Lucia Conte and Luciano Nicolas Pantano, a mother and son that it claimed could not afford the purchase. An attorney who has represented Pantano did not respond to a request for comment.

Records viewed by Reuters indicate that the property, several city blocks long, was bought for $1.8 million, although experts suspect it's worth much more. The complaint points to Pantano's connections with the soccer world, such as serving as the head of the Argentine Civil Association of Futsal and Beach Soccer.

According to court documents, officials during the raid found a black imitation leather bag branded with the AFA logo and Toviggino’s name, several books on soccer and a plaque honoring Toviggino. The 54 vehicles included a Ferrari and several Porsches, registered under the company the complaint attributed to Pantano and Conte.

An official with knowledge of the case said that Toviggino’s relatives had authorization to drive at least several of the cars, confirming a report by local television station TN. Authorities have requested information on the pilots who used the heliport in the hopes of learning about the passengers.

The justice ministry has demanded that the AFA and the Superliga, an association that handles transmission rights of matches, give explanations for accounting entries of nearly half a billion dollars going back to 2017. Daniel Vitolo, the head of the ministry’s Inspector General’s office, told Reuters that those amounts fall into categories on balance reports with generic names such as “others." The Superliga declined a request from Reuters for comment.

“If the AFA really has its papers in order, why doesn’t it explain something that’s very easy to explain?” he said.

Experts said it’s unlikely that the judicial cases will affect Argentina’s participation in the World Cup.

“No one can pay the political cost of doing that,” said Alan Wilder, a sports law attorney in Buenos Aires. “No one would approve of the mere idea of taking (Lionel) Messi out of the World Cup, with this possibly being his last World Cup. He’s the sacred cow.”

Soccer worldwide is no stranger to financial scandals, and in recent years top FIFA officials have been charged with corruption. Tapia’s predecessor resigned amid an investigation into irregularities involving management of match broadcasting funds. Those charged in the case were absolved this month.

Prior to the current scandals, AFA had already faced criticism by fans for favoritism. Many were angered when the AFA recently awarded Rosario Central, home team of national star player Angel Di Maria, a new and controversial trophy.

"I think the lid has been blown off the pot," said Enzo Gutierrez, 30, a Buenos Aires resident who roots for the team San Martin from his native province of San Juan. "It has grabbed my attention a lot but if you're a soccer fan you live knowing that these things happen in Argentine soccer."</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 11:19:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/C3VZHMAU3VMPNPB4LLXP3B5B7I.jpg?auth=c72f6f706277eff8e12d45181b85108a54c2d943f0b7177f92fb6dd3bda84dee&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukrainian drones strike Russian energy targets in Krasnodar, Tatarstan regions</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukrainian-drones-strike-russian-energy-targets-krasnodar-tatarstan-regions-2026-01-01/</link><description>MOSCOW, Jan 1 (Reuters) - Ukrainian drones struck an oil refinery in Russia's southern Krasnodar region, as well as an energy storage facility in the oil-rich Volga river region of Tatarstan, Russian authorities and Ukraine's military said on Thursday.

Debris from a drone had hit the Ilskiy oil refinery in Krasnodar, causing no casualties but igniting a fire that was later extinguished, local authorities said.

In Tatarstan, Russian media cited the local governor's press service as saying that an energy storage facility in the city of Almetyevsk had been hit, causing a blaze that was later put out.

Almetyevsk is located around 1,400 km (869 miles) from Ukraine.

The Ukrainian military said in a statement it had struck both facilities. Kyiv has been intensifying strikes against Russian energy infrastructure in recent months, aiming to cut off Moscow's sources of financing for its military campaign in Ukraine.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 12:45:03 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukraine condemns Russian new year drone attack on power infrastructure</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/ukraine-condemns-russian-new-year-drone-attack-power-infrastructure-2026-01-01/</link><description>Jan 1 (Reuters) - A Russian drone attack damaged power infrastructure in several Ukrainian regions overnight, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Thursday, while Moscow accused Ukraine of carrying out a deadly new year attack in a Russian-controlled part of Ukraine.

"On New Year, Russia deliberately brings war. Over 200 attack drones were launched onto Ukraine in the night," Zelenskiy wrote on Telegram.

Zelenskiy said energy infrastructure in seven regions across Ukraine had been targeted.

Russia accused Ukraine of killing at least 24 people, including a child, in a drone strike on a hotel and cafe where civilians were seeing in the New Year in a Russian-controlled part of Ukraine's southern Kherson region.

Ukraine's military, which has accused Russia of killing thousands of civilians in its own attacks on Ukrainian cities, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Moscow's accusation.

Zelenskiy said that Russia's holiday season attacks showed Ukraine could not afford delays in air defence supplies.

"(Our) allies have the names of equipment which we are lacking. We expect that everything agreed with the United States at the end of December for our defence will arrive on time," he said, without clarifying further.

Zelenskiy met with U.S. President Donald Trump in Florida on Sunday to negotiate a peace framework to end the nearly four-year war. Both leaders have said they are close to an agreement, but thorny issues around post-war control of territories remain.

The Ukrainian energy ministry said a "significant number" of households in the Volyn and Odesa regions - in northwestern and southwestern Ukraine, respectively - were disconnected from power supplies by the overnight strikes, as well as some in the Chernihiv region north of the capital Kyiv.

The governor of Volant said more than 103,000 households in that region had lost power as a result of the attack. Volyn region is several hundred kilometres from the front line and borders NATO member Poland.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 13:34:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/IMLOOZ7PH5KMFKKXKOXIYTXLKM.jpg?auth=117d345c066122527292812e7493b5a7fd49da72abbe1989cf7d3a0261bb6a3b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia says it will give U.S. proof of attempted Ukrainian strike on Putin residence</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-says-it-will-give-us-proof-attempted-ukrainian-strike-putin-residence-2026-01-01/</link><description>MOSCOW, Jan 1 (Reuters) - Russia said on Thursday it had extracted and decoded a file from a Ukrainian drone downed earlier this week that it said shows it had been targeting a Russian presidential residence and that it would hand over the relevant information to the United States.

Moscow accused Kyiv on Monday of trying to strike a residence of President Vladimir Putin in Russia's northern Novgorod region with 91 long-range attack drones. It said Russia would review its negotiating position in ongoing talks with the U.S. on ending the Ukraine war.

Ukraine and Western countries have disputed Russia's account of the alleged attempted strike.

In a statement posted on Telegram on Thursday, Russia's Defence Ministry said: "Decryption of routing data revealed that the final target of the Ukrainian drone attack on December 29, 2025, was a facility at the Russian Presidential Residence in the Novgorod region."

"These materials will be transferred to the American side through the established channels," it added.

The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday that U.S. national security officials had found Ukraine did not target Putin or one of his residences in a drone strike. Reuters could not immediately verify the report.

U.S. President Donald Trump initially expressed sympathy for the Russian charge, telling reporters on Monday that Putin had informed him of the alleged incident and that he was "very angry" about it.

By Wednesday, Trump appeared more sceptical, sharing on social media a New York Post editorial accusing Russia of blocking peace in Ukraine.

Ukraine has denied carrying out such an attack and described the accusation as part of a Russian disinformation campaign meant to drive a wedge between Kyiv and Washington after a weekend meeting between Trump and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 13:35:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/SFD6Y6BWAFNEHLTRAK5PCTQ7IQ.jpg?auth=3eac6b4dfc2c835c3f936b8764a66233ccb1c4214a6de2c52c73b5dc833bc9fa&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Somalia says it killed 29 al-Shabaab militants with international support</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/somalia-says-it-killed-29-al-shabaab-militants-with-international-support-2026-01-01/</link><description>NAIROBI, Jan 1 (Reuters) - Somalia's armed forces have eliminated 29 al-Shabaab militants in the town of Jabad Godane in southeastern Somalia, in coordination with international partners, the Defence Ministry said in a statement on Thursday.

Al-Shabaab has waged an insurgency in Somalia since 2007 in a bid to topple the internationally-backed central government and establish its own rule based on its strict interpretation of sharia law.

The ministry said in a statement on X that it also destroyed vehicles and weapons "that were intended for use in terrorist attacks against civilians," through airstrike operations in the Middle Shabelle region conducted overnight.

"The Ministry of Defence extends its appreciation to international partners for their continued support in security cooperation, intelligence sharing, and operational enablement in the fight against terrorism," it said but did not specify which partners it was referring to.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 13:35:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Bulgaria celebrates entry into euro zone, lev currency banished into history</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/bulgaria-celebrates-entry-into-euro-zone-lev-currency-banished-into-history-2026-01-01/</link><description>SOFIA, Jan 1 (Reuters) - EU member Bulgaria marked its entry into the euro zone on Thursday with a display of euro coins on the facade of the central bank in Sofia and fireworks to celebrate a long-awaited milestone.

As of midnight the euro became the country's currency and the lev was banished into history.

Bulgaria's entry into the euro zone will take the number of Europeans using the currency to more than 350 million. The last country to join the single currency group was Croatia in January 2023.

"Our money will be in a different currency - if I have 10,000 leva, now I will have 5,100 euros. It's all the same. And I think it will be better." Stefan Bisterkov, a driving instructor, said.

Aside from changing currency, becoming the euro zone's 21st member means Bulgaria gets a seat at the European Central Bank's rate-setting Governing Council.

Successive Bulgarian governments have tried to make the step since the Balkan country of 6.7 million people joined the EU in 2007. Bulgarians are split on the issue, opinion polls show, although businesses are largely in favour.

"My expectations from (adopting) the euro are positive, I don't think there will be anything to worry about, quite the opposite. We will only benefit from this, and it will only be more useful for us," said Antonia Tsvetkova, a jeweller.

"Anyone who goes on a trip will not have problems exchanging currency, now everything will be normal."

Some Bulgarians worry that using the euro will push up prices, or are suspicious of a domestic political establishment that is in crisis. The government stepped down last month amid widespread protests against proposed tax increases.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 13:35:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/6RBBZ5TDHVNW3DYRVBXPOV6ZUI.jpg?auth=8f4bb39fb7853dce7ebcec333524a68a8e4b92cda8261e8824904a218395c8c9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UK says small boat migrant arrivals approached record levels in 2025</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260101-uk-says-small-boat-migrant-arrivals-approached-record-levels-2025</link><description>The second-highest annual number of migrants arrived on UK shores in small boats since records were started in 2018, government statistics confirmed on Thursday.

The tally comes as Brexit firebrand Nigel Farage 's anti-immigration party Reform UK surges in popularity ahead of bellwether local elections in May.

With Labour Prime Minister Keir Starmer increasingly under pressure over the thorny issue, his interior minister Shabana Mahmood has proposed a drastic reduction in protections for refugees and the ending of automatic benefits for asylum seekers.

Home Office data showed that no small boats were detected on December 31, meaning a total of 41,472 migrants landed on England 's southern coast in 2025 after making the perilous Channel crossing from northern France .

The record of 45,774 arrivals was recorded in 2022 under the last Conservative government.

Former Tory prime minister Rishi Sunak vowed to "stop the boats" when he was in power.

Ousted by Starmer in July 2024, he later said he regretted the slogan because it was too "stark" and "binary" and lacked sufficient context "for exactly how challenging" the goal was.

Adopting his own "smash the gangs" slogan, Starmer pledged to tackle the problem by dismantling the people smuggling networks running the crossings, but has so far had no more success than his predecessor.

Reform has led Starmer's Labour Party by double-digit margins in opinion polls for most of 2025.

In a New Year message, Farage predicted that if Reform got things "right" at the forthcoming local elections "we will go on and win the general election" due in 2029 at the latest.

Without addressing the migrant issue directly, he added: "We will then absolutely have a chance of fundamentally changing the whole system of government in Britain."

In his own New Year message, Starmer insisted his government would "defeat the decline and division offered by others".

Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch, meanwhile, urged people not to let "politics of grievance tell you that we're destined to stay the same".

The small boat figures come after Home Secretary Mahmood in November said irregular migration was "tearing our country apart".

In early December, an interior ministry spokesperson called the number of small boat crossings "shameful" and said Mahmood's "sweeping reforms" would remove the incentives driving the arrivals.

A returns deal with France had so far resulted in 153 people being removed from the UK to France and 134 being brought to the UK from France, border security and asylum minister Alex Norris said.

"Our landmark one-in one-out scheme means we can now send those who arrive on small boats back to France," he said.

The past year has seen multiple protests in UK towns over the housing of migrants in hotels.

Amid growing anti-immigrant sentiment, in September up to 150,000 massed in central London for one of the largest-ever far-right protests in Britain, organised by activist Tommy Robinson.

Asylum claims in Britain are at a record high, with around 111,000 applications made in the year to June 2025, according to official figures as of mid-November.

Labour is currently taking inspiration from Denmark 's coalition government – led by the centre-left Social Democrats – which has implemented some of the strictest migration policies in Europe.

Senior British officials recently visited the Scandinavian country, where successful asylum claims are at a 40-year low.

But the government's plans will likely face opposition from Labour's more left-wing lawmakers, fearing that the party is losing voters to progressive alternatives such as the Greens.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 14:21:19 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/54ace03c-8d71-11f0-ad9a-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/878996b3e56b816308cf78bfe216bec9e121b485.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>More about the Crans-Montana resort</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/crans-montana-swiss-resort-centre-deadly-bar-fire-2026-01-01/</link><description>BERLIN, Jan 1 (Reuters) - Following are some key facts about the Swiss resort of Crans-Montana where officials said dozens of people were killed and 100 injured, most of them seriously, after a fire tore through a crowded bar during a New Year's Eve party.

Crans-Montana is in the Swiss Alps in the French-speaking part of the canton of Valais. It lies on a plateau above the city of Sierre, around 1,500 metres (4,920 feet) above sea level, with views of the Valais Alps and the Weisshorn mountain.

The resort has attracted a long line-up of celebrities, including James Bond star Roger Moore who lived there until his death in 2017. Model Claudia Schiffer, actor Hugh Grant and former French President Nicolas Sarkozy have all passed through.

It hosts major events including the Omega European Masters golf tournament, which drew more than 48,000 spectators in 2024, and the Alpine Ski World Cup, attended by 37,000 people.

Around three million people visit Crans-Montana every year, far more than its local population of 10,500.

From November 2023 to October 2024, Swiss travellers accounted for 66% of hotel stays, according to Crans-Montana Tourism &amp; Congress Committee data.

This was followed by tourists from France (7.3%), Italy (3.7%), Britain (3.5%), the United States (2.8%), the Gulf states (2.4%), Belgium (2.1%) and Germany (2.0%).

Crans-Montana's ski operations are part of the international Epic Pass network operated by U.S.-listed Vail Resorts (MTN.N) , opens new tab , which acquired the resort's ski lift company in 2024.

Vail Resorts manages 42 mountain sites, including Crans-Montana and Andermatt-Sedrun in Switzerland.

In its December 2025 capital plan, Vail highlighted the rising importance of its Swiss resorts in attracting U.S. visitors and boosting revenue in Europe.

The resort has 140 km (87 miles) of ski slopes, mountain biking trails, hiking routes and championship golf courses, according to its annual report.

It also has 2,678 hotel beds and many holiday apartments. In 2024, 1.45 million Swiss francs ($1.83 million) of central reservation sales and 283,515 Swiss francs from activity bookings were recorded.

The Saudi-backed, internationally recognized Yemeni government ordered new restrictions on flights to and from the UAE, aiming to curb escalating tensions in Yemen, a Saudi source told Reuters.

But the move triggered a defiant response: Yemen’s transport minister, aligned with Yemen's southern separatists, ordered a full shutdown of air traffic rather than comply.

The Southern Transitional Council, the UAE-backed Yemeni separatist force that seized most of southern Yemen last month, blamed the closure on “sudden new regulations” Saudi Arabia sought to impose.

The UAE Foreign Ministry did not immediately reply to a request for comment on the airport closure.

The tussle is the latest in a deepening crisis in Yemen that has exposed a deep rift between the two Gulf oil powers.

Saudi Arabia this week accused the UAE of pressuring Yemen's STC to push towards the kingdom's borders and declared its national security a "red line," prompting the UAE to say it was pulling its remaining forces out of Yemen.

That followed an airstrike by Saudi-led coalition forces on the southern Yemeni port of Mukalla that the coalition said was a dock used to provide foreign military support to the separatists.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 15:23:02 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/Y22AAQLLSRNSXEMBDYEV743ZM4.jpg?auth=f349ecb75dd6350610bdd401ca6e34de729636cf9e68a68382499773ae24d38b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump tells WSJ he is taking more aspirin than doctors recommend</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-tells-wsj-he-is-taking-more-aspirin-than-doctors-recommend-2026-01-01/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 1 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal that he is taking a larger daily dose of aspirin than his doctors recommend.

"They say aspirin is good for thinning out the blood, and I don’t want thick blood pouring through my heart," Trump told the paper in an interview published on Thursday. "I want nice, thin blood pouring through my heart. Does that make sense?"

Trump, 79, is the second-oldest person to ever hold the presidency, following his Democratic predecessor President Joe Biden, who dropped his 2024 reelection bid amid questions about his fitness for the job and was aged 82 when he left office a year ago.

Trump's health has been in the spotlight in recent months due to bruises that have been spotted on his hands and an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) exam that he was reported to have undergone in October, as well as instances where the Republican president closed his eyes during public events.

Daily use of aspirin can lower the chances of heart attack or stroke for people over the age of 60, according to the Mayo Clinic, which says a low dose of aspirin is most commonly 81 milligrams.

The president's doctor, Sean Barbabella, told the Journal that Trump takes 325 milligrams of aspirin daily for cardiac prevention.

The bruising is the result of him shaking so many hands , according to the White House, which said last month the MRI was preventative .

When asked about the MRI, Trump and Barbabella told the Journal that the president actually got a CT scan.

Barbabella said Trump's doctors had initially said they would perform either an MRI or a CT scan but decided to do the latter "to definitively rule out any cardiovascular issues."

It revealed no abnormalities, according to Barbabella.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 15:23:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/JS5MXIV3E5PB5CUZYEADUV6E74.jpg?auth=4d58f51f63bb61e229460ed5f58c7d805aca29e57ddd523ea8aad88c450d4d5a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Togo releases Frenchman detained since June over anti-government protests</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/africa/20260101-togo-releases-frenchman-detained-since-june-over-anti-government-protests</link><description>A Frenchman detained last year in Togo over alleged involvement in anti-government protests arrived back in France on Thursday after his release, the French foreign ministry said.

Steeve Rouyar, a 44-year-old father of two originally from Guadeloupe , had been living in the west African nation since late 2024 when he was arrested in June.

The prosecutor's office in the capital Lome said he was one of around 50 protesters arrested on June 6 during a rare anti-government demonstration in Togo, led with an iron fist by Faure Gnassingbe for the past two decades.

"A decision by the Togolese judiciary" allowed his release, the French foreign ministry said, without providing further details.

The demonstrations began in response to calls for civil disobedience sent out on social media by the June 6 Movement (M66), whose name refers to the longtime Togolese leader's birthday and the day the protests began.

A source following the case, speaking on condition of anonymity as they were not allowed to speak to the press, told AFP in September that Rouyar had been accused of "undermining state security", a charge that can be punished with two to three decades in jail.

He was also accused of helping make flyers, the source said.

The Togolese government said on Wednesday that Gnassingbe has pardoned 1,511 prisoners, but there was no immediate list of the names of those released. Such pardons are common at the end of the year.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 15:24:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/91512e5e-e71b-11f0-b3dd-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/000-73QT363.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>New Year party at Swiss ski resort turned into a disaster zone</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/new-year-party-swiss-ski-resort-turned-into-disaster-zone-2026-01-01/</link><description>CRANS-MONTANA, Switzerland, Jan 1 (Reuters) - As he approached Le Constellation bar to celebrate the New Year in a snowy Swiss ski resort bright with Christmas lights, Dominic Dubois saw flames engulfing the building.

"You could see the orange, the orange, yellow, red," Dubois told Reuters, describing chaotic scenes as bystanders and emergency crews worked together to pull victims clear.

He described how people who had managed to escape the burning building were plunged into the cold outside. "So one of the priorities was to get everyone warm ... the curtains of the restaurant were used," he said.

Dozens of people were killed and around 100 injured when fire tore through the crowded bar during a New Year's Eve party in the Crans-Montana resort , officials said on Thursday.

Nearby, local resident Samuel Rapp, 21, was dining at a Mexican restaurant when he heard of the blaze, and rushed with his girlfriend to Le Constellation, a bar popular with young locals.

"Police and paramedics ... had already set up a protective perimeter," he told Reuters. "There were people screaming, and then people lying on the ground, probably dead. They had jackets over their faces."

Fire broke out in the bar at 1.30 a.m. (0030 GMT). The cause of the blaze, which was initially reported as an explosion, was not yet clear but authorities said it appeared to be an accident rather than an attack.

Rapp said he had seen videos showing desperate partygoers trampling each other to escape. "People were shouting, 'help me, please help us.'"

The local branch of UBS bank opened up to give refuge to survivors, said Dubois, standing at the police cordon on Thursday in a green knitted hat.

"All the tables were pushed aside and people entered and it was warm in there, there was more light as well, so the triage was down there," he said.

"Paramedics, police - not the firemen, the firemen were out here. And then it was just ambulances coming back and forth as much as possible."

Video footage showed lines of ambulances queuing and helicopters landing to take victims of the blast to nearby hospitals and specialist burns units in other Swiss cities.

A waiter in a restaurant near the bar, who declined to be named, said first responders approached staff to ask for tablecloths to cover the bodies to conceal them from onlookers.

In daylight on Thursday, the bar was covered in white sheeting with a tent set up outside and a grey hearse parked in front.

In this retrospective featuring more than 180 photographs, Parr turns his eye on subjects related to environmental destruction, including mass tourism, over-consumption and the omnipresence of plastic in daily life.

The exhibition is also a chance to look back on 50 years of work from the beloved artist, who died in December .

Global Warning at the Jeu de Paume Paris runs from January 30 to May 24.

Pierre-Auguste Renior’s reputation as a “painter of happiness” sometimes saw him derided as a lightweight by his peers, but will no doubt make for an exhibition to lift the spirits.

The theme of love will be explored through around 50 of the impressionist’s paintings, focusing on scenes from everyday life. In these, Renoir represented luminous and vibrant moments of human connection during shared meals, conversations and dancing.

Renoir et l’amour at the Musée d’Orsay runs from March 17 to July 19.

This blockbuster show features more than 230 paintings, drawings, books and Cut Outs documenting the final years of Henri Matisse’s career. The modern master is known for his vivid and innovative use of colour, particularly in his Cut Outs in which he used brightly coloured paper shapes to represent nature , animals and the human form.

Visitors will get a chance to see works borrowed from Paris’ Pompidou centre (which is currently closed for renovation until 2030) and international collections, including Sorrows of the King, Danseuse Créole (“Creole Danser”) and Matisse’s famous Blue Nudes.

Matisse 1941-1954 at the Grand Palais runs from March 24 to July 26.

For billions of gamers around the world, music is an essential and evocative component of successful worldbuilding. With 20 installations investigating the relationship between artistry, storytelling and technology, this interactive exhibition explores the history of video game music, from early sound chips to modern audio landscapes.

Alongside the exhibition, concert-goers can buy tickets for orchestral performances of scores from popular games, including Final Fantasy and Assassin’s Creed.

Video games et music at the Philharmonie de Paris runs from April 3 to January 10, 2027.

Hollywood icon Marilyn Monroe would have celebrated her 100th birthday in 2026 and French film museum the Cinématheque is marking the occasion with an exhibition in her honour.

Monroe was a talented comedic actress who starred in more than 30 films, but her technical skill was often eclipsed by her megawatt fame, looks and personal life. This exhibition commemorates her greatest film performances and investigates what the enduring fascination with the star says about the public’s relationship with Hollywood and celebrity .

Marilyn Monroe: 100 ans at the Cinémathèque Française runs from April 8 to July 26.

For two weeks in June, Paris’s oldest bridge will be transformed into a giant cave by the French street artist known as JR. The ambitious installation was inspired by the rocks used to create Pont Neuf’s stone bricks and aims to create a rugged juxtaposition to the capital’s traditional architecture . It is also an homage to artists Christo et Jeanne-Claude, who famously wrapped the bridge in 41,800 square metres of fabric in 1985.

Originally planned for 2025, the JR project was postponed by a year to allow for complicated logistics. It will be freely accessible to visitors who will be able to walk across the bridge and pass underneath on boats while the artwork is in place.

La Caverne du Pont Neuf will be open to the public from June 6-28.

The Netherlands traditionally rings in the New Year with people setting off their own fireworks, which causes hundreds of injuries and millions of euros in damage every year. This year, some 250 people were arrested on New Year's Eve and in several towns riot police were deployed, police said.

"The impact of heavy fireworks and arson this New Year's Eve in some areas was utterly devastating. The targeted violence against emergency services and police was intense again," police said in a statement on Thursday.

The fireworks accidents killed a 38-year-old man in Aalsmeer, close to Amsterdam, and a boy from Nijmegen, a town in the east of the country, police said.

In Amsterdam, the neo-Gothic Vondelkerk, near the city's central Vondelpark, was destroyed by a fire that started shortly after midnight.

The Amsterdam police and fire department said they were investigating and had no comment yet on what caused the blaze in the church, which was built in 1872.

New Year's Eve 2025 marked the last year before a nationwide ban on the sale of fireworks to consumers will come into effect.

Emergency room doctors, police, firefighters and local and national politicians have campaigned for the ban for years.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 16:53:49 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5KCOVJXVANI27B2O3EOLREY7U4.jpg?auth=4b6bc800a2707775280efaa5fdd7844c9ba9eae6036591c06026c1533414c6de&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia and Ukraine trade allegations of civilian attacks on New Year's day</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-ukraine-trade-allegations-civilian-attacks-new-years-day-2026-01-01/</link><description>KYIV, Jan 1 (Reuters) - Russia and Ukraine accused each other of targeting civilians over the New Year, with Moscow reporting a deadly strike on a hotel in territory it occupies in southern Ukraine while Kyiv said there had been another broad attack on its power supplies.

The reports coincide with intensive talks aimed at bringing an end to the nearly four-year-old war , overseen by U.S. President Donald Trump. Both countries have said the other is doing all it can to influence his views and shape the outcome.

"On New Year, Russia deliberately brings war. Over 200 attack drones were launched onto Ukraine in the night," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy wrote on Telegram, saying energy infrastructure in seven regions across Ukraine had been targeted.

Russia accused Ukraine of killing at least 24 people, including a child, in a drone strike on a hotel and cafe where civilians were seeing in the New Year in a Russian-controlled part of the Kherson region in southern Ukraine.

Ukraine's military, which has accused Russia of killing many civilians in its own attacks on Ukrainian cities, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Zelenskiy said that Russia's holiday season attacks showed Ukraine could not afford delays in air defence supplies.

"(Our) allies have the names of equipment which we are lacking. We expect that everything agreed with the United States at the end of December for our defence will arrive on time," he said, without clarifying further.

Vladimir Saldo, the Russian-installed governor of the region, said three Ukrainian drones had hit the celebrations in Khorly, a coastal village, in what he said was a "deliberate strike" against civilians. He said that many people had been burnt alive.

Russia's Foreign Ministry said that as well as the 24 dead, 50 people had been injured, including six minors who were being treated in hospital.

"There is no doubt that the attack was planned in advance, with drones deliberately targeting areas where civilians had gathered to celebrate New Year's Eve," the ministry said in a statement, calling the attack a "war crime".

On Monday, Moscow accused Kyiv of trying to strike a residence of President Vladimir Putin . Ukrainian and European officials have said the incident did not happen and U.S. security officials were also reported to have found that Ukraine did not target the residence. Russia said on Thursday it would send Washington proof.

Reuters was not able to immediately verify the reported Kherson region attack or photographs of what Saldo's press service said was the aftermath on Thursday.

The images showed at least one dead body was visible beneath a white sheet. The building showed signs that a fire had raged and there were what looked like blood stains on the ground. Russia's TASS news agency published video showing drone fragments, some with Ukrainian writing on them.

Ukrainian officials regularly report civilian deaths from Russian air attacks, including in the Ukrainian-held city of Kherson, which lies near the front line.

The Ukrainian governor of Kherson region, Oleksandr Prokudin, said that one man had been killed and an 87-year-old woman injured in attacks on the city on Thursday, posting a video showing the woman's badly damaged apartment.

Ukraine's deputy prime minister Oleksiy Kuleba said rail facilities had been attacked in three regions, including a locomotive depot and a station in the frontline region of Sumy.

The Russian defence ministry said on Thursday its strikes had hit military targets, as well as energy infrastructure which it claimed was being used to support Ukraine's military.

In a separate report, Russia-appointed Saldo said later that a five-year-old child had been killed and three more people injured in a Ukrainian drone strike on a car near Tarasivka, another coastal village, close to Khorly. He did not provide evidence.

Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of Russia's Security Council, told TASS that those who carried out the hotel attack and their commanders should be targeted.

Kherson is one of four regions in Ukraine which Russia claimed as its own in 2022, a move Kyiv and most Western countries denounced as an illegal land grab.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 16:54:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KB7CCJ7TQNKCFMZP6IJACG34MY.jpg?auth=ffb662a0eac1fcc488b8527ee8a3c5dc052828a6355fa7b93e528d7d375bedb0&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US health insurance costs to rise by 114% for millions as subsidies expire</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260101-health-insurance-costs-rise-114-percent-millions-americans-obamacare-subsidies-expire</link><description>Enhanced tax credits that have helped reduce the cost of health insurance for the vast majority of Affordable Care Act (ACA, also known as "Obamacare") enrollees expired overnight, cementing higher health costs for millions of people in the United States at the start of the new year.

The change affects a diverse cross-section of the population who don’t get their health insurance from an employer and don’t qualify for Medicaid or Medicare – a group that includes many self-employed workers, small business owners, farmers and ranchers.

On average, the more than 20 million subsidised enrollees in the Affordable Care Act programme are seeing their premium costs rise by 114 percent in 2026, according to an analysis by the healthcare research nonprofit KFF.

The subsidies were first given to Affordable Care Act enrollees in 2021 as a temporary measure to help US residents get through the Covid-19 pandemic. Democrats in power at the time then extended them, pushing the expiration date to the start of 2026. Some lower-income enrollees received health care with no premiums, and high earners paid no more than 8.5 percent of their income. Eligibility for middle-class earners was also expanded.

Democrats forced a 43-day government shutdown over the issue, demanding the health subsidies be extended before they agreed to a new Republican budget. Some Republicans also called for a bipartisan solution to save their 2026 political aspirations, given the ACA's popularity – two-thirds of Americans favour the system , according to KFF.

But while congressional Republicans acknowledged the issue needed to be addressed, they refused to put it to a vote until late in the year. A House vote expected in January could offer another chance, but success is far from guaranteed.

Health analysts have predicted the expiration of the subsidies will drive many of the 24 million total Affordable Care Act enrollees – especially younger and healthier Americans – to forgo health insurance coverage altogether.

Over time, that could make the programme more expensive for the older, sicker population that remains.

The surging healthcare prices come alongside an overall increase in health costs in the US, which are further driving up out-of-pocket costs in many plans.

It also comes at the start of a high-stakes midterm election year, with affordability – including the cost of health care – topping the list of voters’ concerns.

“It really bothers me that the middle class has moved from a squeeze to a full suffocation, and they continue to just pile on and leave it up to us,” said 37-year-old single mom Katelin Provost, whose healthcare costs are set to jump. “I’m incredibly disappointed that there hasn’t been more action.”

Some enrollees, like Salt Lake City freelance filmmaker and adjunct professor Stan Clawson, have absorbed the extra expense. Clawson said he was paying just under $350 a month for his premiums last year, a number that will jump to nearly $500 a month this year. It’s a strain for the 49-year-old, but one he’s willing to take on because he needs health insurance as someone who lives with paralysis from a spinal cord injury.

Others, like Provost, are dealing with steeper hikes. The social worker’s monthly premium payment is increasing from $85 a month to nearly $750.

An analysis conducted last September by the Urban Institute and Commonwealth Fund projected the higher premiums from expiring subsidies would prompt some 4.8 million Americans to drop coverage in 2026.

But with the window to select and change plans still ongoing until January 15 in most states, the final effect on enrollment is yet to be determined.

Provost said she is holding out hope that Congress finds a way to revive the subsidies early in the year – but if not, she’ll drop herself off the insurance and keep it only for her 4-year-old daughter.

She can’t afford to pay for coverage for both of them without the subsidies.

After Republicans cut more than $1 trillion in federal healthcare and food assistance by passing Trump’s big tax and spending cuts bill, Democrats repeatedly called for the ACA subsidies to be extended.

In December, the GOP-controlled Senate rejected two partisan healthcare bills – a Democratic pitch to extend the subsidies for three more years and a Republican alternative that would instead provide Americans with health "savings accounts".

In the House, four Republicans broke with GOP leadership and joined forces with Democrats to force a vote that could come as soon as January on a three-year extension of the tax credits. But with the Senate already having rejected such a plan, it’s unclear whether it could get enough momentum to pass.

Meanwhile, Americans whose premiums are skyrocketing say lawmakers don’t understand what it’s really like to struggle to get by as health costs ratchet up with no relief.

Many say they want the subsidies restored alongside broader reforms to make health care more affordable for all Americans.

“Both Republicans and Democrats have been saying for years, oh, we need to fix it. Then do it,” said Chad Bruns, a 58-year-old Affordable Care Act enrollee in Wisconsin. “They need to get to the root cause, and no political party ever does that.”</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 17:23:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/ef55d7dc-e727-11f0-a763-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25350476183812.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Seven bodies recovered, 96 rescued after migrant boat capsizes, Gambia says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/seven-bodies-recovered-96-rescued-after-migrant-boat-capsizes-gambia-says-2026-01-01/</link><description>BANJUL, Jan 1 (Reuters) - Seven bodies were recovered and 96 people were rescued after a boat transporting migrants capsized overnight, Gambia's defence ministry said on Thursday.

SWISS FEDERAL PRESIDENT GUY PARMELIN:

"The fire that broke out last night in a bar in Crans-Montana is one of the worst tragedies our country has ever known ... The events that took place last night in this public establishment are a tragedy of unprecedented and appalling proportions. Many lives, most of them young, have been lost.

American forces have been pursuing the tanker, which maritime groups have identified as the Bella 1, for almost two weeks .

The U.S. on Wednesday imposed sanctions on four companies it said were operating in Venezuela’s oil sector as well as associated oil tankers, as President Donald Trump's administration increases pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.

Russia made the formal diplomatic request as Trump also seeks to broker a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine.

Most injuries, many of them serious, occurred when the blaze swept through the crowded bar less than two hours after midnight Thursday in southwestern Switzerland .

The Crans-Montana resort is best known as an international ski and golf venue. Overnight, its crowded Le Constellation bar morphed from a scene of revelry into the site of potentially one of Switzerland’s worst tragedies.

Crans-Montana is less than 5 kilometres from Sierre, Switzerland, where 28 people, including many children, were killed when a bus from Belgium crashed inside a Swiss tunnel in 2012.

Here’s what we know about the deadly fire :

The blaze broke out around 1:30am Thursday inside the Le Constellation bar amid the holiday celebration.

Two women told French broadcaster BFMTV they were inside when they saw a male bartender lifting a female bartender on his shoulders as she held a lit candle in a bottle. The flames spread, collapsing the wooden ceiling, they told the broadcaster.

People frantically tried to escape from the basement nightclub up a narrow flight of stairs and through a narrow door, causing a crowd surge, one of the women said.

A young man at the scene said people smashed windows to escape the fire, some gravely injured, reported BFMTV. He said he saw about 20 people scrambling to get out of the smoke and flames, likening what happened to a horror movie.

The injured were so numerous that the intensive care unit and operating theatre at the regional hospital quickly hit full capacity, said Mathias Reynard, head of the regional government of the Valais Canton.

While officials said Thursday it was too early to determine the fire's cause, investigators have already ruled out that it could have been an attack.

Experts have not yet been able to go inside the wreckage, said Beatrice Pilloud, Valais Canton attorney general, at a news conference.

Work is underway to identify the victims and inform their families, according to Valais Canton police commander Frédéric Gisler.

The Swiss officials called the blaze an “embrasement généralisé”, a French firefighting term describing how a blaze can trigger the release of combustible gases that can then ignite violently and cause what English-speaking firefighters would call a flashover or a backdraft.

Victims suffered from serious burns and smoke inhalation. Some were flown to specialist hospitals across the country.

Authorities urged people to show caution in the coming days to avoid any accidents that could require the already overwhelmed medical resources.

With high-altitude ski runs rising around 3,000 metres in the heart of the Valais region’s snowy peaks and pine forests , Crans-Montana is one of the top venues on the World Cup circuit.

The resort will host the best men’s and women’s downhill racers, including Lindsey Vonn, for their final events before the Milan Cortina Olympics in February.

The town’s Crans-sur-Sierre golf club, down the street from the bar, stages the European Masters each August on a picturesque course.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 20:25:31 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/e61933b6-e74b-11f0-a45a-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-01T192903Z-60329277-RC2ISIAC1PJ4-RTRMADP-3-SWITZERLAND-BLAST.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuela frees 88 more prisoners detained after post-election protests</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/venezuela-frees-88-more-prisoners-detained-after-post-election-protests-2026-01-01/</link><description>Jan 1 (Reuters) - Venezuela's government has freed 88 more people detained after protests that followed the South American nation's July 2024 election, marking the second mass release in as many weeks amid U.S. pressure on the government of President Nicolas Maduro.

The New Year's Day release follows the government's announcement that it released 99 people on December 26, which would bring a total of 187 people released in two weeks.

"These actions are part of the comprehensive review process of cases ordered by President Nicolas Maduro," the government said in a statement.

The Committee for the Freedom of Political Prisoners, a local non-governmental organization, said it had verified at least 55 prisoners had been released, with all but one freed from the Tocoron prison in central Venezuela.

Following the December 26 announcement, several NGOs questioned whether the government released as many as it said it had. Venezuelan NGOs have estimated around 900 political prisoners are still detained in Venezuela, including people arrested before the election.

Venezuela's government has said it does not hold political prisoners but rather imprisoned politicians, and those arrested were seeking to destabilize the country.

The releases come amid pressure from the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, who has said it would be smart for Maduro to leave power.

The U.S. has amassed a huge military presence in the Caribbean, killed dozens in strikes on boats near the Venezuelan coast it alleges were carrying drugs, and seized two fully loaded Venezuelan crude tankers .</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 22:46:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ACBMEPBQUFJJBJ76X6WNSZXU7A.jpg?auth=f076dc733ebb4410d20be2f6823f541c8d3c3fa96bfdbe3d9a77860a6a5c849c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Brazil's Bolsonaro leaves hospital after surgeries, returns to prison</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/brazils-bolsonaro-leaves-hospital-after-surgeries-returns-prison-2026-01-01/</link><description>BRASILIA, Jan 1 (Reuters) - Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro was discharged from hospital on Thursday after undergoing medical procedures to treat a hernia and hiccups , according to a Reuters witness and local media reports.

Earlier in the day, Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes rejected a request from Bolsonaro's lawyers seeking permission for the former president to serve his sentence under "humanitarian house arrest."

So severe were the burns suffered by the mostly young crowd of revellers in the Le Constellation bar that Swiss officials said it could take days before they name all the victims of the fire that also injured 115, many of them seriously.

Parents of missing youths anxiously issued pleas for news of their loved ones as foreign embassies scrambled to work out if their nationals were among those caught up in one of the worst tragedies to befall modern Switzerland.

"The first objective is to assign names to all the bodies," Crans-Montana's mayor Nicolas Feraud told a press conference on Thursday evening. This, he said, could take days.

Mathias Reynard, head of government of the canton of Valais, said experts were using dental and DNA samples for the task.

"All this work needs to be done because the information is so terrible and sensitive that nothing can be told to the families unless we are 100 percent sure," he said.

What caused the blaze was unclear. Swiss authorities said it appeared to be an accident rather than an attack.

Some accounts from survivors and footage broadcast on social media suggested that the ceiling of the bar's basement may have caught fire when sparkling candles got too close.

Residents of Crans-Montana, which has the distinction of being not only a popular draw for skiers, but also golfers, were stunned by the inferno. Many knew victims and some said they were lucky not to have been there themselves.

Hundreds of people stood in silence near the scene as they came to pay their respects to the victims on Thursday night.

"You think you're safe here but this can happen anywhere. They were people like us," said Piermarco Pani, an 18-year-old who, like many others in the town, knew the bar well.

Dozens of people left flowers or lit candles on a makeshift altar at the top of the road leading to the bar which police had cordoned off. Some cried, others quietly hugged one another.

Behind the cordon, the bodies of some victims still lay in the bar, police said, as they pledged to work around the clock to identify everyone who succumbed to the blaze.

Kean Sarbach, 17, said he had spoken to four people who escaped from the bar, some with burns, and that they had told him the flames had spread very quickly.

Elisa Sousa, 17, said she was meant to be there but ended up spending the evening at a family gathering instead.

"And honestly, I'll need thank my mother a hundred times for not letting me go," she said at the vigil for the victims. "Because God knows where I'd be now."</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 23:20:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/XOGTBIGH4JKWJBTGHYJZKLGVVA.jpg?auth=d8e593a78067e1db45a850481ead6a3f7d033d40959d3eb1cc9a3c772b3af42d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>North Korea leader Kim Jong Un's daughter makes public visit to state mausoleum</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/north-korea-leader-kim-jong-uns-daughter-makes-public-visit-state-mausoleum-2026-01-01/</link><description>SEOUL, Jan 2 (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's daughter, Ju Ae, who is likely being prepared as his successor, accompanied her parents on her first public visit to the Kumsusan mausoleum to pay respects to former leaders, state media photos published on Friday showed.

Ju Ae has been making increasingly prominent appearances in state media over the past three years, fuelling speculation by analysts and South Korea's intelligence agency that she may be in line to be the country's fourth-generation leader.

Kim was also accompanied by his wife, Lee Sol Ju, and senior officials on the visit on January 1, with Ju Ae between her parents in the main hall of the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun, state news agency KCNA photographs showed.

Kim Ju Ae , who is believed to have been born in the early 2010s, attended this year's New Year celebrations , according to state media on Thursday. In September, she travelled to Beijing with her father on her first public overseas outing.

Kim visits Kumsusan to honour his grandfather and state founder, Kim Il Sung, and father Kim Jong Il on key dates and anniversaries in a gesture affirming the dynastic heritage of the nuclear-armed country.

North Korea has never confirmed Ju Ae's age.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 23:21:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ISG4OSFDJRNEJFVJEOI74BFF4E.jpg?auth=9e0424b1a7c68e069d0e76543da542c9efdb566c44cdb73bb4587292c6711047&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Mamdani vows bold left-wing agenda as he takes office as New York mayor</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260101-mamdani-vows-bold-left-wing-agenda-new-york-mayor</link><description>Zohran Mamdani promised Thursday to show left-wing politics can succeed as he took over as New York mayor for a term sure to see him cross swords with US President Donald Trump.

Thousands of people gathered in freezing conditions in the United States ’ largest city to celebrate the 34-year-old Democrat ’s inauguration after his rapid rise from relative anonymity just a year ago.

“They want to know if the left can govern. They want to know if the struggles that afflict them can be solved,” Mamdani said outside City Hall.

“We will do something that New Yorkers do better than anyone else: we will set an example for the world.”

In the 24-minute speech, he added: “Beginning today, we will govern expansively and audaciously.”

Mamdani, New York’s first Muslim mayor, emphasised cost-of-living issues that were central to his campaign, pledging to help those “betrayed by the established order”.

Left-wing allies Senator Bernie Sanders and congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez also spoke before some 4,000 ticketed guests.

“Thank you for giving us, from coast to coast, the hope and the vision that we can create government that works for all, not just the wealthy and the few,” said Sanders, a former presidential hopeful.

At one point, the crowd broke into chants of “tax the rich”. Mamdani wants to raise taxes on New York’s wealthiest residents.

Thousands more thronged downtown Manhattan, many wearing yellow and blue beanies emblazoned with “Zohran”, to watch the ceremony on large screens.

“This is the first time that either of us in our entire lives has felt some kind of political hope at all,” 31-year-old scientist Jacob Byerly told AFP, standing alongside his wife Auburn.

Mamdani, a self-described democratic socialist , comes to power as Trump pushes a hard-right agenda nationally.

It remains to be seen whether he can deliver on his programme, which includes rent freezes, universal childcare and free public buses.

Trump’s approach could prove decisive. The Republican, himself a New Yorker, has repeatedly criticised Mamdani, although the two held unexpectedly cordial talks at the White House in November.

One potential flashpoint is immigration, as Trump expands raids and a broader crackdown on migrants across the United States. Mamdani has vowed to protect immigrant communities.

Before the November vote, Trump threatened to slash federal funding for New York if Mamdani won, branding him a “communist lunatic”. The mayor has said he believes Trump is a fascist.

Mamdani mentioned Trump only once in his speech, reflecting on the city’s diversity and noting that some Trump supporters had also backed him in the mayoral race.

The inauguration was rich in symbolism.

New York Attorney General Letitia James, who successfully prosecuted Trump for fraud , carried out a private midnight swearing-in at a disused subway station.

Mamdani’s office said the understated venue beneath City Hall reflected his commitment to working people.

In a first for the city, he was sworn in using Qurans.

Born in Uganda to a family of Indian origin, Mamdani moved to New York at the age of seven and enjoyed an elite upbringing, with only a relatively brief stint in politics.

To compensate for his inexperience, he is surrounding himself with seasoned aides drawn from previous mayoral administrations and former US president Joe Biden ’s government.

Mamdani has also opened dialogue with business leaders, some of whom had warned of a mass exodus of wealthy New Yorkers if he won. Real estate leaders have since played down those claims.

A vocal defender of Palestinian rights, he faces the task of reassuring New York’s Jewish community — the largest in the US — of his inclusive leadership.

A small group of protesters holding Israeli flags appeared during the ceremony, blowing air horns as Mamdani delivered his speech.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 23:22:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/5d11a098-e760-11f0-b1b7-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26001741473836.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Bolsonaro leaves hospital and returns to prison after being denied house arrest</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260101-bolsonaro-leaves-hospital-returns-to-prison</link><description>Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro left a hospital in capital Brasilia on Thursday, a week after he underwent a double hernia surgery. A car took the embattled ex-leader back to the federal police headquarters where he is serving his 27-year prison sentence for leading a coup d’état aimed at keeping him in office.

Hospital DF Star confirmed Bolsonaro was released after some other minor medical procedures after the double hernia surgery that was completed without complications.

Brazil ’s Supreme Court approved the release of the former president, who governed from 2019 to 2022, for the surgery.

Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who sentenced Bolsonaro to prison, denied the former president’s request for house arrest after he leaves the hospital.

Bolsonaro has undergone several other medical procedures since he was stabbed in the abdomen during a campaign rally in 2018.

Bolsonaro has no contact with the few other inmates at the federal police headquarters in Brasilia, where he is held and where his 12-square-metre (around 130-square-foot) room has a bed, a private bathroom, air conditioning, a television and a desk.

In December, Bolsonaro shook Brazilian politics again by appointing his eldest son, Sen. Flávio Bolsonaro, to become his political party’s presidential candidate in next year’s election, challenging incumbent Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva .

Neither Flávio Bolsonaro nor former first lady Michelle Bolsonaro made comments about the former leader returning to prison after his hospitalisation.

Michelle Bolsonaro said in her social media channels that “there is a Brazil of good people which loves you and prays for you”.

“We will beat the bad days,” she wrote.

Bolsonaro and several of his allies were convicted in September by a panel of Supreme Court justices of attempting to overthrow Brazil’s democratic system following his 2022 election defeat.

The plot included plans to kill Lula , Vice President Geraldo Alckmin and de Moraes. There was also a plan to encourage an insurrection in early 2023.

Bolsonaro was also convicted on charges that include leading an armed criminal organisation and attempting the violent abolition of the democratic rule of law. He has denied any wrongdoing.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 23:43:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/d80e0e1c-e030-11f0-816a-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/2025-12-23T152216Z-613812178-RC2V1HAEN3OD-RTRMADP-3-BRAZIL-BOLSONARO.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China's Xi to host South Korea's Lee in New Year amid Japan tensions</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-xi-host-south-koreas-lee-new-year-amid-japan-tensions-2026-01-02/</link><description>SEOUL/BEIJING, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Chinese President Xi Jinping will host South Korean President Lee Jae Myung on a state visit starting on Sunday, signalling Beijing's intent to strengthen ties with Seoul amidst strained relations with Japan over Taiwan.

The visit marks the second meeting between Xi and Lee in just two months, an unusually short interval that signals China's keen interest in reinforcing ties with Seoul and boosting economic collaboration and tourism, analysts say.

Relations between China and Japan are at their chilliest point in years after Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi suggested in November a hypothetical Chinese attack on Taiwan could trigger a military response from Tokyo.

Xi's invitation to Lee for a state visit from Sunday is a calculated move aimed at deepening bilateral relations especially before the South Korean leader visits Japan, analysts say.

"China wants to emphasize South Korea's importance slightly more than before," said Kang Jun-young, professor of political economics at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies.

"China appears to have strategically decided that it would be better to have (Lee) visit China before South Korea holds a summit with Japan again," he added.

The Lee administration has said it aims to "restore" ties with Beijing, acknowledging China is South Korea's largest trading partner.

The pivot follows the two countries' strained relations under Lee's predecessor Yoon Suk Yeol, due to his closer alignment with Washington and Tokyo, as well as criticism of China's handling of Taiwan.

Now, South Korea is trying to maintain balance but leaning towards cooperation with China to avoid being forced into any troubles that would threaten the Asian industrial powerhouse.

Lee said in December he wouldn't take sides in the diplomatic dispute between China and Japan.

Still, China and South Korea face complex issues as China challenges the U.S., South Korea's major ally in the region, and as nuclear-armed North Korea remains unpredictable.

China is North Korea's major ally and economic lifeline.

Shin Beom-chul, a former South Korean vice defence minister and a senior research fellow at the Sejong Institute, said Xi and Lee might discuss some contentious issues such as efforts to modernise the South Korea- U.S. alliance that apparently aim to curb China's dominance.

Currently, about 28,500 U.S. troops are based in South Korea to counter any threat from North Korea.

U.S. officials have signalled a plan to make those U.S. forces more flexible to respond to other threats, such as defending Taiwan and checking China's growing military reach.

"Korea is not simply responding to threats on the peninsula," General Xavier Brunson, commander of U.S. Forces Korea, said at a forum on Dec. 29. "Korea sits at the crossroads of broader regional dynamics that shape the balance of power across Northeast Asia." he said.

Lee's agenda with Xi includes persuading China to facilitate dialogue with North Korea, experts said.

North Korea has dismissed Lee's outreach, labelling him a "hypocrite" and "confrontational maniac".

Meanwhile, China and North Korea have been seeking closer coordination as North Korean leader Kim Jong Un stood shoulder to shoulder with Xi in September at a big military parade .

Lee's visit to Beijing is expected to address cooperation in areas including critical minerals , supply chain and green industries, his office said earlier.

Seoul sources nearly half of its supply of rare earth minerals, critical to semiconductor manufacturing, come from China. Beijing also accounts for a third of Seoul's annual chip exports, the largest market by far.

Last month, South Korean Industry Minister Kim Jung-kwan and Chinese Commerce Minister Wang Wentao agreed to work towards stable rare earth supplies, the South Korean industry ministry said.

The visit may also foster partnerships on artificial intelligence and advanced technologies, experts said.

China's Huawei Technologies plans to roll out the Ascend 950 AI chips in South Korea next year, aiming to provide an alternative to Nvidia for Korean firms, Huawei's South Korea CEO Balian Wang told a press conference last month.

Wang mentioned ongoing discussions with potential customers, without naming those clients.

Huawei did not address questions from Reuters about Wang's comments.

Another issue at stake is Beijing's effective ban on K-pop content since around the 2017 deployment of a U.S.-led missile defence system in South Korea.

The chief executive of SM Entertainment, a leading K-pop agency will join Lee's business delegation, according to local media.</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 01:46:27 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/M6YEY4IUANI4DKQSZNZRU4T55M.jpg?auth=4e182ba9e05383368512c56456e3fa8dad8f8de6c936326c732cda5ba18ca016&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Xi to host South Korea’s Lee in Beijing as China seeks to bolster regional ties</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260102-xi-to-host-south-korea-lee-beijing</link><description>Chinese President Xi Jinping will host South Korean President Lee Jae Myung on a state visit starting on Sunday, signalling Beijing’s intent to strengthen ties with Seoul amid strained relations with Japan over Taiwan.

Shin Beom-chul, a former South Korean vice defence minister and senior research fellow at the Sejong Institute, said Xi and Lee might discuss contentious issues such as efforts to modernise the South Korea–US alliance, which Beijing sees as aimed at curbing China’s dominance.

About 28,500 US troops are currently based in South Korea to counter threats from North Korea.

US officials have signalled plans to make those forces more flexible to respond to other threats, including defending Taiwan and checking China’s growing military reach.

“Korea is not simply responding to threats on the peninsula,” General Xavier Brunson, commander of US Forces Korea, said at a forum on December 29. “Korea sits at the crossroads of broader regional dynamics that shape the balance of power across Northeast Asia,” he said.

Lee’s agenda with Xi includes persuading China to facilitate dialogue with North Korea, experts said.

North Korea has dismissed Lee’s outreach, labelling him a “hypocrite” and a “confrontational maniac”.

Meanwhile, China and North Korea have been seeking closer coordination, with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un standing shoulder to shoulder with Xi in September at a major military parade.

Lee’s visit to Beijing is expected to address cooperation in areas including critical minerals, supply chains and green industries, his office has said.

Nearly half of South Korea’s supply of rare earth minerals — critical to semiconductor manufacturing — comes from China. Beijing also accounts for about a third of South Korea’s annual chip exports, by far its largest market.

Last month, South Korean Industry Minister Kim Jung-kwan and Chinese Commerce Minister Wang Wentao agreed to work towards stable rare earth supplies, South Korea’s industry ministry said.

The visit may also foster partnerships in artificial intelligence and advanced technologies, experts said.

China’s Huawei Technologies plans to roll out its Ascend 950 AI chips in South Korea next year, aiming to provide an alternative to Nvidia for Korean firms, Huawei’s South Korea chief executive, Balian Wang, told a press conference last month.

Wang said discussions were under way with potential customers, without naming them.

Huawei did not respond to questions from Reuters about Wang’s comments.

Another issue at stake is Beijing’s effective ban on K-pop content since around the 2017 deployment of a US-led missile defence system in South Korea.

The chief executive of SM Entertainment, a leading K-pop agency, will join Lee’s business delegation, according to local media.</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 03:41:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/7cfb3076-b886-11f0-a995-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25305338114999.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Maduro suggests Venezuela is open to talks with US despite military attacks</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260102-maduro-suggests-venezuela-is-open-to-talks-with-us-despite-military-attacks</link><description>President Nicolas Maduro on Thursday dodged a question about an alleged US attack on a dock in Venezuela but said he was open to cooperation with Washington after weeks of American military pressure.

“Wherever they want and whenever they want,” Maduro said of the idea of dialogue with the United States on drug trafficking, oil and migration in an interview on state TV.

To date, Maduro has not confirmed a US land attack on a docking facility in his country that allegedly targeted drug boats , according to comments made on Monday by US President Donald Trump.

Asked point-blank whether he confirmed or denied the attack, Maduro said: “This could be something we talk about in a few days.”

The attack would amount to the first known land strike of the US military campaign against drug trafficking from Latin America.

Trump said on Monday that the United States had hit and destroyed a docking area used by alleged Venezuelan drug boats.

He declined to say whether it was a military or CIA operation or where the strike occurred, noting only that it was “along the shore”.

“There was a major explosion in the dock area where they load the boats up with drugs,” Trump told reporters at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.

“So we hit all the boats and now we hit the area — it’s the implementation area, that’s where they implement. And that is no longer around.”

For weeks, Trump has threatened ground strikes on drug cartels in the region, saying they would start “soon”, but this is the first apparent example.

US forces have also carried out numerous strikes on boats in both the Caribbean Sea and the eastern Pacific Ocean since September, targeting what Washington says are drug smugglers.

The administration has provided no evidence that the targeted boats were involved in drug trafficking, however, prompting debate about the legality of these operations.

International law experts and rights groups say the strikes likely amount to extrajudicial killings, a charge that Washington denies.</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 03:41:32 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/686d089c-da4f-11f0-816f-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25344772186399.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Saudi envoy says leader of Yemen separatist group STC blocked delegation's Aden landing</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/saudi-envoy-says-leader-yemen-separatist-group-stc-blocked-delegations-aden-2026-01-02/</link><description>DUBAI, Jan 2 (Reuters) - The Saudi-backed governor of Yemen's Hadramout province said on Friday he would launch a peaceful operation to take back military positions from the UAE-backed Southern Transitional Council, but that the actions were not a declaration of war.

The move marks the latest escalation in war-torn Yemen where a rift between Gulf powers Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, who back opposing sides, has been playing out since December.

Yemen’s Saudi-backed government said on Friday it had appointed Hadramout Governor Salem Ahmed Saeed al-Khunbashi to take overall command of the "Homeland Shield" forces in the eastern province, granting him full military, security and administrative authority in what it said was a move to restore security and order.

The operation targets military sites only and is "not a declaration of war," it said.

The UAE backs the STC , which seized large swathes of southern Yemen last month from the internationally recognised government, backed by Saudi Arabia, which in turn saw the move as a threat.

The UAE last week said it was pulling its remaining forces out of Yemen after Saudi Arabia backed a call for its forces to leave within 24 hours in one of the severest disagreements between the two Gulf oil powers to ever play out in public.

The STC did not immediately respond to the Hadramout governor's declaration.

Saudi Arabia's ambassador to Yemen also on Friday blamed STC leader Aidarus Al-Zubaidi for refusing to grant landing permission the previous day for a plane carrying a Saudi delegation to Aden.

A halt in flights at Aden international airport on Thursday continued into Friday as both sides traded blame as to who was responsible for the air traffic shutdown.

"For several weeks and until yesterday, the Kingdom sought to make all efforts with the Southern Transitional Council to end the escalation ... but it faced continuous rejection and stubbornness from Aidarus Al-Zubaidi," the Saudi ambassador, Mohammed Al-Jaber, said on X.

Zubaidi issued directives to close air traffic at Aden's airport on Thursday, the ambassador added, saying that a plane carrying a Saudi delegation to Aden aiming to find solutions to the crisis was denied permission to land.

In a statement on Thursday, the STC-controlled Transport Ministry in turn accused Saudi Arabia of imposing an air blockade, saying Riyadh required all flights to go via Saudi Arabia for extra checks.

Aden's international airport is the main gateway for regions of the country outside Houthi control.</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 08:31:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ORRDY2S2D5NGBO64V6WA6FF3XI.jpg?auth=b597960c9819e60afc93944153d2e5917d593e629d179610641e8cec79742245&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump says US will intervene if Iran violently suppresses peaceful protests</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/trump-says-us-will-intervene-if-iran-violently-suppresses-peaceful-protests-2026-01-02/</link><description>Jan 2 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday said that if Iran shoots and violently kills peaceful protesters, the United States of America will come to their rescue.

Hong Kong has stepped up a crackdown on corruption linked to building renovation following a fire in late November that ripped through seven high-rise towers and killed more than 160 people.

John Lee, the city's leader, last month set up an independent committee to investigate the fire and the construction industry, and determine whether there was any bid-rigging in the award of contracts.

The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) said in a statement it conducted enforcement operations last week against a triad-linked corruption syndicate associated with building renovation.

The 21 arrested included middlemen, project consultants, project contractors and members of the owners' corporation of the two housing estates, the agency added.

In one of the estates, the contractor involved was suspected of bribing the project consultant and some members of the owners' corporation to obtain a project contract worth HK$33 million ($4.24 million).

In the other estate, the middlemen allegedly collected instruments of proxy, or authorisation tickets from homeowners "by corrupt means" in an attempt to manipulate votes and win future renovation contracts. It did not elaborate.

"Building maintenance is closely related to the public and involves multiple stakeholders. The ICAC has always attached great importance to corruption in building maintenance," the statement said.

The two estates targeted in last week's operation were in the Kwun Tong district in eastern Kowloon and not related to Wang Fuk Court, the site of the fire that broke out on November 26.

The ICAC has arrested at least 11 people in a corruption probe into renovation work at Wang Fuk Court.

Residents reacted with anger to the inferno, which took nearly two days to extinguish. Authorities have said substandard building materials used in renovating the high-rise blocks fuelled the fire.

The demonstrations are smaller than the last major outbreak of unrest in 2022, triggered by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini , who was arrested for allegedly violating Iran's strict dress code for women.

Maduro said Venezuela was a "brother country" to the United States and a friendly government. He noted that when he and Trump last spoke in November, the U.S. president had acknowledged his authority by addressing him as "Mr. President."

The longtime Venezuelan strongman spoke in an interview that was filmed on New Year's Eve and aired on Venezuelan state TV on the evening of New Year's Day.

In the broadcast, Maduro and his interviewer walk through a militarized zone of the capital Caracas. Later, Maduro takes the wheel of a car with the journalist in the passenger seat and the president's wife, Cilia Flores, in the back - a gesture commentators interpreted as an attempt to project confidence amid fears of a U.S. strike, despite Maduro's scaling back of public appearances in recent weeks.

The comments represent a shift in Maduro's tone towards the United States since the latter launched a large-scale military buildup in the southern Caribbean. Trump has accused the "illegitimate" Maduro of running a narco-state and threatened to remove him from power.

Maduro has vehemently denied links to crime and says that the U.S. is seeking to oust him to take control of Venezuela's vast oil reserves and rare earth mineral deposits.

At an event shortly before Christmas, Maduro urged Trump to focus on domestic challenges, saying: "Honestly, if I speak with him again, I will tell him that each one should attend to their internal affairs."

In the latest remarks, Maduro told his interviewer: "To the people of the United States I say what I have always said, Venezuela is a brother country... a friendly government.

"We must start to speak seriously, with the facts in hand. The U.S. government knows that, because we have said it a lot to their interlocutors, that if they want to speak seriously about the agreement to battle drug trafficking, we are ready to do that. If they want Venezuela's oil, Venezuela is ready to accept U.S. investments like those of Chevron, when, where and how they want to make them."</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 10:22:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/QDZCB5TGQVPIVENT2TTU2W52RU.jpg?auth=8fcc2e18da5ddaf48ee8a7e6b1f6f80e2206925b628ee4004a01d679bf7efac1&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Molotov cocktail, dead chickens sent to Indonesian government critics, rights groups say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/molotov-cocktail-dead-chickens-sent-indonesian-government-critics-rights-groups-2026-01-02/</link><description>JAKARTA, Jan 2 (Reuters) - A Molotov cocktail was thrown at the home of an Indonesian government critic, while others have received intimidating messages, rights campaigners said on Friday, warning of growing threats to freedom of speech in the Southeast Asian country.

The campaigners had recently been critical of the government response to severe flooding in northern Sumatra province in November that killed more than 1,000 people.

The acts of intimidation "constitute an attack on democratic values ​​and the freedom of expression guaranteed by the constitution", according to a joint statement issued on Wednesday by 91 human rights groups, including the Southeast Asia Freedom of Expression Network and the Human Rights Working Group.

Neither the Jakarta police nor the Indonesian presidential office responded immediately to requests for comment. Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto has repeatedly said that criticism is allowed but it must be constructive.

Ramond Donny Adam, a social media personality and member of the opposition Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle, told Reuters on Friday a Molotov cocktail was sent to his home early on December 31.

Adam, better known as DJ Donny, said the bomb failed to explode, but the attack came two days after he was sent a dead chicken in a plastic box and a printout of his face with a red mark across his neck, along with another note saying, "You will end up like this chicken...Do not mess around".

"I have reported these two incidents to the police and the government must reveal who's behind this," said Donny, who has a million followers on Instagram and often posts messages criticising the government.

It was unclear who was behind the incident.

Greenpeace Indonesia country director Leonard Simanjuntak said a dead chicken was found in front of the house of a Greenpeace campaigner on December 30, with a message tied to its leg saying, "Watch your words if you want to protect your family, your mouth is your sword."

Simanjuntak suspected the intimidation was linked to Greenpeace's criticism of government policies surrounding the Sumatra floods and landslides.

Greenpeace criticised the government's forestry management , including the issuance of mining and palm oil plantation permits that some critics said had caused widespread deforestation and worsened the floods.

On her Instagram account, influencer Sherly Annavita said her car was spray painted and rotten eggs were thrown into her home. Annavita, who has more than two million followers, had recently written posts criticising Jakarta's slow response to the Sumatra floods.

"The Italian Golf Federation mourns the passing of Emanuele Galeppini, a young athlete who carried with him passion and genuine values," the federation said in a statement.

Swiss authorities have said around 40 people died in the fire and more than 110 were injured. Authorities have warned that naming the victims or establishing a definitive death toll would take time because many of the bodies were badly burned.

Italy's ambassador to Switzerland said earlier that six Italians were missing and 13 were in hospital receiving treatment for their injuries.

Galeppini had been in Crans-Montana with his family.

"We are locked and loaded and ready to go," he said in a social media post. The United States struck Iranian nuclear facilities in June, joining an Israeli air campaign that targeted Tehran's atomic programme and military leadership.

Top Iranian official Ali Larijani responded to Trump's comments warning that U.S. interference in domestic Iranian issues would equal the destabilisation of the whole region. Iran backs groups in Lebanon, Iraq and Yemen.

The comments came as a local official in western Iran where several deaths were reported was cited by state media as warning that any unrest or illegal gatherings would be met "decisively and without leniency", raising the likelihood of escalation.

This week's protests over soaring inflation have spread across Iran, with deadly confrontations between demonstrators and security forces focused in the western provinces of Lorestan and Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari.

State-affiliated media and rights groups have reported at least six deaths since Wednesday, including one man who authorities said was a member of the Basij paramilitary affiliated with the Revolutionary Guards.

Iran has seen off repeated bouts of major unrest in recent decades, often quelling protests with heavy security measures and mass arrests. But economic problems may leave authorities more vulnerable now .

This week's protests are the biggest in three years, since nationwide demonstrations triggered by the death of a young woman in custody in late 2022 paralysed Iran for weeks, with rights groups reporting hundreds killed.

During the latest unrest, the elected President Masoud Pezeshkian has struck a conciliatory tone, pledging dialogue with protest leaders over the cost-of-living crisis, even as rights groups said security forces had fired on demonstrators.

Speaking on Thursday, before Trump threatened U.S. action, Pezeshkian acknowledged that failings by the authorities were behind the crisis.

"We are to blame... Do not look for America or anyone else to blame. We must serve properly so that people are satisfied with us.... It is us who have to find a solution to these problems," he said.

Pezeshkian's government is attempting a programme of economic liberalisation, but one of its measures, deregulating some currency exchange, has contributed to a sharp decline in the value of Iran's rial on the unofficial market.

The sliding currency has compounded inflation, which has hovered above 36% since March even by official estimates, in an economy battered by Western sanctions over Iran's nuclear programme.

The Israeli and U.S. strikes last year have added to the pressure on the authorities, as have the ousting of Syria's Bashar al-Assad, a close Tehran ally, and the Israeli pounding of its main regional partner, Lebanon's Hezbollah.

Iran continues to back groups in Iraq that have previously fired rockets at U.S. forces in the country, as well as the Houthi group that controls much of northern Yemen.

"American people should know that Trump started the adventurism. They ought to watch over their soldiers," said Larijani, the head of Iran's National Security Council and a top adviser to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

The Hengaw human rights group reported on Thursday that 29 protesters had been detained during the latest wave of demonstrations, including 14 ethnic Kurds, seven Lors, seven women, and two children.

In Lorestan Province, home to much of Iran's Lor ethnic population and site of some intense protests, a senior judicial official told state media: "There will be no tolerance for illegal actions that threaten public order and safety."

The media said law enforcement forces had identified and arrested several "disruptive individuals" in the Lorestan counties of Azna and Delfan.

Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari has also witnessed protests.

The semi-official Fars News Agency reported on Thursday that three protesters were killed and 17 were injured during an attack on a police station in western Lorestan.

Fars and Hengaw also reported fatalities in Lordegan in Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari province.

The convictions stem from cases registered after violent protests on May 9, 2023, when Khan’s supporters attacked military installations following his brief arrest. Since then, the government and military have launched a sweeping crackdown on Khan’s party and dissenting voices, using anti-terrorism laws and military trials to prosecute hundreds accused of incitement and attacks on state institutions.

In its ruling, the court said actions by the accused “fell within the ambit of terrorism” under Pakistani law and that their online material promoted “fear and unrest” in society.

Most of those convicted are believed to be outside Pakistan and did not appear during the proceedings, court documents showed.

The convicted include former army officers-turned YouTubers Adil Raja and Syed Akbar Hussain, journalists Wajahat Saeed Khan, Sabir Shakir and Shaheen Sehbai, commentator Haider Raza Mehdi, and analyst Moeed Pirzada, according to the court’s decision.

Reuters was unable to reach the journalists or their lawyers for comment.

The Committee to Protect Journalists said in 2023 the investigations amounted to retaliation against critical reporting. “Authorities must immediately drop these investigations and cease the relentless intimidation and censorship of the media,” CPJ Asia programme coordinator Beh Lih Yi said.

The court handed down life sentences along with additional prison terms and fines, ordering further jail time if the fines are not paid. All sentences are subject to confirmation by the Islamabad High Court.</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 10:46:39 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HLH2SWXUBVO6BOMQ5ANGG2LS3I.jpg?auth=54ce04cd92d16afbcd81e8a03b75e2e339228e3233080a5b111004f07f3ef6b1&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Turkey's Erdogan says he will discuss Ukraine, Gaza with Trump on Monday</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/turkeys-erdogan-says-he-will-discuss-ukraine-gaza-with-trump-monday-2026-01-02/</link><description>ANKARA, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said he would have a phone call with U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday to discuss peace efforts between Ukraine and Russia as well as issues surrounding Gaza.

Below are details of the key factions in the conflict in Yemen, which has caused one of the world's worst humanitarian crises:

The Yemeni conflict was triggered when the Houthi movement, formally named Ansar Allah, ousted the Saudi-backed, internationally recognised government of then-president Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi in late 2014.

The group remains the dominant military force in the country, controlling the capital Sanaa and Yemen's populous northern highlands. It is estimated to control territory where between 60% to 65% of Yemenis live.

The Saudi-led coalition accuses Iran of arming, training and funding the Houthis. The group denies being an Iranian proxy and says it develops its own weapons.

The Houthis have demonstrated their missile and drone capabilities during the Yemen war in attacks on Saudi Arabia and the UAE, targeting oil installations and vital infrastructure.

Seen as part of a regional alliance known as the "Axis of Resistance" backed by Iran, the Houthis have also rallied behind the Palestinians in the Gaza war , lobbing drones and missiles at Israel and attacking commercial shipping in the Red Sea.

The Houthis have proven resilient, defying over ten years of bombing by the Saudi-led coalition, as well as U.S. and British strikes in recent years.

Riyadh entered Yemen when it led the military coalition against the Houthis in March 2015, seeking to restore Hadi's government. Saudi Arabia sought to prevent an Iran-aligned group from consolidating power on its southern border.

Riyadh and Tehran, despite a China-brokered thawing of relations, have long been regional rivals and deeply distrust one another.

The Southern Transitional Council, which was trained and equipped by the United Arab Emirates, seeks secession for the south, which was an independent state until unification with the north in 1990. The southern leadership at the time tried to secede in 1994 but was swiftly beaten by then-President Ali Abdallah Saleh's army.

The STC, led by Aidarous al-Zubaidi, is ostensibly part of the Saudi-led coalition but declared in 2020 it would establish self-rule in the south. Tensions peaked in December 2025 when the group seized large swathes of land in Hadramout and Al Mahra provinces and swept to the borders of Saudi Arabia, challenging the regional heavyweight's influence.

The Yemeni Congregation for Reform, better known as al-Islah, is a Sunni Islamist movement with historic ties to the Muslim Brotherhood. It is a key faction within the recognised government but is viewed by the UAE and the STC as a terrorist organisation. Its major stronghold has long been Marib, the country's sole gas-producing region with one of its largest oilfields.

The UAE joined the Saudi-led coalition and was among its most effective ground forces. A withdrawal of UAE troops was announced in 2019 and completed in 2020, but it maintained influence on the ground through the STC and other factions.

Abu Dhabi is motivated by its antipathy towards the Muslim Brotherhood and securing shipping lanes in the strategic Bab al-Mandab Strait and Gulf of Aden, analysts have said.

The eight-member Presidential Leadership Council, led by Rashad al-Alimi, is the internationally recognised authority in Yemen but faces dwindling power. It was formed in Riyadh in April 2022 to replace former president Hadi and unify anti-Houthi forces, but the council has been paralysed by the divisions it was meant to solve.

Following the STC’s December offensive, the government’s effective control is likely now limited to small, isolated pockets, and is reliant on Saudi airpower.

The National Resistance Forces are a well-equipped anti-Houthi force led by Tarek Saleh, a nephew of former Yemeni president Saleh and a member of the PLC. Originally established with UAE support to battle the Houthis on Yemen's west coast, the force has maintained ties to Saudi Arabia and aims for a unified Yemen, positioning itself as a counterweight to both the Houthis and southern secessionists.</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 12:42:26 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ZQONLNHQINPE5PJVNRCI6XMAHY.jpg?auth=e55e7b7210d51a91ba30b154869eb03361dd496493c0d0b48602f948ccd86493&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Zelenskiy says he offered position of chief of staff to military intelligence chief</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/zelenskiy-says-he-offered-position-chief-staff-military-intelligence-chief-2026-01-02/</link><description>KYIV, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Friday he has offered the position of presidential chief of staff to military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov.

Condoms and contraceptive pills now incur value-added tax of 13%, the standard rate for most consumer goods.

The move comes as Beijing struggles to boost birth rates in the world's second-largest economy. China's population fell for a third consecutive year in 2024 and experts have cautioned the downturn will continue.

China exempted childcare subsidies from personal income tax and rolled out an annual childcare subsidy last year, following a series of "fertility-friendly" measures in 2024, such as urging colleges and universities to provide "love education" to portray marriage, love, fertility and family in a positive light.

Top leaders again pledged last month at the annual Central Economic Work Conference to promote "positive marriage and childbearing attitudes" to stabilise birth rates.

China's birth rates have been falling for decades as a result of the one-child policy China implemented from 1980 to 2015, and rapid urbanisation.

The high cost of childcare and education as well as job uncertainty and a slowing economy have also discouraged many young Chinese from getting married and starting a family.</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 14:21:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/X4CC3URE6VMW7JFFQH5GYIMV5E.jpg?auth=888b581dac81b0a23c0e6f959c3350795c6deca8bc4414f7143def4963147408&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Yemen is back from the brink, but frenemies Saudi Arabia and UAE have much to negotiate</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260102-yemen-back-from-brink-but-frenemies-saudi-arabia-and-uae-have-much-negotiate</link><description>The New Year kicked off with Yemen , an unstable country straddling a strategic maritime corridor between the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea , seemingly back from the brink.

After an explosive, public blowout in the last weeks of 2025 that saw Saudi Arabia bomb an alleged arms shipment from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to its proxies in Yemen, tensions have cooled. Abu Dhabi denied the arms shipment accusations, but nonetheless complied with a 24-hour deadline to withdraw its forces in southern Yemen.

Saudi Arabia and the UAE came together in a military coalition in 2015 to prevent a takeover of Yemen by Iran-backed Shiite Houthi rebels . But a decade later, the two Gulf powerhouses, who officially refer to each other as “brotherly” countries, have turned into frenemies. Ambition has driven a wedge between Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and UAE President Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan and a once-close relationship between the two royals has been ripped by a divergence of strategic vision.

The Houthis have not been vanquished, but the coalition against them is hanging by a thread. Riyadh backs the internationally recognised Yemeni government under the Presidential Leadership Council (PLC), an unwieldy umbrella body that includes the Islah party, which the UAE accuses of ties to the Muslim Brotherhood and the party denies. Abu Dhabi supports the Southern Transitional Council (STC), which is also within the PLC, but has secessionist aspirations that are at odds with its coalition partners.

The year may have begun with the UAE pulling its “counterterrorism teams” from southern Yemen, but few expect Abu Dhabi to stop wielding its influence and economic heft in a geostrategic coastal zone.

On the regional front, Emirati interests in the Red Sea area are increasing exponentially. Its co-signatory to the Abraham Accords, Israel , ended 2025 with the surprise recognition of the breakaway region of Somaliland , just across the Gulf of Aden from Yemen. Meanwhile the Houthis continue to target Red Sea shipping lanes and Israeli cities under Iran’s “axis of resistance” banner.

Finally, the latest Saudi-UAE spat in Yemen unfolded in the volatile southern region that has long been an al Qaeda stronghold and offers ideal terrain for jihadist groups.

It may not be a very happy new year for Yemenis who have borne the brunt of a devastating conflict, nor for the international community scrambling to cope with the fast-moving pieces on the Middle East chessboard. By the end of the week, Saudi air strikes had already slammed southern separatist camps, causing deaths and injuries, according to a senior STC official.

In southern Yemen, this week's de-escalation came just as swiftly as the dramatic escalation. On Thursday, the UAE-backed STC said Saudi-aligned government forces would enter territories it had seized in recent weeks.

In its statement, the STC said it would continue to operate in the regions but had agreed to the deployment of the Riyadh-backed National Shield government force. “Today, we launched an operation to integrate the southern National Shield forces so that they can assume the responsibilities and missions that fall to our armed forces,” they announced.

But in Yemen, the devil lies in the official statement details. “We are seeing mixed messaging,” said Mohammed al-Basha, founder of the Basha Report, a US-based risk advisory, in a post on X , noting that while Saudi-aligned figures claimed National Shield forces “will take over security” in Hadramawt, “STC influencers say an agreement was reached to share security responsibilities, tasks, and even garrisons and bases”.

The current crisis was sparked by the STC’s lightening sweep in early December from its heartlands around the southwestern port city of Aden towards the east, seizing parts of the resource-rich Hadramawt and Al Mahra provinces.

Yemen’s history has been marked by a north-south divide, with its southern coastal regions – centred around the ancient strategic port of Aden – culturally distinct from the northern area which includes the capital Sanaa . The STC is the latest iteration of longstanding southern secessionist movements fed by grievances against the north.

Over the past few years, “the STC ran most of the south”, said Basha. “Any diplomat, envoy, journalist going to the south did not see any symbols of the Republic of Yemen, it existed only on paper.”

The “southern question”, as it’s known in Yemen policy circles, is a legitimate issue, analysts concede. But in its current form, there are two “major points of contention”, according to Elisabeth Kendall, president of Girton College at the University of Cambridge and a seasoned Yemen expert.

“One is, does the southern cause mean a separate southern region, or does it mean a separate southern state that's independent and sovereign? And two, how big is that southern region or state? Is it just the southern heartlands, the four governorates that are in and around Aden? Or does it include the two vast eastern governorates of Hadramawt and Al Mahra? The Saudis would argue that it does not include Hadramawt and Al Mahra because they border Saudi Arabia,” she added.

The easternmost Al Mahra governorate also borders Oman , a neutral Gulf country that has strained to contain a spillover of the Yemeni conflict into its own Dhofar region that has seen rebellions in the past. “Neither Saudi Arabia nor Oman want a UAE-influenced state on their borders,” Kendall said.

Within Yemen, there are divides between the southwestern and eastern states, notes Basha. “There's no cohesiveness, even though the STC is the largest political bloc. In theory they could run the south, but they don't have the support of the east,” he noted.

While the eruption of the “southern question” exposed the faultlines with the east, it did little to address Yemen’s core security issues. “Two groups are benefiting from everything that's happening right now in the east and the south. It's the Houthis and AQAP,” noted Basha, referring to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. “The Houthis are sitting back, watching the anti-Houthi coalition fight each other, watching the two regional backers have a very public divorce,” he explained. “And al Qaeda loves to flourish wherever there's a vacuum.”

One of the key reasons for the STC’s lightening sweep to the east in December was the fear that the Saudis could reach a peace deal with the Houthis, leaving the Shiite rebels in a commanding position in the north while sidelining southern powerbrokers.

A prisoner swap between the Houthis and the Yemeni government last year sparked some hopes for a peace deal. But given the complexities of the conflict, expectations are low.

“In 2026, will we see a peace deal between the Saudis and the Houthis? Absolutely, yes. Is it going to be implementable on the ground? I am not sure,” said Basha. “The real problems in Yemen will appear after a peace agreement is signed,” he added, predicting that the country’s myriad armed groups are likely to “just either fight each other for territory and resources, or collapse, or join AQAP, or form other militant groups”.

While the UAE agreed to troop withdrawal from southern Yemen to avert a military confrontation with Saudi Arabia, analysts question whether it will mark an end to Abu Dhabi’s funding and support for its proxies in the region.

The 2025 crisis in Yemen has put a spotlight on the UAE’s increasingly assertive foreign policy and extension of its sphere of influence in Middle East, Africa and the seas in between.

“These maritime locations are supremely important geopolitically. The area that the UAE seeks to extend its influence in, via the STC, is right on that very important corner of the Arabian Peninsula, where the Gulf of Aden meets the Red Sea,” explained Kendall.

Yemeni territory includes the island of Perim, located in the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, which is a gateway for oil tankers heading to Europe via the Suez Canal . Further east lies Socotra, an archipelago and UNESCO World Heritage Site that is also a part of Yemen.

Satellite imagery reveals an expanded network of airstrips, military and intelligence bases built by the UAE, according to investigative reports . They extend from Socotra in the Indian Ocean to Yemen’s Arabian Peninsula coast to the Horn of Africa .

The UAE’s strategic partnership with Israel, strengthened by the Abrahams Accord, has also come under the spotlight during the recent tensions in Yemen.

Israeli media last month speculated about the resulting benefits of an independent southern Yemen under Abu Dhabi’s patronage. Arab outlets noted The National ’s interview with Aidarous Al Zubaidi, head of the UAE-backed STC and also vice president of the Saudi-backed PLC, wherein he said he believed “we will be part of the [Abraham] accords”.

While this may be music to the Trump administration’s ears, it adds credence among local populations to the Houthis' self-declared role as defenders of the Palestinian cause.

Last month, when Israel suddenly recognised Somalia’s breakaway region of Somaliland , it raised eyebrows in Middle Eastern capitals and policy circles – and protests in Mogadishu .

It also drew attention to the UAE’s goals in the region. Noting Abu Dhabi’s strategic sweep from Perim island in the west to Socotra in the east, Kendall remarked that the UAE “has a stranglehold on the Gulf of Aden. Add to that, the fact that it was silent when its ally in the Abraham Accords, Israel, expressed its solidarity with the breakaway ‘nation of Somaliland’ on the other side of the Gulf of Aden, and it looks like that whole area is encircled by the UAE.”

Meanwhile across the Red Sea in Sudan, UN sanctions monitors have described what they deemed credible allegations that the UAE provided military support to Sudan 's paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in the civil war against the Sudanese army. Abu Dhabi denies the allegations.

The problem, many analysts say, is not Abu Dhabi’s goal of increasing strategic influence, but its effects on weak states. The UAE bases its foreign policy on “realpolitik and doesn't mind working with secessionist movements or with minorities”, said Basha. “You see that with the Rapid Support Forces. You're seeing that with the southerners in the STC. The Saudis are completely against that.”

This year, until and unless the two Gulf brotherly nations-turned-frenemies manage to sort out their differences, Yemen – and the wider Middle East – is unlikely to enjoy a lasting peace.</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 14:22:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/fd77c40a-e7be-11f0-8c4e-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25365410480398.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Watch live: Swiss officials brief media after deadly NYE fire in Cras-Montana bar</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260102-watch-live-swiss-officials-brief-media-after-deadly-nye-fire-in-cras-montana-bar</link><description>Swiss authorities are holding a press conference on Friday, one day after a deadly fire killed around 40 people and injured more than 115 at the Crans-Montana ski resort in the Swiss Alps .

Sudan’s team has reached the knockout stage of the competition for only the second time since they won the tournament in 1970, overcoming the immense difficulties of being exiled from their country because of the war.

The paramilitary group – which grew from the “Janjaweed” militia mobilised two decades ago by Sudan’s government to subdue its western Darfur province – has been fighting the Sudanese army since April 2023 when the two fell out over how to integrate their forces.

The conflict has since killed tens of thousands of people, displaced millions and spread famine across the vast country.

Despite the conflict, Sudan’s football team have continued to play in exile and against the odds qualified for the Cup of Nations in Morocco, where they will meet the heavily fancied Senegal in the first of the last-16 matches at the weekend.

“Most of the time I try to run away from these questions because the emotions are terrible,” said a visibly upset Appiah at a press conference when asked about the impact of the war on his team.

“It is not something that we want to talk about, but we are hoping that if we win it will let the war calm down or even cease.

“There was a game we won (in recent World Cup qualifying) when the armies put their guns down and everyone was celebrating. Football can change things in this world,” added the Ghanaian born coach.

Sudan has not played a home match over the last three years with its footballing infrastructure damaged. The country’s top two clubs have moved to Rwanda, where they are competing as guests in the local league and Khartoum’s Al Hilal have also made it to the group phase of this season’s Champions League.

“Playing away from home and under these circumstances that you are all aware of, is very difficult,” added captain Bakhit Khamis.

“It’s very hard on us to live away from our families, from our homes. We are trying to cope with these circumstances, trying to please our fans, and hopefully things will get better. Everything we are doing on the pitch is an attempt to make things better for our people,” he said.</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 14:46:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HBMUVP7EIFOXVKYBGQHMB6WWPY.jpg?auth=693e0d2feca24d0a055b84b3a9355c3588ec3e0ed8722778761f92826683d318&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Earthquake of magnitude 6.3 strikes southern Mexico</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/earthquake-magnitude-63-strikes-mexico-gfz-says-2026-01-02/</link><description>Jan 2 (Reuters) - A magnitude 6.3 earthquake struck the southern Mexican state of Guerrero on Friday, the German Research Center for Geosciences (GFZ) said.

Its latest attacks occurred on Thursday night in Lubero, part of North Kivu province. Nine civilians were killed in Kilonge, two civilians in Katanga and two civilians and two soldiers in Maendeleo, according to Macaire Sivikunula, chief of the Bapere locality where the villages are located.

"The ADF rebels killed most of the victims with bladed weapons," although they also exchanged gunfire with soldiers in Maendeleo, he told Reuters.

Alain Kiwewa, Lubero's military administrator, said on Friday afternoon that 16 people had been confirmed dead.

An army spokesperson, Lieutenant Marc Elongo, said Congolese troops were "pursuing the enemy", without providing details.

Kakule Kagheni Samuel, head of civil society groups in Bapere, said the militants also burnt homes to the ground.

The U.N. peacekeeping mission in the Central African country, known as MONUSCO, said in November that the ADF killed 89 civilians in a spate of strikes over the course of a week.

And in September , the ADF claimed responsibility for an attack that claimed the lives of more than 60 civilians at a funeral in eastern Congo.

Sivikunula said local officials were waiting for soldiers to secure the area before organising funerals for victims of the overnight attacks because "the ADF are cunning (and) can ambush civilians who try to organise this kind of activity."

The ADF violence is separate from the war between Congo and Rwanda-backed M23 rebels that killed thousands of people and displaced hundreds of thousands last year, prompting mediation by U.S. President Donald Trump's administration and Qatar.</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 14:46:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Mexico reports second screwworm case in two days</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/mexico-reports-second-screwworm-case-two-days-2026-01-02/</link><description>Jan 2 (Reuters) - Mexican authorities reported a case of the New World screwworm parasite late on Thursday, the second case reported in two days as Mexico works to contain an outbreak that has kept the U.S.-Mexico border closed to Mexican livestock.

The parasite was detected and treated in a goat in the State of Mexico, which borders capital Mexico City, the ministry said, adding that the 20 other animals at the site tested negative and were given preventive treatment.

On December 31, the ministry reported a case in a six-day-old cow calf in the northern state of Tamaulipas, also the only positive case on site.

Mexico has so far reported a total of 13,106 cases since November of 2024, according to government data through December 31, 2025. Of those cases, 671 were active currently.

The southern border state of Chiapas has the most confirmed cases, followed by Oaxaca, Veracruz and Yucatan.

Screwworms are parasitic flies whose females lay eggs in wounds. Their larvae burrow through the flesh of animals, eventually killing their host if left untreated.

Mexico has been working to contain an outbreak of the screwworm, which has spread northward from Central America, rattling the livestock and beef industries of both the U.S. and Mexico.

Because of the outbreak, the U.S. has kept its southern border largely closed to Mexican livestock since May.

Although U.S. officials say the pest has not yet breached the U.S. border, it threatens $1.8 billion in damage to Texas' economy alone, according to a U.S. Department of Agriculture estimate.</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 15:24:26 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/U6P33BTJGFJJJG3WJM3FOXIVXE.jpg?auth=a7a9f282b07ce81be0ea6b4b25c1092aefefeb5fbe6ca196925168c4f0271d64&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Zelenskiy says he will appoint Oleh Ivashchenko as new military intelligence chief</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/zelenskiy-says-he-will-appoint-oleh-ivashchenko-new-military-intelligence-chief-2026-01-02/</link><description>KYIV, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Friday he will appoint the head of the foreign intelligence service Oleh Ivashchenko as the new military intelligence chief.

Swiss officials put the death toll at 40 with more than 100 injured. Investigators are combing through the ruins of the bar, examining video recordings and interviewing survivors in the hunt for clues on how the fire broke out.

Several witnesses have recounted seeing bar staff holding up sparkling fountain candles attached to bottles of champagne. Prosecutor Beatrice Pilloud said the fountain candles were a leading line of enquiry that looked to be firming up.

"Everything suggests that the fire started from the burning candles or 'Bengal lights' that had been attached to champagne bottles. These went too close to the ceiling," she told a news conference. "From there, a rapid, very rapid and widespread conflagration ensued."

Investigators have questioned the bar's two owners, a French couple who bought the bar in 2015 according to the local canton's company registry.

The probe will focus on previous renovations to the bar and the materials used, the availability of adequate fire extinguishing systems and escape routes, as well as the number of people who were in the bar when the fire started.

Pilloud said further investigations would determine whether there were grounds for criminal liability.

"If this is indeed the case and these individuals are still alive, an investigation will be opened against them for negligent arson, negligent homicide, and negligent bodily injury," the prosecutor added.</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 16:28:32 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/MN3JOIDPUZK3XMBHHBUP7MYEWA.jpg?auth=32503722a21d7fb0304090ba29ec7fc89ea80a3adc2b9a01cadc44cf2b23b66c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Understanding Iran’s protest chants: What are demonstrators’ demands?</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260102-understanding-iran-protest-chants-what-are-demonstrators-demands</link><description>A protest movement, which began in Iran on Sunday with a strike and demonstrations by Tehran's shopkeepers, continued Friday in multiple towns and cities across the country, with university students joining the protests.

Demonstrations are spreading from major cities to smaller provincial towns and are increasingly fraught.

At least seven people died on Thursday in clashes between protesters and security forces in western Iran , local media reported.

The Iranian authorities have ordered the closure of public institutions, placing much of the country on holiday, officially citing the cold weather and the need to save energy.

The discontent is not, so far, on the same scale as the unprecedented national protests seen in the wake of Mahsa Amini’ s death in 2022, during which demonstrators called for increased rights for women and the overthrow of the Islamic Republic.

But videos posted on social media show demonstrators from different social groups taking to the streets to express widespread discontent and voice demands for political, social and economic change. Here is what they are calling for:

This chant, taken up by protesters in the early days of the demonstrations, reflects growing anger over Iran's foreign policy.

For decades, Iran has pursued a policy of regional engagement by supporting the militant groups Hamas in the Palestinian territories and Hezbollah in Lebanon .

The protesters argue that these alliances are diverting resources away from domestic needs at a time when Iran is undergoing a severe economic crisis.

A sharp currency slide has crippled sales of imported goods – sparking unrest among Iran’s shopkeepers – while rampant inflation is affecting the wider population.

Prices rose by an average of 52 percent year-on-year in December, according to the Statistical Centre of Iran, and this average masks even more dramatic increases in the cost of basic necessities, fuelling popular anger against the regime.

On the third day of demonstrations, a young woman, dressed in trainers and with her hair up in a ponytail, led a group of protesting shopkeepers through a throughfare of Tehran’s Grand Bazar.

With her fist raised, video footage shows her turn to the crowd behind her and shout: “Don’t be afraid! Don’t be afraid! We are all together!”

Her courageous rallying cry shocked bystanders and was immediately picked up by the other, mostly male, demonstrators. As the protest passed by, the person filming the scene was impressed. “Well done! That girl is so brave,” they said.

The words the female demonstrator used are familiar – they have been heard at protests in Iran for years. But the sight of a young woman among the bazar traders, who appear to be supporting her, shows how two separate strands of dissent are starting to intertwine.

The bazar traders typically belong to more religious and traditional sections of society, making them unlikely allies of the “Woman, Life, Freedom” movement, sparked by Amini’s death, which calls for the end of repression and discrimination against women.

The joint protest in the Grand Bazar has been echoed in recent days by other chants calling for social unity.

At Yard University in central Iran, female students gathered on December 30 shouted: “ Iranians, speak up and demand your rights!”, “Don't just stand by and watch, join us!” and “ Anyone who says they are neutral is dishonourable .”

This chant, typically heard among university students, has resurfaced in recent days. In a video from December 30, students in the hallways of the Khajeh Nasir Toosi University of Technology in Tehran beat a rhythm with their feet as they chant the words.

Universities in Iran are under high surveillance but remain hotbeds of protest. Students from dormitories at the University of Tehran on Monday evening were heard chanting “ Protest, free students ! Protest!”

Security forces quickly surrounded their building and blocked the entryways. But they could not prevent student marches spreading to a dozen other major universities in the capital the next day.

Female students at Tehran’s Shahid Beheshti University attacked security forces who had come to break up a gathering in their halls of residence on Wednesday night with cries of “Without honour! Without honour!”, French journalist Armin Arefi reported.

The chant has been heard repeatedly at demonstrations since Sunday, breaking out near police roadblocks, during detonations of tear gas, and as the police performed violent arrests.

It can be heard in a video from December 31 showing a student being apprehended in front of his classmates by plainclothes security forces.

Shopkeepers and traders who took to the streets on Thursday started shouting insults at police officers before their cries turned to an exhortation for the forces of order to join the protest.

“Police officers! Support us!” they chanted, hopeful that some officers might switch allegiance and tip the balance of the movement in the protesters' favour.

Young protesters were filmed shouting a direct threat to Iran’s supreme leader on January 1, in the city of Marvdasht in southern Iran. The video has since been shared widely online.

Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , leader of the Islamic Republic, has long been the target of protesters' anger. “Death to the dictator” is a popular chant in Tehran and other provinces.

At the University of Tehran, students were also heard shouting “Death to the principle of Velayate Faqih!”, openly criticising Khamenei’s vision of the Islamic Republic.

Velayate Faqih (or the Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist) is a concept that gives religious leaders more power than their political counterparts and places the supreme leader at the head of State.

The chant targets not just the Khamenei but his entire political system.

Political chants have also referenced the former regime, which was led by Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, until he was overthrown by the Islamic Revolution in 1979. His son, Reza Pahlavi, now lives in the US and is a controversial opposition figure, supported by some protesters.

Chants of “this is the final battle, Pahlavi will return!” and “Reza Shah, may your soul rest in peace,” have been heard at some demonstrations.

Opponents of Reza Pahlavi point to his close ties with Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu . Israeli media outlet Haaretz recently reported on an influence operation aimed at reinstalling him as Shah during the 12-day war between Iran and Israel in June.

Demonstrators who reject both the current and former regime have been heard chanting “ Neither Shah nor Mullah [a title for Muslim clergy]”.

Beyond political allegiance, the majority of protesters are united around a broader aspiration: to turn the page on the Islamic Republic and build a different future.

Accompanied by an American delegation and greeted by former and current officials, Jolie said she was "honoured" to meet aid volunteers at the crossing.

A Red Crescent volunteer told the Oscar winner that "there are thousands of aid trucks just waiting" at the border crossing.

According to local media , the actor and former special envoy for the UN refugee agency made the visit to see the condition of injured Palestinians transferred to Egypt and to look into aid deliveries into the devastated territory.

Jolie and the Egyptian authorities have yet to officially comment on the visit.

The Rafah border crossing was set to be reopened under the ceasefire in effect in Gaza since October, but has so far remained closed.

In a joint statement on Friday, Egypt and six other countries, including Saudi Arabia , "urged the international community to pressure Israel, as the occupying power, to immediately lift the constraints on the entry and distribution of essential supplies" to Gaza.

In early December, Israel announced that the Rafah crossing would be opened only for those wishing to leave Gaza, prompting Cairo to swiftly deny that it had approved such a move.

Jolie, one of Hollywood's most iconic figures, stepped down from her role as special envoy for the United Nations refugee agency at the end of 2022 after more than 20 years of service, saying she wanted to work on broader humanitarian issues.</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 16:30:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/9ee68a74-e7e7-11f0-9f2b-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26002475894149.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Yemen's STC aims to hold an independence referendum in two years</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/yemens-stc-aims-hold-an-independence-referendum-two-years-2026-01-02/</link><description>Jan 2 (Reuters) - Yemen's southern separatist movement said on Friday it aims to hold a referendum on independence from the north in two years following its seizure of swathes of the country last month in a move that triggered a major feud between Gulf powers.

A first avalanche hit the southwest Alpine Maira Valley, near the French border in the Italian region of Piedmont, killing one person and injuring two others, Alpine Rescue (Soccorso Alpino) said. One of them is in critical condition.

Rescue teams set out on foot from lower altitudes after the strong winds prevented helicopter crews from reaching the site, the organisation said in a statement.

A second avalanche occurred near Pragelato, a popular ski destination about 60 km (37 miles) west of Turin.

A woman caught in the avalanche managed to free herself but was unable to move because of injuries. Rescue teams were working to evacuate her, with helicopters again limited by adverse weather conditions.

Authorities said they were monitoring reports of a third avalanche in Piedmont, but details were not immediately available.

Separately, in the northeastern Italian region of Veneto, an avalanche on the Vajo Gabene slope in the Small Dolomites killed a 50-year-old ski mountaineer, Italian news agency ANSA said.

Rescue teams reached him by helicopter but were unable to save him.

A combination of heavy snowfall and strong winds has raised avalanche risks across the Alps in recent days, prompting warnings for skiers and hikers.

Local officials urged caution and advised against off-piste excursions as conditions remain unstable.</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 16:50:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Nigeria urges civilians to avoid debris from US-backed strikes on Islamists</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/nigeria-urges-civilians-avoid-debris-us-backed-strikes-islamists-2026-01-02/</link><description>ABUJA, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Nigeria's military urged civilians in the country's northwest on Friday not to keep or tamper with unexploded ordnance found at sites targeted in recent U.S.-backed airstrikes .

The alert follows online footage showing locals scavenging debris and unexploded ordnance at strike sites in Sokoto state, sparking fears of deadly blasts.

U.S. forces launched a rare strike deep inside Nigeria on December 25 at the request of Nigeria's government, firing 16 GPS-guided munitions from MQ‑9 Reaper drones at two Islamic State-linked camps in Sokoto.

"We do not expect civilians to pick up or keep such materials," Major General Michael Onoja, director of Defence Media Operations, told reporters on Friday. "We can only appeal to them to return all materials that may prove harmful to them."

Onoja said specialized ordnance units within the armed forces were tasked with recovering debris and other remnants from the strikes.</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 16:50:43 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KKR4VKUILVMCTGRHMWWZRKBW34.jpg?auth=22232ec4f81eff015fb1faec6628e9cb7180b805cb6f182a7827ba830ecfb8a3&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US says it thwarted potential ISIS-inspired New Year's Eve attack in North Carolina</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/fbi-says-it-thwarted-potential-isis-inspired-attack-new-years-eve-2026-01-02/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 2 (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department said on Friday it thwarted an alleged plan by a North Carolina man to carry out an ISIS-inspired attack using knives and hammers on New Year’s Eve.

Photographs and videos posted online showed smoke rising from an area of vast destruction, with emergency crews making their way through rubble and large chunks of building materials.

"Missile strikes in central Kharkiv have nearly destroyed a five-storey dwelling," Regional Governor Oleh Syniehubov told Ukrainian television, saying that according to preliminary information two ballistic missiles had struck the area.

"Rescue teams are on site. They are primarily clearing rubble and searching for people underneath."

Syniehubov said 25 people were injured, with 16 in hospital, including a woman in serious condition.

Mayor Ihor Terekhov put the casualty toll at 30 injured.

Located 30 km (18 miles) from the border, Kharkiv withstood Russian advances in the early weeks of Russia's February 2022 invasion of its smaller neighbour.

With Russia's forces focused since on capturing eastern regions of the country, the city has been a constant target of aerial attacks.</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 17:20:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/XBLXZZN5TVM3HH6JU27XGFPIAM.jpg?auth=95f44cc06b5af9cd35b627eacf51797bd39c89b7d46e97d3a7afd94d2c9ab503&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Nigeria police charge Joshua driver with dangerous driving over fatal collision</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sports/boxing-nigeria-police-charge-joshua-driver-with-dangerous-driving-over-fatal-2026-01-02/</link><description>Jan 2 (Reuters) - Nigerian police said on Friday the driver of the vehicle involved in a crash that injured British former world heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua and killed two of his close friends was charged with four counts.

Adeniyi Mobolaji Kayode, 46, appeared before the Sagamu Magistrate Court on Friday in connection with the accident on the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, Ogun State Police Command said in a statement.

It told Reuters Kayode was charged on four counts, including causing death by dangerous driving. The case was adjourned to January 20.

Reuters was not immediately able to contact Kayode or a legal representative. Kayode has not commented publicly on the case.

Joshua, 36, sustained minor injuries when the Lexus SUV he was travelling in collided with another car on Monday. Two of his friends and team members, Sina Ghami and Latif Ayodele, died in the crash.

Preliminary findings suggested the car was speeding and attempted a wrongful overtaking manoeuvre before hitting a stationary truck, the FRSC has said.

Joshua, who was born in Britain to Nigerian parents, was taken to hospital for checks and remains stable, his promoter Matchroom Boxing said.

President Bola Tinubu expressed condolences to Joshua and the victims' families, calling the incident a "tragic accident."

The crash came just over a week after Joshua knocked out American social media star Jake Paul in the sixth round of a bout in Miami. Joshua is expected to fight fellow Briton Tyson Fury later this year.</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 17:43:21 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/754MCKXBHRP2ZPZFS2TC7LWZ2M.jpg?auth=f4b5f638bbb8ca48e975b236341d97e1834b6d471c9e969bb5864c5a9cf689e3&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukraine's Zelensky names spy chief Kyrylo Budanov as new top aide</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260102-ukraine-s-zelensky-names-spy-chief-kyrylo-budanov-as-new-top-aide</link><description>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday named military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov as the new head of his office, after his previous top aide resigned in November over a corruption scandal.

Budanov, 39, has built up a legendary reputation in Ukraine, credited with a series of daring operations against Russia since it launched an all-out assault against its neighbour in 2022.

"I had a meeting with Kyrylo Budanov and offered him the role of the Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine," Zelensky said on social media.

The nomination comes at a key moment in the nearly four-year war, with Zelensky announcing on Wednesday that a US-brokered deal to end the conflict was "90 percent" ready.

"At this time, Ukraine needs greater focus on security issues, the development of the Defence and Security Forces of Ukraine, as well as on the diplomatic track of negotiations," Zelensky said.

"Kyrylo has specialised experience in these areas and sufficient strength to deliver results."

Budanov said he had accepted the nomination and would "continue to serve Ukraine".

"It is an honour and a responsibility for me to focus on critically important issues of strategic security for our state at this historic time for Ukraine," he said on Telegram.

Procedures to formally appoint him as the president's chief of staff have been launched, Zelensky's adviser Dmytro Lytvyn told journalists.

Zelensky has also announced that Budanov will be replaced by the current head of the Foreign Intelligence Service, Oleg Ivashchenko.

Budanov, when appointed, will succeed Andriy Yermak, who resigned in November after investigators raided his house as part of a sweeping corruption probe.

Yermak was Zelensky's most important ally, but a divisive figure in Kyiv, where his opponents said he had accumulated vast power, gate-kept access to the president and ruthlessly sidelined critical voices.

The four-year conflict, the deadliest on European soil since World War II, has killed tens of thousands and ravaged swathes of Ukrainian territory.</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 17:44:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/2d0603f2-e7d4-11f0-b9c3-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-02T120450Z-1186667708-RC2ZSIA63Q4F-RTRMADP-3-UKRAINE-CRISIS-ZELENSKIY-CHIEF.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US judge orders man accused of planting pipe bombs in Washington to remain in custody</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us-judge-orders-man-accused-planting-pipe-bombs-washington-remain-custody-2026-01-02/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 2 (Reuters) - A federal judge on Friday ordered that the man accused of planting pipe bombs in Washington the night before the January 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol attack should remain behind bars while his case moves forward.

U.S. District Court Judge Matthew Sharbaugh ordered Brian Cole, 30, to be held without bail as he faces two criminal charges related to the attempted bombings of the Democratic and Republican party headquarters. Cole, who faces two explosives-related charges, has not yet entered a plea.

Sharbaugh concluded in his ruling that the U.S. government's evidence against Cole was strong and that the pipe bombs sparked fear and alarm ahead of the congressional certification of the election even though they did not explode.

"If the plan had succeeded, the results could have been devastating: creating a greater sense of terror on the eve of a high-security Congressional proceeding, causing serious property damage in the heart of Washington, D.C., grievously injuring DNC or RNC staff and other innocent bystanders, or worse," Sharbaugh wrote.

A lawyer for Cole argued during a December 30 court hearing that he should be released on strict conditions, pointing to his lack of criminal history and family support.

The attorney said a defense expert was prepared to testify that the devices were not capable of detonating. The FBI has concluded the pipe bombs were viable.

Federal prosecutors have said in a court filing that Cole confessed to planting the pipe bombs and told investigators after his arrest he thought the 2020 election had been “tampered with." President Donald Trump had falsely claimed that the election, which he lost to Democrat Joe Biden, was marred by fraud.

According to the filing, Cole said he didn't like either political party.

The pipe bombs were not discovered until about 1 p.m. on January 6, diverting police resources just as a mob of Trump supporters surged into the Capitol.</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 18:31:12 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/L4OT2JEWGFKABAFQEMYZNAG3PQ.jpg?auth=e6044bb532f4ad4d0c36a5367b5a3038456ed1289e003c361c0a848c1e786c75&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Hiker killed in rare suspected mountain lion attack in Colorado</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/hiker-killed-rare-suspected-mountain-lion-attack-colorado-2026-01-02/</link><description>Jan 2 (Reuters) - A hiker in Colorado has died in the state's first suspected fatal mountain lion attack in over 25 years, authorities said.

The woman was found unresponsive by other hikers on the Crosier Mountain trail northeast of Estes Park around noon on Thursday.

The hikers saw a mountain lion near the woman's body and scared it away by throwing rocks. A doctor was among the hikers and attended to the woman but found no pulse, Colorado Parks and Wildlife spokesperson Kara Van Hoose told reporters.

CPW officers responded to the scene and shot dead two lions in the area. It is not known whether one or multiple animals were involved in the suspected attack, the agency said in a statement. It is believed the woman was hiking alone.

“There were signs that this was consistent with a mountain lion attack,” Van Hoose told a press conference.

Mountain lion attacks on humans in Colorado are rare, with 28 reported to CPW since 1990. The last fatal attack was in 1999.

CPW pathologists are performing necropsies on the dead animals to check for abnormalities and neurological diseases like rabies and avian influenza, as well as human DNA, Van Hoose said.

CPW policy mandates the killing of any mountain lion involved in an attack on a human so as to prevent repeat incidents. If human DNA is not found on either dead lion, authorities will continue to search for animals that may have been involved, Van Hoose said.

Larimer County Coroner will release the identity of the victim and cause of death, she said.

Colorado has a healthy mountain lion population, estimated by CPW to be between 3,800 and 4,400 adults. Conservation efforts have brought the species back from near extinction in the 1960s due to bounty hunting.

Mountain lions are common in the Front Range area where the woman was found, Van Hoose said. The animals go down to lower elevations in winter in search of prey like deer and elk, increasing chances of encounters with humans.

In recent weeks, Kim has made a series of visits to various military and economic facilities to confirm their progress ahead of the key Ninth Party Congress of the Workers' Party, expected to convene early this year to set out major policy goals.

"I wanted to spend the beginning of 2026 with my comrades who are greeting the new year at the northwest tip of our country, so I rushed here as soon as the central event was over," Kim said, lauding the workers' efforts.

Witnesses reported seeing staff at the Le Constellation bar carrying so-called fountain candles atop bottles of champagne, and questions have also arisen about a foam material used to soundproof the ceiling of the basement where revellers danced.

Beatrice Pilloud, chief prosecutor of Valais, the canton that is home to the bar in the upscale ski resort of Crans-Montana, said that available indications were that the fire started because the sparklers got too near to the ceiling.

"From there, a rapid, very rapid and widespread blaze ensued," she said on Friday afternoon.

Further investigations will show whether anyone faces criminal liability over the fire, Pilloud said.

Police arrived quickly at the scene according to local residents, but the fire burned victims so severely that investigators said they would need days to identify the bodies.

So far, officials have only identified a teenage Italian international golfer, Emanuele Galeppini. According to two people familiar with the investigation, some of the victims may be under 16.

Local residents said the bar was popular with young people and the Swiss government said many of the dead were likely youths. Beer and wine can be drunk from age 16 in Switzerland.

One of the bar's owners, Jacques Moretti, told the Tribune de Geneve newspaper that Le Constellation had been checked three times in 10 years and that everything was done according to the rules. Reuters was not immediately able to contact the bar's owners for comment.

Stephane Ganzer, head of security in Valais, said the investigation would determine if the bar had undergone its annual building inspections, but that the town had not raised concerns or reported defects to the canton.

Grieving residents continued paying their respects to the victims of the blaze on Friday, leaving flowers and tributes nearby, even as police began reopening the area around the cordoned-off bar in the heart of the wealthy mountain town.

One of them, Ashley Hauri, 23, said just before the fire broke out she had been on the verge of going to Le Constellation to catch up with friends. Ultimately, she decided against it.

Six of her former co-workers ranging in age from their 20s to their 40s were inside when the blaze erupted, she said. Two of them ended up in hospital; the other four are still missing.

"I was really shocked," said Hauri, who immediately tried to contact her friends. "But I had no answers, and I was really scared and panicked because I wanted to do something."</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 23:20:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/3JDTZZVCYFOW7K4LK3SQJRGCG4.jpg?auth=25090f65e4e109ab1cbea8a28f606bbdccdda283c7c71dfced505068d35620c6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UN chief deeply concerned over Israel's suspension of NGOs</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/un-chief-deeply-concerned-over-israels-suspension-ngos-2026-01-02/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 2 (Reuters) - UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres is deeply concerned by Israel's announcement of a suspension of the operations of several international non-governmental organizations in occupied Palestinian territory and called for the measure to be reversed, according to a statement on Friday.

The dozen orders Adams issued since his indictment included a directive to allow federal agents, including immigration officers, to use an office on Rikers Island, the city's main jail. That order was later struck down by a court.

The new mayor also struck down executive orders that Adams had portrayed as addressing antisemitism. Mamdani, a Muslim who some have accused of antisemitism over his support of Palestinians in Gaza, told reporters on Friday that he would fund measures to prevent hate crimes, and would make protection of Jewish New Yorkers a focus of his administration.

Mamdani recalled September 26, 2024, the day when Adams was charged with accepting illegal campaign contributions and luxury travel from Turkish nationals seeking to influence him, as "a moment when many New Yorkers lost even more faith in New York City politics and the ability of city government to actually prioritize the needs of the public, as opposed to the needs of the person."

In April, a U.S. judge dismissed the charges against Adams , a Democrat, at the request of the U.S. Justice Department, which had argued that the case was distracting the mayor from helping Republican President Donald Trump step up deportations.

Mamdani, from the left wing of the Democratic Party, has clashed with Trump over the immigration crackdown.

On Thursday, Mamdani revoked orders by Adams that had prevented city institutions from divesting from Israel and that defined antisemitism in a way recognized by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, an intergovernmental organization of 35 countries that promotes Holocaust education.

The Council on American-Islamic Relations is among groups that argue the IHRA definition has been used to try to silence advocates , opens new tab for Palestinian rights.

While Islamic organizations praised Mamdani's moves, Israel's Foreign Ministry posted on X on Friday that Mamdani "shows his true face: He scraps the IHRA definition of antisemitism and lifts restrictions on boycotting Israel. This isn’t leadership. It’s antisemitic gasoline on an open fire."</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 23:40:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/O7KYD6KHMRM2JC3SQQ2357LE5Y.jpg?auth=d12806a19aa582599177b91dad059b734a085f1978cc5d108c57f07a235662bf&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Australian police boost security for Sydney Ashes test after Bondi Beach attack</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/australian-police-boost-security-sydney-ashes-test-after-bondi-beach-attack-2026-01-03/</link><description>SYDNEY, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Australian police said they would bolster staffing at the Sydney Cricket Ground for the fifth Ashes test starting on Sunday, weeks after gunmen killed 15 people at a Jewish event in the city.

The father-and-son gunmen are alleged to have carried out the attack at a Hanukkah event at the famed Bondi Beach on December 14. Australia's worst mass shooting in almost three decades shocked the nation and stoked fears of rising antisemitism in the country.

The massacre has sparked more active policing in Sydney, Australia's most populous city and the capital of New South Wales state.

Authorities on Saturday announced a "high-visibility" police presence for the marquee cricket series between Australia and England, which is held every two years. Measures at the cricket ground, some 5 km (3 miles) from Bondi Beach, would include the riot patrol unit, officers on horseback and officers carrying rifles.

“The difference will be in the visibility of long arms and a stronger presence," New South Wales Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon said in a statement.

Police said they expected a capacity crowd for day one of the fixture, the final encounter in the five-match series already claimed by Australia.

"Many people may not be used to seeing police carrying rifles at sporting events, but our objective here is to help the public feel safe," Lanyon said.

Cricket Australia said first responders to the attack and "community members who bravely acted" would be honoured before the start of play on Sunday.

There will be a guard of honour on the field and a round of applause for "emergency response agencies and members of the community in the face of extreme danger", the governing body said in a statement.

On Wednesday, around 3,000 police, some carrying long arms, were deployed in the city during New Year celebrations, which typically attract over a million revellers.

Several New Year events planned at Bondi were cancelled, while traditional Christmas celebrations there were muted, following the attack that authorities believe was inspired by Sunni Muslim militant group Islamic State.</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 01:40:26 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/GILJ3ZBYONOTJHC6VQCOFQLBXQ.jpg?auth=07a1b1bf6a696ec2860d292b4cac806e93eaa675344c0d0062020d8d1371a541&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Military-backed party in Myanmar takes lead in first phase of polls</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/military-backed-party-myanmar-takes-lead-first-phase-polls-2026-01-03/</link><description>Jan 02(Reuters) - Myanmar's military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party is leading after the first phase of a contentious general election , early results cited by state media showed, in the first vote since a 2021 coup.

Having sparked a nationwide rebellion after crushing pro-democracy protests in the wake of its coup, the ruling junta has said the three-phase vote would bring political stability to the impoverished Southeast Asian nation.

Partial results from Myanmar's first election since 2020, released by the Union Election Commission (UEC) for 56 constituencies, showed the junta-backed party winning by a wide margin as expected, despite thin turnout.

The results published on Friday show the Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP), led by retired generals, winning 38 of 40 seats in the Pyithu Hluttaw, or lower house, whose outcomes have been tallied.

The Shan Nationalities Democratic Party, also known as the White Tiger Party and the Mon Unity Party (MUP) got one seat each.

Among a diminished field of competitors handpicked by the military, the USDP also won 14 seats of the 15 regional or State Hluttaw seats tallied in the first-past-the-post system, while the Akha National Development Party took one.

For the upper house, or Amyotha Hluttaw, only one seat has been declared, which was won by the Wa National Party.

No date has been set for the final result of the election, criticised by the United Nations, some Western countries and human rights groups as anti-junta political parties are not in the running and it is illegal to criticise the polls.

The election panel has not revealed the total number of constituencies voting in the first phase, opting instead to release partial results on a constituency-by-constituency basis.

On Wednesday, the junta said 52% of voters , or more than half of those eligible, had cast ballots in the first phase.

That fell short of turnout of about 70% in general elections in 2020 and 2015, however, according to the U.S.-based nonprofit International Foundation for Electoral Systems.

Two more rounds of voting set for January 11 and January 25 will cover 265 of Myanmar's 330 townships, in some of which the junta does not have complete control.

Aung San Suu Kyi , the Nobel Peace Prize winner deposed by the military months after she won the last general election by a landslide in 2020, remains in detention. Her National League for Democracy has been dissolved.

Analysts say the junta's bid to set up a stable government in the midst of war is fraught with risk , and broad foreign recognition is also unlikely for any military-controlled administration with a civilian veneer.</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 04:07:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LDD4LLJKCZLSLD65B4GRZDZ64A.jpg?auth=2d6244012c729ce1eb0a7ba871e1269acc6739d4a341171a07e2cb218c466f46&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US Coast Guard suspends search for survivors after strike on suspected drug vessels</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us-coast-guard-suspends-search-survivors-after-strike-suspected-drug-vessels-2026-01-03/</link><description>Jan 2 (Reuters) - The United States Coast Guard said on Friday it had suspended a search for people in the water in the aftermath of a U.S. military strike earlier in the week on a convoy of suspected drug vessels in the Pacific Ocean.

The cause and precise locations of the disturbances were not immediately clear. Videos circulating on social media showed multiple explosions across Caracas. Reuters could not immediately verify the videos.

U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly promised land operations in Venezuela. He has not publicly detailed his aims but has privately pressured President Nicolas Maduro to flee the nation, Reuters has reported. Trump said on Monday it would be "smart" for Maduro to leave power.

The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The U.S. has made a major military buildup in the region, including an aircraft carrier, warships and advanced fighter jets stationed in the Caribbean.

Trump has announced a "blockade" of Venezuelan oil, expanded sanctions and staged more than two dozen strikes on vessels the U.S. alleges were involved in trafficking drugs in the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea.

Last week, Trump said the United States had "hit" an area in Venezuela where boats are loaded with drugs, marking the first known time Washington has carried out land operations in Venezuela since the pressure campaign began.

He did not say whether those strikes were carried out by the CIA or not. Other media outlets have reported that the spy agency was behind them.

Trump has accused the South American country of flooding the U.S. with drugs, and his administration has for months been bombing boats originating in South America that it alleges were carrying drugs. Many nations have condemned the attacks as extrajudicial killings and Maduro's government has always denied any involvement with drug trafficking.</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 07:19:39 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/QSO4J4MAT5DZZE7RYVYYJ7DXXA.JPG?auth=3e2bd8a9672d8c14afea4e628483e0f9c80fea23d84b7422fd8b8a5136e0a647&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Multiple explosions, aircraft sounds reported in Venezuela’s Caracas</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260103-multiple-explosions-aircraft-sounds-reported-in-venezuela-caracas-maduro-trump</link><description>Airplanes, loud ​noises and at least one ⁠column of smoke were being heard and seen in Venezuelan ​capital Caracas ‍in the early hours of ​Saturday morning, according to Reuters witnesses, ​and the southern area of the city, near a major military base, was without electricity.

The explosions come as US President Donald Trump , who has deployed a navy task force to the Caribbean, raised the possibility of ground strikes against Venezuela .

Sounds of explosions were still being heard around 2:15 am, although their exact location was unclear.

Trump on Monday said the United States hit and destroyed a docking area for alleged Venezuelan drug boats.

The Republican leader would not say if it was a military or CIA operation or where the strike occurred, noting only that it was "along the shore."

The attack would be the first known land strike on Venezuelan soil.

President Nicolas Maduro has neither confirmed nor denied Monday's strike, but said Thursday he was open to cooperation with Washington after weeks of US military pressure.

The Trump administration has accused Maduro of heading a drug cartel and says it is cracking down on trafficking, but the leftist leader denies any involvement in the narcotics trade, saying Washington is seeking to overthrow him because Venezuela has the largest known reserves of oil on Earth.

Washington has ramped up pressure on Caracas by informally closing Venezuela's airspace, imposing more sanctions and ordering the seizure of tankers loaded with Venezuelan oil.

For weeks Trump has threatened ground strikes on drug cartels in the region, saying they would start "soon," with Monday being the first apparent example.

US forces have also carried out numerous strikes on boats in both the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean since September, targeting what Washington says are drug smugglers.

The explosions come as US President Donald Trump , who has deployed a navy task force to the Caribbean, raised the possibility of ground strikes against Venezuela .

Sounds of explosions were still being heard around 2:15 am, although their exact location was unclear.

Trump on Monday said the United States hit and destroyed a docking area for alleged Venezuelan drug boats.

The Republican leader would not say if it was a military or CIA operation or where the strike occurred, noting only that it was "along the shore."

The attack would be the first known land strike on Venezuelan soil.

President Nicolas Maduro has neither confirmed nor denied Monday's strike, but said Thursday he was open to cooperation with Washington after weeks of US military pressure.

The Trump administration has accused Maduro of heading a drug cartel and says it is cracking down on trafficking, but the leftist leader denies any involvement in the narcotics trade, saying Washington is seeking to overthrow him because Venezuela has the largest known reserves of oil on Earth.

Washington has ramped up pressure on Caracas by informally closing Venezuela's airspace, imposing more sanctions and ordering the seizure of tankers loaded with Venezuelan oil.

For weeks Trump has threatened ground strikes on drug cartels in the region, saying they would start "soon," with Monday being the first apparent example.

US forces have also carried out numerous strikes on boats in both the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean since September, targeting what Washington says are drug smugglers.

The administration has provided no evidence that the targeted boats were involved in drug trafficking, however, prompting debate about the legality of these operations.

The rapidly moving crisis in Yemen has opened a major feud between the two Gulf powers and fractured the coalition of forces , headed by the internationally recognised government, who are fighting the Iran-backed Houthi movement.

The UAE statement said Yemenis should exercise restraint and prioritise dialogue to safeguard security and stability.

It came hours after the UAE-backed Southern Transitional Council (STC) announced its intention to hold a referendum on independence in two years as its forces were ejected from important areas they suddenly seized last month.

Saudi-backed forces said on Friday they had taken control of key locations in Hadramout, a large province with stretches of desert along the Saudi border, and on Saturday witnesses said they had entered parts of the region's capital Mukalla.

Yemen, split for a decade between warring regions, sits at a highly strategic location between the world's top oil exporter Saudi Arabia and the Bab al-Mandeb strait that guards the vital sea route between Europe and Asia.

The STC has for years been part of the internationally recognised government that controls southern and eastern Yemen and is backed by Gulf states against the Houthis.

Overnight the leader of that government, Presidential Council chief Rashad al-Alimi, said he had asked Saudi Arabia to host a forum to resolve the southern issue, adding he hoped this would bring all southern factions together.

The crisis began early last month when the STC suddenly seized swathes of territory including Hadramout, establishing firm control over the whole territory of the former state of South Yemen that merged with the north in 1990.

The leadership of the internationally recognised government, which had been based in Aden and included several ministers from the STC, departed for Saudi Arabia, which regarded the southern move as a threat to its security.

The crisis triggered the biggest split in decades between formerly close allies Saudi Arabia and the UAE, as years of divergence on critical issues came to a head, threatening to upend the regional order.

How far the feud over their differences on regional security bleeds into other issues may become plainer over the weekend as both countries join a scheduled OPEC meeting to determine the group's output policy.

Early this week Saudi Arabia bombed a base in Hadramout and asked all remaining UAE forces in Yemen to depart, calling this a red line for its security, and the UAE complied.

The STC declaration on Friday that it wants a two-year transition period leading to a referendum on independence for a new South Arabian state was the movement's clearest indication yet of its intention to secede.</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 10:21:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/XTQIKGOHANJU7ICFMK5AX7EHBI.jpg?auth=62db8daf5fa3a370376c812588080712678ebf12b68d33b8621983b176076c5d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump says US has captured Venezuela President Maduro</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/trump-says-us-has-captured-venezuela-president-maduro-2026-01-03/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 3 (Reuters) - The U.S. struck Venezuela overnight and captured its long-serving President Nicolas Maduro, President Donald Trump said early on Saturday after months of pressuring him over accusations of drug-running and illegitimacy in power.

Washington has not made such a direct intervention in Latin America since the invasion of Panama in 1989 to depose military leader Manuel Noriega, over similar allegations.

"The United States of America has successfully carried out a large scale strike against Venezuela and its leader, President Nicolas Maduro, who has been, along with his wife, captured and flown out of the country," Trump said in a Truth Social post.

The U.S. had accused Maduro of running a "narco-state" and rigging last year's election, which the opposition said it won overwhelmingly. The Venezuelan leader, who succeeded Hugo Chavez to take power in 2013, has said Washington wants to take control of Venezuela's oil reserves, the largest in the world.

Trump said the operation was carried out "in conjunction with U.S. Law Enforcement" and promised more details at an 11 a.m. (1600 GMT) press conference at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.

Maduro was captured by elite special forces troops, a U.S. official told Reuters.

There was no immediate confirmation by the Venezuelan government of Maduro's capture or departure, but Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino was defiant.

"Free, independent and sovereign Venezuela rejects with all the strength of its libertarian history the presence of these foreign troops, which have only left behind death, pain and destruction," Padrino said in a video broadcast on state media about the same time that Trump posted his message.

"Today we clench our fist in defense of what is ours. Let us unite, for in the unity of the people we will find the strength to resist and to triumph."

While various Latin American governments oppose Maduro and say he stole the 2024 election, direct U.S. action revives painful memories of past interventions and is generally strongly opposed by governments and populations in the region.

The Venezuelan opposition, headed by recent Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Corina Machado, said in a statement on X that it had no official comment on the events.

In the early hours on Saturday, explosions rocked Venezuela's capital Caracas and elsewhere, prompting Maduro's government to declare a national emergency and mobilize troops. It said attacks also took place in the states of Miranda, Aragua and La Guaira.

Blasts, aircraft and black smoke could be seen across Caracas from about 2 a.m. (0600 GMT) for roughly 90 minutes, according to Reuters witnesses and images circulating on social media.

Residents expressed shock and fear as they captured video of billowing smoke and bright orange flashes in the sky. “My love, oh no, look at that,” said one woman in a video, gasping at blasts in the distance.

Carmen Marquez, 50, a resident of the eastern part of the capital, said she went to her roof and could hear planes at different altitudes, though she could not see them.

"Flare-like lights were crossing the sky and then explosions could be heard. We’re worried about what’s coming next. We don’t know anything from the government, only what the state television says," she said.

A power outage affected the southern area of Caracas, near a major military base, witnesses said. A local media outlet allied with the ruling socialist party said explosions had taken place near the Fuerte Tiuna and La Carlota military bases.

Venezuelan allies Cuba and Iran were quick to condemn the strikes. Tehran called it "a blatant violation of national sovereignty and territorial integrity" and urged the U.N. Security Council to intervene to stop the "unlawful aggression."

The U.S., Venezuela's opposition and various other nations say Maduro rigged an election last year to stay in power. He has said there is a Western conspiracy to oust him illegally.

Trump had repeatedly promised land operations in the South American oil producer and said on Monday it would be "smart" for Maduro to leave power.

The Venezuelan government, in a statement before Trump's announcement, said the goal of the attack was for the United States to take possession of the country's oil and minerals.

The U.S. has made a major military buildup in the region, including an aircraft carrier, warships and advanced fighter jets stationed in the Caribbean.

Trump has sought a "blockade" of Venezuelan oil, expanded sanctions against the Maduro government and staged more than two dozen strikes on vessels the U.S. alleges were involved in trafficking drugs in the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea.

Last week, Trump said the United States had hit an area in Venezuela where boats are loaded with drugs, marking the first known time Washington has carried out land operations in Venezuela since the pressure campaign began.

Trump has accused Venezuela of flooding the U.S. with drugs, and his administration has for months been bombing boats originating in South America that it alleges were carrying drugs. Many nations have condemned the attacks as extrajudicial killings and Maduro's government has always denied any involvement with drug trafficking.

It was unclear under what legal authority the latest U.S. strikes were carried out. Legal experts have raised questions about the legality of the hits on suspected drug vessels in the region, which have killed more than 110 people so far.</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 10:21:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WLDZOA7YS5PILOSEHS5TNRUFSI.jpg?auth=dc8160ea4511e3c518dedfec0e8816acba644349a6b590fa0660196d34ac5b99&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran supreme leader says will not yield as protests simmer and US threatens</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-supreme-leader-says-will-not-yield-protests-simmer-us-threatens-2026-01-03/</link><description>DUBAI, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed not to yield after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to come to the aid of protesters, as rights groups reported a sharp rise in arrests following days of unrest sparked by soaring inflation.

Speaking in a recorded appearance on television on Saturday, Khamenei said the Islamic Republic "will not yield to the enemy" and said rioters should be "put in their place".

Rights groups say more than 10 people have been killed and scores detained in demonstrations that have flared across Iran since Sunday as the collapsing rial currency hits an economy already undermined by sanctions.

Authorities have attempted to maintain a dual approach to the unrest, saying protests over the economy are legitimate and will be met by dialogue, while meeting some demonstrations with tear gas amid violent street confrontations.

"The bazaaris were right. They are right to say they cannot do business in these conditions," said Khamenei, referring to market traders' concerns over the currency slide.

"We will speak with the protesters but talking to rioters is useless. Rioters should be put in their place," he added.

Reports of violence have centred on small cities in Iran's western provinces, where several people have been killed. Authorities have said two members of the security services had died and more than a dozen were injured in the unrest.

Hengaw, a Kurdish rights group, said late on Friday that it had identified 133 people arrested, an increase of 77 from the previous day.

Trump on Friday said the U.S. was "locked and loaded and ready to go" but did not specify what action it might take against Iran, where it carried out airstrikes last summer , joining an Israeli campaign targeting Iran's nuclear sites and military leaders.

The threat of action adds to the pressure on Iran's leaders as they navigate one of the most difficult periods in decades, with the sanctions-hit economy shrinking and the government struggling to provide water and electricity in some regions.

Iran has suffered a succession of major strategic blows to its regional position since the start of the war in Gaza in 2023 between its ally Hamas and Israel.

Israeli strikes hammered Iran's strongest regional partner Hezbollah. Tehran's close ally Bashar al-Assad was ousted in Syria. The Israeli and U.S. assault strikes on Iran set back the expensive atomic programme and killed senior military leaders, revealing extensive penetration of Tehran's upper echelons.

The protests are the biggest since mass nationwide demonstrations in late 2022 over the death in custody of Kurdish woman Mahsa Amini. This week's demonstrations have not matched those in scale, but still represent the toughest domestic test for authorities in three years.

Rights groups such as Hengaw and activists posting on social media reported continued protests and violence by security forces across Iran, while state-affiliated media reported what it called attacks on property by infiltrators "in the name of protest".

State television has reported arrests of people accused of manufacturing petrol bombs and home-made pistols.

Numerous social media posts overnight said there had been unrest in a number of cities and towns, as well as three districts of the capital Tehran.

Reuters could not immediately verify the reports by rights groups, state media or social media accounts.</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 11:39:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/EEWU6YUEQVPIDFNWFLGZN2ESSA.jpg?auth=a9d6cf030cf986669a1d78083a0dac5e11f25db3b90f62968804e95ddc35f5b9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>World reacts to US strikes on Venezuela</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/world-reacts-us-strikes-venezuela-2026-01-03/</link><description>Jan 3 (Reuters) - Following are reactions to Saturday's U.S. strikes on Venezuela.

RUSSIA FOREIGN MINISTRY:

"This morning, the United States committed an act of armed aggression against Venezuela. This is deeply concerning and condemnable."

"The pretexts used to justify such actions are unfounded. Ideological animosity has prevailed over business pragmatism and the willingness to build relationships based on trust and predictability."

"In the current situation, it is important, first and foremost, to prevent further escalation and to focus on finding a way out of the situation through dialogue."

"Latin America must remain a zone of peace, as it declared itself to be in 2014. And Venezuela must be guaranteed the right to determine its own destiny without any destructive, let alone military, interference from outside."

"We support the statement by the Venezuelan authorities and the leaders of Latin American countries calling for an immediate meeting of the UN Security Council."

EUROPEAN UNION HIGH REPRESENTATIVE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS KAJA KALLAS:

"I have spoken with Secretary of State Marco Rubio and our Ambassador in Caracas. The EU is closely monitoring the situation in Venezuela.

"The EU has repeatedly stated that Mr Maduro lacks legitimacy and has defended a peaceful transition. Under all circumstances, the principles of international law and the UN Charter must be respected. We call for restraint."

IRAN'S SUPREME LEADER AYATOLLAH ALI KHAMENEI:

"What matters is that when a person realizes the enemy is arrogantly trying to impose something on the country, on the officials, on the government, and on the nation, one must stand firmly against the enemy and bare one’s chest in resistance. We will not yield to the enemy."

"Relying on Almighty God, trusting in God, and with confidence in the support of the people, God willing and by divine grace, we will bring the enemy to its knees."

SPANISH FOREIGN MINISTRY:

"Spain calls for de-escalation and moderation, and for action to always be taken in accordance with international law and the principles of the UN Charter."

"In this regard, Spain is willing to offer its good offices to achieve a peaceful and negotiated solution to the current crisis."

"Earlier this morning, Saturday 3rd January 2026, the United States commenced military operations within the territory of Venezuela.2

"Trinidad and Tobago is NOT a participant in any of these ongoing military operations. Trinidad and Tobago continues to maintain peaceful relations with the people of Venezuela."

RODERICH KIESEWETTER, PROMINENT MP FROM GERMANY’S CONSERVATIVE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC UNION:

"With President Trump, the U.S. are abandoning the rules-based order that has shaped us since 1945."

"The coup in Venezuela marks a return to the old U.S. doctrine from before 1940: a mindset of thinking in terms of spheres of influence, where the law of force rules, not international law."

"Trump is destroying what was left of any trust in the U.S."

"The American actions in Venezuela overnight are unorthodox and contrary to international law - but if they make China and Russia think twice, it may be a good thing."

"I hope the Venezuelan people can now turn a new leaf without Maduro."

ITALIAN OPPOSITION PARTY LEADER AND FORMER PRIME MINISTER GIUSEPPE CONTE:

"The American aggression against Venezuela has no legal basis. We are facing a blatant violation of international law, which certifies the dominance of the strongest and best equipped militarily... I hope that the entire international community will make its voice heard and that everyone will understand that if rules only apply to enemies and not to friends, no one can feel safe anymore. Nor can the illiberal nature of a government's rule justify an attack to a sovereign state".

"International law prohibits the use of force as a means of national policy. Short of a U.N. Chapter VII mandate, force is only available in response to an armed attack or possibly to rescue a population under imminent threat of extermination."

"Clearly, none of these requirements are fulfilled by the armed operation against Venezuela. The U.S. interest in repressing the drugs trade or claims that the Maduro government was in essence a criminal enterprise offers no legal justification."

INDONESIA'S FOREIGN MINISTRY SPOKESPERSON, YVONNE MEWENGKANG:

Indonesia is monitoring developments in Venezuela to ensure the safety of its citizens.

"Indonesia also calls on all relevant parties to prioritize peaceful resolution through de-escalation and dialogue, while prioritizing the protection of civilians."

"Indonesia emphasizes the importance of respecting international law and the principles of the UN Charter."

BELGIUM'S DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS MINISTER MAXIME PREVOT:

"The safety of our citizens is a top priority. Our embassy in Bogotá, which is responsible for Venezuela, and our services in Brussels are fully mobilized. The situation is being closely monitored, in coordination with our European partners."</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 11:39:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WB2XHWTHBBMMHG5JNKLBCVXGMY.jpg?auth=ce7b16e1261bb7eafcd67f8cafe9c4f2c598885b7ae64de0bbf9bae7537542d2&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Who is Nicolas Maduro, Venezuela's president?</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/who-is-nicolas-maduro-venezuelas-president-2026-01-03/</link><description>Jan 3 (Reuters) - Following are some key facts about Nicolas Maduro , the Venezuelan president who President Donald Trump said had been captured by U.S. forces on Saturday.

Trump, whose government has accused Maduro of running drug cartels and other crimes, had been pressuring the strongman to leave office for months.

- Maduro was born into a working-class family on November 23, 1962, son of a trade union leader. He worked as a bus driver during the time army officer Hugo Chavez led a failed coup attempt in 1992.

- He campaigned for Chavez’s release from prison and became a fervent supporter of his leftist agenda. He won a seat in the legislature following Chavez's 1998 election.

- He rose to become president of the National Assembly and then foreign minister, travelling the globe to build international alliances through oil-financed assistance programs.

- Chavez named him as his hand-picked successor and Maduro was narrowly elected president in 2013 following Chavez's death.

- His administration oversaw a spectacular economic collapse characterized by hyperinflation and chronic shortages. His rule became best known for allegedly rigged elections, food shortages and rights abuses, including harsh crackdowns on protests in 2014 and 2017. Millions of Venezuelans emigrated abroad.

- His government was subject to aggressive sanctions by the U.S. and other powers. In 2020 Washington indicted him on corruption and other charges. Maduro rejected the accusations.

"The president and high-ranking officials are working to resolve" the economic difficulties in the sanctions-battered country, Khamenei said in a speech marking a Shiite holiday.

"The shopkeepers have protested against this situation and that is completely fair," he added. But Khamenei nonetheless warned that while "authorities must have dialogue with protesters, it is useless to have dialogue with rioters. Those must be put in their place."

At least eight people were reported on Thursday to have been killed in the protests so far, including members of the security services, according to official figures.

Two deaths overnight into Saturday involved a new level of violence. In Qom, home to the country's major Shiite seminaries, a grenade exploded, killing a man there, the state-owned IRAN newspaper reported. It quoted security officials alleging the man was carrying the grenade to attack people in the city, some 130 kilometres (80 miles) south of the capital, Tehran.

Online videos from Qom purportedly showed fires in the street overnight.

The second death happened in the town of Harsin, some 370 kilometers (230 miles) southwest of Tehran. There, the newspaper said, a member of the Basij, the all-volunteer arm of Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, died in a gun and knife attack in the town in Kermanshah province.

The protests have mostly been concentrated in mid-sized cities in Iran's west and southwest, where clashes and vandalism have been reported.

At least 25 cities have seen protest gatherings of varying sizes, according to an AFP tally based on local media.

However, local media do not necessarily report on every incident, and state media have downplayed coverage of protests, while videos flooding social media are often impossible to verify.

The Fars news agency reported gatherings on Friday in several working-class neighbourhoods of Tehran, which is home to around 10 million people.

But on Saturday, a public holiday, the atmosphere in the capital appeared quiet, with streets mostly empty as the skies spat rain and snow, according to AFP journalists.

In Darehshahr, in the country's west, around 300 people blocked streets, threw molotov cocktails and "brandished Kalashnikovs" on Friday, according to Fars.

The movement kicked off on Sunday when shopkeepers went on strike in Tehran to protest economic conditions, and spread after university students elsewhere in the country took up the cause.

In recent days, the protests have taken on a more overtly political bent.

In Karaj, on the outskirts of the capital, "a few people burned the Iranian flag, shouting 'Death to the dictator!' and 'This isn't the last battle, Pahlavi is coming back!'" Fars reported, adding that others in the crowd objected to the slogans.

The pro-Western Pahlavi dynasty ruled Iran from 1925 to 1979, when it was toppled by the Islamic revolution.

Since the protests began, authorities have adopted a conciliatory tone when it comes to economic demands, while warning that destabilisation and chaos will not be tolerated.

Though widespread, the demonstrations are smaller than the ones that broke out in 2022, triggered by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini , who was arrested for allegedly violating Iran's strict dress code for women.

Her death sparked a nationwide wave of anger that left several hundred people dead, including dozens of members of the security forces.

Iran was also gripped by nationwide protests that began in late 2019 over a rise in fuel prices, eventually leading to calls to topple the country's clerical rulers.</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 11:39:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/263a95d6-e894-11f0-babc-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26003388650698.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuelan security forces patrol Caracas' empty streets</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/shocked-venezuelans-hunker-down-unsure-what-comes-next-2026-01-03/</link><description>Jan 3 (Reuters) - Venezuelan security forces patrolled largely empty streets at dawn in the capital, Caracas, on Saturday, hours after loud explosions woke residents to the news that U.S. commandos had bombed the country and captured President Nicolas Maduro .

Streets close to the Miraflores presidential palace were deserted except for checkpoints manned by uniformed gunmen, as residents expressed their shock at a U.S. military strike that left them guessing who was now in charge of the oil-rich nation.

Smoke streaked the sky, with a dark plume still billowing from the direction of the Port of La Guaira to the north, while another was visible near an air base in the capital.

Most residents stayed home, devouring the latest information on their phones, while some went to stock up on groceries in case they need to hunker down for a prolonged period.

For supporters of the opposition, led by Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Corina Machado , excitement was also in the air.

"My sister, who is in the United States, woke me up with the news; she was crying. We cried together out of happiness," said Jairo Chacin, 39, a mechanic and workshop owner in oil hub Maracaibo, as he waited in a long line to stock up on groceries.

"I went out to check on my business because I was afraid of looting, but the street is deserted. I wanted to fill up my gas tank, but the service stations are already closed, so I took the opportunity to buy food because we don't know what’s coming. Honestly, I have a mix of fear and joy."

U.S. President Donald Trump confirmed Maduro's capture after months of pressuring him over accusations of drug-running and illegitimacy in power. It was the first such U.S. military intervention since the invasion of Panama in 1989 to depose military leader Manuel Noriega .

Soon after the capture of Maduro, Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello appeared on state TV standing on the street and wearing a helmet and flak jacket, urging Venezuelans not to cooperate with the "terrorist enemy".

The Venezuelan opposition said in a statement on X that it had no official comment on the events.

The overnight attack began at about 2 a.m. (0600 GMT), according to Reuters witnesses, who saw blasts, aircraft and black smoke across Caracas for roughly 90 minutes. Video verified by Reuters showed multiple explosions illuminating the night sky, followed by loud blasts. The attack left the southern area of the city, near a major military base, without electricity.

"I couldn’t believe it. I saw it first on social media and then on television. Now, I want to know what will come next," said Nancy Pérez, a 74-year-old woman who went out to a bakery near her home in Valencia, central Venezuela.

One eyewitness video, authenticated by Reuters, captured fire and smoke rising above the Port of La Guaira. The location was confirmed by the port layout, road dividers and buildings, which matched file and satellite imagery.

Other verified videos captured explosions and smoke at the Generalissimo Francisco de Miranda Air Base in eastern Caracas.

Flight radar trackers on Saturday morning showed the airspace over Venezuela was completely empty.

Carmen Marquez, 50, who lives in the east of the capital, said she went to her roof and could hear planes at different altitudes, though she could not see them.

"Flare-like lights were crossing the sky and then explosions could be heard. We're worried about what's coming next. We don't know anything from the government, only what the state television says," she said.</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 12:40:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/6A5FEBSE3VPS5OZ2EMWEW7RRBI.jpg?auth=b7026e0bd3b4472ed500b013e6a02158ec412463da39e7f55f0530ee5fc6a0bb&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UK's Starmer says Britain was not involved in US strikes on Venezuela</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/uks-starmer-says-britain-was-not-involved-us-strikes-venezuela-2026-01-03/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Britain was not involved in the United States' strikes on Venezuela on Saturday and that it was important to uphold international law, and that he wanted to speak to U.S. President Donald Trump and find out exactly what had happened.

Trump said in a post on social media early on Saturday that U.S. forces had captured Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro and removed him from the country while Venezuela's Vice President Delcy Rodriguez said she did not know Maduro's location or if he was still alive.

Asked if he condemned the U.S. action like the leaders of Britain's left-leaning Liberal Democrat and Green parties, who both called it unlawful, Starmer said he first wanted to understand exactly what had happened.

"It's obviously a fast-moving situation and we need to establish all the facts," he said in a statement to British broadcasters.

"I want to speak to President Trump. I want to speak to allies. I can be absolutely clear that we were not involved ... and I always say and believe we should all uphold international law," he added.

Nigel Farage, leader of the Reform UK party which is currently highest in the opinion polls, said he believed the U.S. actions broke international law "but if they make China and Russia think twice, it may be a good thing".

Starmer, a former human rights lawyer, also said the foreign ministry was working to ensure the roughly 500 British citizens in Venezuela remained safe.

His rule abruptly ended on Saturday when President Donald Trump announced U.S. forces had captured him and flown him out of the country.

A 63-year-old socialist and the handpicked successor of the late Hugo Chavez, Maduro was long accused by critics both at home and abroad of being a dictator who jailed or persecuted political opponents and repeatedly staged sham elections.

Maduro, a salsa aficionado with a flair for theatrics, often called opposition politicians "fascist demons" and took pride in resisting U.S. pressure against him, even having his invocation to Trump of "yes peace, not war" remixed into an electronica song.

He was sworn in for a third term in January 2025 following a 2024 election that was widely condemned as fraudulent by international observers and the opposition. Thousands of people who protested against the government's declaration of victory were jailed.

Venezuela's opposition, the United States and many other Western countries also considered Maduro's election win in 2018 to be a sham.

His government's repressive measures were highlighted by the awarding of the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize to opposition leader Maria Corina Machado.

After Trump announced last October that he was authorizing CIA operations in the country, Maduro blasted "those demonic powers that aim to sink their claws into Venezuela to steal our oil." Maduro has long denied U.S. accusations of connections to drug smuggling and corruption.

In August, Washington doubled its reward for Maduro's arrest to $50 million over allegations of drug trafficking and links to criminal groups.

Trump ratcheted up the pressure in recent months with a huge build-up of the U.S. military in the southern Caribbean, more than two dozen strikes on vessels allegedly involved in trafficking drugs in the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea, and a ramping up of sanctions.

A U.N. Fact-Finding Mission found last month that the country's Bolivarian National Guard (GNB) committed serious human rights violations and crimes against humanity over more than a decade in targeting political opponents.

Maduro long denied abusing political and human rights, instead describing his government as being at odds with what he views as a decades-long imperialist campaign to topple Chavez's socialist movement and take Venezuela's oil.

He and his government called sanctions by the U.S. and others illegitimate measures that amounted to an "economic war" designed to cripple the country. His supporters hailed him as a hero who stood up to Washington in the tradition of Cuba's Fidel Castro.

Protesters led months of demonstrations in 2017 against Maduro's government, a period marked by accusations of torture, arbitrary arrests and abuse by security forces. Those protests left 125 people dead.

Dozens more died during protests after Maduro's inauguration to his second term in 2019. After the 2024 election, the U.N. found that Maduro's government escalated repressive tactics to crush peaceful protests, with over two dozen dead and 2,400 arrests.

Maduro's rule was marked by an extended economic collapse in the once relatively affluent nation that prompted an exodus of some 7.7 million migrants.

Almost 82% of Venezuelans live in poverty, with 53% in extreme poverty, unable to buy even basic foodstuffs, a U.N. special rapporteur said in 2024 after visiting the country.

Maduro was born into a working-class family on November 23, 1962, son of a trade union leader. He worked as a bus driver during the time army officer Chavez led a failed coup attempt in 1992.

He agitated for Chavez to be released from prison and backed his fervent leftist agenda in an era when socialism was well out of favor.

After Chavez's 1998 election, Maduro won a seat in the legislature and spent years championing his mentor's self-styled revolution against U.S. intervention in Latin America.

Adversaries took swipes at Maduro's working-class roots and portrayed him as a buffoonish cretin who did little more than slavishly repeat Chavez's bombast.

But the criticism made little dent in his meteoric rise: he became president of the National Assembly and later foreign minister. In that role he crisscrossed the globe to help build alliances with other developing countries through oil-financed assistance programs.

Maduro was narrowly elected president after Chavez died from cancer in 2013. But there was a gaping chasm between his own appeal and the legendary charisma of his predecessor.

His rule was quickly plagued by bread lines and product shortages that smacked of Soviet-era collapse, largely due to his unwillingness to unwind lavish Chavez-era subsidies that were unsustainable after the oil boom came to an end.

As inflation soared in 2013, Maduro sent troops to occupy shops that sold home appliances and forced them to sell off their wares at fire-sale prices, helping fuel his popularity in the run-up to a nationwide election for mayors.

In 2018, militants attempted to assassinate him by sending explosives-laden drones over the top of a rally he was addressing on a Caracas avenue, leading him to reduce his spontaneous public appearances and limit live broadcasts of public events.

Throughout his career, Maduro was often flanked by his wife, Cilia Flores, who held numerous high-ranking positions, including attorney general and chief of parliament, and was often seen as a power broker with as much influence as her spouse.

Trump said on Saturday Flores was also captured and flown out of the country.</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 14:19:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CU653BXW3BNXHPXQGSPQEVJ7SA.jpg?auth=a0df28f27bccaa3c1e37ef8d9f19ee858950aea3967783160cd0b04c95669f84&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Swiss prosecutors place bar managers under investigation after deadly blaze</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/swiss-prosecutors-place-bar-managers-under-investigation-after-deadly-blaze-2026-01-03/</link><description>VIENNA, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Swiss prosecutors said on Saturday they have placed under criminal investigation the two managers of a bar where a blaze on New Year's Day killed at least 40 people.

Zelenskiy called on Ukrainian lawmakers to support Shmyhal, a former prime minister, as the new energy minister, saying his experience was vital to ensure stability in the power sector amid intensifying Russian attacks.

"It is crucial that, after each Russian strike, we can quickly restore what has been destroyed, and that the growth of Ukraine’s energy sector remains stable and sufficient to meet the country’s needs," Zelenskiy said, posting a picture of him meeting Shmyhal in the presidential office on Telegram.

Russia has pounded Ukraine's energy sector with drones and missiles for consecutive winters since the war began nearly four years ago. In recent months, Moscow has again intensified its strikes on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, forcing long blackouts across the country during critical winter months.

Shmyhal, 50, is one of the most experienced government officials in Ukraine, praised by analysts for his skills to maintain economic stability and ensure efficient government operations after Russia's invasion in February 2022.

He was Ukraine's longest-serving prime minister, running the government from 2020 until July 2025, when he was appointed defence minister.

Shmyhal's appointment comes as Zelenskiy launched a major shake-up of the Ukrainian defence sector and security forces.

On Friday, Zelenskiy appointed popular military intelligence head Kyrylo Budanov as his chief of staff and also nominated a new defence minister.

The reshuffle of Ukraine's top officials overseeing security forces and crucial defence and energy sectors comes weeks after a major energy sector corruption scandal that caused Ukraine's biggest wartime political crisis, resulting in the dismissal of Zelenskiy's previous head of office. Justice and energy ministers also resigned as a result of the scandal.

Zelenskiy said the changes were needed to make Ukraine more resilient as the country faces a critical moment in its efforts to end the war with Russia.

The government changes come as Ukrainian negotiators press for security guarantees from the United States and European allies as U.S. President Donald Trump pushes both Kyiv and Moscow to find a solution on how to end the war.

National security advisors from 18 countries met in Kyiv on Saturday to discuss the details of security guarantees and economic agreements on Ukraine's post-war recovery.

Ukraine’s parliament must approve Zelenskiy’s nominations of energy and defence ministers.</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 15:20:39 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/FQ7OV3AFQFJKFIAUNBISE2TNOE.jpg?auth=ae41b9c934f0378af22a83485e994d2e94a7cd245b1aeef6bd1fc7b25c6e47ae&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuela vice president Rodriguez in Russia, four sources say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/venezuela-vice-president-rodriguez-russia-four-sources-say-2026-01-03/</link><description>Jan 3 (Reuters) - Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodriguez is in Russia, four sources familiar with her movements said on Saturday, after President Donald Trump said President Nicolas Maduro had been seized by U.S. forces after an attack on the country.

"These acts represent a grave affront to Venezuela's sovereignty and yet another extremely dangerous precedent for the entire international community," Lula said in a post on X.

Lula also called for a "vigorous" response from the United Nations, adding that Brazil remains open to promoting dialogue and cooperation.

Earlier on Saturday, the U.S. attacked Venezuela and deposed Maduro, President Donald Trump said, in Washington's most direct intervention in Latin America since the 1989 invasion of Panama.

Lula had previously said that an armed intervention in Venezuela would be a "humanitarian catastrophe" , and has repeatedly offered for Brazil to mediate disputes between the countries.

Brazilian officials were holding an emergency cabinet meeting to discuss the situation in Venezuela, the country's foreign ministry told Reuters, while noting that Foreign Minister Mauro Vieira had spoken with his Venezuelan counterpart on Saturday. It did not provide further details.

The head of Brazil's Federal Police also said Venezuela had closed its border with the country, one of the main crossing points for Venezuelan refugees in the region and where Brazil has run operations to assist them since 2018.

After a brief closure, the border was reopened, Roraima state Governor Antonio Denarium told Reuters. Roraima is one of two Brazilian states - along with Amazonas - to share borders with Venezuela and receives around 70% of all Venezuelan refugees that arrive in Brazil, the governor said.

There were no official reports of a higher influx of refugees at the border ahead of its closing due to the military escalation in Venezuela.</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 15:20:47 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/YIDKLLGQXFL2TFEFUPZEUCZJOQ.jpg?auth=ea5f5068d656a71bf5f6201014a91a6146da6ceb349d500e2225f4148292c1a3&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Inside Venezuela’s oil industry: World’s largest oil reserves, failing infrastructure</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260103-world-largest-oil-reserves-failing-infrastructure-inside-venezuela-oil-industry</link><description>⁠The ‍United ​States is ⁠going to be "very strongly involved" in Venezuela 's ​oil ‍industry in the ​wake of the operation to ​capture Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro , President Donald Trump told Fox News ‍on Saturday.

"We have ​the greatest oil companies in the ‌world, the biggest, the greatest, ‍and we're going to be very much involved.

Here's what we know about Venezuela’s oil industry.

Venezuela holds the world’s largest oil reserves – about 303 billion barrels, or 17% of global reserves – surpassing OPEC+ leader Saudi Arabia , according to the London-based Energy Institute. Most of its reserves are heavy oil in the Orinoco Belt, making production costly, though technically straightforward, according to the US Energy Department.

Despite its vast reserves, Venezuela’s crude output remains far below capacity due to mismanagement, underinvestment, and sanctions. Production, which once peaked at 3.5 million barrels per day in the 1970s (over 7% of global output), fell below 2 million bpd during the 2010s and averaged around 1.1 million bpd last year.

Analysts note that any regime change could eventually boost production if sanctions are lifted and foreign investment returns. However, historical precedents in Libya and Iraq suggest recovery is unlikely to be rapid.

Venezuela nationalised its oil sector in the 1970s, creating Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA). In the 1990s, it briefly opened up to foreign investment, but under Hugo Chavez from 1999 onward, PDVSA was required to maintain majority ownership in all projects. The state company partnered with firms including Chevron, China National Petroleum Corporation, ENI, Total, and Russia’s Rosneft to boost production.

The United States was formerly Venezuela’s main oil buyer, but sanctions shifted the main market to China over the past decade. Exports halted entirely after the Trump administration’s blockade on vessels entering or leaving Venezuela in December 2025. PDVSA also owns significant refining capacity abroad, including CITGO in the US, though creditors are contesting control through long-standing legal cases in American courts.</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 15:21:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/378d7240-e8b2-11f0-9359-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25355780619234.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Condemnation and applause in Latin America</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/condemnation-applause-latin-america-after-us-seizes-venezuelas-maduro-2026-01-03/</link><description>SANTIAGO/SAO PAULO, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Latin American leaders were divided between condemnation and jubilation in the wake of a surprise attack on Venezuela early on Saturday that U.S. President Donald Trump said resulted in the capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro.

While much of the region has long been wary of a return to U.S. interventions throughout the 20th century that helped install authoritarian governments from Chile to Honduras, Maduro - who presided over his country’s social and economic collapse - was an increasingly unpopular and isolated leader.

Many Latin American countries have also experienced a shift in recent elections to more right-leaning governments, many of whose leaders view the U.S.-backed military regimes of the last century as necessary bulwarks against socialism.

In a sign of the economic pain faced under Maduro, nearly 8 million Venezuelans have fled the country since 2018, with 85% of them migrating to neighbors in Latin America and the Caribbean, according to the UN's International Organization for Migration.

Many countries in the region have experienced surges in organized crime in recent years and the specter of Venezuela's Tren de Aragua gang has loomed large over voters' minds, leading to a rise in politicians vowing to crack down on crime and immigration.

While few leaders will shed serious tears about Maduro's ousting, governments in the region will react along political lines, said Steven Levitsky, a professor and director of Harvard's David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies.

"I think you'll see right-wing governments applaud because that's what they do. You'll see left-wing governments criticize because how could they not?" Levitsky said.

The strongest condemnation of the attack came in a string of posts on X from neighboring Colombia's President Gustavo Petro, a leftist who has frequently clashed with Trump and has also been threatened by the U.S. president.

“The Colombian government rejects the aggression against the sovereignty of Venezuela and Latin America,” Petro said in one message, while calling for an immediate meeting of the United Nations Security Council, of which Colombia is a member.

His Brazilian counterpart, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, echoed Petro's comments.

“The bombings on Venezuela’s territory and the capture of its president cross an unacceptable line,” Lula said in a statement.

Chile’s outgoing President Gabriel Boric condemned the attack but President-elect Jose Antonio Kast, who rose to power by promising to crack down on migration and crime, said in a post on X that Maduro's arrest was great news for the region.

"Now begins a greater task. The governments of Latin America must ensure that the entire apparatus of the regime abandons power and is held accountable," Kast, who will be sworn in on March 11, said.

Argentina’s President Javier Milei, Trump’s closest ally in the region, has long criticized Maduro and posted videos and statements on X in favor of the attack.

In Ecuador, right-wing President Daniel Noboa said Venezuelans opposed to Maduro and his political godfather Hugo Chavez have an ally in Ecuador.

“All the criminal narco-Chavistas will have their moment,” Noboa said on X. “Their structure will finally collapse across the continent.”

Protests both in favor and against the strikes in Venezuela have been scheduled in Buenos Aires and other cities across the region.

The capture of Maduro by U.S. forces “is one of the most momentous decisions in the history of U.S.-Latin America relations,” said Brian Winter, editor-in-chief of Americas Quarterly and vice president of policy at Americas Society/Council of the Americas.

“The operation confirms return of Washington as policeman in its 'sphere of influence,' an idea that defined much of 19th and 20th centuries but had faded since (the) end of the Cold War,” Winter said in a post on LinkedIn.</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 16:26:03 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WX7XTYXSMROINF3QZVX3BIMS6Q.jpg?auth=328f5341af57b25392cb7b8ea09c7cb824aac3a631cb31650272f44e8fdbf091&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuela diaspora celebrates Maduro's deposition, wonders what's next</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/venezuela-diaspora-celebrates-maduros-deposition-wonders-whats-next-2026-01-03/</link><description>Jan 3 (Reuters) - Venezuelan migrants around the world erupted in celebration on Saturday following the U.S.-led deposition of President Nicolas Maduro, whose government prompted one of the largest migration crises in recent history.

Chants celebrating Maduro's capture were heard in the streets of Chile's capital, where Venezuelans gathered to share their joy.

"We are free. We are all happy that the dictatorship has fallen and that we have a free country," said Khaty Yanez, a Venezuelan woman who has spent the last seven years in Chile.

"My joy is too big," her compatriot Jose Gregorio said. "After so many years, after so many struggles, after so much work, today is the day. Today is the day of freedom."

Since 2014, some 7.7 million Venezuelans or 20% of the population have left the country unable to afford food or seeking better opportunities abroad, according to the U.N. International Organization for Migration , opens new tab .

Neighboring Colombia has received the largest share of the diaspora, around 2.8 million, followed by 1.7 million in Peru, according to the R4V platform, a group of regional NGOs assisting migrants and refugees from Venezuela set up by the U.N. migration agency.

For years, the U.S. was a haven for Venezuelans but in President Donald Trump's second term many are being branded criminals and forced to seek refuge elsewhere .

After the initial joy, doubts about Venezuela's future also set in, as Venezuelans abroad wonder what the future holds for their country and its citizens.

Andres Losada, who has lived in Spain for three years and is among the 400,000 Venezuelans residing in the country according to official data, said he is struggling between worry and joy about the situation in Venezuela.

"Although what people are going through in Caracas is tough, I believe that beyond that there is a light that will lead us to freedom," he added.

Venezuelan security forces patrolled largely empty streets at dawn in the capital, Caracas, on Saturday. Most residents stayed home, devouring the latest information on their phones, while some went to stock up on groceries in case they need to hunker down for a prolonged period.

Speaking to a local TV station in Spain, Agustin Rodriguez, the vice president of a Venezuelan cultural association, expressed concern about the strikes but said they "may be necessary to find a way out for the country in which there can be a return to power alternation, where there can be a future."</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 16:26:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7PLP7FO3E5LLTPJ3L7KPKKGURY.jpg?auth=8e1226105a34031b75a85367aebda05b844d200b746508028a665e1d34a2269f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuelan opposition activists in Madrid warily cheer Maduro capture</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/venezuelan-opposition-activists-madrid-warily-cheer-maduro-capture-2026-01-03/</link><description>MADRID, Jan 3 (Reuters) - In Madrid, Venezuelan opposition activists and others who follow the situation in their homeland were glued to TV and social media on Saturday, amazed by news of Nicolas Maduro's capture by U.S. forces .

But they also wondered what comes next.

U.S. President Donald Trump, who had been applying intense pressure on Maduro for months, announced that U.S. forces had captured Maduro and flown him out of the country, saying later that the Venezuelan leader and his wife would be taken to New York.

Spain is home to the largest Venezuelan migrant population outside Latin America and the U.S., and they include senior opposition figures including Edmundo Gonzalez and Leopoldo Lopez.

"We are all happy," one opposition figure told Reuters by WhatsApp. "But we must ensure that the transition is orderly, peaceful and respectful," said the person, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the situation.

This person rejected the idea that Vice President Delcy Rodriguez might now take power, saying that the opposition leaders who won past elections before being blocked by Maduro were the rightful heirs to the Venezuelan presidency.

Venezuela's opposition, the United States and many other Western countries considered Maduro's election wins in 2018 and 2024 to be fraudulent.

"The Venezuelan people voted massively for Edmundo (Gonzalez) and Maria Corina Machado . Edmundo is the president-elect with constitutional legitimacy," the person said, referring to the July 2024 election and adding this ruled out Rodriguez.

Manuel Garcia, a former opposition leader and lawmaker who left Venezuela after the disputed 2024 election, said the speed of Maduro's removal demonstrated his government did not have the "military capacity they have been boasting about".

"Today marks the beginning of a new stage that will culminate in the consolidation of the transition led by María Corina and President Edmundo Gonzalez," Garcia said.

José Miguel Calvillo, an international affairs and migration professor at Madrid's Complutense University, said it was "very likely" that the U.S. had already had some back-channel discussions with elements of the Venezuelan government and the military to arrange a transition.

"If it is confirmed that the intervention of the United States has been supported by the internal government, a transitional government will be expected to include major players from the current opposition," he said.

"What is desirable for both Venezuela and the U.S. is that there will not be a radical break with the current government but rather a moderate transition."

Manuel Muñiz, chancellor of Madrid's private IE Business School, said the coming days would test the strength both of the opposition and the Venezuelan government beyond just Maduro.

"The Venezuelan regime is quite granular and present throughout Venezuelan society," he said. "There are a number of avenues in front of us, and not all of them lead to open, peaceful elections and a transition of power in Venezuela. There are some that lead to violence, disorder and instability."

Jimena Blanco, chief analyst for risk consultancy Verisk Maplecroft, said there were divergent views in the opposition about whether Machado or Gonzalez should take the presidency.

Machado was barred from running in the 2024 presidential election, despite having won the opposition's primary by a landslide, and her ally Edmundo Gonzalez took her place as the main opposition candidate.

Machado won the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize for her work promoting democracy.

Blanco said that while Gonzalez may be the constitutionally elected president, Machado is credited with unifying the opposition, creating the conditions for his election and risking her life staying in Venezuela to maintain opposition momentum.

"There are others that argue that Edmundo Gonzalez is elected president and he should take office," she said.

Scenarios discussed in opposition circles included a military junta of second or third tier armed forces leaders overseeing a civilian cabinet of opposition leaders that did not include Machado, for her to then run in elections.

"For her it would be very damaging if she was to be seen as to be placed in power rather than ascending to power through democratic channels she has tried to promote," Blanco said.

In the Canary Islands, a Spanish archipelago where many Venezuelans live, Agustín Rodríguez, vice president of the Canarian-Venezuelan Union migrant support network, said he had mixed feelings about Saturday's events.

But he hoped it meant the third of Venezuela's population that lives in exile - something he described as the country's "displaced heart" - could return.

Some 7.7 million Venezuelans left the country in recent years.

"No one likes to see these kinds of fireworks, but they may be necessary to find a way out for the country in which there can be a return to power alternation, there can be a future, people can return to their country," he said.</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 16:26:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LN33CFML4JLY7AICNXPHCIMRF4.jpg?auth=69ead17414fbb589dadee50bf4af6a4356a56562627b8ca0387df20307382685&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Disbelief as fire exploded inside Swiss bar: 'We thought it was a joke'</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/disbelief-fire-exploded-inside-swiss-bar-we-thought-it-was-joke-2026-01-03/</link><description>CRANS-MONTANA, Switzerland, Jan 3 (Reuters) - When a devastating fire broke out in the Swiss ski resort of Crans-Montana at around 1:30 a.m. on Thursday, some New Year’s revellers seemed unsure at first whether to take it seriously.

Le Constellation, a two-storey bar with a glass-enclosed terrace, was still packed with partygoers, many of them teenagers.

Witnesses reported seeing a staff member, who was sitting on the shoulders of a colleague, carrying bottles with fizzing candle-style sparklers in the basement section shortly before the ceiling caught fire.

A video shared on social media and verified by Reuters shows a young man using his shirt to try to beat back flames that are beginning to form in the ceiling as others record the scene on their phones. Loud music plays in the background.

"We thought it was a joke, or that it wasn't necessarily serious," said Axel Clavier, a teenager who was in the basement with friends when the fire started.

Moments later, there was a huge cloud of black smoke, Clavier told the Swiss news agency Keystone. "We couldn't breathe anymore."

It all happened in seconds, said Julia, a 19-year-old from the Swiss city of Lausanne who did not want to give her last name. Panic ensued.

"People just suddenly started running and walking on top of each other," she told Reuters, fighting back tears. "There was an enormous crowd, and this really small entrance, and it was hard to escape."

She was on the ground floor and escaped with an injured foot. A friend, who was with her, got caught in the flames that tore through from the basement and ended up in hospital with severe burns, she said.

At least 40 people were killed and 119 injured in the inferno, said Swiss officials in the southwestern canton of Valais, an "unprecedented" toll in a resort known for panoramic Alpine views and sporting attractions like skiing and golf.

Initial investigations suggest the blaze started when the so-called fountain candles attached to champagne bottles got too close to the ceiling , local prosecutor Beatrice Pilloud told a news conference on Friday. "From there, a rapid, very rapid and widespread conflagration ensued."

Questions have also arisen about a foam material that may have been used to soundproof the ceiling of the basement where revellers danced to rap music.

The investigation will focus on renovations that were made to the bar and the materials used, the fire extinguishing systems and escape routes, as well as the number of people in the building when the blaze started, she said.

Swiss prosecutors said on Saturday they have placed the bar's two managers under investigation on suspicion of homicide by negligence and other crimes. Reuters could not immediately reach them for comment.

The Swiss newspaper Tribune de Geneve quoted one of the owners, Jacques Moretti, as saying the bar had been inspected three times in the past 10 years, and "everything was done according to the rules."

Reuters interviewed more than a dozen witnesses, including three survivors, and reviewed multiple videos and pictures to piece together what unfolded in the early hours of New Year's Day.

Known locally as "Le Constel", the bar was a popular evening hangout for foreign students and local teenagers, who in Switzerland are allowed to buy beer and wine from the age of 16.

"It's a bar where we'd go for our first outings when we were 16 or 17," said 21-year-old Samuel Rapp, who was at a Mexican restaurant next door when the fire broke out. "We'd go there because you can play pool; we'd play darts."

The night of the fire, witnesses described lines out the door with some people turned away because they had not booked tables.

One young survivor, who gave his name only as Nathan, said the display with the sparklers seemed to be a regular attraction.
"We were there the night before, and there was a table next to us that had the same show," he told Keystone.

A promotional video for the bar also showed people carrying bottles of champagne with fizzing sparklers at the venue.

Moretti acquired the bar with his wife in 2015, Swiss company records show. It was substantially refurbished since then, according to witness accounts and local media reports at the time.

Witnesses described a single stairwell leading from the basement to the enclosed terrace, with a small door at the end, where desperate people trying to escape from both floors became trapped. It was not immediately clear whether there were other emergency exits.

Laetitia Place, 17, said she had just entered the basement area expecting to meet friends when the fire exploded and raced across the ceiling.

"I saw a friend of mine, and then we saw the fire, and we went straight back up," she told Reuters.

"The first stairs are pretty easy to get through since they're wide," she said. "But after that, there's the small door where everyone was pushing, and so we all fell. We were piled on top of each other; some people were burning, and some were dead next to us."

Clavier, who was also in the basement, said he got blocked by a mass of people. He described pushing over a table so he could shield behind it from the heat as he waited for the crowd to thin out.

"We couldn't see anything at all, as there was no light," he told reporters on Friday. "There was one door of 1.5 meters (4.9 ft) wide for some two or three hundred people to get out. The people fell, and they suffocated."

Others described seeing people trapped inside banging on the reinforced glass until it yielded. Clavier said he managed to break out after striking a window with a table and kicking it.

Emergency responders arrived at the scene in minutes, police said, but the fire spread so quickly that for many, it was too late. Improvised triage centres were set up in nearby cafes.

"We saw people burnt without any hair, without clothes because they were so burnt," said Jérémy Halna, a 22-year-old student who was visiting from France and said he helped some of those emerging from the flames into the freezing night.

A DEADLY 'FLASHOVER'
Many in the town described an agonising search for friends lost in the scramble and children who never returned from their night out.

The fire burned victims so severely that investigators said they would need days to identify the bodies.

"I don’t know if he is even recognisable," said Laetitia Brodard-Sitre, whose 16-year-old son, Arthur, sent her a New Year's text message from Le Constellation about an hour before the fire started.

"All that I want is to find my son and be close to him, whether he be alive or dead," she said.

Fire safety experts interviewed by Reuters said the evidence points to a familiar scenario: blazes ignited by indoor fireworks and other pyrotechnics have claimed hundreds of lives at bars and nightclubs.

"Nightclubs are not fire-safety friendly places," said Milad Haghani, associate professor of urban resilience and mobility at the University of Melbourne. He noted the danger of flammable soundproofing insulation, commonly found in such disasters.

When flammable surfaces ignite in confined spaces, a so-called "flashover" can occur, where nearly everything in a room explodes into flames at once.

"The fire will look for oxygen in order to grow; that's its physical mechanism," said Olivier Burnier, a partner in Swiss fire safety consultancy Fire Safety &amp; Engineering SA. "That's why we had what people described as an explosion."

Under Swiss law, any venue holding more than 100 people must have at least two 90-centimetre (35.4-inch) exits, he said. For those holding over 200, one exit must be 90 centimetres and the other at least 120 centimetres.

Pilloud, the prosecutor, said investigators would be looking into the safety measures at the bar, including exits and fire extinguishers.

One person familiar with the establishment, who asked not to be identified, said a water sprinkler system was installed by the previous owner. Reuters could not determine whether such a system was operating the night of the fire. At least one witness said she saw no sign of one as she fled the building.</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 17:18:16 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/XLJ2GBF2JBIKPB4GLGL237WAKA.jpg?auth=f108747aa3467c796ac955038bbbd6f824ff4b74a561bd270bfba2e7c2bc88e5&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Inside the US operation to capture Maduro</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/mock-house-cia-source-special-forces-us-operation-capture-maduro-2026-01-03/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 3 (Reuters) - At 4:21 on Saturday morning, U.S. President Donald Trump sent a message on his Truth Social platform: the United States had carried out a daring mission to capture Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife.

The action came as a surprise, but according to sources familiar with the matter, planning for one of the most complex U.S. operations in recent memory had been in the works for some time and included detailed rehearsals.

Elite U.S. troops, including the Army's Delta Force, created an exact replica of Maduro's safe house and practiced how they would enter the strongly fortified residence.

The CIA had a small team on the ground starting in August who were able to provide insight into Maduro's pattern of life that made grabbing him seamless, according to one source familiar with the matter.

Two other sources told Reuters the intelligence agency also had an asset close to Maduro who would monitor his movements and was poised to pinpoint his exact location as the operation unfolded.

With the pieces in place, Trump approved the operation four days ago, but military and intelligence planners suggested he wait for better weather and less cloud cover.

In the early hours of Saturday, the mission to capture Maduro started. Trump, surrounded by his advisers at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, watched a live stream of the operation.

How the hours-long operation unfolded is based on interviews with four sources familiar with the matter and details Trump himself has revealed.

"I've done some pretty good ones, but I've never seen anything like this," Trump said on Fox News just hours after the mission was completed.

The Pentagon has overseen a massive military build up of forces in the Caribbean, sending an aircraft carrier, 11 warships and more than a dozen F-35 aircraft. In total, more than 15,000 troops have poured into the region for what U.S. officials have long described as anti-drug operations.

According to one of the sources, Trump senior aide Stephen Miller, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and CIA Director John Ratcliffe formed a core team working on the issue for months with regular - sometimes daily - meetings and phone calls. They often also met with the president.

Late on Friday night and into early Saturday, Trump and his advisers huddled as a number of U.S. aircraft took off and carried out strikes against targets inside and close to Caracas, including air defense systems, according to a U.S. military official.

Trump told Fox News Channel's "Fox &amp; Friends" the number of U.S. aircraft involved was "massive".

"We had a fighter jet for every possible situation," Trump said.

Sources have told Reuters that in addition to fighter jets, the Pentagon had also quietly moved into the region refueling air tankers, drones and aircraft specializing in electronic jamming.

U.S. officials told Reuters that the airstrikes hit military targets. Images taken by Reuters at the La Carlota air base in Caracas showed charred military vehicles from a Venezuelan anti-aircraft unit.

With the strikes taking place, U.S. Special Forces made their way into Caracas heavily armed, including with a blow torch in case they had to cut through steel doors at Maduro's location. Officials did not say how the troops entered the city, but video posted on social media by residents showed a convoy of helicopters flying over Caracas at a low altitude.

Once they reached Maduro's safe house the troops, along with FBI agents, made their way into the residence, which Trump described as a "very highly guarded... fortress."

"They just broke in, and they broke into places that were not really able to be broke into, you know, steel doors that were put there for just this reason," Trump said. "They got taken out in a matter of seconds."

It is unclear how U.S. forces were able to capture Maduro and his wife once they entered the house, but Trump said the Venezuelan leader had unsuccessfully tried to get to a safe room.

"He was trying to get into it, but he got bum rushed so fast that he didn't get into that," Trump said.

Some U.S. forces were hit, Trump said, but none were killed.

As the operation unfolded, Rubio started to inform lawmakers that it was underway. The notifications only began after the operation started and not before, as is customary for key lawmakers who play an oversight role, officials told Reuters.

Little is yet known about Maduro's extraction from Caracas. Trump said that one helicopter was hit "pretty hard" but was able to make it back.

The Venezuelan leader was flown to the USS Iwo Jima, an amphibious assault ship, and will be transferred to New York to stand trial.</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 17:18:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/6A5FEBSE3VPS5OZ2EMWEW7RRBI.jpg?auth=b7026e0bd3b4472ed500b013e6a02158ec412463da39e7f55f0530ee5fc6a0bb&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Germany urges political solution for Venezuela crisis</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/germany-urges-political-solution-venezuela-crisis-2026-01-03/</link><description>FRANKFURT, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Germany's foreign ministry on Saturday called for a political solution in Venezuela where the United States attacked and captured leader Nicolas Maduro .

"We call on all involved parties to avoid an escalation of the situation and to seek ways for a political settlement," said a written communication obtained by Reuters after a crisis team had met at the ministry.

"International law has to be respected ... Venezuelans deserve a peaceful and democratic future," it added.

The ministry said it was in close contact with the embassy in Caracas and a travel warning had been issued.

Its note echoed statements by both the European Union's top diplomat Kaja Kallas, who also has repeatedly said that Maduro "lacks legitimacy," and from EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who demanded the observance of international law.

German politicians and commentators on Saturday took mixed stances, with some applauding Maduro's removal and others condemning what they called the abandonment of the rules-based order of the post-1945 Western world.</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 17:18:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/2P62CJLHTRIHXCC3MEH6BUVZCA.jpg?auth=a3e8387ff99d0ecf233c4b4d8c6026e429e6d48f26a26efc884d2b805c5575a4&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Who is Delcy Rodriguez, the vice president who could replace Venezuela's Maduro?</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/who-is-delcy-rodriguez-vice-president-who-could-replace-venezuelas-maduro-2026-01-03/</link><description>Buenos Aires, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Following are some facts about Venezuelan vice president Delcy Rodriguez, who could take charge of the government after U.S. President Donald Trump said on Saturday that President Nicolas Maduro had been captured by U.S. forces.

Security Council meeting.

Venezuela and Colombia, backed by Russia and China, have asked for the 15-member Security Council to meet, diplomats said, after the U.S. attacked Venezuela and deposed its long-serving autocratic President Nicolas Maduro. The meeting has not yet been scheduled.

"These developments constitute a dangerous precedent," Guterres' spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said in a statement. "The Secretary-General continues to emphasize the importance of full respect - by all - of international law, including the UN Charter. He’s deeply concerned that the rules of international law have not been respected."

The U.N. Security Council has met twice - in October and December - over the escalating tensions between the United States and Venezuela.

"The deadly and treacherous U.S. military attack is being carried out against a country that is at peace," Venezuela's U.N. Ambassador Samuel Moncada wrote to the Security Council on Saturday, warning that it "has serious implications for regional and international peace and security."

He said the U.S. had violated the founding U.N. Charter, which states: "
 All members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state."

U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has for months targeted suspected drug trafficking boats off the Venezuelan coast and the Pacific coast of Latin America. The U.S. ramped up its military presence in the region and announced a blockade of all vessels subject to U.S. sanctions, last month intercepting two tankers loaded with Venezuelan crude.

In October, the U.S. justified its action as consistent with Article 51 of the founding U.N. Charter, which requires the Security Council to be immediately informed of any action states take in self-defense against armed attack.

"This is not regime change this is justice," U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Mike Waltz posted on X on Saturday. "Maduro was an indicted, illegitimate dictator that led a declared Narco-terrorism organization responsible for killing American citizens."</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 17:18:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CORQYBRJS5KXPMHLQ3NPWUMEKQ.jpg?auth=e671a3fd8fdd275a183fa4eba36474ad031a796008a7e9dd042d308952b6dbb0&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump signals US may expand focus to Cuba amid Venezuela operation</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/trump-signals-us-may-expand-focus-cuba-amid-venezuela-operation-2026-01-03/</link><description>PALM BEACH, Florida, Jan 3 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday indicated that Cuba could become a topic of discussion as part of broader U.S. policy in the region, highlighting the potential for Washington to expand its focus beyond Venezuela amid rising tensions in Latin America.</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 17:41:07 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/YOU7WQN75RKD5KUWIWHPVRTGTE.jpg?auth=73963609b22e771730813f0691cf52e276341ac3262d68108e50d1101d9a1837&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump says US oil companies will spend billions in Venezuela</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/trump-says-us-oil-companies-will-spend-billions-venezuela-2026-01-03/</link><description>PALM BEACH, Florida, Jan 3 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said that American oil companies were prepared to enter Venezuela and invest to restore production in the South American country, an announcement that came just hours after Nicolás Maduro was captured and removed by U.S. forces.

"We’re going to have our very large U.S. oil companies, the biggest anywhere in the world, go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure, oil infrastructure, and start making money for the country," Trump said on Saturday.

While Chevron is the only American major with current operations in Venezuela, Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) , opens new tab and ConocoPhillips (COP.N) , opens new tab , among others, have storied histories in the country. The American Petroleum Institute, the largest U.S. oil trade group, said on Saturday it was monitoring the emerging situation.

“We’re closely watching developments involving Venezuela, including the potential implications for global energy markets,” an API spokesperson told Reuters.

Chevron, which exports around 150,000 bpd of crude from Venezuela to the U.S. Gulf Coast, said it is focused on the safety and wellbeing of its employees, in addition to the integrity of its assets.

"We continue to operate in full compliance with all relevant laws and regulations,” a Chevron spokesperson said in an emailed response to questions.

Top oilfield service companies SLB (SLB.N) , opens new tab , Baker Hughes (BKR.O) , opens new tab , Halliburton (HAL.N) , opens new tab and Weatherford (WFRD.O) , opens new tab did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Exxon and Conoco did not immediately respond to questions from Reuters.

Trump's plans to have large U.S. oil companies enter Venezuela and get "oil flowing" will be hindered by lack of infrastructure that will require many years and heavy investment, analysts said. "There are still many questions that need to be answered about the state of the Venezuelan oil industry, but it is clear that it will take tens of billions of dollars to turn that industry around," said Peter McNally, Global Head of Sector Analysts at Third Bridge, adding that it could take at least a decade of Western oil majors committing to the country.

A U.S. embargo on all Venezuelan oil, meanwhile, remains in full effect, Trump said. He told reporters that the U.S. military forces would remain in position until U.S. demands had been fully met.

"The American armada remains poised in position, and the U.S. retains all military options until United States demands have been fully met and fully satisfied," he said.</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 18:52:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/UP4TPIQUTRL4RF4JXJLD34NSLY.jpg?auth=f84af9634821dff498b848377234199b8a1d4376712d6204db5e58bdd2dc17f9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Democratic lawmakers say they were misled on Venezuela</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/democratic-lawmakers-say-they-were-misled-venezuela-2026-01-03/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Democratic members of the U.S. Congress said on Saturday that senior officials of President Donald Trump's administration had misled them during recent briefings about plans for Venezuela by insisting they were not planning regime change in Caracas.

The comments came after the U.S. attacked Venezuela and deposed its long-serving President Nicolas Maduro in an overnight operation, in Washington's most direct intervention in Latin America since the 1989 invasion of Panama.

In briefings in November and December by officials including Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, lawmakers said they were told repeatedly that there were no plans for a land invasion inside Venezuela and that the administration was not focused on regime change.

"Because the President and his Cabinet repeatedly denied any intention of conducting regime change in Venezuela when briefing Congress, we are left with no understanding of how the Administration is preparing to mitigate risks to the U.S. and we have no information regarding a long-term strategy following today’s extraordinary escalation," Senator Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in a statement on Saturday.

"Instead, the Administration consistently misled the American people and their elected representatives by offering three differing and contradictory explanations for its actions," Shaheen said.

The Pentagon, State Department and White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Several lawmakers said they felt they had been lied to.

"The Administration lied to Congress and launched an illegal war for regime change and oil," Democratic Representative Don Beyer of Virginia said on X. Beyer's district includes the Pentagon, just across the river from Washington.

At a news conference on Saturday, Trump said Congress had not been kept fully informed on the Venezuela plans because of concerns that word about his plans would get out. "Congress does have a tendency to leak," Trump told reporters.

Members of Congress, including some of Trump's fellow Republicans as well as Democrats, had been clamoring for more information about his strategy toward the oil-rich South American nation since he began a military build-up in the southern Caribbean and ordered strikes on boats he said were carrying drugs.

Democrats had emerged from those meetings dissatisfied. "I asked them what their strategy is, and what they were doing, and again, did not get satisfying answers at all," Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York told reporters at the time.

Democratic Representative Seth Moulton of Massachusetts said on CNN: "When we had briefings on Venezuela, we asked, 'Are you going to invade the country?' We were told no. 'Do you plan to put troops on the ground?' We were told no. 'Do you intend regime change in Venezuela?' We were told no. So in a sense, we have been briefed, we've just been completely lied to."

Lawmakers said they were not briefed before the operation, although Rubio had been calling members of Congress on Saturday morning after it took place. There were no briefings for lawmakers scheduled by Saturday afternoon, although Republican congressional leaders said they hoped to arrange some after lawmakers return to Washington on January 5 following their year-end recess.

Most Republicans praised Trump's action.

Senate Republican Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota said: "President Trump’s decisive action to disrupt the unacceptable status quo and apprehend Maduro, through the execution of a valid Department of Justice warrant, is an important first step to bring him to justice for the drug crimes for which he has been indicted in the United States."

Members of Congress have long accused presidents from both parties of seeking to sidestep the Constitution's requirement that Congress, not the president, approve anything other than brief and limited foreign military action.

On Venezuela, Democratic lawmakers and some Republicans had said even before Saturday's overnight action that they were worried that Trump was conducting a four-month-long military campaign without congressional authorization.</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 19:16:10 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/QG23ESPCYRJVRFBIVIFUWRG6DI.jpg?auth=5dded4c2a2ff1980b4e28d8755b259916dae0752d57009bcfe71a4c6db2d1293&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Spain will not recognize US intervention in Venezuela, PM says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/spain-will-not-recognize-us-intervention-venezuela-pm-says-2026-01-03/</link><description>Jan 3 - Spain will not recognize a U.S. intervention in Venezuela that violates international law, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said on Saturday, after U.S. forces captured long-serving Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro in an overnight operation.

"I'm not thrilled with Putin. He's killing too many people," Trump told reporters at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, during a press conference to discuss the overnight U.S. military operation in Venezuela and capture of its President Nicolas Maduro .

Trump said he did not discuss Maduro with Putin when the two leaders spoke by telephone for over two hours on Monday, shortly before the U.S. president met with Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Palm Beach.

"We never spoke about Maduro," Trump said when asked if he and Putin had discussed the Venezuelan leader.

Russia's foreign ministry said on Saturday it was extremely concerned by reports that Maduro and his wife had been removed from the country during "aggressive actions" by the United States, and called for the pair's immediate release.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters that Maduro had rejected multiple chances to flee the country, and some reports suggested weeks ago that he could have headed to Russia or closely allied states.

Trump on Monday initially expressed sympathy for Russian allegations that Ukrainian drones attacked one of Putin's residences. He later appeared more skeptical and shared a New York Post editorial accusing Russia of blocking peace in Ukraine.

The Wall Street Journal later reported that U.S. national security officials had found Ukraine did not target Putin or one of his residences in a drone strike.

Trump has repeatedly expressed frustration about the lack of progress toward ending the war in Ukraine, which began with Russia's invasion in February 2022, focusing heavily on what he calls tens of thousands of troops being killed on both sides.</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 20:23:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/U4TWW4Z6HVOOVFUZ3CW62SPW7U.jpg?auth=85eac5450e31c9556f28ae53548df0918274ffb44f8e6355d9f009f5535908d1&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Cuban president denounces 'state terrorism' against Venezuela</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/cuban-president-denounces-state-terrorism-against-venezuela-2026-01-03/</link><description>HAVANA, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel on Saturday condemned the United States for attacking Venezuela and capturing its president at a rally of thousands of Havana residents in front of the U.S. Embassy in the Cuban capital.

"Cuba condemns and denounces these actions as an act of state terrorism," Diaz-Canel said.

"It is a shocking violation of the norms of international law - the military aggression against a peaceful nation that poses no threat to the United States," he added.

Venezuela supplies around 30% of Cuba's already scarce oil imports in exchange for thousands of medical personnel who work in the South American country.

Analysts agree the loss of the oil would be a devastating blow to Cuba's already shaky power grid and energy supplies.

Meanwhile, thousands of Cubans are worried over the fate of relatives and friends working in Venezuela. Cuba's health ministry tweeted on Saturday they were "well protected."

In an interview U.S. President Donald Trump gave to the New York Post on Saturday, he said he is not considering additional military action against Cuba.

“No, Cuba is going to fall of its own volition. Cuba is doing very poorly,” Trump said.

“Cuba was always very reliant on Venezuela. That’s where they got their money, and they protected Venezuela, but that didn’t work out too well in this case,” the president said.

Cuba is suffering through a six-year crisis which has seen economic growth fall at least 15%, according to the government, causing shortages of basic goods, soaring inflation, crumbling services and widespread power outages.

The government largely blames tougher U.S. sanctions imposed during the first Trump administration, on top of the decades-old trade embargo, for the crisis.</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 21:18:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WN75XUZOS5L6JJ2ODP53R7RLSU.jpg?auth=cc20fd80cbbf736e904dd4c35f119ba45039dd217d9bf641aba79d13eaf5816b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US airlines cancel flights after Caribbean airspace closure</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/us-airlines-cancel-flights-after-caribbean-airspace-closure-2026-01-03/</link><description>Jan 3 (Reuters) - Major U.S. airlines on Saturday canceled hundreds of flights following a military operation in Venezuela that resulted in the capture of President Nicolas Maduro.

Trump bets on regime change in Venezuela.</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/we-are-going-run-this-country-trump-bets-regime-change-venezuela-2026-01-03/</link><description>PALM BEACH, Florida/WASHINGTON, Jan 3 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s decision to attack Venezuela, arrest its president and temporarily run the country marks a striking departure for a politician who long criticized others for overreaching on foreign affairs and vowed to avoid foreign entanglements.

His vision for U.S. involvement in Venezuela, sketched out in a midday news conference, left open the possibility of more military action, ongoing involvement in that nation’s politics and oil industry and “boots on the ground.” The term suggests military deployment of the sort that presidents often avoid for fear of provoking domestic political backlash.

"We are going to run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper, and judicious transition,” Trump said.

He gave little sense of how far he was willing to go to gain control of Venezuela, where Maduro's top aides appeared to be still in power.

As recently as his inauguration for a second term last January, Trump told supporters: "We will measure our success not only by the battles we win, but also by the wars that we end, and perhaps most importantly, by the wars we never get into."

Since then, Trump has bombed targets in Syria, Iraq, Iran, Nigeria, Yemen and Somalia, blown up dozens of alleged drug boats in the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean and made veiled threats to invade Greenland and Panama.

The overnight attack on Venezuela was his most aggressive foreign military action yet, striking the capital Caracas and other parts of the country and capturing President Nicolas Maduro and his wife to face drug-trafficking charges in New York.

These developments ran counter to some Republican hopes that the president would focus more on voters' domestic concerns – affordability, health care and the economy.

Trump told the news conference that intervening in Venezuela was in line with his “America First” policy.

“We want to surround ourselves with good neighbors. We want to surround ourself with stability. We want to surround ourself with energy,” he said, referring to Venezuela’s oil reserves.

But the emerging political stakes were captured by a social media post from U.S. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia Republican, who has broken with Trump because of what she said has been his departure from the America First rhetoric of limiting foreign adventures. She is resigning from Congress next week.

“This is what many in MAGA thought they voted to end. Boy were we wrong.”

RISK OF QUAGMIRE

Trump’s ongoing attention to foreign affairs provides fuel for Democrats to criticize Trump ahead of midterm congressional elections in November, when control of both houses of Congress is likely to turn on just a few races across the United States. Republicans narrowly control both right now, giving the president a largely free hand to enact his agenda.

"Let me be clear, Maduro is an illegitimate dictator, but launching military action without congressional authorization, without a federal plan for what comes next, is reckless," Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a call with reporters.

Trump has worked to end several foreign conflicts, including in Ukraine and Gaza, while lobbying for a Nobel Peace Prize. But U.S. military actions tend to draw more public attention and historically have carried more political risk for presidents and their parties.

Polls have shown that, before the attack, the prospect of U.S. military action in Venezuela was unpopular, with roughly one out of five Americans supporting force to depose Maduro, according to a November Reuters/Ipsos survey.

Trump’s top diplomat and national security adviser Marco Rubio called several members of Congress early on Saturday in an effort to blunt opposition to military action.

Mike Lee, a prominent libertarian-leaning senator, initially questioned the administration taking military action without a declaration of war or authorization for the use of military force, but wrote on X he concluded that the operation likely fell within the president's authority after speaking to Rubio.

Republican Representative Thomas Massie, a frequent Trump critic, wrote in a post on X that Trump’s warning of further strikes on Venezuela “Doesn’t seem the least bit consistent” with Rubio’s characterization to Lee. “If this action were constitutionally sound, the Attorney General wouldn’t be tweeting that they’ve arrested the President of a sovereign country and his wife for possessing guns in violation of a 1934 U.S. firearm law,” Massie wrote in a separate post.

For a president who has consistently contrasted himself with the Republican "neoconservatives" of the late 20th century, Trump’s foreign policy has developed striking similarities with that of his predecessors.

In 1983, under former President Ronald Reagan, the U.S. invaded Grenada, claiming that the government at that time was illegitimate, a claim Trump has also made with respect to Maduro.

In 1989, former President George H.W. Bush invaded Panama to depose dictator Manuel Noriega who, like Maduro, was wanted on U.S. drug-trafficking charges. In that case, the U.S. installed Noriega’s replacement.

Elliott Abrams, who served as Venezuela envoy in Trump's first term, said he did not believe the president was running a political risk at home in ousting Maduro and that he “has a lot of latitude as long as American troops are not dying." But he acknowledged: “I don’t know what running Venezuela means.”

"He's done the right thing in removing Maduro," said Abrams, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations think-tank. "The question is whether he will do the right thing in supporting democracy in Venezuela."

Brett Bruen, a former foreign policy adviser in Barack Obama's administration, said the U.S. could now be sucked into overseeing a complex transition process.

“I don’t see any short version of this story,” said Bruen, now head of the Global Situation Room, an international affairs consultancy. “The U.S. will get tangled up in Venezuela but will also have new problems to contend with related to its neighbors.”</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 21:21:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LDBC2HULRVOQJE6HQTJID4AF2A.jpg?auth=f920564494942db91491882699a8f52b233e7acae66e93d654736391b936e0a0&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuela's oil exports paralyzed amid political turmoil, sources say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/venezuelas-oil-exports-paralyzed-amid-political-turmoil-sources-say-2026-01-03/</link><description>Jan 3 (Reuters) - Venezuela's oil exports, which had fallen to a minimum amid U.S. President Donald Trump's announced blockade of all sanctioned tankers going in and out of the country's waters, are now paralyzed as port captains have not received requests to authorize loaded ships to set sail, four sources close to operations said on Saturday.

The paralysis emerges as the U.S. extracted President Nicolas Maduro and his wife from capital Caracas and announced it will oversee a political transition in the South American country.

President Trump said on Saturday that an "oil embargo" on the country was in full effect.

Several vessels that have recently loaded crude and fuel bound for destinations including the U.S. and Asia have not set sail, while others that had waited to load have left empty, according to monitoring data. No tankers were loading on Saturday at the country's main oil port of Jose, TankerTrackers.com said.

A total suspension of oil exports, including tankers chartered by state-run PDVSA's main partner Chevron (CVX.N) , opens new tab , could accelerate the country's need to cut back output at oilfields, since storage tanks and even ships used for floating storage have filled rapidly in recent weeks, according to sources and PDVSA's documents.

PDVSA and Chevron did not immediately reply to requests for comment.</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 21:40:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WLDZOA7YS5PILOSEHS5TNRUFSI.jpg?auth=dc8160ea4511e3c518dedfec0e8816acba644349a6b590fa0660196d34ac5b99&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Explainer: Was the US capture of Venezuela's president legal?</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/was-us-capture-venezuelas-president-legal-2026-01-03/</link><description>WASHINGTON Jan 3 (Reuters) - The U.S. captured Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro in a military operation early on Saturday morning, culminating a months-long pressure campaign by President Donald Trump's administration that drew condemnation from some international leaders.

Maduro was on a warship bound for New York to face criminal charges, according to U.S. officials.

Below is a look at the legality of the U.S. action.

On Saturday, U.S. forces attacked Venezuela and seized Maduro, who has been widely condemned as an illegitimate leader, and his wife Cilia Flores.

Trump had been urging Maduro to cede power and has accused him of supporting drug cartels that Washington designated as terror groups, alleging they were responsible for thousands of U.S. deaths tied to illegal drug use.

Since September, U.S. forces had killed more than 100 people in at least 30 strikes on alleged drug trafficking boats from Venezuela in the Caribbean and Pacific, which legal experts said likely violated U.S. and international law.

U.S. authorities said the Justice Department sought military assistance to apprehend Maduro, who had been indicted by a New York grand jury along with his wife, son, two political leaders and an alleged leader of an international gang. They were charged with crimes related to terrorism, drugs and weapons.

Attorney General Pam Bondi said on social media that the defendants "will soon face the full wrath of American justice on American soil in American courts."

However, at a press conference, Trump blamed Venezuela for stealing U.S. oil interests and said Washington would take them back and planned to run Venezuela for a period of time, without offering specifics.

Experts in international law said the Trump administration had muddled the legal issues by claiming the operation was both a targeted law enforcement mission and the potential prelude to long-term control of Venezuela by the U.S.

"You cannot say this was a law enforcement operation and then turn around and say now we need to run the country," said Jeremy Paul, a professor at Northeastern University specializing in constitutional law. "It just doesn't make any sense."

The U.S. Congress has the power to declare war but the president is the commander-in-chief, and presidents of both parties have justified carrying out military action when it was limited in scope and in the national interest.

Trump's Chief of Staff Susie Wiles told Vanity Fair magazine in an interview published late last year that if Trump were to authorize "some activity on land" in Venezuela he would need approval from Congress.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Congress was not notified before Saturday's operation.

International law prohibits the use of force in international relations except for narrow exceptions such as authorization by the U.N. Security Council or in self-defense.

Drug trafficking and gang violence are considered criminal activity and do not rise to the accepted international standard of an armed conflict that would justify a military response, according to legal experts.

"A criminal indictment alone doesn't provide authority to use military force to depose a foreign government, and the administration will probably hang this also on a theory of self-defense," said Matthew Waxman, a law professor at Columbia University specializing in national security law.

The U.S. has not recognized Maduro as the legitimate leader of Venezuela since 2019, following an election the U.S. said was rigged.

The U.S. has captured criminal suspects in foreign countries including Libya but it has sought consent of local authorities. While the administration describes Maduro as an illegitimate leader, Washington has not recognized another Venezuelan leader who could have authorized the capture of Maduro.

In 1989, the U.S. arrested General Manuel Noriega, then the leader of Panama, in similar circumstances. Noriega had been indicted on drug-related charges and Washington said it was acting to protect U.S. citizens after Panamanian forces had killed a U.S. soldier.

The United States had also alleged Noriega was an illegitimate leader and had recognized as the country's leader the candidate who Noriega had claimed to have defeated in a recent election.

The former president of Honduras, Juan Orlando Hernández, was extradited to the United States in 2022 and later convicted on drug-related charges and sentenced to 45 years in prison. Trump pardoned Hernandez in December.

Legal experts were skeptical that the United States would face any meaningful accountability for its actions in Venezuela, even if they were unlawful given the lack of enforcement mechanisms in international law.

"It's hard to see how any legal body could impose practical consequences on the administration," said Paul, of Northeastern.</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 21:42:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HGORUN4VPFPYNI2TKXCUDC2N6E.jpg?auth=2d3998dd1dbecfe11f4f123d418eaa1b9842191752bdd7377ac4fa74e97d53af&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UK says it and France bomb Islamic State facility in Syria</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/uk-says-it-france-bomb-islamic-state-facility-syria-2026-01-03/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Britain and France's air forces conducted a joint operation late on Saturday to bomb a suspected underground arms dump previously used by Islamic State in Syria, Britain's defence ministry said on Saturday.

The dramatic mission punctuated a winter sojourn to his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, filled with an unusual mix of activities that have become oddly typical for the unconventional president.

Trump spent Thursday night, for instance, blasting out messages on Truth Social about an eclectic array of topics, none of them related to the South American country.

He wrote that the U.S. was "locked and loaded" and poised to help protesters in Iran if they were attacked by the government in Tehran. The 79-year-old president also presented his 11.2 million Truth Social followers with an image of a bald eagle that had been apparently slain by a windmill, while assuring them in a separate post that he is in "PERFECT HEALTH."

On Friday, less than 24 hours before the Venezuela mission, Trump spent almost an hour perusing marble and onyx at an Italian stone importer in a gritty section of Lake Worth Beach for his planned White House ballroom. Onlookers were left agape as "The Beast" presidential limousine snaked its way down narrow roads flanked by strip malls and trailer parks for the shopping excursion.

Since arriving at Mar-a-Lago in mid-December for a trip that wraps up on Sunday, Trump's days have been a blend of heady geopolitical affairs with visits from foreign leaders and glitzy social occasions, like a black-tie gala on New Year's Eve replete with Palm Beach socialites. No stretch has underlined that juxtaposition more than the last few days.

Supporters see a vigorous executive, capable of juggling several tasks and interests simultaneously. Opponents say he is easily distracted and sometimes focused on trivial matters, even when his administration is engaged in immensely consequential matters, like preparing to attack a sovereign nation.

On New Year's Eve, with hundreds of military assets already in place and awaiting the order to capture Maduro, Trump took to Truth Social with mock celebration of the news that George and Amal Clooney - both critics of the U.S. president - had obtained French citizenship.

During the gala at Mar-a-Lago hours later, Trump invited painter Vanessa Horabuena up to the stage to paint an image of Jesus Christ. He then auctioned off the painting for $2.75 million to a woman in a top hat and a svelte man in modified black-tie attire. The proceeds, the president said, would go to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office.

In the lead-up to the Venezuela mission, Trump also had his most high-profile architectural passion project - the $400 million new White House ballroom - on his mind. The endeavor has faced sharp criticism from Democrats and conservationists, in part because it involved the demolition of a significant chunk of the executive mansion.

A White House official told reporters on Friday that Trump was purchasing marble and onyx for the ballroom at his own expense, without providing further details.

"I'm doing a magnificent, big, beautiful ballroom that the country's wanted, the White House has wanted for 150 years," Trump said last week alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who had traveled to Florida to meet with the U.S. president.

That Trump would venture out days later to view marble options - even as one of the most significant U.S. military operations ever in Latin America was imminent - was not a total surprise for a president who has long had something of an obsession with the white stone.

During his first term in office, Trump appointees on an architectural board demanded that a renovation of the Federal Reserve in Washington include more marble . That demand, revealed by the media last year, has garnered renewed relevance as Trump frequently criticizes Fed Chairman Jerome Powell for the cost of that renovation.

Following Trump's Friday stop at the marble importer, he headed to his golf course, as he did on a near-daily basis while in Florida. In the evening, he met with his ambassador to China, former Senator David Perdue.

Within hours, the plan to capture Maduro was a go.</description><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 01:55:32 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/VKPKNGXKH5LU3DKUFIKFCLEAC4.jpg?auth=d7a4f502eda87e8d90d4fd0c5e6a32fb7b5eaae5012456ce52e0cf6c62bd82d6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>No quick wins in tapping Venezuela's oil reserves</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/no-quick-wins-tapping-venezuelas-oil-reserves-2026-01-04/</link><description>MIAMI, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Venezuela is unlikely to see any meaningful boost to crude output for years even if U.S. oil majors do invest the billions of dollars in the country that President Donald Trump promised just hours following Nicolás Maduro's capture by U.S. forces.

The South American country may have the world's largest estimated oil reserves, but output has plummeted over the past decades amid mismanagement and a lack of investment from foreign firms after Venezuela nationalized oil operations in the 2000s that included the assets of Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) , opens new tab and ConocoPhillips (COP.N) , opens new tab .

Any companies that might want to invest there would need to deal with security concerns, dilapidated infrastructure, questions about the legality of the U.S. operation to snatch Maduro and the potential for long-term political instability, analysts told Reuters.

American firms won't return until they know for sure they will be paid and will have at least a minimal amount of security, said Mark Christian, director of business development at CHRIS Well Consulting. He also said the companies would not go back until sanctions against the country are removed.

Venezuela would also have to reform its laws to allow for larger investment by foreign oil companies.

Venezuela nationalized the industry in the 1970s, and in the 2000s ordered a forced migration to joint ventures controlled by its state oil company, PDVSA [RIC:RIC:PDVSA.UL]. Most companies negotiated exits and migrated, including Chevron, while a handful of others did not reach deals and filed for arbitration.

"I f Trump et al can produce a peaceful transition with little resistance, then in five to seven years there is a significant oil-production ramp up as infrastructure is repaired and investments get sorted out," Thomas O'Donnell, an energy and geopolitical strategist, told Reuters, adding that heavy crude produced in the country works well with U.S. Gulf Coast refineries and can also be blended with lighter oil produced from fracking.

But that would depend on everything going right, and there's a lot that could go wrong.

"A botched political transition that has a feeling of U.S. dominance can lead to years of resistance," O'Donnell said, noting armed groups of citizens and guerrilla groups that operate in the country.

Chevron would be positioned to benefit the most from any potential oil opening in Venezuela, said Francisco Monaldi, director of the Latin America Energy Program at Rice University's Baker Institute in Houston. Other U.S. oil companies would be paying close attention to political stability and would wait to see how the operational environment and contract framework unfolded, he added.

Venezuela - a founding member of OPEC with Iran, Iraq, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia - produced as much as 3.5 million barrels per day in the 1970s, which at the time represented over 7% of global oil output. Production fell below 2 million bpd during the 2010s and averaged around 1.1 million bpd last year, or just 1% of global production.

Chevron is the only American major currently operating in Venezuela. Conoco has been seeking billions for the takeover of three oil projects nearly two decades ago, while Exxon was also involved in lengthy arbitration cases against Venezuela after it exited the country nearly two decades ago.

"The company that probably will be very interested in going back is Conoco, because they are owed more than $10 billion, and it's unlikely that they will get paid without going back into the country," Monaldi said. Exxon could also return, but is not owed as much money, he added.

"ConocoPhillips is monitoring developments in Venezuela and their potential implications for global energy supply and stability. It would be premature to speculate on any future business activities or investments," a company spokesperson said in emailed comments to Reuters.

Chevron, which exports around 150,000 bpd of crude from Venezuela to the U.S. Gulf Coast, has had to carefully maneuver with the Trump administration in an effort to maintain its presence in the country over the past year. CEO Mike Wirth said in December that he had spoken with the Trump administration about what he said was the importance of maintaining an American presence in the country through multiple political cycles.

The oil firm has been in Venezuela for over 100 years and said on Saturday that it is focused on the safety and well-being of its employees, in addition to the integrity of its assets. "We continue to operate in full compliance with all relevant laws and regulations,” a Chevron spokesperson said in an emailed response to questions.

Exxon did not immediately respond to questions from Reuters.

OPEC and allies will meet on Sunday and are expected to maintain current oil output policy. The group has been increasing production since last year, stoking concerns of a global supply glut, but has agreed to pause oil output hikes for January, February and March.

Ed Hirs, an energy fellow at University of Houston, said recent events in Venezuela would have little impact on U.S. prices for oil and gasoline for now, with much of the country's production going to Cuba and China at the moment. He also said that history is full of recent examples of American excursions that didn't produce notable results for U.S. companies.

"Trump now joins the history of U.S. presidents who have overthrown regimes of oil-rich countries. Bush with Iraq. Obama with Libya. In those cases, the United States has received zero benefit from the oil. I’m afraid that history will repeat itself in Venezuela," Hirs said.

Oil tankers chartered by Chevron had been among the few to set sail from Venezuela over the past month, following Trump's December announcement of a " blockade

That's perhaps where one quick win could emerge, if Trump is able to restart the flow of Venezuelan crude into the U.S. Gulf, potentially boosting refiners like Valero in the process. At the moment, it appears that just the opposite is happening.</description><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 01:55:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/NR2Y3TBKNVNBHOE5YRZNWTLDUU.jpg?auth=8e006ffc53c4dfdc9e4acd8fbc4d8c1be03a57f6ac86bb3cd3639672b50a18cd&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuela's Supreme Court orders Delcy Rodriguez become interim president</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/venezuelas-supreme-court-orders-delcy-rodriguez-become-interim-president-2026-01-04/</link><description>CARACAS, Jan 3 (Reuters) - The Constitutional Chamber of Venezuela's Supreme Court ordered on Saturday that Vice President Delcy Rodríguez assume the role of acting president of the country in the absence of Nicolás Maduro, who was detained early Saturday morning in an operation by U.S. forces.

The court ruling said that Rodríguez would assume "the office of President of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, in order to guarantee administrative continuity and the comprehensive defense of the Nation."

The ruling added that the court will debate the matter in order to "determine the applicable legal framework to guarantee the continuity of the State, the administration of government, and the defense of sovereignty in the face of the forced absence of the President of the Republic."</description><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 03:52:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BBUYWN5GZJLOHCVO5HMVH74BJM.jpg?auth=b2abd175d5270e7b7c1d38e22c6b1886e7284150fcd7af5700e31c8c6a405754&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Maduro is out but it's unclear who is running Venezuela</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/maduro-is-out-its-unclear-who-is-running-venezuela-2026-01-04/</link><description>Jan 3 (Reuters) - The U.S. capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro - praised by President Donald Trump as stunning and powerful - leaves behind uncertainty about who is running the oil-rich country.

Trump said on Saturday that Vice President Delcy Rodriguez, part of the powerful cabal at the top of the country's government, had been sworn in after Maduro's arrest and that she had spoken with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, leading to speculation that she would take the reins.

Under Venezuela's constitution, Rodriguez becomes acting president in Maduro's absence and the country's top court ordered her to assume the role late Saturday night.

But shortly after Trump's remarks, Rodriguez appeared on state television flanked by her brother, the head of the national assembly Jorge Rodriguez, Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello and Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino Lopez and said that Maduro remained Venezuela's only president.

The joint appearance indicated the group that shared power with Maduro is staying united - for now.

Trump publicly closed the door Saturday on working with opposition leader and Nobel Prize winner Maria Corina Machado, widely seen as Maduro's most credible opponent, saying she doesn't have support inside the country.

After Machado was barred from running in Venezuela's 2024 elections, international observers say her stand-in candidate won the vote in a landslide, despite Maduro's government claiming victory.

For more than a decade, real power in Venezuela has been held by a small circle of senior officials. Analysts and officials say though that the system depends on a sprawling web of loyalists and security organs, fueled by corruption and surveillance.

Within the inner circle, a civilian-military balance reigns. Each member has their own interests and patronage networks. Currently Rodriguez and her brother represent the civilian side. Padrino and Cabello represent the military side.

This power structure makes dismantling Venezuela's current government more complex than removing Maduro, according to interviews with current and former U.S. officials, Venezuelan and U.S. military analysts and security consultants to Venezuela's opposition.

"You can remove as many pieces of the Venezuelan government as you like, but it would have to be multiple actors at different levels to move the needle," said a former U.S. official involved in criminal investigations in Venezuela.

A big question mark surrounds Cabello, who exerts influence over the country's military and civilian counterintelligence agencies, which conduct widespread domestic espionage.

"The focus is now on Diosdado Cabello," said Venezuelan military strategist Jose Garcia. "Because he is the most ideological, violent and unpredictable element of the Venezuelan regime."

The United Nations found both SEBIN, the civilian agency, and DGCIM, the military intelligence service, have committed crimes against humanity as part of a state plan to crush dissent. Eleven former detainees - including some who were once security personnel themselves - described electric shocks, simulated drownings, and sexual abuse at DGCIM black sites to Reuters in interviews before Maduro's capture.

"They want you to feel like you are a cockroach in a cage of elephants, that they are bigger," said a former DGCIM agent who was arrested and accused of treason in 2020 after having contact with military dissidents.

In recent weeks, as the United States mounted its biggest military build-up in Latin America in decades, Cabello has appeared on live TV ordering the DGCIM to "go and get the terrorists" and warning "whoever strays, we will know."

He repeated the rhetoric in a state television appearance on Saturday, clad in a flak jacket and helmet and surrounded by heavily armed guards.

Cabello has also been closely associated with pro-government militias, notably groups of motorcycle-riding armed civilians known as colectivos.

Cabello, a former military officer and a major player in the socialist party, has influence over a meaningful fraction of the armed forces, even though Venezuela's military has been formally run by Defense Minister Padrino for more than ten years.

Venezuela has as many as 2,000 generals and admirals , more than double the number in the United States. Senior and retired officers control food distribution, raw materials and the state oil company PDVSA, while dozens of generals sit on the boards of private firms.

Beyond contracts, military officials profit from illicit trade, defectors and current and former U.S. investigators say.

Documents from an opposition security consultant, shared with the U.S. military and seen by Reuters, say commanders close to Cabello and Padrino are assigned to key brigades along Venezuela's borders and in industrial hubs.

The brigades, while tactically important, also sit on major smuggling routes.

"There are some 20 to 50 officers in the Venezuelan military who need to go, probably even more, to fully remove this regime," said a lawyer who has represented a member of senior Venezuelan leadership.

Some might be considering jumping ship. The lawyer said that around a dozen former officials and current generals had reached out after Maduro's capture, hoping to cut a deal with the U.S. by offering intelligence in exchange for safe passage and legal immunity.

But those close to Cabello said he was not currently interested in cutting a deal, the lawyer said.</description><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 04:49:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WQU4R6U6SBKHFFHWRQN772YPYY.jpg?auth=ce9d0511d13b61592af37fa523ac13c9d0463647410ca0f94786b2d072ab9506&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Myanmar to free 6,186 prisoners in Independence Day amnesty during election</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/myanmar-free-6186-prisoners-independence-day-amnesty-during-election-2026-01-04/</link><description>Jan 4 (Reuters) - Myanmar's military government will release 6,186 prisoners under an amnesty marking Independence Day, state media said on Saturday, a week after a multi-stage general election began in the impoverished Southeast Asian nation.

The amnesty, which includes 52 foreigners, is a humanitarian gesture that takes into consideration the public's peace of mind, state-run MRTV said.

The junta also reduced sentences by one-sixth nationwide, excluding for those convicted of serious crimes such as murder, rape, terrorism, corruption and arms- or drug-related offences.

It was not immediately clear whether any political detainees would be freed.

Myanmar has been in turmoil since 2021, when the military toppled the elected civilian government of Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi and violently suppressed pro-democracy protests, sparking a nationwide armed rebellion.

Suu Kyi is serving 27 years in prison after being detained in the coup, months after her National League for Democracy won a landslide and was later dissolved.

More than 30,000 people have been detained on political charges since the coup, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, a human rights group.

Newly formed resistance groups and long-established ethnic armies are fighting the military across much of the country, forcing an estimated 3.6 million people from their homes.

The first round of the election, Myanmar's first since 2020, was held last weekend in a vote condemned by opposition groups, the U.N. and some Western governments as a sham, given that anti-junta political parties are out of the running and it is illegal to criticise the polls.</description><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 04:50:31 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WPXMPAPVQ5NOXJKWR2XSV7L5PU.jpg?auth=18a6d3382c04958b5a9fdc860fab2be843aeef4647a730840ab1f5caed2d1a9d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Maduro in New York detention centre as Trump says US to 'run' Venezuela</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260104-maduro-in-new-york-detention-centre-as-trump-says-us-to-run-venezuela-drug-trafficking</link><description>Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro was in a New York jail Saturday, hours after American special forces seized and flew him out of his country — which Donald Trump said would come under effective US control.

The US president's announcement followed a lightning pre-dawn attack in which commandos grabbed Maduro and his wife while air strikes pounded sites in and around Caracas.

A US government plane carrying Maduro landed at a military base shortly after nightfall, and he was transported by helicopter to New York City, where the couple were to be arraigned on drug trafficking and weapons charges.

The White House posted video on X of Maduro, handcuffed and in sandals, escorted by federal agents through a US Drug Enforcement Administration facility in New York.

"Good night, happy new year," the 63-year-old leftist is heard saying in English.

Despite the success of the risky raid, what happens next is highly uncertain.

Trump said he was "designating people" from his cabinet to be in charge in Venezuela but gave no further details.

In another surprise, Trump indicated US troops could be deployed, saying Washington is "not afraid of boots on the ground."

But he appeared to reject the possibility of the country's opposition taking power and said he could work instead with Maduro's vice president, Delcy Rodriguez.

One aspect that became clearer was Trump's interest in Venezuela's vast oil reserves.

"We're going to have our very large United States oil companies... go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure," he said.

"We'll be selling large amounts of oil."

US-backed opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, who won last year's Nobel Peace Prize, posted on social media that "the hour of freedom has arrived."

She called for the opposition's 2024 election candidate, Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia, to "immediately" assume the presidency.

But Trump was surprisingly cold about expectations that Machado could become Venezuela's new leader, saying she doesn't have "support or respect" there.

Instead, he touted Rodriguez, saying "she's essentially willing to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again."

Rodriguez poured cold water on that, demanding Maduro's release and vowing to "defend" the country.

Late Saturday, Venezuela's Supreme Court ordered Rodriguez to assume presidential powers "in an acting capacity."

Reflecting the confusion, Trump indicated US involvement is likely for the long haul.

"We're going to stay until such time as the proper transition can take place," he said.

Venezuela ally China said it "strongly condemns" the US operation, while France warned a solution cannot "be imposed from outside."

United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was "deeply concerned that the rules of international law have not been respected."

At Venezuela's request, the UN Security Council will meet Monday to discuss the crisis, the Somali presidency of the Council told AFP.

Venezuelans had been bracing for attacks as US forces spent months massing off the coast.

Caracas residents woke to explosions and the whir of military helicopters around 2:00 am (0600 GMT). Air strikes hit a major military base and an airbase, among other sites, for nearly an hour.

The top US military officer, General Dan Caine, said 150 aircraft took part in the operation, supporting troops who choppered in to seize Maduro with the help of months of intelligence into his daily habits -- down to "what he ate" and what pets he kept.

Maduro and his wife "gave up" without a struggle and there was "no loss of US life," he said.

Venezuelan authorities have yet to release casualty figures. But Trump told the New York Post that "many" Cubans in Maduro's security detail were killed.

Within hours of the operation, Caracas had fallen eerily quiet, with police stationed outside public buildings and the smell of smoke drifting through the streets.

The US and numerous European governments did not recognise Maduro's legitimacy, saying he stole elections in 2018 and 2024.

Maduro -- in power since 2013 after taking over from leftist mentor Hugo Chavez -- long accused Trump of seeking regime change in order to control Venezuela's oil reserves.

Trump has offered several justifications for the aggressive policy toward Venezuela, at times stressing illegal migration, narcotics trafficking and oil.

But he had previously avoided openly calling for regime change.

Several members of Congress quickly questioned the legality of the operation. But Trump's key ally Mike Johnson, top Republican in the House of Representatives, said it was "justified."</description><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 04:51:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/2406bf64-e91c-11f0-b85f-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/ecaca612b59266055f1299b093dc41ca21cb581d.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuela's Maduro in custody, Trump says US will run the country</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/venezuelas-maduro-custody-trump-says-us-will-run-country-2026-01-04/</link><description>CARACAS/NEW YORK, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro was in a New York detention center on Sunday after President Donald Trump ordered an audacious U.S. raid to capture the South American leader and take control of the country and its vast oil reserves.

As part of the dramatic operation early on Saturday that knocked out electricity in parts of Caracas and included strikes on military installations, U.S. Special Forces seized Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, and transported them via helicopter to a U.S. Navy ship offshore before flying them to the U.S.

"We will run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition," Trump told a press conference at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.

For months, his administration criticized Maduro, 63, over what it called his involvement in shipping drugs to the U.S. It ramped up pressure with a massive military build-up in the Caribbean and a series of deadly missile attacks on alleged drug-running boats.

While many Western allies oppose Maduro and say he stole Venezuela's 2024 election, Trump's boasts about controlling the nation and exploiting its oil revived painful memories of past U.S. interventions in Latin America, Iraq and Afghanistan.

Some legal experts questioned the legality of an operation to seize the head of state of a foreign power, while Democrats who said they were misled during recent Congress briefings demanded a plan for what is to follow.

Trump said as part of the takeover, major U.S. oil companies would move back into Venezuela, which has the world's largest oil reserves, and refurbish badly degraded oil infrastructure, a process experts said could take years .

He said he was open to sending U.S. forces into Venezuela. "We're not afraid of boots on the ground," he said.

A plane carrying Maduro landed near New York City on Saturday night, and he was helicoptered to the city before being taken by a large convoy to the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn under a heavy police guard.

Images released by U.S. authorities showed the leader handcuffed and blindfolded during the flight, and later being led down a hallway at the offices of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, where he was heard wishing a "happy New Year."

Indicted on various federal charges, including narco-terrorism conspiracy, Maduro expected to make an initial appearance in Manhattan federal court on Monday, according to a Justice Department official.

It is unclear how Trump plans to oversee Venezuela. U.S. forces have no control over the country, and Maduro's government appears not only to still be in charge but to have no appetite for cooperating with Washington.

Maduro's vice president, Delcy Rodriguez, appeared on Venezuelan television on Saturday afternoon with other top officials to decry what she called a kidnapping.

“We demand the immediate release of President Nicolas Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores," Rodriguez said, calling Maduro "the only president of Venezuela." A Venezuelan court ordered Rodriguez to assume the position of interim president.

Trump did not say who will lead Venezuela when the U.S. cedes control, but appeared to rule out working with opposition figure and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Maria Corina Machado, widely seen as Maduro's most credible opponent.

"She doesn't have the support within or the respect within the country," he said.

In Venezuela, the streets were mostly calm after a rush for groceries and fuel. Soldiers patrolled some parts and small pro-Maduro crowds gathered in Caracas.

Others expressed relief. "I'm happy, I doubted for a moment that it was happening because it's like a movie," said merchant Carolina Pimentel, 37, in the city of Maracay.

Many Venezuelan migrants around the world erupted in celebration.

"We are free. We are all happy that the dictatorship has fallen and that we have a free country," said Khaty Yanez, who lives in the Chilean capital Santiago, one of an estimated 7.7 million Venezuelans - 20% of the population - who have left the country since 2014.

The U.N. Security Council planned to meet on Monday to discuss the actions, which Secretary-General Antonio Guterres described as "a dangerous precedent." Russia and China, both major backers of Venezuela, criticized the U.S.

"China firmly opposes such hegemonic behavior by the U.S., which seriously violates international law, violates Venezuela's sovereignty and threatens peace and security in Latin America and the Caribbean," China's foreign ministry said.

Trump's comments about an open-ended military presence in Venezuela echoed the rhetoric around past invasions in Iraq and Afghanistan, both of which ended in American withdrawals after years of costly occupation and thousands of U.S. casualties.

A U.S. occupation "won't cost us a penny" because the United States would be reimbursed from the "money coming out of the ground," Trump said, referring to Venezuela's oil reserves, a subject he returned to repeatedly during Saturday's press conference.

Trump’s focus on foreign affairs provides fuel for Democrats to criticize him ahead of midterm congressional elections in November, when control of both houses of Congress is at stake, with Republicans controlling both by narrow margins.

Opinion polls show the top concern for voters is high prices at home, not foreign policy.

Trump also runs the risk of alienating some of his own supporters, who have backed his "America First" agenda and oppose foreign interventions.</description><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 06:32:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/FMQGLGBAR5OA5NZKTV5ERDE63I.jpg?auth=f898965558dc6e4e3bae037e1aa2c0ce27ed69f4cf971f5b481f8190516ce1f6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>South Korean President Lee arrives in Beijing for state visit, Chinese state media says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/south-korean-president-lee-arrives-beijing-state-visit-chinese-state-media-says-2026-01-04/</link><description>SHANGHAI, Jan 4 (Reuters) - South Korean President Lee Jae Myung began a state visit to China on Sunday, hoping to promote peace on the Korean Peninsula hours after rival North Korea launched ballistic missiles.

The visit, Lee's first to China since taking office in June, comes amid heightened global tensions after Pyongyang's aggressive display, on the heels of the U.S. attack on Venezuela.

Lee is expected to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping during the trip for their second meeting in just two months, an unusually short interval that, analysts say, signals China's keen interest in boosting economic collaboration and tourism as its relations with neighbouring Japan have sunk to the lowest point in years.

Beijing was incensed when Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi suggested in November that Tokyo could take military action if Beijing attacked Taiwan. China claims the democratically governed island as its own - an assertion rejected by Taiwan's government.

Sunday's missile launches by North Korea represent "a message to China to deter closer ties with South Korea and to counter China's stance on denuclearisation", said Lim Eul-chul, a professor at the Institute for Far Eastern Studies in Seoul.

Lee arrived in Beijing with a delegation that includes more than 200 South Korean business leaders to start a four-day state visit to China, Chinese state news broadcaster CCTV reported.

China and South Korea are expected to discuss matters such as supply chain investment, the digital economy and cultural exchanges during Lee's visit, CCTV said.</description><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 06:33:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/J6ZZCV7F6ZJXFHR4II5POHP4AE.jpg?auth=8ae12e9e53aef0059b6fd5be578616755c77b8f031593d2e2fc345db13e6c680&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Live: Venezuela faces power vacuum after US captures Maduro</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260104-live-venezuela-maduro-held-in-us-custody-as-trump-vows-to-run-the-country-us</link><description>Hours after Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro was captured in an audacious US raid, Vice President Delcy Rodriguez insisted he remains the Latin American country’s only leader.

In a televised speech, Rodriguez, who is also finance and oil minister, called for calm. Rodriguez denounced Maduro's kidnapping and vowed to defend Venezuela's resources.

On Saturday, Venezuela’s high court ordered her to assume the role of interim president.

China's ​foreign ministry said ⁠the United States should immediately ​release Venezuelan ‍leader Nicolas Maduro ​and his wife and ​resolve the situation in Venezuela through dialogue and negotiation.

The ministry said in ‍a statement on ​its website that the United States should also ‌ensure the personal safety ‍of Maduro and his wife, saying that their deportation violated international law ‍and norms.

The United States has advised ⁠airlines its Caribbean airspace curbs will expire at midnight ET (0500 GMT) and flights could resume as schedules are quickly updated, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said.

The comments on X followed the cancelation of hundreds of flights by ​major airlines after the US attack on Venezuela and its capture of Maduro.

Key carriers United Airlines and Delta were readying to resume flights to the Caribbean by Sunday.

The US capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro leaves behind uncertainty about who is running the oil-rich country.

Trump said on Saturday that Vice President Delcy Rodriguez, part of the powerful cabal at the top of the country's government, had been sworn in after Maduro's arrest and that she had spoken with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, leading to speculation that she would take the reins.

Under Venezuela's constitution, Rodriguez becomes acting president in Maduro's absence and the country's top court ordered her to assume the role late Saturday night.

But shortly after Trump's remarks, Rodriguez appeared on state television flanked by her brother, the head of the national assembly Jorge Rodriguez, Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello and Defence Minister Vladimir Padrino Lopez and said that Maduro remained Venezuela's only president.

The joint appearance indicated the group that shared power with Maduro is staying united - for now.

Trump publicly closed the door Saturday on working with opposition leader and Nobel Prize winner Maria Corina Machado, widely seen as Maduro's most credible opponent, saying she doesn't have support inside the country.

A lingering smell of explosives hung over Venezuela's capital Caracas on Saturday as shocked residents took stock after an early-morning US strike that ousted strongman Nicolas Maduro.

While a few hundred Maduro supporters gathered to clamor for his freedom, the streets were otherwise eerily quiet.

"I felt the explosions lift me out of bed. In that instant I thought: 'My God, the day has come,' and I cried," Maria Eugenia Escobar, a 58-year-old resident of the city of six million people, told AFP.

The strikes started around 2:00 am local time, with dozens of detonations that some people at first mistook for fireworks.

Windows rattled from the shockwaves and residents rushed out onto terraces and balconies as military aircraft zoomed overhead.

"It was horrible, we felt the planes flying over our house," said a resident of the Coche neighborhood, near the city's largest military complex, which was targeted in the raid.

The arrest of Maduro and his wife in a stunning military operation early Saturday in Venezuela sets the stage for a major test for US prosecutors as they seek to secure a conviction in a Manhattan courtroom against the longtime leader of the oil-rich South American nation.

Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a post on X that Maduro and his wife “will soon face the full wrath of American justice on American soil in American courts.”

Here's a look at the accusations against Maduro and the charges he faces.

Maduro is charged alongside his wife, his son and three others. Maduro is indicted on four counts: narco-terrorism conspiracy, cocaine importation conspiracy, possession of machine guns and destructive devices and conspiracy to possess machine guns and destructive devices.

Maduro is facing the same charges as in an earlier indictment brought against him in Manhattan federal court in 2020, during the first Trump presidency. The new indictment unsealed on Saturday, which adds charges against Maduro's wife, was filed under seal in the Southern District of New York just before Christmas.

It was not immediately clear when Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, would make their first appearance at the courthouse in Manhattan. A video posted Saturday night on social media by a White House account showed Maduro, smiling, as he was escorted through a US Drug Enforcement Administration office in New York by two federal agents grasping his arms. He was expected to be detained while awaiting trial at a federal jail in Brooklyn.

The indictment accuses Maduro of partnering with “some of the most violent and prolific drug traffickers and narco-terrorists in the world” to allow for the shipment of thousands of tons of cocaine into the Us Authorities allege powerful and violent drug-trafficking organizations, such as the Sinaloa Cartel and Tren de Aragua gang, worked directly with the Venezuelan government and then sent profits to high-ranking officials who helped and protected them in exchange.

Maduro allowed “cocaine-fueled corruption to flourish for his own benefit, for the benefit of members of his ruling regime, and for the benefit of his family members,” the indictment alleges.

“This cycle of narcotics-based corruption lines the pockets of Venezuelan officials and their families while also benefiting violent narco-terrorists who operate with impunity on Venezuelan soil and who help produce, protect, and transport tons of cocaine to the United States,” the indictment says.

The US accuses Maduro and his wife of ordering kidnappings, beatings and murders “against those who owed them drug money or otherwise undermined their drug trafficking operation.” That includes the killing of a local drug boss in Caracas, according to the indictment.

Maduro’s wife is also accused of accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes in 2007 to arrange a meeting between “a large-scale drug trafficker” and the director of Venezuela’s National Anti-Drug Office. In a corrupt deal, the drug trafficker then agreed to pay a monthly bribe to the director of the anti-drug office as well as about $100,000 for each cocaine-carrying flight “to ensure the flight’s safe passage.” Some of that money then went to Maduro’s wife, the indictment says.

Nephews of Maduro's wife were heard during recorded meetings with confidential US government sources in 2015 agreeing to send “multi-hundred-kilogram cocaine shipments” from Maduro's “presidential hanger” at a Venezuelan airport. The nephews during the recorded meetings explained “that they were at ‘war’ with the United States,” the indictment alleges. They were both sentenced in 2017 to 18 years in prison for conspiring to send tons of cocaine into the US before being released in 2022 as part of a prisoner swap in exchange for seven imprisoned Americans.

During a news conference, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Dan Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, cast the military raid that captured Maduro and his wife as an action carried out on behalf of the Department of Justice. Caine said the operation was made “at the request of the Justice Department.”

Rubio, as he responded to a question about whether Congress had been notified, said the US raid to get the couple was “basically a law enforcement function," adding that it was an instance in which the “Department of War supported the Department of Justice." He called Maduro “a fugitive of American justice with a $50 million reward” over his head.</description><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 07:24:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/c2c75cb6-e93b-11f0-9be5-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26003534551418.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UK, France strike suspected IS arms site near Syria's Palmyra</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260104-uk-france-strike-suspected-islamic-state-is-arms-site-near-syria-palmyra</link><description>The British Ministry of Defence said it cooperated with France on Saturday night to strike an underground facility in Syria that had likely been used by the Islamic State group to store weapons.

"Royal Air Force aircraft have completed successful strikes against Daesh in a joint operation with France," the ministry said in a statement, using the Arabic acronym for IS.

"This facility had been occupied by Daesh, most likely to store weapons and explosives. The area around the facility is devoid of any civilian habitation," the statement added.

The ministry said there was no indication the bombing north of the ancient site of Palmyra had posed any risk to civilians.

IS was territorially defeated in Syria in 2019 but still maintains a presence, particularly in the country's vast desert.

Palmyra, home to UNESCO-listed ancient ruins, was once controlled by the jihadist fighters.

Last month, Washington said a lone IS gunman in Palmyra attacked American personnel, killing two US soldiers and a US civilian.

US forces said they struck dozens of IS targets in Syria in retaliation.</description><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 07:24:48 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/4c7a1adc-47ee-11ec-9aae-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/ei_deir_ezzor.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Stunned Swiss Alpine resort seeks solace together after deadly bar fire</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/stunned-swiss-alpine-resort-seeks-solace-together-after-deadly-bar-fire-2026-01-04/</link><description>CRANS-MONTANA, Switzerland, Jan 4 (Reuters) - When 51-year-old Annouk Perret came to pay her respects to the victims of the Swiss New Year bar fire that killed at least 40 people in the ski resort of Crans-Montana, she knew that she too could have been one of the parents mourning a lost child.

Authorities say most of the victims of the blaze that ripped through the Le Constellation bar were young people in a country renowned for orderliness and unaccustomed to mass fatalities.

Laying flowers with her son Emile and her tearful mother-in-law Carmen outside the now cordoned-off popular bar, Perret recalled how her 17-year-old daughter wanted to go in too that night - but did not because of the long queue outside.

Instead, she said her daughter went to a bar opposite with friends. When flames engulfing the bar sparked a blast, they first assumed it was fireworks; when police quickly arrived, the group feared it was gunfire and fled, Perret said.

Afterwards, the family learned that another friend of her daughter decided to enter "Le Constellation" just before the fire and lost her life there, Perret told Reuters.

"We've come today because we need to be here. We need to see the place where it happened," she said. "(She) could have been dead, but is not. But others are dead."

Perret spoke just as Swiss authorities were announcing they had identified four more victims aged 16-21, without naming them. Very few of the dead have so far been identified, with the severity of burns making identification hard.

That will be a tough process for Crans-Montana, she said, a wealthy town of over 10,000 people with a popular golf course.

Prosecutors on Saturday said the two people who ran the bar are now under investigation suspected of crimes including homicide by negligence.

Damiano Vizioli, a 24-year-old living in neighbouring Sion, was in Le Constellation on New Year's Eve but had gone outside to smoke a cigarette when the bar suddenly burst into flames.

He was stunned to see people with their clothes on fire scrambling to escape from the burning bar, he said. The distressing scenes he witnessed have stayed with him.

"I'm not sleeping well because I can hear the people screaming," said Vizioli, who went back to the bar desperate for news of a friend working there whom he has not heard from since.

The blaze has hit many nationalities, with the injured and missing coming from all corners of Europe and as far afield as Australia. But most of the tally are Swiss.

Mutual support was crucial for coping, Perret said.

"Now we call each other, each parents, because everybody has children who were in there or almost were there, or didn't go... and everybody's completely shaken," she said.

Reporters from all around Europe rushed to get to the Alpine retreat as images of the inferno began circulating online.

Eric Schmid, a 63-year-old local businessman, said he had received messages from all over the world since the news broke.

"The scar will be quite deep, and I think it'll take time to heal," he said. But the Swiss are resilient, he added.

"We are mountain people. We will survive, of course, but that's not the most important thing," he said. "It's more about the kids and all these people who have been affected. But the messages and signs of solidarity are super important."

Among those who expressed gratitude for the solidarity is Pierre Pralong, an 89-year-old anxiously awaiting word of his missing granddaughter Emilie, 22, who went to the bar. The uncertainty had caused the family great suffering, he said.

But even as hopes dwindle, faith in God was helping him as he recalled Emilie's joyful nature. "I have a feeling she's probably passed on into the next life," Pralong said.</description><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 08:28:31 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/XLJ2GBF2JBIKPB4GLGL237WAKA.jpg?auth=f108747aa3467c796ac955038bbbd6f824ff4b74a561bd270bfba2e7c2bc88e5&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>One killed, two injured in Ukraine's drone attack in Russia's border region</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/one-killed-two-injured-ukraines-drone-attack-russias-border-region-2026-01-04/</link><description>MOSCOW, Jan 4 (Reuters) - One man was killed and a woman and a four-year old child were injured by a Ukrainian drone attack on a vehicle in Russia's western border region of Belgorod, the governor said on Sunday.

Reuters was unable to independently verify the report.

Separately, Russia's defence ministry said it has downed 42 Ukrainian drones on Sunday morning, on top of 90 it had shot down overnight, including three Moscow-bound drones.

Some 119 people suffered injuries, including severe burns, with many transferred to burn units in hospitals around Europe. Work on identifying the dead and the injured are continuing, the police said.

The demonstrations first kicked off last Sunday when shopkeepers staged a strike over economic concerns, but have since spread in size and scope, with protesters making political demands.

The protests have affected, to varying degrees, at least 40 different cities, mostly medium-sized and located in the country's west, according to an AFP tally based on official announcements and media reports.

At least 12 people have been killed, including members of the security forces, according to a toll based on official reports.

Protests Saturday evening in Tehran were described as "limited" by the Fars news agency, which said they were "generally made up of groups of 50 to 200 young people".

Tehran's population is about 10 million.

Demonstrations were reported in the districts of Novobat and Tehran Pars in the capital's east; Ekteban, Sadeghieh and Sattarkhan in the west; and Naziabad and Abdolabad in the south, Fars said.

Demonstrators shouted slogans including "death to the dictator", Fars said, though no major incidents were reported beyond some stone throwing and rubbish bins being set alright.

The news agency said the situation in Tehran "contrasted with an intensification of violence and organised attacks in other regions, notably the country's west".

In Malekshahi, a county of about 20,000 residents including a sizeable Kurdish population, a member of the security forces was killed in clashes, Iranian media reported Saturday.

"Rioters attempted to storm a police station," Fars said, adding that "two assailants were killed".

Local media's accounting of the protests is not exhaustive, and state-run outlets have downplayed their coverage of the demonstrations, while videos flooding social media are often impossible to verify.</description><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 09:25:10 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/1308a510-e949-11f0-b4a0-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26004221769471.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US strike on Venezuela to embolden China's territorial claims, Taiwan attack unlikely, analysts say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/us-strike-venezuela-embolden-chinas-territorial-claims-taiwan-attack-unlikely-2026-01-04/</link><description>SHANGHAI/BEIJING, Jan 4 (Reuters) - The U.S. attack on Venezuela will embolden China to strengthen its territorial claims over areas such as Taiwan and parts of the South China Sea but will not hasten any potential invasion of Taiwan, analysts said.

Chinese President Xi Jinping's considerations about Taiwan and his timeline are separate from the situation in Latin America, influenced more by China's domestic situation than by U.S. actions, they said.

Still, analysts said, President Donald Trump's audacious attack on Saturday, capturing Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro, hands China an unexpected opportunity that Beijing will likely use in the near term to amplify criticism of Washington and bolster its own standing on the international stage.

Further out, Beijing could leverage Trump's move to defend its stance against the U.S. on territorial issues including Taiwan, Tibet and islands in the East and South China seas.

"Washington's consistent, long-standing arguments are always that the Chinese actions are violating international law but they are now damaging that," said William Yang, an analyst at International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based NGO.

"It's really creating a lot of openings and cheap ammunition for the Chinese to push back against the U.S. in the future."

China claims democratically governed Taiwan as its own province - an assertion the island's government rejects - and claims almost all of the South China Sea, a position that puts it at odds with several Southeast Asian nations that also claim parts of the vital trade route.

China's foreign ministry and Taiwan Affairs Office, and Taiwan's presidential office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Beijing condemned Trump's strike on Venezuela, saying it violated international law and threatened peace and security in Latin America. It has demanded the U.S. release Maduro and his wife, who are being detained in New York awaiting trial.

Hours before his capture, Maduro met with a high-level Chinese delegation in Caracas, according to photos he posted on his Instagram page.

The Chinese foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the whereabouts of the delegation, which included China's special representative for Latin American and Caribbean affairs, Qiu Xiaoqi.

On Sunday China's official Xinhua news agency called the U.S. attack "naked hegemonic behaviour."

"The US invasion has made everyone see more and more the fact that the so-called 'rules-based international order' in the mouth of the United States is actually just a 'predatory order based on US interests'," state-run Xinhua news agency said.

Taiwan, in particular, has been facing growing pressure from Beijing. China last week encircled the island in its most extensive war games to date, showcasing Beijing's ability to cut off the island from outside support in a conflict.

But analysts said they did not expect China to capitalise on the Venezuelan situation to escalate that into an attack anytime soon.

"Taking over Taiwan depends on China's developing but still insufficient capability rather than what Trump did in a distant continent," said Shi Yinhong, professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing.

Neil Thomas, a fellow on Chinese politics at the Asia Society, said China sees Taiwan as an internal affair and so was unlikely to cite U.S. actions against Venezuela as precedent for any cross-strait military strikes.

"Beijing will want a clear contrast with Washington to trumpet its claims to stand for peace, development and moral leadership," Thomas said. "Xi does not care about Venezuela more than he cares about China. He'll be hoping that it turns into a quagmire for the United States."

Wang Ting-yu, a senior lawmaker from Taiwan’s ruling party who sits on the parliament’s foreign affairs and defence committee, rejected the idea that China might follow the U.S. example and strike Taiwan.

"China has never lacked hostility toward Taiwan, but it genuinely lacks the feasible means," Wang posted on Facebook. "China is not the United States, and Taiwan is certainly not Venezuela. If China could actually pull it off, it would have done so long ago!"

Still, the situation amplifies risks for Taiwan and could press Taipei to seek more favour from the Trump administration, some observers said.

On China's Weibo social media platform, discussions of the U.S. attack trended heavily on Sunday, with several users saying Beijing should learn from what Trump did.

Lev Nachman, a political science professor at National Taiwan University, said he expected Taiwan's government to express lightly worded support for American action on Venezuela. Taiwan has not yet made any statement.

"What I do think Trump's actions could do is to help Xi Jinping's narrative in the future to create more justification for action against Taiwan," he said.</description><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 09:41:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/R676NTGGAZKJXK267DKBKJ5E3Y.jpg?auth=d05140924008721a8d2d986990893db52cd2f58068ff73dbb57ecbc4edaf5747&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israeli forces kill three Palestinians in Gaza, local authorities say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-forces-kill-three-palestinians-gaza-local-authorities-say-2026-01-04/</link><description>CAIRO, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Israeli forces shot and killed at least three Palestinians in separate incidents in the southern Gaza Strip city of Khan Younis on Sunday, local health authorities said.

Medics reported that the dead included a 15‑year‑old boy, a fisherman killed outside areas still occupied by Israel in the enclave, and a third man who was shot and killed east of the city in areas under Israeli control.

The Israeli military had no immediate comment on the reported incidents.

Israel has carried out repeated air strikes since a ceasefire took effect in October, saying they are aimed at preventing attacks or destroying militant infrastructure.

Gaza’s health ministry says 420 Palestinians have been killed since the ceasefire began, while militants have killed three Israeli soldiers.

Israel and Hamas have traded blame for violations of the ceasefire agreement brokered under U.S. President Donald Trump.

Israel retained control of 53% of Gaza under the first phase of Trump's plan, which involved the release of hostages held by militants in Gaza and of Palestinians detained by Israel.

The final hostage remains to be handed over are those of an Israeli police officer killed on October 7, 2023 - the day Gazan militants invaded Israel, killing 1,200 and taking some 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.

Israel's military assault on Gaza has killed more than 71,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza health ministry, and led to accusations of genocide and war crimes that Israel denies.</description><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 09:43:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/6KLKJOWVSROQLCYAKF7KYIQNVE.jpg?auth=6ed23fc7749dbe126e520259f942c88fd69c4a640f712c854df25a8072d98eaa&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Numerous teenagers among the dead in Swiss bar blaze, police say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/numerous-teenagers-among-dead-swiss-bar-blaze-police-say-2026-01-04/</link><description>ZURICH, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Teenagers as young as 14 and 15 years old were among those who died in the bar fire on New Year's Eve that killed 40 people in Switzerland, police said on Sunday.

Police in Valais said they had identified 16 more of those who died in the blaze in Crans-Montana, one of the worst disasters in recent Swiss history.

Those newly identified included 10 Swiss nationals, two Italians, one person with Italian-Emirati citizenship, one Romanian, one person from France and one from Turkey, Valais police said. No names were given.

The youngest person identified so far is a 14-year-old Swiss woman, while two 15-year-old Swiss women were also among the dead.

Ten of the other bodies identified on Sunday were teenagers aged 16 to 18, police said. Also identified among the dead were two Swiss men aged 20 and 31, and a French national aged 39.

In total, police have now identified 24 of those who died in the blaze in the mountain resort, in southern Switzerland.

Late on Saturday police said two Swiss women aged 24 and 22 along with two Swiss men aged 21 and 18 had been identified.

Officials are still trying to identify others killed in the fire at the Le Constellation bar.

Some 119 people suffered injuries, including severe burns, with many transferred to burn units in hospitals around Europe. Work on identifying the dead and the injured are continuing, the police said.

Two people who ran the bar are under criminal investigation on suspicion of offences including homicide by negligence, prosecutors said on Saturday.</description><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 10:21:26 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LJ6SKPU5ZVLXDFLEN4FFFQ6GD4.jpg?auth=66ab360163ee37152562193dffa7f21358010cfbe2a54a933e6fcd93dd994445&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Greek airports halt flights due to radio frequency issues</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/greek-airports-halt-flights-due-radio-frequency-issues-2026-01-04/</link><description>Jan 4 - Airports across Greece have suspended arrivals and departures on Sunday after unspecified issues affecting radio frequencies, Greek state TV and the country's aviation authority said.</description><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 10:45:52 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/J2OT46IMSVO2LHG3HHCW3T5WGM.jpg?auth=1bb42dc711388997fd45b2f1aac58ca16ebd233c55b315fd77faa5f6343d7aff&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Cuba denounces 'state terrorism' against Venezuela as US warns Havana could be next</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260104-cuba-diaz-canel-denounces-state-terrorism-against-venezuela-us-rubio-trump-warns-havana-could-be-next</link><description>Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel on Saturday condemned the United States for attacking Venezuela and capturing its president Nicolas Maduro at a rally of thousands of Havana residents in front of the US Embassy in the Cuban capital.

"Cuba condemns and denounces these actions as an act of state terrorism," Diaz-Canel said.

"It is a shocking violation of the norms of international law – the military aggression against a peaceful nation that poses no threat to the United States," he added.

Venezuela supplies around 30% of Cuba's already scarce oil imports in exchange for thousands of medical personnel who work in the South American country.

Analysts agree the loss of the oil would be a devastating blow to Cuba's already shaky power grid and energy supplies.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio hinted that Cuba could be the next target of the Trump administration’s push to restore American dominance in the Western Hemisphere.

Rubio said he would be a bit concerned if he were a Cuban government official following the overnight US military operation in Venezuela. “If I lived in Havana and I was in the government, I’d be concerned at least a little bit,” said Rubio, who has had a long preoccupation with both Venezuela and Cuba.

The US has had a long history of military interventions in Latin America , including its tacit support for the unsuccessful 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion led by Cuban exiles aimed at toppling Fidel Castro .

Meanwhile, thousands of Cubans are worried over the fate of relatives and friends working in Venezuela. Cuba's health ministry tweeted on Saturday they were "well protected".

In an interview US President Donald Trump gave to the New York Post on Saturday, he said he is not considering additional military action against Cuba.

“No, Cuba is going to fall of its own volition. Cuba is doing very poorly,” Trump said.

“Cuba was always very reliant on Venezuela. That’s where they got their money, and they protected Venezuela, but that didn’t work out too well in this case,” the president said.

Cuba is suffering through a six-year crisis which has seen economic growth fall at least 15%, according to the government, causing shortages of basic goods, soaring inflation, crumbling services and widespread power outages.

The government largely blames tougher US sanctions imposed during the first Trump administration, on top of the decades-old trade embargo, for the crisis.</description><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 10:46:19 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/21779c4c-e957-11f0-8a99-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26003682662963.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>North Korea condemns US strikes on Venezuela as 'serious encroachment of sovereignty'</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/north-korea-condemns-us-strikes-venezuela-serious-encroachment-sovereignty-2026-01-04/</link><description>SEOUL, Jan 4 (Reuters) - North Korea has denounced the U.S. strikes on Venezuela as "the most serious form of encroachment of sovereignty," state news agency KCNA said on Sunday.

Deaths and arrests have been reported through the week both by state media and rights groups, though the numbers have differed. Reuters has not been able to verify the figures independently.

The protests are the biggest in three years and while smaller than some previous bouts of unrest to rattle the Islamic Republic, they come at a moment of vulnerability with the economy in tatters and international pressure building.

U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to come to the protesters' aid if they face violence, saying on Friday "we are locked and loaded and ready to go" but without specifying any actions he was considering.

That warning prompted threats of retaliation against U.S. forces in the region from senior Iranian officials and Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Iran "will not yield to the enemy".

Kurdish rights group Hengaw reported that at least 17 people had been killed since the start of the protests. HRANA, a network of rights activists, said at least 16 people had been killed and 582 arrested.

The most intense clashes have been reported in western parts of Iran but there have also been protests and clashes between demonstrators and police in the capital Tehran, in central areas, and in the southern Baluchistan province.

Late on Saturday the governor of Qom, the conservative centre of Iran's Shi'ite Muslim clerical establishment, said two people had been killed there in unrest, adding that one of them had died when an explosive device he made blew up prematurely.

HRANA and the state-affiliated Tasnim news agency reported that authorities had detained the administrator of online accounts urging protests.

Protests began a week ago among bazaar traders and shopkeepers before spreading to university students and then provincial cities, where some protesters have been chanting against Iran's clerical rulers.

Iran has had inflation above 36% since the start of its year in March and the rial currency has lost around half its value against the dollar, causing hardship for many people.

International sanctions over Iran's expensive nuclear programme have been reimposed, the government has struggled to provide water and electricity across the country through the year and global financial bodies predict a recession in 2026.

Authorities have attempted a dual approach to the protests - acknowledging the economic crisis and offering dialogue with demonstrators while meeting more forceful displays of dissent with violence.

Khamenei said on Saturday that although authorities would talk to protesters, "rioters should be put in their place".</description><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 11:39:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/R55EIDRSYVJZBIBIVXGBQFF5W4.jpg?auth=5183957e771e85a8e590c75dda0c41d32453ec192c30b07941ecef58163867ae&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>At least 30 killed in Nigeria market attack, police say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/least-30-killed-nigeria-market-attack-police-say-2026-01-04/</link><description>MAIDUGURI, Nigeria, Jan 4 (Reuters) - At least 30 people were killed and several others abducted when gunmen attacked a market in Nigeria's Niger State, police said on Sunday.

Police spokesperson Wasiu Abiodun said the gunmen, locally called bandits, stormed Kasuwan Daji market in Demo village, at around 4:30 p.m. on Saturday burning stalls and looting food items.

"Over 30 victims lost their lives during the attack, and some persons were also kidnapped. Efforts are ongoing to rescue the kidnapped victims," Abiodun said.

Witnesses said the gunmen arrived on motorcycles and opened fire indiscriminately. They said the violence was part of a series of raids that began on Friday in the nearby villages Agwarra and Borgu.

“Women and children were not spared,” said Dauda Shakulle, who was wounded while fleeing. "There has been no presence of security forces since the attacks began. We are currently recovering corpses."

The Nigerian military did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The attack came weeks after gunmen seized more than 300 children and staff of a Catholic school in the state in central Nigeria. Those victims were released after nearly a month in captivity.

Such banditry has escalated across northwestern and central Nigeria, with armed groups carrying out mass killings and kidnappings in rural communities. Security forces have struggled to contain the violence despite ongoing operations.

Witness Khalid Pissa said the gunmen attacked communities in Kasuwan Daji, and also in nearby Chukama and Shanga. Pissa put the death toll at 40.</description><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 12:41:26 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Pope Leo calls for Venezuela to remain an independent country</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/pope-leo-calls-venezuela-remain-an-independent-country-2026-01-04/</link><description>VATICAN CITY, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Pope Leo called for Venezuela to remain an independent nation and said he was following developments after the United States' toppling of President Nicolas Maduro with a "soul full of concern" on Sunday.

Leo, the first American pope, also called for respect for human rights and the rule of law "as enshrined" in Venezuela's constitution.

"We must not delay in overcoming violence and embarking on paths of justice and peace, while guaranteeing the country's sovereignty," the pope told pilgrims in St. Peter's Square during his Sunday prayer.

U.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday said the U.S. would take control of oil-rich Venezuela after ordering a raid to capture Maduro, who is currently being held in a New York detention center awaiting drug charges.

Leo, who has criticized some of Trump's right-wing policies, in December had urged the U.S. president not to oust Maduro using military force.

"The good of the beloved Venezuelan people must prevail over every other consideration," said the pontiff.</description><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 12:41:31 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/RPHI4WD2UZLELOK7X7TNM2VB5A.jpg?auth=266f7e2233c94d4f3452446db8cb923da8fd3ebfaca237a312e03db47a384d09&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Britain's Starmer says leadership change would 'not be in national interest'</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/britains-starmer-says-leadership-change-would-not-be-national-interest-2026-01-04/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 4 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on Sunday he would still be in power this time next year, in the face of low poll numbers and speculation about a possible leadership challenge.

Starmer told the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg it was not in the national interest to "chop and change" the country's leader as had happened under the previous Conservative government.

His Labour Party is trailing the populists Reform UK in opinion polls 18 months after winning a landslide victory in the 2024 national election.

The prime minister's personal rating is at historic lows as Labour prepares for local elections in England, Wales and Scotland in May.

Starmer said the elections would not be a "referendum" on his government, but Labour would "fight for every vote".

Asked if there were any circumstances in which he could stand down if a poor showing prompted a challenge to his leadership, he said he would stay the course.

"Under the last government we saw constant chopping and changing of leadership, of teams — it caused utter chaos, utter chaos, and it's amongst the reasons that the Tories (Conservatives) were booted out so effectively at the last election," he said.

"Nobody wants to go back to that. It's not in our national interest. We know from that evidence what happens if you go down that chaotic path, and I'm not going to take us back to that kind of chaos."

Conservative lawmakers in effect forced Prime Minister Boris Johnson to stand down in 2022, resulting in the premiership of Liz Truss, the shortest in British history. She was replaced by Rishi Sunak, who led the party to defeat in 2024.

Starmer said in a New Year message on Thursday that life for many Britons was still "harder than it should be", but people would start to see positive changes in public services and improvements in the cost of living this year.

"I will be judged, and I know I'll be judged, when we get to the next election on whether I've delivered on the key things that matter most to people," he told Kuenssberg.</description><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 12:41:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/JXQVY7TNBFNB3H2GZWK66DLW7Y.jpg?auth=7928cd10e46532dc1317718ab534e969837ad752cfbc15725b3e676b5853aa7c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Spain 'strongly condemns' violation of international law in Venezuela, PM says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/spain-strongly-condemns-violation-international-law-venezuela-pm-says-2026-01-04/</link><description>MADRID, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Spain condemned what it called a violation of international law in Venezuela, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez wrote in a letter sent to members of his Socialist Party on Sunday after U.S. President Donald Trump's raid to capture Nicolas Maduro .

His comments went further than his remarks on Saturday in which he said he would not recognise the intervention.

The Socialists' hard-left coalition partner Sumar had urged the government to condemn the U.S. strikes that resulted in the Venezuelan president's capture, with party sources describing it as an act of imperialist piracy against a member state of the United Nations.

Sanchez's letter described the "violation of international law in Venezuela, an act that we strongly condemn".

Trump says Maduro masterminded the flow of drugs into the U.S. and was illegitimately in power due to vote-rigging. Maduro denies those claims and officials in Caracas have demanded his release.

Spain is home to the largest Venezuelan migrant population outside Latin America and the U.S., and they include senior opposition figures such as Edmundo Gonzalez and Leopoldo Lopez.

On Sunday, hundreds of left-wing protesters demonstrated at the U.S. embassy in Madrid to oppose Washington's actions after thousands of opposition activists and others gathered at Madrid's Puerta del Sol on Saturday to celebrate Maduro's detention.

The question of the legality of the U.S. action is likely to be the subject of much debate. International law prohibits the use of force in international relations except for narrow exceptions such as authorisation by the U.N. Security Council or in self-defence.

The accident occurred just before 8 p.m. local time (1900 GMT) on Saturday when the large canoe, which had departed Adiyani village in northwestern Jigawa State, overturned en route to Garbi in Yobe State. The vessel was carrying 52 passengers, according to Mohammed Goje, head of the Yobe State Emergency Management Agency.

"So far, 13 passengers have been rescued alive, while 25 bodies have been recovered. Search and rescue operations are ongoing for 14 missing persons," Goje said, adding that emergency teams from neighbouring towns had joined local volunteers and security agencies at the scene.

Police in Jigawa State confirmed the incident and said the canoe capsized due to leakage. "It was a market day, and the victims were returning home after trading. If the driver survives, he will be prosecuted for negligence," said Lawan Adam, the state police spokesperson, noting that safety laws banning night journeys and overloading were ignored.

Babagana Shettima, a resident of Adiyani, said casualties were from both his village and the destination in Yobe. "When the boat's arrival was delayed, relatives raised the alarm. It was later discovered the canoe had capsized halfway. Divers recovered some bodies," he told Reuters.

Deadly boat accidents are common in Nigeria, where vessels often operate without safety measures. In September, at least 60 people died when an overloaded boat sank after it collided with a tree stump in Niger State, central Nigeria.</description><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 13:30:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>The week in pictures: New Year celebrations, Venezuela's Maduro captured and AFCON 2025</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260104-the-week-in-pictures-new-year-celebrations-venezuela-s-maduro-captured-and-afcon-2025</link><description /><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 13:30:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/97a393ac-e7c3-11f0-bc0c-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-01T140813Z-1655288027-RC25SIATZP78-RTRMADP-3-NEW-YEAR-USA-NEW-YORK.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Crans-Montana holds silent procession for victims of the fire</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/grieving-swiss-town-holds-silent-procession-victims-deadly-bar-fire-2026-01-04/</link><description>CRANS-MONTANA, Switzerland, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Hundreds of people silently filed through the frosty streets of the Swiss ski resort of Crans-Montana on Sunday to remember victims of a New Year bar fire that killed at least 40 people and injured more than a hundred others.

Following a packed church mass that spilled outdoors, the crowd slowly walked towards an impromptu shrine to the victims next to the "Le Constellation" bar that went up in flames in the early hours of January 1.

"It's to be together with the people who are suffering, who have lost somebody in the family, children or friends," said 76-year-old Charlotte Schumacher, a participant in the procession. "I know people who have lost their grandchildren."

Teenagers as young as 14 or 15 years old were among the dead, and the severity of the burns suffered by the victims has made the process of identifying them difficult.

Attendees of the interconfessional church service hugged and shook hands as the prosperous Alpine town sought to pull together to process the trauma of one of the deadliest tragedies to strike modern Switzerland.

Prosecutors said the fire was likely caused by sparkling candles igniting the ceiling of its basement. Swiss authorities have put the two people who ran the bar under investigation on suspicion of crimes including homicide by negligence.

The injured and missing came from all corners of Europe and as far afield as Australia, underlining the international appeal of the picturesque resort with panoramic views of the Alps.

But most of the tally were Swiss. The toll might have been worse if emergency services had not acted so quickly, residents said.

"Within minutes you had ambulances; within minutes you had the police that did their job and they did it unbelievably well," said Max Haus, a local business owner who witnessed the harrowing aftermath of the blaze.

As Sunday's sombre procession reached its conclusion, applause began rippling from one end to the other as dozens of police and emergency services workers, some of them in tears, came up through the middle to be celebrated as heroes.

"It's unimaginable what they did, what they have seen," Bruno Huggler, the director of tourism for Crans-Montana, said of the rescue workers. "And now it's very important to take care of them."</description><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 13:48:54 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/3VUXTLLIYZLZJJP2GJVQHVIW4I.jpg?auth=fccb4536856fb6d9597fa0cc627f3e8afe36f9b2e83feab3330851f29ee6cbe9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>At least 114 killed in week of fighting in Sudan’s Darfur</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/africa/20260104-at-least-114-killed-in-week-of-fighting-in-sudan-s-darfur</link><description>Attacks by Sudan 's army and its paramilitary foes on two Darfur towns over the past week have killed 114 people, medical sources told AFP Sunday.

Following years of economic crisis and U.S. sanctions that severed the country from international capital markets, Venezuela defaulted in late 2017 after missing payments on international bonds issued by the government and state oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela, known as PDVSA.

Since then, accumulated interest and legal claims tied to past expropriations have added to unpaid principal, swelling total external liabilities far beyond the face value of the original bonds.

Venezuela's distressed debt has rallied since U.S. President Donald Trump came to power in January 2025 as speculators bet on the possibility of political change.

Below is a look at which entities owe money, what could be included in a restructuring and who might be knocking on Caracas' door to collect.

Analysts estimate that Venezuela has about $60 billion of defaulted bonds outstanding. However, total external debt including PDVSA obligations, bilateral loans and arbitration awards stand at roughly $150-$170 billion, depending on how accrued interest and court judgments are counted, according to analysts.

The International Monetary Fund estimates Venezuela's nominal GDP at about $82.8 billion for 2025, implying a debt-to-GDP ratio of between 180%-200%.

A PDVSA bond originally maturing in 2020 was secured by a majority stake in U.S.-based refiner Citgo, which is ultimately owned by Caracas-headquartered PDVSA. Citgo is an asset now at the center of court-supervised efforts by creditors to recover value.

Years of sanctions, including a prohibition on trading Venezuela’s debt, have made it hard to keep tabs on ownership.

The largest share of commercial creditors likely consists of international bondholders, including specialist distressed-debt investors, sometimes called vulture funds.

Among the creditors is a group of companies awarded compensation through international arbitration after assets were expropriated by Caracas. U.S. courts have upheld multi-billion-dollar awards to ConocoPhillips and Crystallex among others, turning those claims into debt obligations and allowing creditors to pursue Venezuelan assets to make themselves whole.

A growing pool of court-recognized claimants is competing for recovery from Citgo’s parent company through U.S. legal proceedings. A Delaware court registered about $19 billion in claims for the auction of PDV Holding, Citgo's parent, which far exceeds the estimated value of Citgo's total assets. PDV Holding is PDVSA’s wholly-owned subsidiary.

Caracas also has bilateral creditors, primarily China and Russia, which extended loans to both Maduro and his mentor, former president Hugo Chavez.

Precise numbers are hard to verify since Venezuela has not published comprehensive debt statistics in years.

Given the plethora of claims, legal proceedings and political uncertainty, a formal restructuring is expected to be complex and lengthy.

A sovereign debt workout could be anchored by an IMF program setting fiscal targets and debt-sustainability assumptions. However, Venezuela has not had an IMF annual consultation in nearly two decades and remains locked out of the lender’s financing.

U.S. sanctions are another obstacle. Since 2017, restrictions imposed under both Republican and Democratic administrations have sharply limited Venezuela's ability to issue or restructure debt without explicit licenses from the U.S. Treasury.

It is unclear what will happen with U.S. sanctions. For now, President Donald Trump has said the U.S. will "run" the .

Bonds have returned some 95% at the index level in 2025.

Many of them currently trade between 27-32 cents on the dollar, MarketAxess data shows.

Citigroup analysts in November estimated that a principal haircut of at least 50% would be needed to restore debt sustainability and satisfy potential conditions from the IMF.

Under Citi’s base case, Venezuela could offer creditors a 20-year bond with a coupon of around 4.4%, alongside a 10-year zero-coupon note to compensate for past-due interest. Using an exit yield of 11%, Citi estimates the net present value of the package in the mid-40s cents on the dollar, with recoveries potentially rising into the high-40s if Venezuela were to hand out additional contingent instruments such as oil-linked warrants.

Other investors sketch a wider range. Aberdeen Investments said in September it had initially assumed recoveries of around 25 cents on the dollar for Venezuelan bonds, but that improved political and sanctions scenarios could lift recoveries into the low-to-mid-30s, depending on the structure of any deal and the use of oil-linked or GDP-style instruments.

Recovery assumptions sit against a grim backdrop .

Venezuela’s economy shrank dramatically after 2013 when oil production fell off a cliff, inflation spiraled and poverty surged. Although output has stabilized somewhat, lower global oil prices and discounts to Venezuela's crude prices limit revenue gains, leaving little room to service debt without deep restructuring.

The separatists denied having restricted movement into Aden, but the government accusations indicate that hostility between the sides persists despite proposals for a dialogue that had raised hopes of a negotiated solution to the crisis.

The conflict between the government and the Southern Transitional Council since early last month has triggered a major feud between the Gulf powers and fractured the coalition fighting Houthi forces.

The Iran-backed Houthis seized the capital Sanaa in 2014 and Gulf countries intervened the following year in support of the internationally recognised government, splitting Yemen into rival zones of control.

The government, in a statement from the presidential office to official media, said the STC had taken measures to restrict movement of citizens into Aden and that it had also received reports of a campaign of arrests in the city.

The STC told Reuters it rejected the accusations, calling them a complete distortion of the facts, and said the situation in Aden was stable.

Reuters could not verify the accusations.

A senior government official told Reuters that forces would continue to advance towards Aden. Any dialogue would only begin once Aden was secured, the official said, without elaborating.

Aden has been the main seat of power outside Houthi-controlled areas since 2015 but leaders of the internationally recognised government left the city for Saudi Arabia early last month when the STC seized control.

On Saturday, as government forces said they had retaken Mukalla in the eastern province of Hadramout, residents of areas around Aden said STC fighters had put up checkpoints.

Meanwhile Aden airport closed on Thursday after a dispute over flights between the city and the UAE, with the STC and the government trading blame over which side had shut down air traffic. At least one flight took off on Sunday, travellers and airport officials said.

The U.S. embassy also said it had received reports of closures and redirected flights to and from the Yemeni island of Socotra.

The internationally recognised government said late on Friday it had asked Saudi Arabia to host a forum to resolve the southern issue. Riyadh said it would do so and extended invitations to southern factions.

The STC welcomed this late on Saturday, a potential sign that all sides now see negotiation as the eventual means of ending the brief conflict triggered early last month when the separatists suddenly seized swathes of territory.

Government forces backed by Saudi airstrikes on Friday and Saturday took back control of the strategically important Hadramout province in the east of Yemen.</description><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 15:20:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ORRDY2S2D5NGBO64V6WA6FF3XI.jpg?auth=b597960c9819e60afc93944153d2e5917d593e629d179610641e8cec79742245&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Berlin power grid attack caused by 'extreme leftists', officials say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/berlin-power-grid-attack-caused-by-extreme-leftists-officials-say-2026-01-04/</link><description>FRANKFURT, Jan 4 (Reuters) - A fire in southwest Berlin that has left tens of thousands in the German capital without electricity was likely the result of a far-left extremist attack, officials said on Sunday.

Grid company Stromnetz Berlin said on Saturday that the suspected arson attack could leave up to 45,000 households without power until January 8.

On Sunday, it said efforts to restore power were ongoing, with around 35,000 households and 1,900 commercial entities still affected.

Following the attack, local media published a letter purportedly from a far-left activist organisation called the Volcano Group that claimed responsibility for the incident, saying its actions were directed at the fossil-fuel based energy industry.

"The letter claiming responsibility has been classified as authentic by the security authorities," Iris Spranger, Berlin's interior affairs minister, said in a post on x.

"I condemn this inhumane attack on Berliners and visitors to the city in the strongest possible terms. The investigation is ongoing."

In September, a suspected arson attack on two pylons left around 50,000 households in Berlin without power in an incident local media said bore similarities to Volcano Group's high-profile attack on the power supply of Tesla's (TSLA.O) , opens new tab gigafactory in Gruenheide in 2024.</description><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 16:25:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WICYQLXTFBPCBBL5RTA3TIR354.jpg?auth=07074a4f8690b07358174b225d70f20d013cb4b8f2d236540acce479b68dd28a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>France tightens food import checks as farmers protest Mercosur deal</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260104-france-tightens-food-import-checks-as-farmers-protest-mercosur-deal</link><description>The French government said on Sunday it was tightening checks on several food ⁠imports in a bid to ease concerns of farmers who have been protesting at what they say is unfair competition from countries with looser regulations.

French farmers have been protesting over a ​planned European trade deal with the South American Mercosur bloc, and other issues ‍including measures to contain a livestock disease.

Agriculture Minister Annie Genevard said the tighter checks would make sure food coming from ​outside the EU did not include substances banned in food produced in ​the bloc.

A decree would be issued soon announcing the suspension of imports of some food products already known to contain those substances, she added.

"Imports, regardless of from where they come in the world, must comply with our standards. France is setting an example in Europe by issuing this unprecedented decree that concerns more than a dozen food products," wrote Genevard on X.

"Melons, apples, apricots, cherries, strawberries, grapes, potatoes: ‍they will only be on sale in France if they show no residue of these substances banned in our ​country. Other products from South America such as avocados, mangos, guavas, or certain citrus fruits from elsewhere will only be allowed in if they comply with our standards," she added.

Prime ‌Minister Sébastien Lecornu said earlier that any imported product showing traces of these weed and fungus killers – namely mancozeb, glufosinate, thiophanate-methyl, and carbendazim ‍which are banned in Europe – will not be allowed in France.

Germany and Spain back the Mercosur deal, but opponents in France say the trade arrangement would lead to cheap imports of South American commodities, notably beef, that do not meet the European Union 's environmental and food safety standards.

"Protecting our farmers, guaranteeing the health of French people and standing up to any form of unfair competition while making ‍sure our rules are respected – this is non-negotiable. It is up to the European Commission to make ‌sure this is generalised ​across the board. If necessary, we will do it again," added Genevard.</description><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 16:27:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/51a0e8d2-e985-11f0-adf3-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25352523125527.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Large part of Maduro's security team killed in US action, minister says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/large-part-maduros-security-team-killed-us-action-venezuela-defense-minister-2026-01-04/</link><description>Jan 4 (Reuters) - A large part of erstwhile President Nicolas Maduro's security team was killed in the U.S. raid that led to the leader's Saturday capture, Venezuelan Defense Minister General Vladimir Padrino said in a televised statement on Sunday morning.

At least 152 members of the UAE-backed STC forces were wounded and 130 were taken captive, the official said, giving a preliminary toll of casualties since the start of the Saudi-backed operation.

Forces supported by Riyadh began operations on Friday to retake swathes of territory seized by the STC, which is backed by Abu Dhabi , as a struggle for dominance deepened a rift between the two Gulf allies.

Most of the casualties occurred in strikes by the Saudi-led coalition that targeted military camps held by the separatists , the official said, including Al-Khasha and Barshid military camps in Hadramawt province.

An official with the Saudi-backed forces told AFP later Sunday that at least 14 of their fighters had been killed in fighting and over 30 wounded during the offensive.

Yemen's presidency on Saturday announced the retaking of resource-rich Hadramawt , following an apparent retreat of the STC.

Riyadh-aligned government military officials on Saturday also said authorities in neighbouring Mahra province had switched back their allegiance without any resistance.

On Sunday, Saudi-backed forces were consolidating positions in Mukalla, the capital of Hadramawt province, two government military officials told AFP.

But amid the chaos of the fighting and rapid retreats, a law enforcement official in Mukalla told AFP that at least 18 suspected militants affiliated with Al-Qaeda had escaped from a local detention centre in the port city.

Local residents also reported that sporadic clashes were taking place between forces loyal to the STC and the Saudi-backed fighters in Mahra province.

Riyadh and Abu Dhabi have long supported rival groups in Yemen's divided government.

A December offensive by the STC, in which it took control of Hadramawt and Mahra, angered Saudi Arabia , exposing fissures in the ties between the two oil-rich powers.

The Saudi-led coalition launched repeated warnings and air strikes over the past week, including one on an alleged Emirati arms shipment to the separatists.

On Friday, a strike on the Al-Khasha military camp in Hadramawt left 20 dead, according to an earlier toll from the separatist group.

On Saturday, a military official with the STC told AFP Saudi warplanes had carried out "intense" air strikes on another of the group's camps at Barshid, west of Mukalla.

The Yemeni government is a patchwork of groups that includes the separatists, and is held together by shared opposition to the Iran-backed Houthis.

The Houthis pushed the government out of Yemen's capital Sanaa in 2014 and secured control over most of the north.

The Iran-backed group has been at war with the government, backed by a Saudi-led coalition since 2015, in a conflict that has killed hundreds of thousands of Yemenis and triggered a major humanitarian crisis.</description><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 17:42:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/0a9b6000-e991-11f0-a9b5-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-04T145208Z-43020088-RC29UIAX6XAC-RTRMADP-3-YEMEN-SECURITY.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Crans-Montana mourns fire victims, pays tribute to emergency services workers</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260104-swiss-town-mourns-fire-victims-pays-tribute-to-emergency-services-workers</link><description>Hundreds of people silently filed through the frosty streets of the Swiss ski resort of Crans-Montana on Sunday to remember victims of a New Year bar fire that killed at least ​40 people and injured more than a hundred others.

Following a packed church mass that ‍spilled outdoors, the crowd slowly walked towards an impromptu shrine to the victims next to the "Le Constellation" bar that went up in ​flames in the early hours of January 1.

"It's to be together with the people ​who are suffering, who have lost somebody in the family, children or friends," said 76-year-old Charlotte Schumacher, a participant in the procession. "I know people who have lost their grandchildren."

Teenagers as young as 14 or 15 years old were among the dead, and the severity of the burns suffered by the victims has made the process of identifying them difficult.

So far, 24 people have been identified by authorities, including eight French nationals.

Attendees of the interconfessional church service hugged and shook hands as the prosperous Alpine town sought to pull together ‍to process the trauma of one of the deadliest tragedies to strike modern Switzerland .

Prosecutors said the fire was likely caused by ​ sparkling candles igniting the ceiling of its basement. Swiss authorities have put the two people who ran the bar under investigation on suspicion of crimes including homicide by negligence.

The injured and missing came ‌from all corners of Europe and as far afield as Australia, underlining the international appeal of the picturesque resort with panoramic views of the Alps.

But most ‍of the tally were Swiss. The toll might have been worse if emergency services had not acted so quickly, residents said.

"Within minutes you had ambulances; within minutes you had the police that did their job and they did it unbelievably well," said Max Haus, a local business owner who witnessed the harrowing aftermath of the blaze.

As Sunday's sombre procession reached its conclusion, applause began rippling from one end to the other as dozens of police ‍and emergency services workers, some of them in tears, came up through the middle to be celebrated as heroes.

"It's ‌unimaginable what they ​did, what they have seen," Bruno Huggler, the director of tourism for Crans-Montana, said of the rescue workers. "And now it's very important to take care of them."</description><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 18:30:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/81e07fec-e95f-11f0-a6f2-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26004392213870.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump warns Venezuelan VP Delcy Rodríguez in magazine interview</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/trump-warns-venezuelan-vp-delcy-rodrguez-magazine-interview-2026-01-04/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 4 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Sunday said Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodríguez may pay a bigger price than ousted leader Nicolas Maduro "if she doesn't do what's right," according to an interview with The Atlantic magazine.

Trump initially praised Rodriguez on Saturday after U.S. forces seized Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro and his wife from Caracas. Rodriguez said later, however, that her country would defend its natural resources.

"If she doesn’t do what’s right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro," Trump was quoted as saying in the telephone interview held as he arrived at his West Palm Beach golf course in Florida.

The U.S. president defended his decision to take Maduro by force, telling the magazine: "You know, rebuilding there and regime change, anything you want to call it, is better than what you have right now. Can’t get any worse."

Trump also said other countries may be subject to American intervention.

Jonatan Mallora, a 50-year-old motorcycle taxi driver, and his neighbor Angel Alvarez, a young street vendor, said they woke on Saturday to explosions in their community in La Guaira state, about 31 kilometers (19 miles) north of Caracas.

Venezuelan authorities have said the U.S. hit areas in La Guaira, Caracas and the neighboring states of Miranda and Aragua and that soldiers, civilians and much of Maduro's security team were killed, though they have not offered specific figures on dead and injured.

The small Romulo Gallegos neighborhood, where Mallora and Alvarez live, was damaged in the U.S. attack on a nearby naval academy.

“It's sheer luck they didn't kill my kids,” Mallora said amid the rubble of his apartment, where the roof was destroyed. He said he fled and escaped unharmed along with his 24-year-old daughter and 22-year-old son.

Alvarez surveyed shrapnel damage to his apartment wall and water tank — vital in a country where water supply is unreliable. He said he was relieved to have a spare tank and his home remained standing, unlike Mallora's.

“We really didn’t know what to do,” Alvarez said, recalling how he ran back and forth after waking to the deafening noise.

“I would never wish on anyone" the experience of an attack, he added. “We’re alive by a miracle.”</description><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 19:37:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/QIZ7KXG7GFN55GVH6CHJ6F3IUY.jpg?auth=e326d4c40ddee248e524b6f81c75b578a80c08b2f230bdf337b1dad572a6bf9b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Swiss police: last 16 victims of New Year's bar fire have been identified</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/swiss-police-last-16-victims-new-years-bar-fire-have-been-identified-2026-01-04/</link><description>ZURICH, Jan 4 (Reuters) - The last 16 people who died in the New Year's Eve bar fire at the Swiss mountain resort of Crans-Montana have been identified, police said on Sunday.

The U.S. attacked Venezuela on Saturday and deposed its long-serving President Nicolas Maduro in an overnight operation, in Washington's most direct intervention in Latin America since the 1989 invasion of Panama.

"The EU recalls that, under all circumstances, the principles of international law and the U.N. Charter must be upheld. Members of the United Nations Security Council have a particular responsibility to uphold those principles, as a pillar of the international security architecture," the EU's top diplomat Kaja Kallas said in a statement supported by 26 of the 27 EU nations.

The joint statement called for restraint from all sides to ensure a peaceful solution. The EU has said Maduro lacked democratic legitimacy, and called for a transition to democracy determined by the will of the Venezuelan people.

"Respecting the will of the Venezuelan people remains the only way for Venezuela to restore democracy and resolve the current crisis," the statement said.

It added that the EU shared the priority of combatting organised crime and drug trafficking. Such challenges must be addressed "through sustained cooperation in full respect of international law and the principles of territorial integrity and sovereignty," the statement said.

Maduro is in a New York detention centre awaiting a Monday court appearance on drug charges. Maduro was indicted in 2020 on U.S. charges including narco-terrorism conspiracy. He has always denied any criminal involvement.

The EU is in close contact with the United States and other partners, the statement said.

A spokesperson for Hungary's representation to the EU did not immediately respond to a request for comment on why it had not signed the statement.</description><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 20:25:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/S3IET3ZQCZLCNLFVTQ3BCSBH7M.jpg?auth=0a2c1664f4a4688781d3b4aee0050ce46c3e931a3ea8d0113955ee956cf2036e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Denmark PM urges Trump to stop threats to take over Greenland</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/denmark-pm-urges-trump-stop-threats-take-over-greenland-2026-01-04/</link><description>COPENHAGEN, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen on Sunday urged U.S. President Donald Trump to stop threatening to take over Greenland, after he reiterated his wish to do so in an interview with The Atlantic magazine.

"It makes absolutely no sense to talk about the U.S. needing to take over Greenland. The U.S. has no right to annex any of the three countries in the Danish Kingdom," Frederiksen said in a statement on Sunday.

Trump told the magazine: "We do need Greenland, absolutely. We need it for defense."

He spoke a day after the U.S. captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and the president said Washington would run the Latin American country.

This raised concerns in Denmark that the same could happen with Greenland, a Danish territory.

Frederiksen said: "I would therefore strongly urge the U.S. stop the threats against a historically close ally and against another country and another people, who have very clearly said that they are not for sale."

The Greenlandic prime minister's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside regular office hours.

Trump on December 21 named Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry as special envoy to Greenland, drawing renewed criticism from Denmark and Greenland over Washington's interest in the mineral-rich Arctic island.

Trump has advocated for Greenland, a self-governing Danish territory, to become part of the United States. Landry publicly supports the idea.

The Arctic island's strategic position between Europe and North America makes it a key site for the U.S. ballistic missile defence system, while its mineral wealth is attractive as the U.S. hopes to reduce its reliance on Chinese exports.

Greenland , a former Danish colony, has the right to declare independence under a 2009 agreement but depends heavily on Danish subsidies.

Denmark has sought to repair strained ties with Greenland over the past year, while also trying to ease tensions with the Trump administration by investing in Arctic defence.</description><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 20:44:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5SYJKI6KEBN5HOYFJKSQ7HWRPM.jpg?auth=b8a23871febe9953bd58630abf8f292a9a0039c6151abcdac05053107bb73ae3&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump bets on intimidation to force Venezuelan leaders into line</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/trump-bets-intimidation-force-venezuelan-leaders-into-line-2026-01-04/</link><description /><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 21:19:31 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Trump warns Venezuela's interim president of 'big price' if she resists US</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260104-trump-warns-venezuela-s-interim-president-of-paying-big-price-if-she-resists-us</link><description>President Donald Trump threatened Sunday that Venezuela 's new leader will pay a "big price" if she does not cooperate with the United States, after US forces seized and jailed her former boss Nicolas Maduro .

If interim president Delcy Rodriguez "doesn't do what's right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro," Trump told The Atlantic in a telephone interview.

US forces attacked Caracas in the early hours of Saturday, bombing military targets and spiriting away Maduro and his wife to face federal narcotrafficking charges in New York. The deposed leader is due to appear in a Manhattan court on Monday.

The Trump administration says it is willing to work with the remainder of Maduro's government as long as Washington's goals, particularly opening access to US investment in Venezuela's enormous crude oil reserves, are met.

The streets of Caracas were calm in the wake of the stunning raid, in which US commandos swooped into Caracas on helicopters, backed by attack jets and naval forces, to capture Maduro.

Residents queued up to buy food in grocery stores, and the masked and heavily armed police visible the previous day were gone, AFP correspondents said.

The Venezuelan military announced it recognized Rodriguez – previously Maduro's vice president – as acting president, and urged people to resume normal life.

Despite the success of the initial US operation, questions mounted over Trump's strategy.

The Senate's top Democrat, Chuck Schumer , told ABC News that Americans were left "scratching their heads in wonderment and in fear".

Trump said Saturday that the United States will "run" Venezuela.

And he told The Atlantic that "rebuilding there and regime change – anything you want to call it – is better than what you have right now".

But Secretary of State Marco Rubio stressed Sunday that Washington is not seeking complete regime change in the South American country of about 30 million people, or elections to restore democracy there.

Rather than seek to topple the entire Maduro government, "we're going to make an assessment on the basis of what they do," he told CBS News.

The United States is fighting drug traffickers, "not a war against Venezuela", Rubio told NBC's "Meet the Press".

However, he said a large US naval presence would remain in the Caribbean to enforce a blockade of Venezuelan oil exports for "tremendous leverage".

Trump has made clear that Washington intends to call the shots in Venezuela, with a focus on securing access to the world's largest proven oil reserves.

"We're going to run the country" until a transition can be made, he said Saturday, also insisting that military "boots on the ground" remained a possibility.

In her first remarks since the US attack, Rodriguez struck a defiant note, saying Maduro was the country's sole legitimate leader and that "we're ready to defend our natural resources".

The deposed Venezuelan leader was in a New York detention centre ahead of his court hearing.

Handcuffed and in sandals, Maduro was escorted by federal agents through a Manhattan US Drug Enforcement Administration facility late Saturday, a video posted by the White House on social media showed.

"Good night, happy new year," the 63-year-old leftist was heard saying in English.

Earlier, he was photographed aboard a US naval ship blindfolded and handcuffed, with noise-canceling ear protectors.

Maduro, a self-described socialist, led Venezuela with an iron fist for more than a decade through a series of elections widely considered rigged. He came to power after the death of his charismatic mentor, Hugo Chavez .

As news of Maduro's capture rippled out, exiled Venezuelans waved flags and celebrated in plazas from Madrid to Santiago. About eight million Venezuelans have fled the grinding poverty and political suppression of their homeland.

Brazil , Chile , Colombia , Mexico , Uruguay and Spain in a joint statement expressed their "rejection" of the US operation and "concern about any attempt at governmental control or administration or outside appropriation of natural or strategic resources".

Washington's military intervention in Venezuela has reignited fears for Greenland, which Trump has repeatedly made clear he wants to become an annexed part of the United States.

Those fears were underscored by Trump's comments to The Atlantic magazine and a social media post by the wife of his most influential aide showing Greenland in the colours of the US flag.

"I have to say this very clearly to the United States: it is absolutely absurd to say that the United States should take control of Greenland," Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said in a statement late Sunday.

She called on Washington to stop "threatening its historical ally".

The United States's European allies were rattled by Trump sending in his military on Saturday to attack Caracas and grab Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro , who is now being held in New York.

Trump has said the United States will now "run" Venezuela indefinitely and tap its huge oil reserves.

In Greenland's case, Trump has claimed that making the Danish territory part of the United States would serve US national security interests, given its strategic location on the Arctic.

Greenland is also rich in key critical minerals used in high-tech sectors.

Asked in a telephone interview with The Atlantic about the implications of the Venezuela military operation for Greenland, Trump said that it was up to others to decide, according to the magazine Sunday.

"They are going to have to view it themselves. I really don't know," Trump was quoted as saying.

He added: "But we do need Greenland, absolutely. We need it for defense."

Late Saturday, Katie Miller – wife of Trump's deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller – posted the contentious image of the Danish autonomous territory in the colours of the US flag on her X feed.

Her post had a single word above it: "SOON".

Greenland's Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen called the post "disrespectful".

"Relations between nations and peoples are built on mutual respect and international law – not on symbolic gestures that disregard our status and our rights," he stated on X.

But he also said that "there is neither reason for panic nor for concern. Our country is not for sale, and our future is not decided by social media posts".

Denmark's ambassador to the US, Jesper Moeller Soerensen, reacted earlier on Sunday with his own post saying "we expect full respect for the territorial integrity" of Denmark, above a link to Katie Miller's image.

Moves edging towards that goal by his government – including his appointment of an envoy to the Danish territory – have drawn the ire of both Copenhagen and the European Union.

Stephen Miller is widely seen as the architect of much of Trump's policies, guiding the president on his hardline immigration policies and domestic agenda.

Denmark's ambassador gave a pointed "friendly reminder" in response to Katie Miller's post that his country – a NATO member – has "significantly boosted its Arctic security efforts" and worked together with the US on that.

"We are close allies and should continue to work together as such," Soerensen wrote.

Katie Miller was deputy press secretary under Trump at the Department of Homeland Security during his first term.

She later worked as communications director for then vice president Mike Pence and also acted as his press secretary.</description><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 22:22:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/cbe470fc-e9b5-11f0-86d5-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25297625966686.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Who is 'tsarina' Delcy Rodriguez, the acting president of Venezuela?</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/who-is-tsarina-delcy-rodriguez-acting-president-venezuela-2026-01-04/</link><description>Jan 4 (Reuters) - Delcy Rodriguez, declared the interim president of Venezuela after Nicolas Maduro's capture by U.S. forces, is one of the iron fists in Venezuelan politics, a practitioner of economic orthodoxy who has strived to build relationships with the private sector and who is known for her taste for luxury.

Over more than a decade in public life, the 56-year-old Rodriguez has amassed significant influence, earning her the nickname "the tsarina," while Maduro has called her a "tigress" for her staunch defense of his socialist government, which has presided over a deep economic crisis, alleged torture and arbitrary detentions and the exodus of some 8 million migrants.

She has been vice president since 2018, simultaneously serving first as finance minister and then as oil minister. Before that she was communications minister, foreign minister and the head of a pro-government legislature. She works closely with her brother, Jorge Rodriguez, who is the head of the National Assembly.

The Rodriguez siblings are the children of leftist guerrilla fighter Jorge Antonio Rodriguez, who founded the revolutionary Socialist League Party and was arrested in 1976 for his alleged involvement in the kidnapping of an American businessman.

He died in police custody due to what his family alleges was torture and Maduro has praised him as a hero of the Venezuelan left.

Delcy, a lawyer specializing in labor law, spent nine years in France and England pursuing postgraduate studies.

She participates in table tennis competitions with her brother, which they often share on social media. In public appearances, she's often seen wearing luxury clothing brands.

As vice president, after years of hyperinflation amid U.S. sanctions, she implemented orthodox policies including cutting public spending, limiting credit and a fixed dollar-bolivar rate, which helped lower triple-digit inflation.

She has managed to keep oil production at an average of about 1.1 million barrels per day last year, and her role has put her in close contact with foreign oil companies like Chevron.

Sometimes described by industry leaders as a "workaholic," Rodriguez attends many private sector events, something other public officials neglected to do for years. She is the Venezuelan official who travels most frequently to China, Russia, and Turkey, some of Venezuela's allies.</description><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 23:41:52 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WEP2WT7GR5MTDNKAO6HGVYDN3A.jpg?auth=28013dc0c948fcfa8cc753fc4a9ecce54e4c3f47e756f58efa79db6b3d061313&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump says he doesn't believe Ukraine struck Putin residence</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/trump-says-he-doesnt-believe-ukraine-struck-putin-residence-2026-01-05/</link><description>ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE, Jan 4 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said he did not believe that an alleged Ukrainian strike on President Vladimir Putin's residence took place as claimed by Russia.

"I don't believe that strike happened," Trump told reporters on Sunday aboard Air Force One en route back to Washington, D.C., from Florida. "There is something that happened fairly nearby, but had nothing to do with this."

Moscow accused Kyiv on Monday of trying to strike a residence of Putin in Russia's northern Novgorod region with 91 long-range attack drones, and said Russia would review its negotiating position in ongoing talks with the U.S. on ending the Ukraine war.

Ukraine and Western countries have disputed Russia's account of the alleged attempted strike.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 01:55:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/TQJ4HEZN6RN7FKM3JXYSZZBAPI.jpg?auth=8b6f046cc87d1d137c574d9a18570fe68a9b11e0f6c289b7b2dc8a4e4d1a3b19&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump political base sets aside isolationism to cheer Maduro capture</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-political-base-sets-aside-isolationism-cheer-maduro-capture-2026-01-05/</link><description>Jan 4 (Reuters) - Supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump have largely praised the capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro as a swift, painless win, though political analysts warn support could wane if the operation drags on and echoes past foreign interventions.

While a handful of conservative figures criticized the attack on Venezuela and detainment of Maduro as a betrayal of Trump's "America First" pledge to avoid foreign entanglements, most of the president's Republican allies fell in line.

The early support came even after Trump said the United States would temporarily "run" Venezuela and work to tap its oil reserves, raising the possibility of the kind of open-ended foreign entanglement he and the MAGA base have long opposed.

For now, the base appears willing to cheer on the removal of Maduro, seeing little risk of an escalation into a years-long quagmire like the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, political analysts said.

"This is too recent for there to be significant MAGA-base push back," said Joshua Wilson, a professor of political science at the University of Denver. "There are many questions about how things will develop, and so this could become another test of Trump's ability to frame events and control his base."

The military action comes amid a slump in Trump's approval ratings, with a Reuters/Ipsos poll last month showing that just 39% of U.S. adults approved of his job performance, largely reflecting disappointment over his handling of the economy.

Historically, presidents usually only gain a short-lived political boost from military action, according to Matthew Wilson, a political science professor at Southern Methodist University. That means the risk for Trump and Republicans is on the downside heading into November's midterm elections , when control of Congress is at stake.

"If it goes well, it will largely be forgotten, I suspect, by the time of the midterms," Wilson said. "If it goes poorly, it will be an albatross."

Before Saturday's events, the last time the United States took action to remove the ruler of a Latin American country was the 1989 invasion of Panama that ousted dictator Manuel Noriega. That was the first of two quick, relatively successful military actions under U.S. President George H.W. Bush, who also orchestrated the 1991 Gulf War, yet he still lost his re-election bid to Bill Clinton in 1992 primarily due to a weak economy.

Democrats have widely criticized the Trump administration's actions in Venezuela as ill-advised and potentially unlawful given they were carried out without approval from Congress. The party's leader in the Senate, Chuck Schumer, said Trump risked dragging the U.S. "into another costly foreign war."

The Democrats have been joined by Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, a longtime Trump supporter who had a public falling out with the president this year. Speaking on NBC's "Meet the Press" program on Sunday, the Republican described Maduro's arrest as a betrayal of Trump's pledge during the 2024 presidential campaign to steer clear of foreign conflicts.

"This is the same Washington playbook that we are so sick and tired of that doesn't serve the American people," she said.

Candace Owens, a right-wing podcaster known in part for spreading conspiracy theories, was also critical of Maduro's capture, writing on X that the CIA had staged "another hostile takeover of a country at the behest of a globalist psychopaths [sic]."

Yet most of Trump’s political supporters — and even some critics — either backed the attack or declined to weigh in.

Steve Bannon, a former Trump aide and prominent voice in the Make America Great Again movement, praised the raid as "bold and brilliant" on his podcast hours after the operation, embodying the hawkish tone prevalent across the president's base.

Trump administration officials have gone to lengths to characterize Saturday's operation as a law enforcement action against Maduro, who has been indicted on drug-related charges and has a court hearing on Monday in New York.

Some MAGA influencers said they also supported Trump's stated goal of asserting U.S. dominance in the Western Hemisphere.

Right-wing activist Laura Loomer argued on social media that the United States must exploit Venezuela's vast oil reserves rather than allow adversaries such as Iran, China, Russia and Cuba to benefit from them and finance attacks on the West.

"We will exert our power and take the oil and financially starve the axis of evil," Loomer wrote on X, in a broadside against Representative Thomas Massie, one of the few Republicans to question the legal basis for the strikes on Venezuela.

Nikki Haley, who lost to Trump in the Republican primary of 2024, called Maduro a "brutal socialist dictator" in a post on X and said the Venezuelan people "deserve freedom".

Republican Senator Rand Paul, a longtime opponent of overseas military interventions, did not explicitly criticize Trump's actions in a social media post, but cautioned that "time will tell if regime change in Venezuela is successful without significant monetary or human cost."

Matt McManus, a political science professor at Spelman College, said it would be incorrect to cast the MAGA movement as strictly isolationist, when it has long been comfortable in projecting power. He pointed to Trump backers' support of the U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites in June and of Trump's various threats against other countries during his first term.

"MAGAdom has never really been defined by a great concern for ideological consistency," McManus said. "It very much takes its cues from the leading figures... And of course, right now, Trump is signaling very heavily that Venezuelan intervention is what's good for America."

But McManus and other experts agreed that a prolonged intervention in Venezuela would test Trump's grip over his party and the MAGA movement, especially if U.S. troops are deployed - a possibility the president has not ruled out.

"I guess Venezuela will be the acid test that answers the question is MAGA whatever Donald Trump says it is," said Dante Scala, a political science professor at the University of New Hampshire.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 01:55:44 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LRKHGKZMIBJWHJOKYYKPGIUQRU.jpg?auth=d44a143039e6d038335ea1d4dde223c45dd6eb921390e4e06c262c0fbd199f4a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukraine targets Moscow daily with drones this year, Russia says, in apparent escalation</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/ukraine-targets-moscow-daily-with-drones-this-year-russia-says-apparent-2026-01-04/</link><description>Jan 5 (Reuters) - Ukraine has targeted Moscow with drones every day of 2026 so far, according to data published by Russia’s Defence Ministry, in what appeared to mark an escalation from earlier, more sporadic attacks on the Russian capital.

By midnight on Sunday alone, Russian air defence systems had destroyed 57 drones over the Moscow region out of 437 downed over Russia, the ministry said on its Telegram messaging app.

The daily activity suggests a shift from past patterns, when Moscow was hit more intermittently, often around symbolic dates or as a form of signalling rather than a near routine pressure campaign.

There was no immediate comment from Ukraine, but Kyiv has increasingly used long range drones to strike targets deep inside Russia.

Ukraine says such attacks aim to disrupt military logistics and energy infrastructure, raise costs for Moscow’s war effort and respond to repeated Russian missile and drone attacks in the war that Russia launched nearly four years ago.

Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin has reported multiple interceptions since New Year’s Eve without giving further details.

Russia typically reports only how many drones its air defences say they downed, not how many Ukraine launched, and rarely discloses the full extent of damage unless civilians are killed or civilian sites are hit.

The attacks have forced temporary closures at Moscow airports and at scores of other Russian airports for safety reasons, Russia’s aviation watchdog Rosaviatsiya said on Telegram.

The disruption comes during Russia’s extended New Year and Orthodox Christmas break, which this year runs through January 9, when many Russians take vacations and travel domestically and abroad, making it one of the country’s busiest periods for transport and tourism.

According to RIA state news calculations, Russia’s air defences intercepted and destroyed at least 1,548 Ukrainian drones over Russian territory and the Crimean Peninsula over the past week.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 01:55:48 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/NFUTUSDKRNONNLWUHWPTG52U6E.jpg?auth=9fcfacd567354c0812d76cfc44205e646ade0230f9d73ccd5ebf82c5a479e6cb&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump threatens military operation against Colombia, after Venezuela raid</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/trump-says-new-military-operation-focused-colombia-sounds-good-him-2026-01-05/</link><description>ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE, Jan 4 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Sunday threatened military action against Colombia's government, telling reporters that such an operation "sounds good to me."

"Colombia is very sick, too, run by a sick man, who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States, and he's not going to be doing it very long," Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One, in an apparent reference to Colombia's President Gustavo Petro.

Asked directly whether the U.S. would pursue a military operation against the country, Trump answered, "It sounds good to me."

"We have never believed that any country can act as the world's police, nor do we accept that any nation can claim to be the world's judge," Wang told his Pakistani counterpart Ishaq Dar during a meeting in Beijing on Sunday, referring to "sudden developments in Venezuela" without directly mentioning the U.S.

"The sovereignty and security of all countries should be fully protected under international law," China's top diplomat added, in his first remarks since images of the 63-year-old Maduro blindfolded and handcuffed on Saturday stunned Venezuelans.

Maduro is in a New York detention centre awaiting a Monday court appearance on drug charges.

Beijing has ambition to become a diplomatic heavyweight, a goal it articulated most clearly after brokering a surprise rapprochement between Saudi Arabia and Iran in 2023, pledging to "play a constructive role in global hotspot issues ." Analysts say Beijing's success in going toe-to-toe with the U.S. in trade negotiations has only reinforced China's confidence.

However, President Donald Trump's assertion that the U.S. will oversee Venezuela's government for the time being poses a stern test to the "all-weather comprehensive strategic partnership" Beijing and Caracas struck in 2023, marking almost 50 years of diplomatic ties.

"It was a big blow to China, we wanted to look like a dependable friend to Venezuela," said a Chinese government official briefed on a meeting between Maduro and China's special representative for Latin American and Caribbean affairs, Qiu Xiaoqi, hours before his capture.

Maduro's son visited China's top-ranking Peking University in 2024, where he enrolled in 2016, they said, adding they were unsure whether he would return despite years of diplomatic engagement with Caracas around his education and ties to China.

The world's second-largest economy has provided Venezuela with an economic lifeline since the U.S. and its allies ramped up sanctions in 2017, purchasing roughly $1.6 billion worth of goods in 2024, the most recent full-year data available.

Almost half of China's purchases were crude oil, customs data shows, while its state-owned oil giants had invested around $4.6 billion in Venezuela by 2018, according to data from the American Enterprise Institute think tank, which tracks Chinese overseas corporate investment.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 01:56:03 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/32BD2RSD2BC4ZLMIIGFCTJX7FE.JPG?auth=93c1a1ccbbead0437d7bb72525a5feb5327ea4c39a8bf15f409c79846ff7b9d6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Legality of US capture of Venezuela's Maduro in focus at United Nations</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/legality-us-capture-venezuelas-maduro-focus-united-nations-2026-01-04/</link><description>UNITED NATIONS, Jan 4 (Reuters) - The legality of the U.S. capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro will be under the spotlight at the United Nations on Monday, but Washington is unlikely to face strong criticism from allies over its military operation in the Latin American state.

The 15-member U.N. Security Council will meet on Monday after U.S. Special Forces seized Maduro in an operation on Saturday that knocked out power in parts of Caracas and struck military installations. Venezuelan authorities also said it was deadly . Maduro is now in detention in New York awaiting a court appearance on Monday on drug charges.

Russia, China and other Venezuelan allies have accused the United States of violating international law, but U.S. allies - many of whom opposed Maduro - have been less vocal about any concerns over the use of military force.

"Judging by the reactions from European leaders to date, I suspect that U.S. allies will equivocate exquisitely in the Security Council," said Richard Gowan, director of global issues and institutions at the International Crisis Group, a think-tank.

U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres views the U.S. operation as setting "a dangerous precedent," his spokesperson said on Saturday. Many legal experts also say the U.S. action was illegal, although Washington will be able to block any attempts by the U.N. Security Council to hold it accountable.

In the wake of the U.S. operation, European states have largely called for international law to be respected without specifically calling out Washington, though French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said the U.S. had violated "the principle of not resorting to force, that underpins international law."

The U.N. Charter states that members "shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state." There are currently 193 members of the United Nations.

U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Mike Waltz on Sunday cited Article 51 of the U.N. Charter, which says that nothing "shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defense if an armed attack occurs against a member of the United Nations."

"In this case, you have a drug kingpin, an illegitimate leader indicted in the United States, coordinating with the likes of China, Russia, Iran, terrorist groups like Hezbollah, pumping drugs, thugs, and weapons into the United States of America, threatening to invade its neighbors," he told Fox News.

However, legal experts say the U.S. operation was illegal because it lacked U.N. Security Council authorization, did not have Venezuelan consent, and does not constitute self-defense against an armed attack.

"The action violated international law," said Tom Dannenbaum, a professor at Stanford Law School. "Serious legal objections to Maduro's regime do not eliminate the need for a legal basis to use military force in Venezuela."

But Washington cannot be held accountable for any violation by the U.N. Security Council, which is charged with maintaining international peace and security. The U.S. wields a veto - along with Russia, China, Britain and France - so can block action.

Maduro was indicted in 2020 on U.S. charges including narco-terrorism conspiracy. He has always denied any criminal involvement.

"Even if Maduro were to be responsible for the smuggling of some drugs into the U.S., such smuggling of drugs does not constitute an armed attack and does not authorize the U.S. to use force in self-defense," said Milena Sterio, a professor at Cleveland State University College of Law.

She also said Washington "cannot exercise extra-territorial jurisdiction to arrest individuals anywhere it pleases."

Adil Haque, a professor at Rutgers Law School, also said the U.S. capture of Maduro "was an illegal infringement of the inviolability and immunity of a sitting Head of State, who may lack democratic legitimacy but was clearly effectively discharging his official functions on behalf of his State."</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 01:56:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/GOVVZYXT6ZJTJDRTRU3PKOBWMQ.jpg?auth=08e2188054badd7bdcc2bc92209bb2710d9ee40cc988135d05121f0d759a1861&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russian politicians say Trump strike on Venezuela unlawful, destabilising</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/russian-politicians-say-trump-strike-venezuela-unlawful-destabilising-2026-01-05/</link><description>MOSCOW, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Russia’s Security Council deputy chairman Dmitry Medvedev and a senior lawmaker said over the weekend that U.S. President Donald Trump’s actions in Venezuela were unlawful and destabilising, while portraying them as a blunt assertion of U.S. interests.

The comments followed Trump’s statement that the United States struck Venezuela and that Maduro and his wife were captured and taken out of the country, prompting international reaction and calls for urgent UN discussions.

Medvedev told TASS on Sunday that Trump’s behaviour was illegal but internally coherent because it pursued U.S. interests.

“It must be acknowledged that, despite the obvious unlawfulness of Trump’s behaviour, one cannot deny a certain consistency in his actions. He and his team defend their country’s national interests quite harshly,” Medvedev was quoted as saying.

Medvedev said Latin America was viewed as the United States’ “backyard” and suggested Trump was seeking leverage over Venezuela’s oil supplies.

“Uncle Sam’s main motivation has always been simple: other people’s supplies,” Medvedev said, according to TASS.

He added that if such an operation were carried out against a stronger country, it would be seen as an act of war.

Alexei Pushkov, a Russian senator who chairs a Federation Council commission on information policy, said the operation and Trump’s rhetoric might prove less effective than their dramatic impact.

“One cannot deny that Trump’s actions and especially his statements are striking. Their effectiveness is another matter,” Pushkov said on the Telegram messaging app.

He compared the episode to what he called premature U.S. declarations of victory in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya, arguing that initial “triumphs” later turned into defeat or prolonged crises.

Pushkov said the United States, by attacking Venezuela and seizing its president, had violated norms and “alarmed the whole world,” returning it to “the wild imperialism of the 19th century” and reviving a Wild West right to act at will in the Western Hemisphere.

“But what will the final result be? Will this ‘triumph’ not turn into a catastrophe?” he said.

Russia has long maintained close ties with Venezuela, spanning energy cooperation, military links and high-level political contacts, and Moscow has backed Caracas diplomatically for years as both countries seek to deepen trade and investment.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 01:57:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/I2ZPZCR66FN4XGGNEHG75FG334.jpg?auth=5d4f73b4177f1fbba2b0bbc0f2af0cba5ef37b6dec21be0855a6c455c9c8898f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Anne Frank's step-sister and Auschwitz survivor Eva Schloss dies at 96</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260105-anne-frank-holocaust-eva-schloss</link><description>Eva Schloss, the Auschwitz survivor who dedicated decades to educating people on the Holocaust and was the step-sister of diarist Anne Frank, has died aged 96, her foundation announced Sunday.

Her family expressed their "great sadness" at the loss of this "remarkable woman: an Auschwitz survivor, a devoted Holocaust educator, tireless in her work for remembrance, understanding and peace".

King Charles III , who danced with Schloss at an event in London in 2022, and his wife Camilla, patron of her Anne Frank Trust UK foundation, said they were "greatly saddened".

"We are both privileged and proud to have known her and we admired her deeply," the royal couple said in a statement.

Schloss co-founded the organisation in 1990 to pass on the memory of the Holocaust to young people and combat prejudice.

Born Eva Geiringer in Austria in 1929, she was a child when the Nazis annexed her country.

Her Jewish family first fled to Belgium and then to Amsterdam, in the Netherlands, where they settled opposite Frank's house.

Frank's accounts of the Holocaust in the diary have become a symbol of the suffering inflicted by the Nazis during World War II.

The two girls were the same age and often played together.

But from 1942 onwards, both families had to go into hiding.

Eva, her mother Elfriede, her father Erich and her brother Heinz were betrayed two years later by a Nazi sympathiser. They were arrested on her fifteenth birthday and sent to the Auschwitz extermination camp in May 1944.

Eva, who was able to stay in touch with her mother, was separated from her father and brother, who both died in the camps.

Shortly after their liberation in 1945, she moved to London to study and met her future husband, Zvi Schloss.

Her mother returned to Amsterdam and married Frank's father, Otto, who was also a widower upon his return from Auschwitz.

Eva and Zvi Schloss, who had three daughters, obtained British citizenship. Eva Schloss also regained her Austrian citizenship in 2021, aged 92.

She wrote several books and recounted her experiences around the world, and was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) by the king in 2013, when he was Prince of Wales.

Anne Frank died in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in 1945.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 01:58:08 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/d6ecdde0-e9ba-11f0-87e8-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/992544351f2ce952df1525c0fa7df51fab758340.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Donald Trump ramps up pressure on Iran after fresh clashes erupt</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260105-donald-trump-iran-clashes</link><description>New deadly clashes between protesters and security forces erupted in Iran, rights groups and local media said Sunday, as demonstrations first sparked by anger over the rising cost of living entered a second week.

At least 12 people, including members of the security forces, have been killed since the protests kicked off with a shopkeepers' strike in Tehran on December 28, according to a toll based on official reports.

Overnight, protests featuring slogans criticising the Islamic republic's clerical authorities were reported in Tehran, Shiraz in the south, and in areas of western Iran where the movement has been concentrated, according to the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) monitor.

The demonstrations are the most significant in Iran since a 2022-2023 movement sparked by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, who had been arrested for allegedly violating Iran's strict dress code for women.

The latest protests have been concentrated in parts of the west with large populations of the Kurdish and Lor minorities, and have yet to reach the scale of the 2022-2023 movement, let alone the mass street demonstrations that followed disputed 2009 presidential elections.

But they do present a new challenge for supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei -- 86, and in power since 1989 -- coming on the heels of a 12-day war with Israel in June that saw nuclear infrastructure damaged and key members of the security elite killed.

With the government under pressure to show a response to the economic pain, spokeswoman Fatemeh Mohajerani told state TV on Sunday that citizens would receive a monthly allowance equivalent to $7 for the next four months.

President Donald Trump warned Sunday that Iran would get "hit very hard" by the United States if more protesters die.

"We're watching it very closely. If they start killing people like they have in the past, I think they're going to get hit very hard by the United States," Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One -- a day after the American operation to capture Tehran's ally Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.

The protests have taken place in 23 out of Iran's 31 provinces and affected, to varying degrees, at least 40 different cities, most of them small and medium-sized, according to an AFP tally based on official announcements and media reports.

The Norway-based Hengaw rights group said that Revolutionary Guards opened fire on protesters in the Malekshahi county of the western Ilam province on Saturday, killing four members of Iran's Kurdish minority.

The group said it was checking reports that two other people had been killed, adding dozens more were wounded. It also accused the authorities of raiding the main hospital in the city of Ilam to seize the bodies of the protesters.

The Iran Human Rights NGO, also based in Norway, gave an identical toll of four dead, as well as 30 wounded, after "security forces attacked the protests" in Malekshahi.

It said funerals for the dead took place on Sunday with mourners chanting slogans against the government and Khamenei.

Both organisations posted footage of what appeared to be bloodied corpses on the ground, in videos verified by AFP.

Iranian media said a member of the security forces was killed in a clash with "rioters" who attempted to storm a police office, with "two assailants" killed.

In Tehran, sporadic demonstrations on Saturday night were reported in districts in the east, west and south, the Fars news agency said.

On Sunday, the vast majority of shops were open in the capital, although the streets appeared less crowded than usual, with riot police and security forces deployed at major intersections, AFP observed.

Images verified by AFP showed Iranian security forces using tear gas to disperse a group of protesters who gathered in central Tehran during the day on Sunday.

HRANA said that over the last week at least 582 people have been arrested.

Hengaw said almost all of those killed were from ethnic minorities, chiefly Kurds and Lors.

Abroad, several hundred people took part in two separate rallies in Paris on Sunday to support the protesters, following similar actions in London a day earlier, AFP correspondents said.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 03:56:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/8f5d0f02-e9e4-11f0-9382-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26004477898342.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>North Korea's Kim oversees hypersonic missile test, warns of 'geopolitical crisis'</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260105-north-korea-hypersonic-missiles-nuclear-forces</link><description>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un oversaw the firing of "cutting-edge" hypersonic missiles to ready Pyongyang's nuclear forces for war, state media reported Monday, saying "geopolitical crisis" made the test even more urgent in a clear nod to this weekend's US attack on Venezuela.

Seoul and Tokyo said Sunday they had detected the launch from near Pyongyang of two ballistic missiles -- the country's first test of the year just hours before South Korean leader Lee Jae Myung headed to Beijing for a summit.

Lee has said he hopes to use his visit to harness China's clout over North Korea to improve Seoul's ties with Pyongyang.

On Monday, the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) quoted Kim as saying the test showed "the readiness of the DPRK's nuclear forces", referring to North Korea by its official name.

"Important achievements have been recently made in putting our nuclear forces on a practical basis and preparing them for an actual war," Kim was quoted as saying by KCNA.

Pyongyang's activity, he said, was "aimed at gradually putting the nuclear war deterrent on a high-developed basis".

Photos shared by state media showed Kim puffing on a cigarette accompanied by top officials as a missile soars into the early morning sky.

"Why it is necessary is exemplified by the recent geopolitical crisis and complicated international events," Kim was quoted as saying, a clear reference to Washington's weekend capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.

The operation represents a nightmare scenario for North Korea's leadership, which has long feared a so-called "decapitation strike" of that kind and accused Washington of seeking to remove it from power.

Pyongyang condemned it Sunday as a "serious encroachment of sovereignty" that "clearly confirms once again the rogue and brutal nature of the US".

Pyongyang has for decades justified its nuclear and missile programmes as a deterrent against alleged regime change efforts by Washington.

Sunday's launch "can be interpreted as a message signalling that Pyongyang possesses a war deterrent and nuclear capabilities, unlike Venezuela," Hong Min, an analyst at the Seoul-based Korea Institute for National Unification, told AFP.

He pointed to state media reports Sunday that Kim had visited a facility involved in making tactical guided weapons.

This, he said, "demonstrated a capability to launch more precise strikes than existing multiple rocket launchers from various platforms, including air and ground".

North Korea's new weapon system using hypersonic missiles was first tested in October.

Hypersonic missiles travel at more than five times the speed of sound and can manoeuvre mid-flight, making them harder to track and intercept.

They have been deployed to deadly effect last year on cities in Ukraine by Russia, with whom North Korea has deepened ties in recent years, and by Iran against Israel.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 03:56:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/3a09e8be-e9cf-11f0-8f03-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/a037a233acfd7554f2cba841f29e752f74f2044f.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuela's Maduro to appear in US court, Trump says further strikes possible</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/venezuelas-maduro-appear-us-court-trump-says-further-strikes-possible-2026-01-05/</link><description>Jan 5 (Reuters) - Deposed Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro was due to appear in a U.S. court on Monday after his weekend capture by American forces, with U.S. President Donald Trump leaving open the possibility of another incursion if the United States doesn't get its way with Venezuela's interim government.

Trump told reporters on Sunday that he could order another strike if Venezuela does not cooperate with U.S. efforts to open up its oil industry and stop drug trafficking. He also threatened military action in Colombia and Mexico and said Cuba's communist regime "looks like it's ready to fall" on its own.

The Colombian and Mexican embassies in Washington did not immediately return requests for comment.

The remarks by Trump came on the eve of Maduro's scheduled appearance on Monday before a federal judge in New York. Maduro was detained during a military raid on Saturday in Caracas that has plunged Venezuela into uncertainty.

Trump administration officials have portrayed the seizure as a law-enforcement action to hold Maduro accountable for criminal charges filed in 2020 that accuse him of narco-terrorism conspiracy. But Trump himself has said other factors were at play, saying the raid was prompted in part by an influx of Venezuelan immigrants to the United States and the country's decision to nationalize U.S. oil interests decades ago.

"We're taking back what they stole," he said aboard Air Force One as he returned on Sunday to Washington from Florida.

Oil companies will return to Venezuela and rebuild the country's petroleum industry, Trump said. "They're going to spend billions of dollars and they're going to take the oil out of the ground," he said.

Meanwhile, Maduro's government remains in power in Caracas, and top officials have remained defiant.

Vice President Delcy Rodriguez, who has taken over as interim leader, has said Maduro remains president and has contradicted Trump's claim that she is willing to work with the United States. Rodriguez, who also serves as oil minister, has long been considered the most pragmatic member of Maduro's inner circle.

Maduro, 63, faces charges that accuse him of providing support to major drug trafficking groups, such as the Sinaloa Cartel and the Tren de Aragua gang.

Prosecutors say he directed cocaine trafficking routes, used the military to protect shipments, sheltered violent trafficking groups and used presidential facilities to move drugs. The charges, first filed in 2020, were updated on Saturday to include his wife, Cilia Flores, who is accused of ordering kidnappings and murders.

Maduro has denied wrongdoing, and it could be several months before he stands trial.

The United States has deemed Maduro an illegitimate dictator since he declared victory in a 2018 election marred by allegations of massive irregularities . But Trump has dismissed the idea of opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Corina Machado taking over, saying she lacks support.

Machado was banned from the 2024 election but has said her ally Edmundo Gonzalez has a mandate to take the presidency and some international observers say he overwhelmingly won that vote.

On Sunday, Trump said his administration will try to work with Venezuela's current government to clamp down on drug trafficking and open up its oil industry, rather than pushing for elections to install new leaders.

Though Maduro has few allies on the world stage, many countries have questioned the legality of seizing a foreign head of state and called on the U.S. to respect international law. The U.N. Security Council planned to meet on Monday to discuss the U.S. attack, which Secretary-General Antonio Guterres described as a dangerous precedent.

The attack has also raised questions in Washington, where opposition Democrats say they were misled by the administration about its Venezuela policy. Secretary of State Marco Rubio was due to brief top lawmakers on Capitol Hill later on Monday.

Once one of the most prosperous nations in Latin America, Venezuela's economy has collapsed over the past 20 years, sending about one in five Venezuelans abroad in one of the world's biggest exoduses , opens new tab . The removal of Maduro, a former bus driver who led Venezuela for more than 12 years after the death of strongman Hugo Chavez, could lead to even more destabilization in the nation of 28 million people.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 04:58:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/AWR4B7DQ7VDLBGF6Z54UHWWRYM.JPG?auth=61a8758396619c39aa387dbd721b3488e6800288dff076b08ea61863ee498473&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukraine says Russian strike on Kyiv leaves first civilians dead this year</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-military-says-russian-strike-kyiv-kills-civilian-2026-01-05/</link><description>KYIV, Jan 5 (Reuters) - An overnight Russian air attack on Kyiv and its region killed two people, Ukraine’s authorities said on Monday, in what appeared to be the first reported deaths in Russian strikes on the Ukrainian capital this year.

Ukraine’s State Emergency Service said the strike set ablaze a medical facility in the Obolonskyi district in Kyiv's northern sector, where an inpatient ward was operating. After the fire was extinguished, a body was found inside, the service added.

A woman was also injured and 25 people were evacuated, the service said on the Telegram messaging app.

It released a nighttime photo showing emergency responders carrying a body on a stretcher past an ambulance outside a building, with snow on the ground.

Russia also hit towns and villages across the Kyiv region, damaging homes and critical infrastructure, and killing a civilian in the Fastiv district, just southwest of the capital, the region’s governor Mykola Kalashnyk said on Telegram.

Small parts of the region were left without power, Kalashnyk added.

There was no immediate comment from Russia. Both sides deny targeting civilians in their attacks.

Russia has repeatedly attacked Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities with missiles and drones during the nearly four-year-old war , saying it strikes military targets, while Ukraine says civilians and civilian infrastructure are often hit.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 04:59:21 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Cuba says 32 of its citizens killed in Maduro extraction</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/cuba-says-32-its-citizens-killed-maduro-extraction-2026-01-05/</link><description>HAVANA, Jan 4 (Reuters) - The Cuban government said on Sunday that 32 of its citizens were killed during the U.S. raid on Venezuela to extract President Nicolas Maduro for prosecution in the United States.

Havana said there would be two days of mourning on January 5 and 6 in honor of those killed and said funeral arrangements would be announced.

The Cuban government statement gave few details, but said all the dead were members of the Cuban armed forces and intelligence agencies.

"True to their responsibilities concerning security and defense, our compatriots fulfilled their duty with dignity and heroism and fell, after fierce resistance, in direct combat against the attackers or as a result of bombings on the facilities," the statement said.

Cuba has provided some security for Maduro since he came to power. It was not clear how many Cubans were guarding the Venezuelan president when they died and how many may have perished elsewhere.

Maduro, 63, and his wife Cilia Flores were seized by U.S. forces in the Venezuela capital Caracas on Saturday and flown to the United States. Maduro is being held in a New York detention center awaiting a Monday court appearance on drug charges.

Maduro was indicted in 2020 on U.S. charges including narco-terrorism conspiracy.

Xi did not elaborate on what cooperation China was interested to further in his opening remarks at their meeting at the Great Hall of the People, but emphasised mutual respect and achieving win-win outcomes as "valuable experiences for the long-term, stable development of China-Ireland ties".

China has shown growing interest in engaging with European Union countries individually as ties with Brussels remain frosty.

Martin, the first Irish Taoiseach to visit Beijing in 14 years, said that Ireland acknowledged China's "indispensable role" in the world, highlighting its role in peacekeeping efforts.

He also stressed Ireland's stance on open trade, a topic that could feature in discussions between the leaders.

"We believe it's fundamental that we try and work towards open trade, recognising the interdependence of the world," the taoiseach said of trade ties with China.

Martin's trip comes two weeks after Beijing announced tariffs on EU dairy products, imposing provisional duties of up to 42.7%, the latest in a series of measures against EU exports widely seen as retaliation for the bloc's electric vehicle tariffs.

Ireland is among Europe's largest exporters of dairy products, shipping overseas more than 90% of the output from its family farms in trade worth 6 billion euros ($7.02 billion). It was among the EU nations that voted in favour of tariffs on Chinese EVs.

Taiwan has in recent years complained about what it sees as China's "hybrid warfare" - from daily military drills near the island to disinformation campaigns and cyberattacks - as Beijing ramps up military and political pressure on the democratically governed island to force Taipei to accept its claims of sovereignty.

The average number of daily attacks in 2025 jumped 113% from 2023 when the bureau first began publishing such data, with sectors such as energy, emergency rescue and hospitals seeing the sharpest year‑on‑year increases, according to a report by the National Security Bureau on Sunday.

"Such a trend indicates a deliberate attempt by China to compromise Taiwan’s crucial infrastructure comprehensively and to disrupt or paralyse Taiwanese government and social functions," the report said.

The bureau said China's "cyber army" timed operations to coincide with military and political coercion. For example, China launched 40 "joint combat readiness patrols" by sending military planes and ships close to Taiwan and cyberattacks escalated on 23 of those occasions.

China also ramped up hacking activities during politically sensitive moments such as when President Lai Ching-te marked his first year in office with a speech in May and when Vice President Hsiao Bi-khim spoke at a meeting with lawmakers at the European Parliament in November.

"China’s moves align with its strategic need to employ hybrid threats against Taiwan during both peacetime and wartime," the report said.

China's Taiwan Affairs Office did not respond to a request for comment.

China routinely denies being involved in hacking attacks.

Beijing claims Taiwan as its own territory and has not ruled out the use of force to bring the island under its control. Taipei strongly objects to China's sovereignty claims and says only Taiwan's people can decide their future.

The Taiwanese report said the Chinese attacks included distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks designed to disrupt Taiwan's daily life as well as man-in-the-middle attacks to steal information and penetrate the island's telecommunications networks.

Science parks that anchor Taiwan's semiconductor industry—home to firms such as TSMC (2330.TW) , opens new tab —have also been prime targets, with attackers employing a range of techniques to steal advanced technologies.

The move was "an attempt to support China's self-reliance in technology and economic development and prevent China from being put in a disadvantaged position in the U.S.-China technology competition," the report said.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 05:00:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/RXWNWIVM7NLNPN74WQ52TWZK3I.jpg?auth=84a63adeea274f04f757bacb994fce6ff42268aa220a403ef818b1416eb02bcd&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Live: Maduro to make first US court appearance in New York amid Federal indictment</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260105-live-maduro-us-court-new-york-federal-indictment</link><description>Deposed Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro was due to appear in a US court on Monday after his

Maduro, 63, and his wife, Cilia Flores, have been jailed in Brooklyn after U.S. forces seized them from Caracas in a surprise weekend raid , opens new tab .

They are both set to appear at the hearing scheduled for 12:00 p.m. EST (1700 GMT ) before U.S. District Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein. It is unclear if either had obtained lawyers, or if they would enter pleas.

The U.S. has deemed Maduro an illegitimate dictator since he declared victory in a 2018 election marred by allegations of massive irregularities . His capture marks Washington's most controversial intervention in Latin America since the invasion of Panama 37 years ago.

Prosecutors say Maduro is the kingpin of a cartel of Venezuelan political and military officials who have conspired for decades with drug trafficking groups and U.S.-designated terrorist organizations to flood the U.S. with thousands of tons of cocaine.

Maduro was first indicted in 2020 as part of a long-running narcotics trafficking case against current and former Venezuelan officials and Colombian guerrillas.

In a new indictment unsealed Saturday, prosecutors allege that Maduro personally oversaw a state-sponsored cocaine trafficking network that partnered with some of the world's most violent and prolific drug trafficking groups, including Mexico’s Sinaloa and Zetas cartels, the Colombian paramilitary group FARC and the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.

"As Venezuela's President and now de-facto ruler, Maduro allows cocaine-fueled corruption to flourish for his own benefit, for the benefit of members of his ruling regime, and for the benefit of his family members," according to the indictment filed by prosecutors from the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Southern District of New York.

Maduro is charged with narco-terrorism, cocaine importation conspiracy, possession of machine guns and destructive devices, and conspiracy to possess machine guns and destructive devices. He faces decades to life in prison on each count if convicted.

Prosecutors say Maduro has been involved in drug trafficking from the time of his election to Venezuela's National Assembly in 2000 to his tenure as foreign minister from 2006 to 2013 and ever since his selection as the late president Hugo Chavez's successor in 2013.

The indictment says that while serving as foreign minister, Maduro sold diplomatic passports to known drug traffickers and personally arranged diplomatic cover for flights transporting drug proceeds from Mexico to Venezuela.

From 2004 to 2015, prosecutors say Maduro and his wife used state-sponsored criminal gangs to traffic cocaine that had been seized by Venezuelan authorities and ordered kidnappings, beatings and murders to protect their operations and collect debts.

Prosecutors say that as president, Maduro directed cocaine trafficking routes, used the military to protect shipments, sheltered violent trafficking groups and used presidential facilities to move drugs.

The indictment cites an example from months after Maduro's swearing in April 2013, when he allegedly directed top co-conspirators to find a new smuggling route to replace one uncovered by French authorities. Maduro also authorized the arrests of low-level military officials to deflect blame, prosecutors say.

Legal experts said prosecutors will need to show evidence of Maduro's direct involvement in drug trafficking to secure a conviction, which could prove difficult if he insulated himself from decision making.

Maduro ruled Venezuela with a heavy hand for more than 12 years, presiding over deep economic and social crises and resisting pressure from domestic opponents and foreign governments for political change.

Maduro’s capture followed a monthslong pressure campaign by Trump, who authorized U.S. forces to seize ships suspected of carrying sanctioned Venezuelan oil and carry out missile strikes on small boats said to be ferrying drugs.

Experts in international law have questioned the legality of the raid, with some condemning Trump's actions as a repudiation of a rules-based international order.

The U.N. Security Council planned to meet on Monday to discuss the U.S. attack, which Secretary-General Antonio Guterres described as a dangerous precedent. Russia and China, both major backers of Venezuela, have criticized the U.S.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 07:29:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4XAVTX3OYBKOZGKBWMVOFAYSBY.jpg?auth=faac4c90cdec96329e0c503e13c377435a27aea53cf2d2c254a20e592311ccab&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Amsterdam airport scraps 450 flights due to snow and ice, ANP reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/amsterdam-airport-scraps-450-flights-due-snow-ice-anp-reports-2026-01-05/</link><description>AMSTERDAM, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Amsterdam's Schiphol airport cancelled 450 flights on Monday morning due to snow and icy weather and expected that number to rise throughout the day, Dutch news agency ANP reported citing the airport.

She said that Venezuela "aspires to live without external threats" and that she wanted to prioritise moving towards balanced and respectful relations with the United States.

Here is the text of the statement:

"A message from Venezuela to the world, and to the United States:

"Venezuela reaffirms its commitment to peace and peaceful coexistence. Our country aspires to live without external threats, in an environment of respect and international cooperation. We believe that global peace is built by first guaranteeing peace within each nation.

"We prioritise moving towards balanced and respectful international relations between the United States and Venezuela, and between Venezuela and other countries in the region, premised on sovereign equality and non-interference. These principles guide our diplomacy with the rest of the world.

"We invite the US government to collaborate with us on an agenda of cooperation oriented towards shared development within the framework of international law to strengthen lasting community coexistence.

"President Donald Trump, our peoples and our region deserve peace and dialogue, not war. This has always been President Nicolás Maduro's message, and it is the message of all of Venezuela right now. This is the Venezuela I believe in and have dedicated my life to. I dream of a Venezuela where all good Venezuelans can come together.

"Venezuela has the right to peace, development, sovereignty and a future."

In a speech to civil servants, Anwar said his administration will table a parliamentary bill to limit the tenure of prime ministers to a maximum of 10 years, a measure that was part of his ruling coalition's election pledges in 2022.

"Everyone has a term limit. If given enough time to deliver, it is better for us to hand over to the next generation," Anwar said.

He said a bill to separate the attorney-general's role as the government's top legal adviser from the function of leading public prosecutor will also be tabled when parliament reconvenes for its first sitting of the year this month.

The independence of Malaysia's attorneys-general has often been questioned as they are appointed by the prime minister, prompting concerns about political interference in the judicial process.

The government also aims to introduce an ombudsman law to strengthen transparency in the public sector and provide the public with a formal channel to raise governance complaints, Anwar said.

A freedom of information law has also been proposed to prevent abuse of power in government projects, he added.

Anwar took office in 2022 on an anti-corruption platform but has faced accusations of backsliding on promised reforms , and his pledge to crack down on graft has also come under intense scrutiny .

The premier has said the government has been working hard to address governance issues and eliminate graft, but he has acknowledged the challenge of stamping out systemic corruption.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 07:51:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/6YGFTS65MRJWREI74CFONCCKBU.jpg?auth=34fc796537aa8acf1d01bf268c8b3652c4b0f0029b9ed1d01cde13f65f34069d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>France reiterates its support of Denmark and Greenland sovereignty after renewed Trump threats</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/france-reiterates-its-support-denmark-greenland-sovereignty-after-renewed-trump-2026-01-05/</link><description>PARIS, Jan 5 (Reuters) - France reiterated on Monday its support of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Denmark and Greenland following renewed threats by U.S. President Donald Trump to take over Greenland.

The Alpine getaway of Crans-Montana in the canton of Valais united in mourning on Sunday with condolences coming in from leaders ranging from Pope Leo to Chinese President Xi Jinping.

Prosecutors said the fire that spread rapidly in the early hours of January 1 was likely caused by sparkling candles igniting the ceiling of the bar's basement.

Authorities are investigating the two people who ran the bar on suspicion of crimes including homicide by negligence. On Sunday, police said circumstances did not currently merit them being put under arrest and they did not see a flight risk.

On Monday morning, Swiss newspaper Blick said anger over the case was growing.

"Why are the couple running the bar free?" the paper said on its front page, pasted over a photo of mourners and media gathered around the huge pile of flowers left in front of the "Le Constellation" bar.

The youngest victims of the blaze, which also injured well over 100 people, were only 14 years old, and the dead were from all around Europe, including several from France and Italy. Swiss authorities have not named the victims.

Italian Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini said in a social media post that "in civilized Switzerland, the prison gates will have to open for quite a few people".

Salvini said there had been a failure to ensure the bar's basement was safe, questioning the emergency systems and whether there had been enough inspections.

Aika Chappaz, a local resident who took part in a silent procession through the town on Sunday, said justice must be done for the sake of future generations.

"It's crucial that such a tragedy never happens again. And the investigation must be thorough, because it's so unbelievable," she said.

Tages-Anzeiger, another leading Swiss newspaper, said questions must be answered about the age checks at the bar, the soundproofing material used in the basement and the standards governing use of the so-called fountain candles.

One of the bar's two operators, Jacques Moretti , told Swiss media that Le Constellation had been checked three times in 10 years and that everything was done according to the rules.

Valais authorities say investigators were checking if the bar had undergone its annual building inspections, but that the town had not raised concerns or reported defects to the canton.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 09:33:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ROP546HFMRLUTHIBKPGVY7OH6A.jpg?auth=f794c33f0fef8618d75690e280a8211ccd657fd95e6d458e6d7bd829a3e735bd&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China, Pakistan reaffirm ties as US outreach to Islamabad deepens</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-pakistan-reaffirm-ties-us-outreach-islamabad-deepens-2026-01-05/</link><description>BEIJING, Jan 5 (Reuters) - China and Pakistan pledged on Monday to further deepen ties and expand cooperation, reaffirming to each other their historically "ironclad" friendship as signs of rapprochement between Islamabad and Washington grow.

Pakistan is one of China's closest partners, diplomatically supporting Beijing on a wide range of internationally sensitive issues ranging from the status of Taiwan to Xinjiang, Tibet, Hong Kong and the South China Sea.

In exchange, Beijing has poured billions of dollars into the South Asian country through the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) - a flagship project under China's Belt and Road trade and infrastructure initiative.

But repeated Islamist militant attacks on Chinese nationals working on the CPEC and other projects in Pakistan have become a major source of tension in recent years.

Adding to the complexity in the Sino-Pakistani relationship, U.S.-Pakistani ties have warmed since President Donald Trump returned to the White House a year ago and landed a diplomatic victory in a region that China regards as within its sphere of influence.

Pakistan even said it would recommend Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize for helping resolve a conflict it had with India.

In a joint statement on Monday, China and Pakistan said they would build an upgraded version of the CPEC, focus on their cooperation on industry, agriculture and mining, and step up collaboration in the financial and banking sector.

China then praised Pakistan's "comprehensive measures" to protect the safety of Chinese personnel and projects, the statement read.

Both sides also called for more "visible and verifiable actions to dismantle and eliminate all terrorist organisations" entrenched in Afghanistan, which shares borders with both Pakistan and China. No details were given.

Pakistan is among an exclusive group of countries that China regards as an "all-weather strategic partner", with close ties dating back decades.

The first premier of the People's Republic of China, Zhou Enlai, once credited Pakistan as a bridge in normalising Beijing's relations with the U.S. in the 1970s, with Islamabad often acting as a channel of communication between Beijing and the outside world at the time.

But warming U.S.-Pakistani ties since 2025 under the Trump administration are creating a counterweight to China's so-called neighbourhood diplomacy with countries with which it shares a border.

Pakistan last March hailed its counter-terrorism cooperation with Washington after the arrest of Mohammad Sharifullah, whom it blames for a 2021 attack on U.S. troops at Kabul airport. Trump publicly thanked Pakistan for its role in the capture.

The Trump administration also released $397 million for a U.S.-backed programme in Pakistan that monitors use of F-16 fighter jets in counter-terrorism efforts despite Washington's global freeze in foreign aid.

On Sunday, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi met with his Pakistani counterpart Ishaq Dar in Beijing to reaffirm the "ironclad friendship and strategic mutual trust" between the two neighbours.

"China and Pakistan will further promote their ironclad ties, deepen mutually beneficial cooperation, and continue to strengthen their strategic cooperation to break new ground," the joint statement said.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 10:26:52 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/AZK5WIMSNFPQRKI5PA6RJHRCAI.jpg?auth=12b1d5eb1426a92584bedc652fc1a993c9f38eee63019f7d403d2edc27535193&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukraine's Zelenskiy appoints Canadian ex-deputy PM as economic adviser</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/ukraines-zelenskiy-appoints-canadian-ex-deputy-pm-economic-adviser-2026-01-05/</link><description>KYIV, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Monday he had appointed Canada's former deputy prime minister Chrystia Freeland as his economic development adviser, citing her experience in attracting investment.

All the identified departed vessels are under U.S. sanctions. A separate group of ships, also under sanctions, left the country in recent days empty after discharging imports or completing domestic transportation trips.

The departures could be a relief for Venezuela's state-run oil company PDVSA, which had accumulated a very large inventory of floating storage amid the U.S. blockade, begun last month, dragging the country's oil exports to a standstill.

Oil exports are Venezuela's main source of revenue. An interim government now led by oil minister and vice president Delcy Rodriguez will need the income to finance spending and secure domestic stability in the country.

A source with knowledge of the departures' paperwork told Reuters that at least four supertankers had been cleared by Venezuelan authorities in recent days to leave Venezuelan waters in dark mode.

It was not immediately clear if the departures happened in defiance of the U.S. measures.

The authorities have detained hundreds of opposition supporters ahead of the January 15 election , which will again pit the 81-year-old Museveni against the 43-year-old pop-star-turned politician Bobi Wine.

"Live broadcasting or streaming of riots, unlawful processions, or violent incidents is prohibited, as it can escalate tensions and spread panic," the Ministry of Information Communication and Technology said in a statement.

Authorities often describe anti-government protests as riots.

The ministry also prohibited the dissemination of any content it described as "inciting, hateful or violent".

More than 50 people were killed before the last election in 2021 in crackdowns by security forces against Wine supporters, who accused Museveni of stealing the election, which he denied.

Critics and rights groups have long accused his government's security forces of torturing and intimidating opponents to maintain his grip on power, allegations he has denied.

Spokespeople for the government and police did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the statement.

Brigitte and her husband, French President Emmanuel Macron, have long faced such falsehoods, including allegations that she was born under the name Jean-Michel Trogneux — the actual name of her older brother.

The couple's 24-year age gap has also drawn criticism and barbs, which they largely ignored for years but have recently begun challenging in court.

Monday's ruling marks a victory for the Macrons as they pursue a separate high-profile U.S. defamation lawsuit against right-wing influencer and podcaster Candace Owens , who has also claimed Brigitte was born male.

The eight men and two women were found guilty of making malicious comments about Brigitte Macron's gender and sexuality, even equating her age difference with her husband to "paedophilia". They were handed sentences of up to eight months with suspended jail time, France Info reported.

Reuters could not immediately contact Brigitte Macron's lawyer or lawyers for those convicted.

Speaking with TF1 on Sunday night, Brigitte Macron defended her fight against cyber bullies, hoping it would be an example to others. She said the online attacks against her appeared endless, and included "people who broke into my tax website and modified my identity."

She also lamented that her attackers ignored the strong evidence of her gender.

"A birth certificate is not nothing. It is a father or a mother who goes to declare their child, who says who he is or who she is," she said. "I want to help adolescents to fight against harassment, and if I do not set an example, it will be difficult."</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 10:52:12 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/EKAJ3GASYVMK5CBOEQW4SMQMLY.jpg?auth=d2a8ebc3fb41edf70ba1c0e78ef5e8eb5c89c2c7d656e1fcaed78c602683361b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Greenland says 'no more fantasies about annexation' after Trump remarks</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/greenland-says-no-more-fantasies-about-annexation-after-trump-remarks-2026-01-05/</link><description>COPENHAGEN, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Greenland's leader declared "enough is enough," and Denmark's allies in Europe affirmed that the Arctic island's future must be determined by its people, rebuffing renewed remarks by U.S. President Donald Trump about acquiring the vast territory.

Trump spoke a day after the U.S. special forces captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro in a stunning raid, with Trump stating that Washington intended to oversee governance of the oil-rich Latin American country. The U.S. operation rekindled concerns in Denmark that Greenland, an autonomous Danish territory, might face a similar scenario.

Trump has repeatedly said he wants to take over Greenland, an ambition first voiced in 2019 during his first presidency. On Sunday, he told The Atlantic magazine in an interview : "We do need Greenland, absolutely. We need it for defence."

Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One early on Monday, Trump said he would revisit the topic in a few weeks.

"Threats, pressure, and talk of annexation have no place between friends," Greenland Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said on Facebook late on Sunday. "Enough is enough. (...) No more fantasies about annexation."

On December 21, Trump appointed Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry as special envoy to Greenland. Landry has publicly expressed support for incorporating Greenland into the U.S.

Greenland's strategic location between Europe and North America makes it a critical site in the U.S. ballistic missile defence system. The island's significant mineral resources also align with Washington's ambition to reduce dependence on Chinese exports.

Support for Denmark and Greenland came swiftly from Nordic and Baltic leaders following Trump's latest remarks.

President Alexander Stubb of Finland posted on X late on Sunday: "No one decides for Greenland and Denmark but Greenland and Denmark themselves. Our Nordic friend Denmark and @Statsmin have our full support."

France also expressed solidarity, saying Greenland belonged to the people of Greenland. President Emmanuel Macron said last June during a visit to Greenland's capital, Nuuk, that the island was threatened by "predatory ambition".

Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said on Sunday that U.S. comments about needing to take over Greenland made " absolutely no sense ".</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 11:20:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/U3HNOL2P7RIURPYNYDWDYROTLM.jpg?auth=d75c8a61112f4ee7361df4689ba4debcd72482e54ed06dc8af258b099f66441a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Turkey to stress 'strategic priority' of Black Sea security at Ukraine meeting in Paris</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/turkey-stress-strategic-priority-black-sea-security-ukraine-meeting-paris-2026-01-05/</link><description>ANKARA, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Turkey's foreign minister will stress the "strategic priority" of maintaining security in the Black Sea at a summit on Ukraine in Paris this week, a Turkish Foreign Ministry source said on Monday.

French President Emmanuel Macron convened a meeting of the " Coalition of the Willing " on Tuesday. The group, led by Britain and France, includes more than 30 nations.

The source said Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan would attend the meeting and would repeat Turkey's position on the need for "results-oriented" steps to end the war.

Talks at the Paris summit would focus on articles in a U.S. draft plan to end the war, as well as security guarantees for Ukraine and the possible role the Coalition can play, the source said.

The person said Fidan would point to "concrete" results from three previous rounds of direct talks between Ukrainian and Russian officials in Istanbul, including prisoner swaps, and repeat Ankara's offer to host a leaders' meeting of the warring sides.

Fidan would "state that Turkey views maintaining security in the Black Sea as a strategic priority and that it is reminding all sides of its position on this matter", the source said.

NATO member Turkey has maintained cordial ties with Moscow and Kyiv throughout the war. It has provided military support to Ukraine but refused to join Western sanctions on Russia.

Ankara has warned both sides against the recent escalation in the Black Sea, which saw Russian and Turkish vessels struck by drones , as well as Ukrainian ports damaged. Turkey has also seen a series of drones enter its airspace in recent weeks, and downed one near its capital.

Erdogan said last week he would discuss various issues with U.S. President Donald Trump in a phone call on Monday, including matters related to the Russia-Ukraine war.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 11:20:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/GDU2X4RJN5PO7KZKAFYNLQINFM.jpg?auth=07653c7a393e4164dc29196c91d7695bb2897cba59b5b4aea46e703ad9b73b10&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>What are the charges against Venezuela's Nicolas Maduro?</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/what-are-charges-against-venezuelas-nicolas-maduro-2026-01-05/</link><description>Jan 5 (Reuters) - Nicolas Maduro, the president of Venezuela captured in a U.S. military raid, faces criminal charges in Manhattan, where federal prosecutors have targeted him for years.

Here is a recap of the indictment unsealed on Saturday against Maduro, his wife, his son, and other co-defendants.

The indictment , opens new tab alleged Maduro and other Venezuelan leaders have, for more than 25 years, "abused their positions of public trust and corrupted once-legitimate institutions to import tons of cocaine into the United States."

The indictment alleged Maduro and his allies “provided law enforcement cover and logistical support” to major drug trafficking groups, such as the Sinaloa Cartel and Tren de Aragua gang. These criminal organizations sent profits to high-ranking officials who protected them in exchange, the Justice Department said.

Among other specific acts, Maduro is accused of selling Venezuelan diplomatic passports to known drug traffickers and facilitating flights under diplomatic cover to bring drug proceeds back from Mexico to Venezuela.

Maduro was indicted on four counts: narco-terrorism conspiracy, cocaine importation conspiracy, possession of machine guns and destructive devices and conspiracy to possess machine guns and destructive devices.

The case was brought by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, an office within the Justice Department famous for its fierce independence and aggressive prosecutions.

The same prosecutor's office returned an indictment against Maduro in 2020, with the same four charges. The updated indictment made public on Saturday adds some new details and co-defendants, including Maduro's wife, Cilia Flores.

The first lady is accused of ordering kidnappings and murders, as well as accepting bribes in 2007 to arrange a meeting between drug traffickers and the director of Venezuela’s National Anti-Drug Office.

Maduro is expected to make an initial appearance in court on Monday. A judge will likely advise him of the charges against him and ensure he has a defense lawyer.

It could be several months or even more than a year before Maduro stands trial. Prosecutors could eventually offer a plea deal to avoid a trial.

Maduro's case is expected to be overseen by U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein because he was assigned to the 2020 case brought against Maduro.

The 92-year-old jurist who has been skeptical of arguments by U.S. President Donald Trump's administration in other high-profile cases. Earlier this year, Hellerstein rejected efforts to deport alleged Venezuelan gang members under the Alien Enemies Act, saying the wartime law had been improperly invoked by the Trump administration.

As the case unfolds, Maduro is likely to argue to seek dismissal on the grounds that he is immune, or shielded, from criminal prosecution because he is a foreign head of state.

Judges have in some contexts concluded that foreign officials enjoy immunity from legal claims in U.S. courts.

But Maduro faces an uphill battle with this argument because of a historic precedent: the U.S. invasion of Panama in 1989 that ousted the country's leader, Manuel Noriega.

Like Maduro, Noriega was accused of conspiring to smuggle drugs into the U.S., and was captured in a military raid in his home country.

U.S. courts rejected Noriega's immunity argument, showing deference to the U.S. government's assertion that he was not Panama's legitimate leader. Legal experts have said that precedent will likely undermine Maduro's efforts to get charges dismissed.

Maduro is also likely to invoke a legal doctrine that says criminal charges should be dismissed if prosecutors brought them vindictively or selectively. He might also argue that claims against him are time-barred, meaning they are too old to be pursued in court.

Federal conspiracy charges generally have a five-year statute of limitations, meaning charges must be brought within five years of the alleged crime's completion, with some exceptions.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 11:20:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/PEOLZ2BOWNMF7LPCAAE4OJRHYQ.jpg?auth=13ceafbcc26703af0ea318331cee03d1f9472de1ddacb72a57661e425d3dacaa&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>South Korea's Lee seeks to develop strategic cooperative partnership with China</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/south-koreas-lee-seeks-develop-strategic-cooperative-partnership-with-china-2026-01-05/</link><description>SEOUL, Jan 5 (Reuters) - South Korean President Lee Jae Myung told Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday their summit is an important opportunity for full restoration of South Korea-China relations.

Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores face drug trafficking charges in the United States after being captured in a dramatic overnight raid.

They were transported to a U.S. Navy ship, flown to the U.S. and taken Saturday night to the Metropolitan Detention Center, Brooklyn. Both the 63-year old Maduro and his 69-year old wife are due to appear in Manhattan federal court on Monday.

Founded in 1994, MDC Brooklyn holds roughly 1,300 men and women and is currently the only jail for detainees awaiting federal trials in New York City.

Past residents have included everyone from Maxwell and hip-hop mogul Combs to Juan Orlando Hernandez, the former president of Honduras who was convicted of drug trafficking charges before being pardoned in December by President Donald Trump . Luigi Mangione, who pleaded not guilty to killing a UnitedHealth Group executive, is currently housed there awaiting trial.

The jail has been plagued by what inmates and defense lawyers have said are inhumane and unsanitary conditions.

In 2019, some detainees at MDC Brooklyn were left in frigid cells after an electrical fire cut power and heat to the jail in the middle of winter.

In 2024, two men were murdered by fellow inmates using makeshift weapons, according to the Justice Department, prompting a crackdown on violence and contraband smuggling at the facility.

Maxwell, who was housed in MDC Brooklyn before her 2021 conviction for helping Epstein sexually abuse underage girls, complained of raw sewage and vermin feces in her cell.

The U.S. Bureau of Prisons, the division of the Justice Department that operates MDC Brooklyn, did not respond to a request for comment. But the agency said in a September 2025 report that the jail's conditions have improved because of increased staffing and other reforms.

Mitchell Epner, a former federal prosecutor who now practices criminal defense, said all prisoners at MDC Brooklyn face some risk of violence from other inmates. That risk is higher with someone like Maduro who could be targeted by a gang or a prisoner wanting to build a reputation through a "lone-wolf attack," Epner said.

Cameron Lindsay, a former MDC Brooklyn warden who has served an expert witness, said the Bureau of Prisons will likely keep Maduro separated from other inmates and carefully vet the staff who interact with him.

"It's conjecture on my part, but I would expect him to be put in a cell on a floor by himself," Lindsay said. "This is obviously a super sensitive, high-security operation."

Lindsay said Maduro will likely be locked down 23 hours a day, with meals delivered to his cell and one hour allotted for exercise in a small caged area. He likely will have access to a shower three times a week, Lindsay added.

The former warden said Maduro's wife likely would receive the same treatment.

Combs, convicted in July on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution, slept within two feet of other inmates in a dorm-style room during his time at MDC Brooklyn. The bathroom, with no door, was located in the same room.

At one point during Combs's incarceration, guards stopped someone trying to cut him with a makeshift knife, his lawyers said.

There have been some signs of improving conditions at MDC Brooklyn in the last two years.

In 2024, Manhattan-based U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman declined to order a man charged with drug crimes detained pending trial at the MDC, calling the conditions there an "ongoing tragedy."

But in hearing in a different case in May 2025, Furman said conditions had gotten "a lot better" since his 2024 ruling because of improved staffing.

In its September report, the Bureau of Prisons said "there has been a substantial decrease in violence" at MDC Brooklyn, and that the number of inmates dropped from about 1,600 to roughly 1,300.

The same month it issued those statistics, the Justice Department announced criminal charges against 25 people relating to violence and contraband smuggling at MDC Brooklyn.

In one case, a former correctional officer was accused of smuggling in vacuum‑sealed bags of marijuana and cigarettes under his Bureau of Prisons-issued protective vest.

In a different case, an alleged gang member was accused of hiding ceramic scalpels, which can be used as weapons, in a bag of Doritos while in a visiting room at MDC Brooklyn so that he could give them to inmates.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 11:20:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/E77UQ6YNJ5JE3DVOY24XZVHF4Q.jpg?auth=77a6ee4a98469e25a6a5eb88ba012742f9bad851debfe40e16717307d9073de3&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ten people found guilty of cyberbullying France’s First Lady Brigitte Macron</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260105-ten-people-found-guilty-cyberbullying-france-first-lady-brigitte-macron</link><description>A Paris court on Monday found ten people guilty of cyberbullying France’s First Lady Brigitte Macron by spreading false online claims about her gender and sexuality, including allegations she was born a man.

The court convicted all defendants to sentences ranging from a cyberbullying awareness training to 8-month suspended prison sentences.

The court pointed to “particularly degrading, insulting, and malicious” comments referring to false claims regarding alleged trans identity and alleged pedocriminality targeting Brigitte Macron.

The defendants, eight men and two women aged 41 to 65, are accused of having posted “numerous malicious comments” falsely claiming that President Emmanuel Macron ’s wife was born a man and linking their 24-year age gap to paedophilia . Some of the posts were viewed tens of thousands of times.

Brigitte Macron did not attend the two-day trial in October. Speaking on TF1 national television Sunday, she said she launched legal proceedings to “set an example” in the fight against harassment.

Her daughter, Tiphaine Auzière, testified about what she described as the “deterioration” of her mother’s life since the online harassment intensified. “She cannot ignore the horrible things said about her,” Auzière told the court. She said the impact has extended to the entire family, including Macron’s grandchildren.

Defendant Delphine Jegousse, 51, who is known as Amandine Roy and describes herself as a medium and an author, is considered to have played a major role in spreading the rumour after she released a four-hour video on her YouTube channel in 2021. She was given a 6-month prison sentence.

The X account of Aurélien Poirson-Atlan, 41, known as Zoé Sagan on social media, was suspended in 2024 after his name was cited in several judicial investigations. Poirson-Atlan was given an 8-month prison sentence.

Other defendants include an elected official, a teacher and a computer scientist. Several told the court their comments were intended as humor or satire and said they did not understand why they were being prosecuted.

The case follows years of conspiracy theories falsely alleging that Brigitte Macron was born under the name Jean-Michel Trogneux, which is actually the name of her brother. The Macrons have also filed a defamation suit in the United States against conservative influencer Candace Owens.

The Macrons, who have been married since 2007, first met at the high school where he was a student and she was a teacher. Brigitte Macron, 24 years her husband’s senior, was then called Brigitte Auzière, a married mother of three.

The Baltic Sea region is on high alert after a string of power cable, telecom link and gas pipeline outages since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022 , and the NATO military alliance has boosted its presence with frigates, aircraft and naval drones.

The latest cable outage occurred on Friday near Liepaja and investigators on Sunday said they had boarded a ship and initiated criminal proceedings, although they did not name the vessel.

The incident occurred after Finnish police on December 31 seized a cargo vessel en route from Russia to Israel on suspicion of sabotaging an undersea telecoms cable running across the Gulf of Finland to Estonia by dragging its anchor.

MarineTraffic vessel tracking data show four ships crossing the Lithuania-Latvia cable on their way to Liepaja port on January 2, when the damage was first discovered. Three of those ships remained in the port on Monday.

Latvian police said on Monday they had inspected a ship at Liepaja, including its anchor, as well as technical equipment and logs, and that the crew had voluntarily cooperated with the investigation.

"At present, the information obtained in the criminal case does not indicate a connection of the specific ship with the damage to the optical cable," a national police statement said.

Neighbouring Lithuania's National Crisis Management Centre said on Sunday the cable ran from Sventoji in Lithuania to Liepaja, two coastal towns some 65 km (40 miles) apart, and that it was not immediately clear what caused the outage.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 11:42:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>German minister: protection of Greenland will be discussed within NATO if needed</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/german-minister-protection-greenland-will-be-discussed-within-nato-if-needed-2026-01-05/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 5 (Reuters) - German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said on Monday that Greenland belonged to Denmark and that the NATO alliance could discuss strengthening its protection if necessary.

Wadephul was speaking after U.S. President Donald Trump made renewed threats to take over Greenland, a prospect that alarmed NATO allies and has taken on a new urgency after Trump followed through on threats to topple Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro.

Trump has repeatedly said he wants to take over Greenland, an ambition first voiced in 2019 during his first presidency.

On Sunday, he told The Atlantic magazine in an interview: "We do need Greenland, absolutely. We need it for defence."

Speaking to reporters in Lithuania, Wadephul said Germany had questions about Maduro's removal and stressed the Venezuelan people should determine their country's future in free and fair elections, after Trump said the U.S. would run the country.

On Greenland, Wadephul stressed it was part of Denmark.

"And since Denmark is a member of NATO, Greenland will, in principle, also be subject to NATO defence," he said.

"And if there are further requirements to strengthen defence efforts concerning Greenland, then we will have to discuss this within the framework of the alliance."

He did not elaborate on the nature of those discussions.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 11:42:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/MHNUKO63VRONLIKHBE6F7AMXUU.jpg?auth=37df21e2d2632b4f949f90a053b851a78f948af2cb8de3b3f34fefe2172d8be0&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>EU sees opportunity for democratic transition in Venezuela, spokesperson says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/eu-sees-opportunity-democratic-transition-venezuela-spokesperson-says-2026-01-05/</link><description>BRUSSELS, Jan 5 (Reuters) - The capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro by the United States on Saturday creates an opportunity for a democratic transition in the country, a European Commission spokesperson said on Monday.

In the biggest U.S. intervention in Latin America since the 1989 invasion of Panama, Special Forces swooped into Caracas in helicopters over the weekend and apprehended Maduro before taking him to New York to face drugs charges.

U.S. President Donald Trump, Orban's ally, who has exempted Hungary from U.S. sanctions on Russian energy for the 2026 Hungarian election year, has made clear that he wants to share in Venezuela's oil riches.

"What I consider important for Hungary from this is that, together with Venezuela, the United States, by my estimation, will be able to control 40-50% of the world's oil reserves," Orban said at an annual news conference for international media.

"This is a power already capable of significantly influencing the world market price of energy... I see a strong chance that as a result of bringing Venezuela under control, a more favourable global energy situation will emerge for Hungary, and that is good news."

Budapest has angered many fellow members of the European Union and NATO by continuing to import Russian oil and gas. While insisting that this remains necessary, Budapest has also been taking steps to diversify supplies.

A U.S. military operation to capture Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, and Trump's intention to oversee governance of the oil-rich Latin American country, has rekindled concerns in Denmark that Greenland, an autonomous Danish territory, might face a similar scenario.

"Greenland and the Kingdom of Denmark must determine the future of Greenland and nobody else," Starmer told reporters.

When asked in a separate interview about Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen telling Trump to stop threatening Greenland , Starmer said: "I stand with her and she's right about the future of Greenland."

Starmer, who has sought to stay on good terms with Trump and adopted a less publicly critical approach than most other European leaders, was also asked about the raid in Venezuela.

He said it was now up to the U.S. to justify its actions, and that Britain would judge other nations against the benchmark of international law.

Starmer said on Saturday he was not sad that Nicolas Maduro was no longer president of Venezuela, but he wanted this to lead to a more democratic government.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 12:49:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/JXQVY7TNBFNB3H2GZWK66DLW7Y.jpg?auth=7928cd10e46532dc1317718ab534e969837ad752cfbc15725b3e676b5853aa7c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Guinea's top court validates Doumbouya's landslide vote win</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/guineas-top-court-validates-doumbouyas-landslide-vote-win-2026-01-05/</link><description>CONAKRY, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Guinea's Supreme Court has validated results showing a landslide election win for coup leader Mamady Doumbouya, clearing the way for the former special forces commander to serve a seven-year term as president.

The court also said late on Sunday the second-place finisher, Abdoulaye Yero Balde, had dropped his legal challenge to the result, which was condemned by opposition supporters online. Balde did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Doumbouya, thought to be in his early 40s, seized power in Guinea, a West African nation rich in bauxite and iron ore, in a 2021 coup, toppling then-president Alpha Conde. On New Year's Eve, Conde gave a speech dismissing the vote as a "masquerade".

The court's validation, required after every vote, confirmed provisional results that said Doumbouya had secured 86.72% of the vote in the December 28 election against a fragmented field of eight challengers .

In a short speech after the ruling, Doumbouya called on "all the daughters and sons of our nation, both here and in the diaspora, to come together to build a new Guinea".

The results showed Balde, the leader of the opposition Democratic Front of Guinea, came in second with 6.59% of the vote.

He had asked the Supreme Court to annul the provisional results, saying the vote count was not transparent and that representatives of his party had been expelled from some polling stations.

The U.S. embassy in Guinea congratulated Doumbouya and said Washington was looking forward to strengthening ties and advancing economic stability.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 12:49:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/2CTPESHPFJPZFNENN5DPD2PK4Q.jpg?auth=4e47bbf9fd2b21932a332e56a12f852b007ce3a59d82e6ff90b17428c2ff09ef&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UK's Starmer says it is for the US to justify actions in Venezuela</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/uks-starmer-says-it-is-us-justify-its-actions-venezuela-2026-01-05/</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 12:49:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Head of Ukraine's security service Maliuk to be replaced, Zelenskiy says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/head-ukraines-security-service-maliuk-be-replaced-zelenskiy-says-2026-01-05/</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 12:49:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Russian embassy warns citizens against travel to Venezuela, TASS reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/russian-embassy-warns-citizens-against-travel-venezuela-tass-reports-2026-01-05/</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 12:49:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Guinea's top court validates Doumbouya's landslide vote win</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/guineas-top-court-validates-doumbouyas-landslide-vote-win-2026-01-05/</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 12:50:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Russian embassy warns citizens against travel to Venezuela, TASS reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/russian-embassy-warns-citizens-against-travel-venezuela-tass-reports-2026-01-05/</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 12:50:03 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Hungary still aiming for US backstop after first attempt fizzles, Orban says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/hungary-still-aiming-us-backstop-after-first-attempt-fizzles-orban-says-2026-01-05/</link><description>BUDAPEST, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Hungary has not managed to secure the type of financial assistance it had originally sought from Washington ahead of a 2026 election, Prime Minister Viktor Orban said on Monday, adding that talks on a possible backstop were ongoing.

In power since 2010, eurosceptic Orban has struggled to revive Hungary's economy from an inflationary surge following Russia's February 2022 invasion of neighbouring Ukraine, with the economy mired in a three-year stretch of stagnation.

With Hungary still strongly reliant on Russian energy imports, President Donald Trump has granted Orban a one-year exemption from U.S. sanctions on Russian energy, staving off an energy price surge, which would have hit Hungary's economy hard.

The two leaders also discussed forms of financial assistance in November, although Trump last month rebuked Orban's claim that Washington had already agreed to provide Hungary a backstop worth up to $20 billion.

"I have requested a (financial) shield, but the type of assistance that would have been acceptable for both the U.S. and Hungary was not available," Orban told a press conference.

Orban is facing what could be the toughest challenge to his 16-year rule from a combination of Hungary's prolonged economic stagnation, a surge in the cost of living and an abuse scandal, which has triggered the rise of a strong opposition rival.

The veteran leader has launched tax cuts, wage hikes and cheap loans for homebuyers to shore up his poll standings at the cost of a higher budget deficit, inflationary risks and the slow decline in the European Union's largest debt pile outside the euro zone stalling.

When asked whether he could expect more help from Washington ahead of the election, likely to be in April, Orban said:

"Whether the American president or some high-ranking American leader will come to Hungary? This is likely, because in spring there will be political events in Hungary that high-ranking American leaders always attend."</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 13:42:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CN4QYNG7IFODFH5GJGEIL2EMOI.jpg?auth=9bb6ddd24880c963f4b7ef6440cdb00d93f91e6e3e7b6f2a935098d235be4ab2&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Syria, Israel resume U.S.-mediated security talks</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/syria-israel-resume-us-mediated-security-talks-2026-01-05/</link><description>Jan 5 (Reuters) - U.S.-mediated talks between Syria and Israel have resumed after an interruption of several months, Syria's state news agency SANA reported on Monday, with Damascus seeking withdrawal of Israeli troops from territory seized after the fall of Bashar al-Assad.

SANA, citing a Syrian government source, said the Syrian delegation was led by Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shibani and intelligence chief Hussein al-Salama. The resumption of the talks reflects a push by Damascus to reclaim what it describes as its non-negotiable national rights, the source said.

The discussions are focused on reviving a 1974 disengagement agreement that established a U.N.-monitored buffer zone between Israel and Syria after the 1973 Middle East war, SANA said.

Israeli troops advanced deeper across the border after Assad was toppled on December 8, 2024 by rebel fighters who assumed Syria's leadership. Israel has also intervened in what it calls missions to protect ethnic minority Druze in southwestern Syria.

Syria is seeking an Israeli withdrawal to positions held before Assad was toppled, and wants a reciprocal security framework guaranteeing its sovereignty and preventing interference in its internal affairs.

A Syrian official told Reuters last month that talks had been stalled since October, but that Syria expected a possible shift following a December 29 meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

The Syrian official said Damascus considered Israel's withdrawal from territory it took after Assad's fall to be a "red line" and that Syria had been asked to consider a phased withdrawal by Israeli troops.

"We're not going to legitimize an Israeli presence in Syria or the Golan Heights for that matter," the official said.

Under previous rounds of U.S.-mediated talks in Paris and Washington, Syria has pressed for a deal similar to the 1974 disengagement accord, which separated forces and maintained a ceasefire for decades, though formal peace was never achieved.

Syria's leadership has also sought an end to Israeli air strikes and incursions.

Israel has said it would conclude an agreement only on terms safeguarding its security interests, including demilitarisation of parts of southwestern Syria and protections for minority communities. It has yet to publicly commit to a full withdrawal to pre-2024 lines.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 13:42:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/IVQFLIYGO5M7VHS7JB7MEDOLLQ.jpg?auth=a75b43e7b2dd1b090ecfcf1fad6a3c61c16fca03322911c9f5db21f5d987b683&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Rome welcomed record 33.5 million pilgrims for Catholic Holy Year</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/rome-welcomed-record-335-million-pilgrims-catholic-holy-year-2026-01-05/</link><description>VATICAN CITY, Jan 5 (Reuters) - About 33.5 million pilgrims came to Rome in 2025 for the Catholic Holy Year, Vatican and Italian officials said on Monday, marking a record number of yearly visitors and a boon for local tourist shops, museums and restaurants.

Holy years, or jubilees, typically occur every 25 years and are considered a time of peace, forgiveness and pardon. Pilgrims to Rome can enter special "Holy Doors" at four Rome basilicas, and can see the pope at special audiences throughout the year.

Officials said the 3.7 billion euros ($4.32 billion) of state and European funds spent on overhauling tourist sites for the occasion had been worth the investment.

"The whole world has come to Rome," Archbishop Rino Fisichella, the Vatican's lead jubilee official, told a news conference. "The Jubilee has not been a losing investment but a driving force that has boosted ... overall growth."

The year, during which Catholics can also earn a special indulgence, or remission of sins, ends on Tuesday.

Visitors over the past 12 months came from 185 countries, officials said, with pilgrims from Italy, the United States, Spain, Brazil and Poland leading the pack.

Much of Rome has resembled one large construction site for the past two years as officials undertook some 3,200 construction projects for the jubilee, creating a new underpass near the Vatican, updating the subway system, and restoring the famed Trevi fountain.

"The Jubilee has been a driving force for the transformation of the city," Rome mayor Roberto Gualtieri told reporters.

Although they typically occur only once every quarter-century, a special Jubilee year is expected in 2033 as part of celebrations to mark 2,000 years since the death of Jesus.

Leo proposed in November that the year might also include a joint pilgrimage by him and other Christian leaders to Jerusalem, to visit the site of Jesus' crucifixion.

The last jubilee tourism record, made during the 2000 holy year, was 25 million.

The 2025 Jubilee was marked by an historical rarity not seen for 300 years. It was opened by one pope, Francis, and will be closed on Tuesday during a formal ceremony in St. Peter's Basilica by his successor, Leo.

Francis died in April after 12 years leading the 1.4-billion-member Church. The last jubilee held under two popes was in the year 1700, when Clement XI closed a holy year opened by Innocent XII.

Hundreds of Jubilee construction projects will continue in Rome beyond the end of the Holy Year.

The frenzy of work has infuriated some residents and left some visitors feeling short-changed because various tourist attractions were hidden behind scaffolding for many months.

Many renters in Rome were also left frustrated as the long-term rental market dried up as landlords sought to cash in on short-term rentals for pilgrims.

Special Forces seized Maduro only eight months after the Russian president agreed a strategic partnership with his "dear friend", and Trump said the U.S. was taking temporary control of Venezuela, which has the world's biggest oil reserves .

Some Russian nationalists have criticised the loss of an ally and contrasted the swift U.S. operation with Russia's failure to take control of Ukraine in almost four years of war.

But on another level, what Russia casts as Trump's "piracy" and "regime change" in the United States' "backyard" is more tolerable for Moscow, especially if Washington becomes bogged down in Venezuela.

"Russia has lost an ally in Latin America," said a senior Russian source, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation.

"But if this is an example of Trump's Monroe Doctrine in action, as it seems to be, then Russia also has its own sphere of influence."

The source was referring to the Trump administration's desire to reassert U.S. dominance in the Western Hemisphere and revive the 19th-century Monroe Doctrine, which declared the area to be Washington's zone of influence.

A second Russian source said Moscow saw the U.S. operation as a clear attempt to gain control of Venezuela's oil wealth and observed that most Western powers had not openly criticised it.

Putin has been trying to stake out a Russian sphere of influence in former Soviet republics in Central Asia, the Caucasus and Ukraine in a push opposed by Washington since the Cold War ended.

Putin has not commented publicly on the U.S. operation in Venezuela although Russia's foreign ministry has urged Trump to release Maduro and called for dialogue. The ministry previously cast Trump's actions as modern-day piracy in the Caribbean.

Russian state media have depicted the operation as a U.S. "kidnapping", reported remarks by Trump on the U.S. having "sick" neighbours and referred to the U.S. capture of military leader Manuel Noriega in Panama on January 3, 1990.

"That Trump just 'stole' the president of another country shows that there is basically no international law - there is only the law of force - but Russia has known that for a long time," Sergei Markov, a former Kremlin adviser, told Reuters.

He said the modern-day Monroe Doctrine - which Trump suggested could be updated as the "Donroe Doctrine" - could be interpreted in different ways.

"Is the United States really ready to recognise Russia's dominance over the former Soviet Union, or is it simply that the United States is so strong that it will not tolerate any great powers even close to it?"

Alexei Pushkov, who chairs the commission on information policy in Russia's Federation Council, or senate, saw the U.S. operation in Venezuela as a direct implementation of the U.S. National Security Strategy, depicting it as an attempt to revive U.S. supremacy and gain sway over more oil reserves.

But he said it risked a return to "the wild imperialism of the 19th century and, in fact, reviving the concept of the Wild West - the Wild West in the sense that the United States has regained the right to do what they want in the Western Hemisphere."

"Will the triumph turn into a disaster?" he asked.

For Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping, having a U.S. president focused on - and potentially bogged down in - the Western Hemisphere would appear to be more than acceptable, given Russia's focus on Ukraine and China's on Taiwan .

But some Russian nationalists have criticised the loss of an ally so soon after Bashar al-Assad's fall in Syria, and compared the speed of the U.S. operation with the much slower pace of Russia's advances in Ukraine.

Russia's largest oil producer, Rosneft (ROSN.MM) , opens new tab , terminated operations in Venezuela in 2020 and sold its assets related to operations there to a company owned by Russia's government.

Jailed Russian nationalist Igor Girkin said the U.S. had shown in Venezuela how a great power should act when facing a potential threat and cast the U.S. operation as part of an attempt to cut oil flows to China.

"We've had another blow to our image - another country that counted on Russia's help did not get it," Girkin said.

"Having got bogged down up to our ears in the bloody swamp of Ukraine, we are practically incapable of anything else, especially since we cannot help Venezuela in another hemisphere that is right next door to the United States."</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 14:25:52 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BV42FG46URNNZDQMT7EHK4UAZE.jpg?auth=1bd4b42493ab5e9d4a45aa2aa5df541893f61a2cdc4b8828c27099304bcc64a8&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russian missile strikes damage energy infrastructure in Ukraine's Kharkiv, mayor says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-missile-strikes-damage-energy-infrastructure-ukraines-kharkiv-mayor-says-2026-01-05/</link><description>KYIV, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Russia carried out five missile strikes on Ukraine's second-biggest city Kharkiv on Monday, causing "very serious damage" to energy infrastructure, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said.

"This is not just an attack on facilities. It's an attack on heating, on water, on people's normal lives. They are trying to break us with fear and darkness," he said on Telegram, without specifying the targets that had been hit.

Kharkiv's regional prosecutors' office said in a statement that at least one civilian was injured in the attack.

In a separate strike in the eastern city of Dnipro, an enterprise owned by major U.S. agricultural producer Bunge (BG.N) , opens new tab was hit, causing a leak of 300 tons of sunflower oil, said Borys Filatov, the mayor.

"Public utilities workers are cleaning up, spreading sand and gravel," Filatov wrote on the Telegram messaging app, adding that the spill would close a major riverside road to traffic for two or three days.

Kharkiv, with over a million inhabitants, is located close to the border with Russia. The temperature was around minus 3 degrees Celsius (27°F) during the day on Monday and will drop at night. According to the local electricity supplier, prior to the latest attack residents received electricity for an average of 14-16 hours out of 24.

Since November, Russia has sharply increased both the number and intensity of attacks on Ukraine's energy system and logistics, plunging entire regions into darkness after large-scale missile and drone attacks.

A third of Ukraine's capital Kyiv was left without heating after a vast Russian attack in late December, after Ukraine's largest seaport, Odesa, was virtually cut off from power for several days following a series of attacks.

Russia also attacked stations that produced heat for Chernihiv and Kherson.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 14:27:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Macron says France ‘does not approve’ of method US used to overthrow Maduro</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260105-macron-says-france-does-not-approve-of-method-us-used-to-overthrow-maduro</link><description>French President Emmanuel Macron on Monday said he "neither supported nor approved" the US military operation to grab Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro , a government spokesman said.

His comment clarified an initial public reaction Macron made that Venezuelans "can only rejoice" at Maduro's overthrow.

That first reaction drew criticism from several political figures in France , some of whom saw the French president as kowtowing to US President Donald Trump .

It also contrasted with a reaction from French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot who on Saturday condemned the US operation – saying it undermined international law, while stressing that no solution to Venezuela 's crisis can be imposed from the outside.

On Monday, government spokeswoman Maud Bregeon reported Macron as telling cabinet ministers: "We defend international law and the freedom of peoples. The method employed is neither supported nor approved."

She said Macron added that, for Venezuela, "if there is to be a transition, then the 2024 winner must obviously play a central role in it".

That was in reference to Venezuelan presidential candidate Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia , who was widely considered the rightful victor of a 2024 presidential election.

Maduro, however, was proclaimed the winner, sparking deadly riots that were brutally repressed.

Maduro's vice president, Delcy Rodriguez, has taken over Venezuela's government as interim leader, and said she wants to discuss "cooperation" with Washington. The country's military has said it recognises her authority.

Trump says the US is now "in charge" of Venezuela . The White House on Sunday indicated it does not want regime change, just a pliant new Venezuelan government, even if filled with former Maduro associates.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 14:28:31 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/21ad66fa-ea25-11f0-8685-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25349479964109.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran's leaders struggle to end protests, US action in Venezuela stokes fears</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/irans-leaders-struggle-end-protests-us-action-venezuela-stokes-fears-2026-01-05/</link><description>DUBAI, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Iran's efforts to quell a wave of anti-government protests have been complicated by Donald Trump's threat to intervene on their side, a warning firmly underlined by the subsequent U.S. capture of Venezuela's Nicolas Maduro , officials and insiders said on Monday.

A day before U.S. special forces seized Maduro and his wife on January 3 and whisked them off to New York, the U.S. president warned in a social media post that if Iran's leadership killed protesters who have taken to the streets since December 28 the U.S. "will come to their rescue". At least 17 people have died so far.

Tehran's options have been limited by Trump's threats and a long-running economic crisis that deepened after Israel, joined by the U.S., launched strikes on the Islamic Republic in June in a 12-day war that pummelled several of Iran's nuclear sites.

"These twin pressures have narrowed Tehran's room for manoeuvre, leaving leaders caught between public anger on the streets and hardening demands and threats from Washington, with few viable options and high risks on every path," one Iranian official told Reuters.

The view was echoed by two other officials and a former Iranian official who remains close to Iran's decision makers. All of them asked not to be identified due to the sensitivity of the situation.

A second official said that, after U.S. action in Venezuela, some of the authorities feared Iran could be "the next victim of Trump's aggressive foreign policy".

Iran's economy has been hammered by years of U.S. sanctions, but its rial has been in freefall since last year's Israeli-U.S. strikes that mainly targeted nuclear sites, where the West says Tehran has been working on nuclear arms. Iran denies this.

The protests that erupted in Tehran and which have spread to some cities in western and southern Iran do not match the scale of unrest that swept the nation in 2022-23 over the death of Mahsa Amini, who died in the custody of Iran's morality police for allegedly violating the hijab law.

But, even if smaller, these protests have quickly expanded from an economic focus to broader frustrations, with some protesters chanting "Down with the Islamic Republic" or "Death to the dictator" - a reference to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei who has the final say in all state matters.

That presents a challenge for the authorities which have been trying to maintain and nurture the spirit of national unity that emerged during and after the Israeli-U.S. strikes.

A third official said worries were growing in Tehran that "Trump or Israel might take military action against Iran, like what they did in June."

Iran, which has for years allied itself with fellow oil producer Venezuela, which like Iran has suffered under years of U.S. sanctions, has condemned Washington's action in Caracas. It has also condemned Trump's statements about Iran.

Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei said such statements about "Iran's internal affairs amount, under international norms, to nothing more than incitement to violence, incitement to terrorism, and incitement to killing".

On Friday, Trump threatened to intervene if protesters faced violence, declaring, "We are locked and loaded and ready to go," though he offered no details on what actions he might take.

The protests threaten what has long been Khamenei's defining priority: preserving the Islamic Republic at any cost. In a sign of the leadership's concern, Khamenei on Saturday accused "enemies of the Islamic Republic" of fomenting unrest and warned that "rioters should be put in their place".

Authorities have attempted to maintain a dual approach to the unrest, saying protests over the economy are legitimate and will be met by dialogue, while meeting some demonstrations with tear gas amid violent street confrontations.

However, at least 17 people have been killed in a week, rights groups said on Sunday. Authorities have said at least two members of the security services had died and more than a dozen were injured in the unrest.

The country's clerical establishment is still coming to terms with the 2025 Israeli and U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear and military targets. The attacks, which killed top Revolutionary Guard commanders and nuclear scientists, were launched just a day before a planned sixth round of talks with Washington over Tehran's disputed nuclear program.

Negotiations have stalled since the June conflict, even as both sides insist they remain open to a deal.

Washington and its allies accuse Iran of using its nuclear program as cover to develop weapons capability, a charge Tehran denies, saying its ambitions are purely peaceful.

Economic grievances remain at the heart of latest unrest.

Widening disparities between ordinary Iranians and a privileged clerical and security elite, compounded by mismanagement, runaway inflation and corruption — factors even acknowledged by state media — have fuelled public anger.

Witnesses in Tehran, Mashhad and Tabriz reported a heavy security presence in main squares. "You can feel the tense atmosphere in Tehran, but life continues as normal," said Amir Reza, 47, a carpet shop owner in Tehran's Grand Bazaar.

President Masoud Pezeshkian has urged dialogue and promised reforms to stabilize the monetary and banking systems and protect purchasing power.

Starting January 10, the government will provide a monthly stipend of 10,000,000 rials per person (about $7) in non-cashable electronic credit for use in select grocery stores, the semi-official Tasnim news agency reported.

For lower-income households, whose monthly salaries barely exceed $150, the measure represents a modest but meaningful boost. The rial lost roughly half its value against the dollar in 2025, while official inflation reached 42.5% in December.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 14:51:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/EEWU6YUEQVPIDFNWFLGZN2ESSA.jpg?auth=a9d6cf030cf986669a1d78083a0dac5e11f25db3b90f62968804e95ddc35f5b9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israel urges evacuation of two villages in southern Lebanon ahead of strike</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-urges-evacuation-two-villages-southern-lebanon-ahead-strike-2026-01-05/</link><description>CAIRO, Jan 5 (Reuters) - An Israeli military spokesperson issued on Monday an evacuation order for two villages in southern Lebanon ahead of a strike.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 14:52:16 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/VMFGG6HMMBO4TIKRYZUONABQOU.jpg?auth=dbff391834117a268e41ede21d5613f4db85be956e314f7404f6026dd8a51280&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israel urges evacuation of two villages in southern Lebanon ahead of strike</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-urges-evacuation-two-villages-southern-lebanon-ahead-strike-2026-01-05/</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 14:52:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Witkoff, Kushner to represent US at Ukraine talks, says White House</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/witkoff-kushner-represent-us-ukraine-talks-says-white-house-2026-01-05/</link><description>Jan 5 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff and his son-in-law Jared Kushner will represent the United States at talks on Ukraine in Paris this week, a White House official said on Monday.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 15:26:52 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/IO4XLOYCONIG7OXJTQDFM2LKTM.jpg?auth=98b5cd6fd3d3ca5ef39f17209e5a65142b786511ef9a77235a1c5cf98b15d867&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israeli airstrike kills two in Gaza including girl, hospital staff say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-airstrike-kills-two-gaza-including-girl-hospital-staff-say-2026-01-05/</link><description>CAIRO, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Israel killed at least two Palestinians including a girl, and wounded four others including other children, in an airstrike on Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip on Monday, officials at the city's main Nasser Hospital said.

The Israeli military said the strike, carried out in an area controlled by Hamas, had targeted a Hamas militant who was planning to attack Israeli troops in southern Gaza.

Israel has carried out repeated air strikes in Gaza since a U.S.-brokered deal took effect in October that halted most fighting. Israel says its strikes are aimed at preventing attacks or destroying militant infrastructure.

Gaza's health ministry says 422 Palestinians have been killed since the ceasefire took effect. Gaza militants have killed three Israeli soldiers during the same period.

Under the first phase of the deal, brokered by U.S. President Donald Trump, Israel has retained control of 53% of Gaza. Hamas agreed to release living hostages and hand over remains in exchange for the freeing of Palestinians detained by Israel.

The final hostage remains still to be handed over belong to an Israeli police officer killed on October 7, 2023 - the day Gazan militants invaded Israel, killing 1,200 and taking some 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.

Israel's offensive in Gaza has killed more than 71,000 Palestinians, most of them civilians, according to local health authorities. Most of the territory is in ruins, with the population of more than 2 million living mainly in makeshift homes or damaged buildings in areas where Israeli forces withdrew.

Earlier on Monday, a father and son in Gaza were killed in the collapse of their house which had been damaged in an earlier Israeli strike, authorities in Gaza said.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 15:48:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/NULNCCXFQBKSPMNVZ6KNJLRKOI.jpg?auth=e72741fa4f7d0d9f8a8911aad4bb5a0a88c67ab682883756a4d0c991bcbf9d8a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Denmark's prime minister says Trump is serious about wanting Greenland takeover</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/denmarks-prime-minister-says-trump-is-serious-about-wanting-greenland-takeover-2026-01-05/</link><description>COPENHAGEN, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said on Monday that she believes U.S. President Donald Trump is serious about wanting to take over Greenland, and that both Denmark and Greenland have clearly rejected his ambition.

“I am deeply concerned about the possible intensification of instability in the country, the potential impact on the region, and the precedent it may set for how relations between and among states are conducted,” Guterres said in a statement delivered to the council by U.N. political affairs chief Rosemary DiCarlo.

Guterres also said in the statement that he was concerned that the U.S. operation to capture Maduro in Caracas early on Saturday did not respect the rules of international law.

“I welcome and am ready to support all efforts aimed at assisting Venezuelans in finding a peaceful way forward,” he said in the statement.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 15:50:04 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HHJU5YIYWZOFNJ7BLYXJ2EHRWM.jpg?auth=7488f078e9bad4143d5c43989dbab0d37b2e9bce4dfa11faf8ba3d98f1c38544&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Switzerland freezes assets linked to Venezuela's Maduro after US arrest</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/switzerland-freezes-assets-linked-venezuelas-maduro-after-us-arrest-2026-01-05/</link><description>ZURICH, Jan 5 - Switzerland has frozen assets held in the country by Venezuela's Nicolas Maduro and associates, the Swiss government said on Monday, following his arrest by U.S. forces in Caracas and transfer to the United States.

A spokesperson for the Swiss Foreign Ministry said the order affects 37 people. The spokesperson said the ministry could not provide any details on the value of the assets in question.

The measure, effective immediately and valid for four years, aims to prevent an outflow of potentially illicit assets and comes in addition to existing sanctions imposed on Venezuela since 2018, the government said in a statement.

The asset freeze does not affect members of the current Venezuelan government, and Switzerland said it will seek to return any funds found to be illicitly acquired to benefit the Venezuelan people.

The government said the situation in Venezuela was volatile, with various outcomes possible in the coming days and weeks.

It said it was following the situation closely, and called for de-escalation and restraint, while also offering its good offices to find a peaceful solution.

"The Federal Council wants to ensure that any illicitly acquired assets cannot be transferred out of Switzerland in the current situation," it said.

The asset freeze was a precautionary measure and applied to Maduro and his associates as foreign politically exposed persons, the government said.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 16:29:31 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/FHVBK67CG5NWJALKIX4QYNVY2U.jpg?auth=ed17f12cf6f30e1898ab72cbc5fa7e571687edb0c85504bb05d93b45d461c3c6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Britain demands Elon Musk's Grok answers concerns about sexualised photos</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/britain-demands-elon-musks-grok-answers-concerns-about-sexualised-photos-2026-01-05/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Britain has demanded Elon Musk's social media site X explain how its AI chatbot Grok was able to produce undressed images of people and sexualised images of children, and whether it was failing in its legal duty to protect users.

Grok said on Friday lapses in safeguards had resulted in "images depicting minors in minimal clothing" on X, saying it was urgently fixing them.

British media regulator Ofcom said it was aware of "serious concerns" raised about the feature.

"We have made urgent contact with X and xAI to understand what steps they have taken to comply with their legal duties to protect users in the UK," a spokesperson said.

Grok said on Friday: "xAI has safeguards, but improvements are ongoing to block such requests entirely."

Creating or sharing non-consensual intimate images or child sexual abuse material, including sexual deepfakes created by artificial intelligence, is illegal in Britain.

In addition, tech platforms have a duty to take steps to stop British users encountering illegal content and take it down when they become aware of it.

The request comes after ministers in France reported X to prosecutors and regulators over the disturbing images, saying in a statement on Friday the "sexual and sexist" content was "manifestly illegal".</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 16:30:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WZUIN6NBUVJEFHFNMY2AU7TDQQ.jpg?auth=07385399c8e03bc163dc51202d900132d76ac75624f01c308a5b2f682299440b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>France asks airlines to cancel 15% of flights at Paris main airports after snowfalls</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/france-asks-airlines-cancel-15-flights-paris-main-airports-after-snowfalls-2026-01-05/</link><description>PARIS, Jan 5 (Reuters) - France's civil aviation authority on Monday asked airlines to cancel 15% of flights until later in the evening at Orly and Charles de Gaulle airports following heavy snowfalls in the French capital Paris.

The airlines are free to choose which flights they cancel so long as they reduce takeoffs and landings, a spokesperson told Reuters.

Airlines were asked to reduce flights until 2000 CET (1900 GMT) at Paris-Charles de Gaulle airport, and until 2330 CET (2230 GMT) at Paris-Orly.

The French transport ministry urged travellers to check if their flight was taking off before leaving home, and to go to the airport by public transportation rather than by car.

Meanwhile, Amsterdam Schiphol airport , one of Europe's busiest hubs, cancelled almost 500 flights on Monday morning and was closed to incoming traffic until 1200 GMT also because of snowfalls, news agency ANP reported.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 16:30:42 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CMAXOSYJVNNSVHUWY2GCDMVMBQ.jpg?auth=833521d89a12b5b9db39decbe7544bfbdfe2acedcd8e61fd7c36de5b0b9980fd&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>All 116 people wounded in Crans-Montana New Year's fire now identified</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260105-all-116-people-wounded-in-crans-montana-new-year-s-fire-now-identified</link><description>Swiss police announced Monday they had now identified all 116 people wounded in the devastating New Year bar blaze in Crans-Montana , with three-quarters of them still in hospital.

Four days on from the blaze that swept through Le Constellation bar in the Alpine ski resort town, everyone killed and injured has now been identified.

A total of 40 people were killed in the tragedy, all of whom had been identified by Sunday. The average age of those killed was 19.

"All 116 injured people have been identified. Eighty-three of them are still hospitalised," the Wallis cantonal police in southwest Switzerland said in a statement.

The total number of people injured in the disaster was revised downwards, with police having warned in the days following the tragedy that the tolls were likely to change.

"Initially, we reported 119 injured. In reality, three injured people admitted to the emergency room that night were mistakenly attributed to the event," the statement said.

Among those injured were 68 Swiss, 21 French, 10 Italians, four Serbs and two Poles, police said.

Nationals from Belgium, Portugal, the Czech Republic, Australia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Republic of Congo and Luxembourg were also among those hurt in the tragedy.

And there were four injured people with dual nationality, given as French-Finnish, Swiss-Belgian, French-Italian, and Philippine-Italian.

The Wallis police said no further information would be given on the identities of those injured, "out of respect for the families".

The most severely burned casualties have been airlifted to specialist burns centres in Switzerland and abroad.

The Swiss government said Sunday that 35 patients had been transferred to specialist clinics in neighbouring Germany, France and Italy, plus Belgium.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 16:32:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/30bbb2b2-e987-11f0-ac25-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-04T152628Z-50281374-RC2BUIA5XSF3-RTRMADP-3-SWITZERLAND-BLAST.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump’s risky gamble: Can the US 'run' Venezuela after Maduro's capture?</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260105-trump-risky-gamble-can-the-us-run-venezuela-maduro-capture</link><description>US President Donald Trump described the next steps following the shock military US action in Venezuela – dubbed “Operation Absolute Determination” – as a temporary phase pending a political transition.

He presented the run-up to this transition as simple and unequivocal: the United States would “run” Venezuela after the capture of Nicolas Maduro on Saturday.

But the US president did not provide details on how this US stewardship – which would be legally fragile – would be implemented. And while he left open the possibility of deploying US troops on Venezuelan soil, he did not specify whether their role would be to maintain order or protect the US oil companies that he said would soon be operating in the country.

"Toppling Maduro is likely to be the easy part for Trump," warned an analysis in The Washington Post . The paper nevertheless offered editorial support for the US operation.

Historically, US attempts to "run" foreign countries, either covertly or openly from Washington, have rarely succeeded. "In Latin America , US interventions have generally ended badly, such as Guatemala in 1954, where a US-backed coup led to decades of internal conflict," said Luca Trenta, a US foreign policy and security specialist at Swansea University in Wales. "Elsewhere, in Iraq and Libya , the American presence was also accompanied by a sharp rise in violence."

Many experts expressed scepticism that Trump might succeed where others had failed. "The statements made during the press conference [on Sunday] were not reassuring," said Rebecca Jarman, a Latin America security specialist at the University of Leeds. "The best-case scenario would have been a negotiated transition, perhaps some kind of diplomatic help in creating a structure that would lead to some sort of coalition. Instead, everything appears to rest on a show of force and the possible deployment of troops ."

Trump has ruled out Venezuelan Maria Corina Machado , the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize laureate , saying she lacked the stature to lead the country, despite her role as a former lawmaker and Venezuela’s leading opposition figure.

Anyone who ascends to the role will be walking a fine line.  "The problem is that the manner in which Maduro was removed will make the next opposition leader look like a US puppet," said Tom Long, a Latin America specialist at the University of Warwick.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio appears to have made his choice. He announced that the United States would cooperate with Delcy Rodriguez , Venezuela’s vice president, who was appointed by the Supreme Court on Saturday to serve as interim president.

But shortly after Rubio made his remarks, Rodriguez showed little willingness to align with Washington. "She was very clear in a press conference that actually, she simply wanted to get Maduro back because he was the legitimate president", Trenta said. Speaking on state television, Rodriguez urged national unity in response to what she called Maduro's "kidnapping" and insisted Venezuela would never become a "colony".

Rodriguez also arouses "a degree of mistrust within the US administration because some see her as appointed by Maduro and so unreliable", the expert added. She thus does not fit the profile of the total political reversal the United States would like to see in Venezuela.

"It would be wrong to assume the previous government disappeared with Maduro’s arrest," Long said.

But some experts argued she could play a stabilising role. "Her hostile rhetoric towards Washington is posturing, it’s unavoidable," Jarman said. Any other tone would have branded her a Washington stooge in the eyes of officials still in place in Caracas.

Jarman described Rodriguez as "not particularly ideologically bound" and, above all, "a careerist politician". She added that Rodriguez’s track record of running the Venezuelan intelligence services since 2018 means she is experienced in dealing with "antagonistic actors", an advantage in the eyes of Trump and Rubio.

Indeed, that skill could allow Rodriguez to maintain a fragile balance between US interests as well as those of the Venezuelan military and "non-state actors", including gangs, potentially sparing Washington the need to deploy troops.

It remains to be seen, however, if Rodriguez’s political skill will be enough to keep Venezuela under control. No one knows, for instance, how the country's powerful military could react. "At the moment, Defence Minister Vladimir Padrino Lopez and high-ranking officials are laying low," Jarman said. "They want to see what happens and how this all plays out before working out where best to invest their loyalty and their efforts."

"The army's appetite to defend Maduro himself is very limited, but its appetite to defend its turf is very high – especially its interests in natural resource extraction such as oil, or in drug trafficking ," she added.

The armed forces, therefore, appear to be waiting to see which entrenched interests they will be able to defend.

Experts also warned of the risk of internal divisions within the armed forces. "If splits emerge, tensions could quickly escalate, potentially leading to violence, chaos and conflict," Trenta said.

Such a scenario would be catastrophic for the population, who would bear the brunt of any escalation in violence. But the alternative is not a cure-all for Venezuelans, even if some welcomed the fall of Maduro, who Jarman notes "was very unpopular” in the country.

A short-term cooperation between Washington and Rodriguez could entrench the existing power structure, Jarman warned. “The ruling elites could tighten their grip on institutions and increase repression, this time without fear of being targeted by the United States,” she said.

Air traffic controllers for Athens airport were guiding planes toward the runway when the usual radio chatter suddenly vanished - replaced by a piercing whistle.

It quickly became clear that controllers had lost contact with most aircraft in Greek airspace, including dozens of incoming flights, according to two controllers and an aviation official on duty at the time.

Internet systems also appeared to fail across the board. Even the civil aviation authority's press office resorted to reading statements over the phone rather than sending by email.

The outage , which lasted several hours and affected most of Greece's airports, stranded thousands of travelers. Authorities have ruled out a cyberattack, but the cause remains unknown - and officials admit the systems didn't get fixed, they simply came back on their own.

"Suddenly communications went down. You could only hear a high-pitched whistle," said one controller, speaking on condition of anonymity. "The thing is, we don't know what caused it and how it ended. We want to find out the exact cause to ensure once and for all that this will not happen again."

Controllers managed to identify a couple of working radio frequencies in the tower, but not enough to maintain safe communication with pilots, a senior official said. Within half an hour, Greece took the unprecedented step of suspending flights into and across its airspace.

Air traffic controllers from across the region stepped in to help. A controller in a neighbouring country said most communication with Greece was done over the telephone because the usual radios were down.

"We had a black hole in Greek airspace," said aviation safety expert Faithon Karaiosifidis. "Imagine if it had happened in the summer at the peak of the tourist season. The chaos."

The incident has reignited calls to upgrade Greece's aviation infrastructure, which unions and experts say is outdated and underfunded after the country's 2009–2018 debt crisis.

The government insisted Monday that modernisation is underway and that current systems meet EU standards. The plan, which includes updating communication systems, is due for completion in 2028.

But last month, the European Commission referred Greece to the EU Court of Justice for failing to implement certain navigation procedures designed to boost safety in low-visibility conditions. It's unclear whether those measures would have made any difference on Sunday - but many worry reform is coming too late.

"This incident once again exposes the critical weaknesses of outdated and underfunded air traffic management infrastructure. Safety was maintained thanks to human expertise — but this cannot continue to compensate for systemic deficiencies," said Panagiotis Psarros, Chair of the Association of Greek Air Traffic Controllers.

Experts say the problems go beyond ageing equipment. Radios dating back to the 1990s remain in use, and staffing shortages persist despite a tourism boom that brings millions of visitors to Greece each year.

"The old technical equipment and the lack of personnel in air traffic controllers and electronic technicians ... create a bottleneck," said Karaiosifidis.

In September, unions protested by limiting flight arrivals they said exceeded permitted limits, causing delays. They have now threatened to do the same again.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 17:23:58 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/3WBX3SWRIFPALHASBUF6MFC5QQ.jpg?auth=f741b55a2d70ba863eeae3b83c7307b24c78b89d4e913344636dfc886a725b47&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US making preparations in case Trump decides to reopen embassy in Caracas, official says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/us-making-preparations-case-trump-decides-reopen-embassy-caracas-official-says-2026-01-05/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 5 (Reuters) - The United States is undergoing preparations in case President Donald Trump decides to reopen the U.S. embassy in Venezuela's capital Caracas, a senior State Department official said on Monday.

"As President Trump said, we are making preparations to allow for a reopening should the President make that decision," the official told Reuters.

Trump on Sunday said that the U.S. was thinking about reopening the embassy in Caracas.

Bloomberg first reported that the Trump administration is taking early steps to allow for the reopening of the American embassy in Venezuela.

The United States captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro in a raid early on Saturday and whisked him to New York to face drug-trafficking charges.

Trump has asserted that the U.S. will run Venezuela until such time as a "safe, proper and judicious transition" can be made, and he has made no secret of wanting to share in Venezuela's oil riches.

But it was unclear how the U.S. intends to run the country. The U.S. president's vow on Saturday to “run” post-Maduro Venezuela appears for now to be more an aspiration to exert outside control - or at least heavy influence - over the OPEC nation without deploying U.S. ground forces, which would have little public support at home.

But Trump said on Sunday that more military intervention was on the table. "If they don't behave, we will do a second strike," he said.

American oil companies will return to Venezuela and rebuild the sector's infrastructure, Trump told reporters on Air Force One on Sunday.

The far-left Volcano activist group claimed responsibility for the attack which also shut down mobile phone connections, cut heating during freezing weather, stopped trains and forced hospitals to switch to back-up generators.

"Left-wing terrorism is back in Germany with increasing intensity," Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt told the Bild newspaper in an interview.

Volcano, which says it is against the energy industry's use of fossil fuels, has claimed several attacks in Berlin and the neighbouring Brandenburg region.

"There will be talks which we have to have with the federal government about how we can better protect our critical infrastructure, especially in the area of the capital," Berlin mayor Kai Wegner told a news conference.

Germany and other Western powers have also been on the alert for sabotage attacks on power, communications and transport systems at a time of increasing geopolitical uncertainty.

A blaze early on Saturday destroyed a cable duct over a canal, cutting power in around 45,000 households and more than 2,000 businesses in the southwest of the city, including the prosperous areas of Zehlendorf and Wannsee.

Electricity has since been restored for some 14,500 households but full restoration is not expected until Thursday afternoon, Stromnetz Berlin, the city's network operator, said.

In 2024, the Volcano group claimed responsibility for a suspected arson attack on a power pylon near Tesla's car factory outside Berlin.

In its most recent annual report, the domestic intelligence agency said left-wing militancy was a growing danger and made explicit reference to the Volcano group.

Bernhard Büllmann, head of Stromnetz Berlin, said restoring electricity to areas still without power would be a complex operation involving high-tension lines that required specialist staff.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 18:36:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4IAMFFG4ORJL5HCGNYKEDUFDS4.jpg?auth=7b76ec77cdb55bb09a64b9169de3af2f9ced17d54d9c3cf5229594aafa3bc3b6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Who might be next: Countries in US crosshairs after Venezuela</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260105-maduro-ouster-who-next-us-trump-crosshairs-regime-change-cuba-greenland-iran</link><description>A day after the audacious – and successful – US military operation that removed Nicolas Maduro in Venezuela, Secretary of State Marco Rubio indicated in an interview that aired Sunday that Cuba might be next.

Asked directly whether Cuba was the administration's "next target", Rubio called the Cuban government "a huge problem".

"So is that a yes?" the interviewer pressed. "I think they're in a lot of trouble, yes," Rubio replied.

That same day, Trump renewed his calls for a US takeover of the Danish territory of Greenland, citing US security interests, and threatened military action in Colombia for its role in cocaine trafficking.

With such thinly veiled threats, Trump and co. are rattling friends and foes alike, spurring observers around the world to pose a pointed question: Who might be next?

Greenland's melting Arctic ice is creating new, potentially lucrative shipping routes while its land mass is mineral-rich. Its strategic location has also been identified as a potential Achilles' heel for NATO . Russia, China, the United States and Europe have already taken steps to bolster their military presence in the region.

Trump, for his part, tried to buy the semi-autonomous island from Denmark in 2019 during his first term.

“It’s so strategic right now. Greenland is covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place," Trump told reporters as he flew back to Washington from Florida on Sunday.

"We need Greenland from the standpoint of national security, and Denmark is not going to be able to do it.”

The operation in Caracas and Trump’s comments heightened concern in Copenhagen, with Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen stating unequivocally that Trump has "no right to annex" the territory.

She also reminded Trump that Denmark already provides the United States, a fellow member of NATO, broad access to Greenland through existing security agreements.

“I would therefore strongly urge the US to stop threatening a historically close ally and another country and people who have made it very clear that they are not for sale,” Frederiksen said.

Denmark signed onto a European Union statement on Sunday underscoring that “the right of the Venezuelan people to determine their future must be respected” even as Trump vowed the US would “run” Venezuela and pressed the country's acting president, former vice president Delcy Rodriguez, to toe the US line .

Trump mocked Danish efforts to boost Greenland’s national security posture on Sunday by saying the Danes had added “one more dog sled” to their arsenal.

Greenlanders and Danes were further rankled by a social media post from a former Trump administration official turned right-wing podcaster. Katie Miller – who is married to Trump deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, the anti-immigrant campaigner and architect of many of Trump's controversial deportation policies – appeared to threaten Denmark, a US ally. The post showed an illustrated map of Greenland in the colors of the Stars and Stripes accompanied by the caption: “SOON."

In a post responding to Miller, Ambassador Jesper Moller Sorensen, Denmark's chief envoy to Washington, called for the US to respect national borders. “And yes, we expect full respect for the territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Denmark,” he wrote.

During his presidential transition and in the early months of his return to the White House, Trump called for the US to assert control over Greenland and has pointedly not ruled out military force to take control of the Arctic island.

The issue had largely drifted out of the headlines in recent months. But Trump then put the spotlight back on Greenland less than two weeks ago when he said he would appoint Republican Governor Jeff Landry as special envoy to Greenland. The Louisiana governor responded that in his volunteer position he would help Trump “make Greenland a part of the US”.

The Trump administration's National Security Strategy , published last month, cited restoring “American preeminence in the Western Hemisphere” as a central goal, an aim underscored by the Venezuelan adventure.

Trump on Saturday cited the 19th-century Monroe Doctrine , which called on world powers – notably European colonists – to respect American hegemony in the region.

He also cited the doctrine's Roosevelt Corollary – the justification used to support Panama’s secession from Colombia, which helped secure the Panama Canal Zone for the US – as he made his case for a more assertive approach to the Western Hemisphere.

Trump even quipped that James Monroe's 1823 policy declaration could be renamed the “Don-roe Doctrine”.

Concern is thus simmering in Cuba, one of Venezuela’s most important allies and trading partners, fueled by Rubio's hints that the Cuban government might be the next to draw Washington's attention.

Rubio underscored the link between the two countries in his Sunday appearance on NBC's “Meet the Press”, saying Cuban officials were with Maduro ahead of his capture.

“It was Cubans that guarded Maduro,” Rubio said. “He was not guarded by Venezuelan bodyguards. He had Cuban bodyguards.” The secretary of state added that Cuban bodyguards were also in charge of “internal intelligence” in Maduro’s government, including “who spies on who inside, to make sure there are no traitors”.

The Cuban government said in a statement read on state television on Sunday evening that 32 officers were killed in the US military operation that toppled Maduro.

Trump said the Cuban economy, battered by years of a US embargo, is in tatters and will slide further now with the ouster of Maduro, who provided the Caribbean island with subsidized oil. “It's going down,” Trump said of Cuba's economy. “It's going down for the count.”

US-Cuba relations have been hostile since the 1959 Cuban revolution.

As he made his way back to Washington on Sunday evening, Trump also put Venezuela's neighbour Colombia and its leftist president, Gustavo Petro, on notice.

In a back-and-forth with reporters, Trump said Colombia is “run by a sick man who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States”.

The administration imposed sanctions in October on Petro, his family and a member of his government over accusations of involvement in the global drug trafficking.

Trump began his pressure campaign on Maduro by ordering dozens of lethal strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats travelling from Venezuela in the Caribbean. He eventually expanded the operations to target suspected vessels in the eastern Pacific originating from Colombia.

In September the United States added Colombia, the top recipient of US assistance in the region, to a list of nations failing to cooperate in the drug war for the first time in almost 30 years. The designation led to a slashing of assistance to the country.

“He’s not going to be doing it for very long,” Trump said of Petro on Sunday. “He has cocaine mills and cocaine factories. He’s not going to be doing it.”

Asked whether he might order the US to conduct an operation against Colombia, Trump replied vaguely: “It sounds good to me.”

Iran has long been allied to Venezuela, using Caracas to bypass US sanctions and trading oil for gold. The " ghost fleets " operating off the coast of Venezuela are suspected of carrying sanctioned Russian and Iranian oil to global markets, circumventing sanctions.

Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah militants also have economic ties to Venezuela , raising money through narcotics. According to the Atlantic Council think tank, the Maduro regime and Hezbollah have exploited the status quo "to turn Venezuela into a central hub for the convergence of transnational organized crime and international terrorism".

Leaders in Tehran are likely to see the fall of Maduro as an indication that Trump is likely to pursue regime change if he deems it's in the US interest, and will not just stop at curtailing Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile programs, noted Raz Zimmt, head of the Iran and Shiite Axis research program at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv, in comments to the Times of Israel .

Moreover, events in Venezuela could indicate that Trump would not oppose Israeli efforts at regime change in Tehran despite his previous dissembling. Hosting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House last week, Trump dismissed the idea, telling reporters : “I’m not going to talk about an overthrow of a regime.”

But amid reports of widespread Iranian protests just a few days later, Trump returned to more bellicose rhetoric.

“If Iran shots [sic] and violently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue," he posted on Truth Social in the wee hours of January 2. “We are locked and loaded and ready to go,” he said before adding his customary sign-off: “Thank you for your attention to this matter!”</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 18:37:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/3dcbbc5a-ea26-11f0-8e3e-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/Trump-Rubio-Maduro-next.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Snow and ice cause travel disruption in France, UK and Netherlands</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260105-snow-and-ice-cause-travel-disruption-in-france-uk-and-netherlands</link><description>Some of the winter's coldest weather so far hit travel in Britain, France and the Netherlands on Monday, closing roads, grounding flights and forcing train cancellations, including on Eurostar, just days after a power outage caused major disruption.

Eurostar , which links the UK to the European mainland, told passengers travelling between London and the Netherlands to postpone their journeys, as services could not operate beyond Brussels due to the Dutch weather.

Rail traffic through the Channel Tunnel had only resumed on New Year's Eve, after an electricity failure stranded thousands of passengers and even trapped some for a night on a powerless train.

"Due to expected adverse weather conditions, the traffic is suspended in the Netherlands today," Eurostar said in a live service update, urging travellers affected not to turn up to the station.

Six trains between London St Pancras International and Paris Gare du Nord were cancelled, with most others delayed, the timetable indicated.

British railway authorities meanwhile deployed snowploughs in Scotland to try to clear tracks hit by heavy snow, which reached up to 52 centimetres (20 inches) on Monday morning in Tomintoul, near Inverness in northeast Scotland .

NS Dutch railways said services were severely disrupted on Monday, especially in the Amsterdam region, and fewer trains would run in some parts of the country on Tuesday.

The UK's Met Office issued fresh weather warnings for Monday and Tuesday for snow and ice for Scotland, Northern Ireland and parts of northern England and said cold weather health alerts for all English regions would remain in place until Friday.

The disruption follows a cold snap in recent days in the UK.

Temperatures dropped to a low of -10.9C in the high hills of Shap in Cumbria, northwest England, on Sunday night.

"Overnight into Tuesday temperatures will once again fall below freezing for much of the country, with the lowest temperatures over lying snow possibly dipping to -12C," the Met Office said.

A total of 212 schools were closed in Northern Ireland on Monday, the authorities said, with dozens of schools also shut in Scotland, Wales and northern England.

Flights were cancelled at airports including Liverpool in northwest England, Aberdeen and Inverness in northeast Scotland, and Belfast in Northern Ireland.

At France's major Paris airports of Charles de Gaulle and Orly, heavy snowfall forced airlines to reduce their flights by 15 percent.

Some 250 snowploughs were on standby at the two airports, French Transport Minister Philippe Tabarot told a press conference, adding there would likely be "cancellations and some delays".

At Schiphol, the main international airport of the Netherlands, some 700 flights were cancelled -- more than half of those scheduled to take off or land on Monday.

Reduced traffic was expected for the rest of the day, the airport authorities said, with wintry weather forcing further cancellations in the coming days.

In Paris, snow and ice disrupted the bus network on Monday afternoon and roads, particularly in the northwest Normandy region as well as in the French capital, were badly affected with long rush-hour tailbacks.

Weather service Meteo France issued an orange alert for snow and ice for much of northwest France, including Paris, on Monday evening – the second-highest warning.

It forecast sub-zero temperatures into the evening and overnight, with the mercury barely above freezing into Tuesday.

In Scotland, the police cautioned road users not to try to drive through closed roads because of the treacherous conditions.

The UK's roadside assistance provider, the AA, said there had been a 40 percent spike in callouts compared to a typical Monday.

Belfast Zoo remained closed due to the weather conditions on Monday, while snow, ice or low temperature warnings were in place across neighbouring Ireland.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 19:20:42 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/cb446318-ea56-11f0-ab3c-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/000-89NX74R.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Delcy Rodriguez formally sworn in as Venezuela's interim president</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/delcy-rodriguez-formally-sworn-venezuelas-interim-president-2026-01-05/</link><description>Jan 5 - Venezuela's vice president and oil minister Delcy Rodriguez was formally sworn in on Monday as the country's interim president, as U.S.-deposed President Nicolas Maduro appeared in a New York court on drug charges, after the Trump administration removed him from power in a dramatic weekend military action.

Rodriguez, a 56-year-old labor lawyer known for close connections to the private sector and her devotion to the ruling party, was sworn in by her brother Jorge, who is the head of the national assembly legislature.

Also sworn in on Monday were 283 lawmakers elected last May. Just a small number of are classed as opposition - most of the opposition, especially the faction directed by Nobel Prize winner Machado, boycotted the contest.

The two-day poll showed 65% of Republicans back the military operation ordered by Republican President Donald Trump, compared to 11% of Democrats and 23% of independents.

U.S. forces swooped into Caracas before dawn on Saturday in a deadly raid that yielded the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, who the U.S. military turned over to federal authorities for prosecution on charges involving alleged drug trafficking.

The Reuters/Ipsos poll, conducted on Sunday and Monday, showed significant support among Republicans for a foreign policy that includes exerting influence over nearby countries.

Some 43% of Republicans said they agreed with the statement: "The United States should have a policy of dominating affairs in the Western Hemisphere," compared with 19% who disagreed. The rest said they were unsure or did not answer the question.

The poll, which surveyed 1,248 U.S. adults nationwide, showed Trump's approval rating at 42%, the highest rating since October and up from 39% in a December poll. The poll, which was conducted online, had a margin of error of about 3 percentage points.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 19:42:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/37TCBCR6PZMWVJCXXWMTZGIOKU.jpg?auth=687041e210cd3e8f28f2c3d664d9b39632efbfdf0e94a1e74047dac1ec085d2e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Assange's lawyer Barry Pollack to fight Maduro's US narcotics charges</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/assanges-lawyer-barry-pollack-fight-maduros-us-narcotics-charges-2026-01-05/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Barry Pollack — the Washington lawyer who represented WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange — will defend toppled Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro in a U.S. drug case that could test immunity claims for foreign leaders and the legality of his capture.

Pollack appeared with Maduro on Monday as he pleaded not guilty in Manhattan federal court days after Maduro and his wife were seized in a U.S. military raid.

Defending Assange gave Pollack a taste of cases steeped in global intrigue and with consequences for America’s standing in the world. The case tested whether U.S. law could criminalize the publishing of sensitive information.

Assange faced U.S. Espionage Act charges for WikiLeaks’ mass release of secret U.S. documents, including diplomatic cables and accounts of military actions in Iraq and Afghanistan.

After months of negotiations, he pleaded guilty to a single count of conspiring to obtain and disclose classified defense information.

The unusual 2024 deal Pollack struck let Assange walk out of a British prison, enter his plea in the U.S. territory of the Northern Mariana Islands before returning to his native Australia.

POLLACK SAYS HE WILL CHALLENGE MADURO'S 'MILITARY ABDUCTION'

Maduro pleaded not guilty on Monday to a four-count indictment accusing him of leading a conspiracy to funnel cocaine into the United States, including by working with armed guerrilla groups, drug cartels and international gangs.

At Maduro's arraignment in Manhattan federal court on Monday, Pollack said he anticipated extensive legal wrangling over what he termed Maduro's "military abduction," signaling the defense will argue Saturday's operation was unlawful .

Pollack may also claim that Maduro is immune from criminal charges as the head of a foreign government. Pollack did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

"The United States has an extraordinary view of what its worldwide jurisdiction is," Pollack told the legal site Lawdragon in an interview last year about the Assange case.

Both arguments face legal hurdles.

The U.S. has not recognized Maduro as Venezuela's leader since 2019, after Maduro claimed victory in an election the U.S. and other countries deemed fraudulent. U.S. courts have generally declined to dismiss prosecutions based on claims a defendant was brought to the U.S. unlawfully.

Pollack, a partner at the Harris St. Laurent &amp; Wechsler law firm, also previously represented a former Central Intelligence Agency officer who was convicted of sharing classified information with a reporter.

He secured an acquittal for a former Enron Corp executive who faced charges tied to the energy company's collapse in 2001.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 19:43:19 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/6BYKJPMBJRKGHP2PYZ4DC7D3EI.jpg?auth=ec5d26143c5adb809576a747fb51acaf52da2854547e59206c95125440e34e20&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Greenland is not comparable to Venezuela, prime minister says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/greenland-is-not-comparable-venezuela-prime-minister-says-2026-01-05/</link><description>COPENHAGEN, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Greenland hopes to improve relations with the United States and can't be compared to Venezuela, the Arctic island's Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen told a press conference on Monday.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 19:44:04 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ZYDRNAPY4BNE7BRUZQCT75PPOA.jpg?auth=ce887505c2bf65d22ddf66fd64eda0d5944962869f55f766c5c650e8dbbabd73&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>At least nine soldiers killed in ambush attack in Nigeria's Borno state, sources say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/least-nine-soldiers-killed-ambush-attack-nigerias-borno-state-sources-say-2026-01-05/</link><description>MAIDUGURI, Nigeria, Jan 5 (Reuters) - At least nine Nigerian soldiers were killed and several others injured when their convoy struck a landmine and came under fire in Borno state in northeastern Nigeria, two security sources said on Monday.

The attack took place on Sunday near Bindundul village, about 20 kilometres (12 miles) from Kareto, an area where Islamic State West Africa Province fighters operate freely and often set up checkpoints, according to a military source from the Damasak brigade.

"The terrorists planted a mine that our soldiers stepped on. Unfortunately, about nine soldiers died instantly, while five others were seriously injured," said Abba Kaka Tuja, a member of the Civilian Joint Task Force involved in the rescue operation.

He added that an armoured vehicle was destroyed when the mine detonated, followed by sporadic gunfire from militants.

The soldiers were traveling from Maiduguri to Damasak, the headquarters of Mobbar Local Government Area, when the attack occurred around 1600 GMT, Tuja said.

Military officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Nigeria’s northeast, where ISWAP fighters and Boko Haram have intensified attacks in recent months, targeting military convoys and civilians, is the country’s most conflict-prone region.

Other areas are also tense.

The Brazilian Presidency did not provide further details about Saturday's call.

According to a source from Brazil's government, Lula called Rodriguez to confirm reports he had seen in the media regarding the U.S. military action that removed Maduro from power in Venezuela.

Many Venezuelans said they were still processing the events of Saturday, when a military operation rocked the capital Caracas and other areas, and expect a prolonged period of political and economic uncertainty.

Mariela Gonzalez, 52, the owner of a beauty and makeup business in the northwestern city of Barquisimeto, said that she had chatted with other shopkeepers via WhatsApp and opted to reopen on Monday after closing over the weekend.

"We're afraid, but we can't let ourselves be paralyzed," Gonzalez said.

U.S. President Donald Trump has said the U.S. will "run" Venezuela pending a political transition, while also threatening more military action if a new interim government led by Maduro's former vice president does not cooperate with Washington's demands.

After a spike of panic-buying at the weekend, customer traffic was slower than usual on Monday, said store employees.

"We are open because we have to work and also because there are perishable foods that can spoil. However, people are only coming to buy the basics," said Rosendo Linarez, 38, a supermarket manager in Barquisimeto.

In Venezuela's second-largest city of Maracaibo, in the western state of Zulia, drivers of taxis and buses estimated that over a third of their colleagues were staying home out of fear and for lack of clients.

"There are very few passengers, and a tense calm," said Marielys Urdaneta, a 41-year-old driver, who said she showed up to work because she needed the income. "I went out of necessity ... fear or not, you have to eat," she said.

Douglas Sanchez, who sells snacks from a kiosk in Caracas, agreed.

"You feel anguish, desperation, all of that, but (we) have to go out and work, go out and make our little bit of money to buy food and things. Because if you don't go out to work, you don't have anything," he said.

Daniel Morillo, 30, who migrated to Peru five years ago, was visiting his hometown of Maracaibo for the Christmas holidays. After the events of the weekend he said he was planning to cut his trip short, using his remaining funds to buy medicine and food for his parents.

"I thought I would leave sad just because of the goodbye to my parents ... not with this knot in my chest for leaving them in this uncertainty," Morillo said.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 21:22:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/PN3FR334SRP5BHYEV6OTXQMYV4.jpg?auth=b2bc6a95625c63a1fb448667dfee6a8d88acaddcf83e8e72d59695b58f33c888&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Colombia to continue to work with US on drug trafficking, government says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/colombia-continue-work-with-us-drug-trafficking-government-says-2026-01-05/</link><description>BOGOTA, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Colombia will continue to work with the United States in fighting drug trafficking using Washington's intel and technology, two officials from the South American nation said on Monday.

Aliyev, interviewed by Azeri television channels, said Azerbaijan had been in contact with Donald Trump's U.S. administration with a list of questions about the operation of a peacekeeping force in Gaza.

"We prepared a questionnaire of more than 20 questions and provided it to the American side. No participation in peacekeeping forces is envisaged," Aliyev said.

"I am not considering participation in hostilities outside Azerbaijan at all."

An Azeri government source had said last November that Azerbaijan would provide no troops for such an operation unless there was a complete halt to fighting between Israel and the militant group Hamas.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 21:45:19 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/F7ESATXU3FJRNIMGFZXOV6GJLE.jpg?auth=71e05f9fa7a1c085d58f7506e7b3716d7645c5a482882c129b4365eb930c8276&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>North Korea's Kim inspects memorial for soldiers who died in Russia mission</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/north-koreas-kim-inspects-memorial-soldiers-who-died-russia-mission-2026-01-05/</link><description>SEOUL, Jan 6 (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and his daughter Ju Ae on Monday inspected the construction of a memorial for North Korean troops who died fighting overseas, state media KCNA reported on Tuesday.

Under a mutual defence pact with Russia, in 2024 North Korea sent some 14,000 soldiers to fight alongside Russian troops in Ukraine, where more than 6,000 of them were killed, according to South Korean, Ukrainian and Western sources.

Kim described the dead soldiers as "heroes ... who sacrificed themselves without hesitation", saying "no one in the world can overcome such an army that is absolutely loyal to the orders of the party".

He took part in tree-planting for the memorial with Ju Ae, who wore a red muffler while shoveling earth with her father, KCNA photos showed.

Meanwhile, a photo exhibition detailing North Korea's progress under Kim opened in Pyongyang as the country gears up for a key party congress to be held soon, KCNA said.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 22:48:39 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/R55HLVWOHRMADFD23UMZSO47AQ.jpg?auth=632e47ec82134d70a9a0b046c413616d8aae42d3dff1be78abc5f529dd820fad&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Central African Republic President Touadera wins re-election, results show</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/central-african-republic-president-touadera-wins-re-election-provisional-results-2026-01-05/</link><description>BANGUI, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Central African Republic President Faustin-Archange Touadera has won a third term in office, securing an outright majority in the presidential election held on December 28, provisional results from the electoral commission showed on Monday.

The 68-year-old mathematician who took power a decade ago was seeking a third term after a constitutional referendum in 2023 scrapped the presidential term limit.

He campaigned on his security record in the chronically unstable nation after enlisting help from Russian mercenaries and Rwandan soldiers. He also signed peace deals with several rebel groups this year.

The results announced on Monday showed Touadera received 74.6% of the vote, while former prime minister Anicet-Georges Dologuele received 14% and former prime minister Henri-Marie Dondra received 3.65%.

The main opposition coalition, known by its French acronym BRDC, boycotted the election, saying it would not be fair.

Even before the results were announced, Dologuele and Dondra had cast doubt on their credibility, calling separate press conferences to denounce what they described as election fraud.

Dologuele, the runner-up in the 2020 election, told a press conference on Friday that there had been "a methodical attempt to manipulate" the outcome.

"The Central African people spoke on December 28," Dologuele said. "They expressed a clear desire for change."

The Constitutional Court has until January 20 to adjudicate any challenges and declare definitive results.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 23:22:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KBCNPGHFSZJK7J23RURLZN54JQ.jpg?auth=496f3c420086c9e73d25c2117b568e35a7161a5af398f2b918f1f75bf5530dc3&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Magnitude 6.2 quake strikes western Japan</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/magnitude-62-quake-strikes-western-japan-2026-01-06/</link><description>TOKYO, Jan 6 (Reuters) - An earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 6.2 hit western Japan on Tuesday, the Japan Meteorological Agency said.

US President Donald Trump ’s special envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner will attend the Paris meeting, the latest in a US-led push to end the Russian invasion, which began four years ago next month.

French President Emmanuel Macron is hosting the meeting of the so-called “coalition of the willing” on Tuesday to discuss security guarantees as part of a proposal to end the war between Ukraine and Russia.

The overnight Russian strikes triggered a fire at a private medical clinic in the capital, killing one person and wounding three others, the authorities said.

Emergency services released images of rescuers removing people on stretchers from a gutted building.

“Doctors and nurses were forced to evacuate the wounded under fire,” Ukraine’s Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko said on X.

“It was a terrible night for us,” Margaryta Maliovana, the clinic’s CEO, told AFP.

“One person died. A young man, 30 years old, was killed,” she said, adding that there were 26 patients in the clinic at the moment of the strike.

The pre-dawn attack also killed a man in his 70s in the neighbouring city of Fastiv, the Kyiv regional governor said.

The strikes caused power outages in the area, with backup systems activated to maintain water and heating supplies, the official said, as temperatures dropped to -8C.

Russia launched a total of 165 drones and at least nine missiles overnight, the Ukrainian air force said.

European leaders are in Paris on Tuesday, seeking a breakthrough on a plan to end the fighting that Kyiv says is “90 percent” ready.

“This week, we will be working with our European and American partners to ensure that Ukraine has the assistance it needs,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Monday.

To lay the groundwork, security advisers from 15 countries, including Britain, France and Germany, as well as representatives from NATO and the European Union, gathered in Kyiv over the weekend.

US envoy Witkoff joined the talks virtually, a Ukrainian official told AFP, though the United States ’ large-scale military attack on Venezuela earlier in the day overshadowed proceedings.

Another preparatory meeting between chiefs of staff is scheduled for Monday.

Diplomatic efforts to end Europe’s deadliest conflict since World War II have gained pace in recent weeks, though both Moscow and Kyiv remain at odds over the key issue of territory in a post-war settlement.

Russia, which occupies around 20 percent of Ukraine, is pushing for full control of the country’s eastern Donbas region as part of a deal.

But Kyiv has warned that ceding ground will embolden Moscow and said it will not sign a peace deal that fails to deter Russia from invading again.

On Monday, Russia said it had seized the village of Grabovske in Ukraine’s north-eastern Sumy region, from where Kyiv had last month accused Moscow of forcibly relocating dozens of residents.

Bombarded daily and losing ground, Ukraine has responded with its own drone attacks launched towards Russian territory, targeting in particular energy infrastructure that funds the war effort.

Trump on Sunday dismissed claims by Moscow that Kyiv had launched a drone at one of Russian President Vladimir Putin ’s residences.

“I don’t believe that strike happened,” Trump said in response to a reporter’s question aboard Air Force One. Kyiv has also rejected the accusation.

Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, triggering a conflict that has killed tens, if not hundreds, of thousands, devastated eastern Ukraine and forced millions to flee their homes.

Putin has vowed to press on with his military campaign if his hardline demands are not met at the negotiating table.

Russia in 2025 gained the most ground on the battlefield since the first year of its offensive, according to AFP analysis.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 01:47:08 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/570fe164-dee1-11f0-bee9-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25353746236838.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US scraps universal child vaccine guidance, drawing expert concern</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260106-us-scraps-universal-child-vaccine-guidance</link><description>The United States ended on Monday its longstanding guidance that all children receive vaccines against flu and three other diseases, a sweeping change that advances one of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s long-term goals.

Public health experts warn the latest rollback could lead to preventable hospitalisations and deaths.

The action, which removes the recommendation for rotavirus, influenza, meningococcal disease and hepatitis A, and states that parents should consult healthcare providers under what it calls shared clinical-decision-making, was approved by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Acting Director Jim O’Neill without the agency’s usual outside expert review. It advances Kennedy’s campaign to pare back childhood vaccinations.

Last month, President Donald Trump urged the US to “align with other developed nations” by reducing the number of shots for children.

Trump said the new schedule was "rooted in the Gold Standard of Science" and aligns the United States with other developed nations. In a post on his Truth Social platform, the president congratulated Kennedy and other health officials on the change.

"Many Americans, especially the 'MAHA Moms', have been praying for these COMMON SENSE reforms for many years. Thank you for your attention to this matter!" he wrote, referring to Kennedy's Make America Healthy Again movement.

Kennedy, a prominent vaccine critic, has previously led efforts to drop universal recommendations for COVID-19 and hepatitis B shots for children, citing links to autism that scientists have repeatedly debunked.

Vaccine experts decried the changes they said put American children at risk.

Dr Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, said there should have been public discussion on the risks and benefits of the potential impact of dropping the recommendations.

Dr Sean O'Leary, chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said other developed countries face different disease risks and have different healthcare systems than the United States. Unlike the US, which depends on private healthcare, most countries provide basic universal healthcare that is paid for by the government.

"Any decision about the US childhood vaccination schedule should be grounded in evidence, transparency and established scientific processes, not comparisons that overlook critical differences between countries or health systems," he said.

For the change in policy, two leading officials of the Department of Health and Human Services, Martin Kulldorff and Tracy Beth Hoeg, reviewed vaccine protocols in 20 other developed countries — all of which have universal healthcare — and made the recommendations to change the US schedule, the agency said.

In a report, HHS wrote that the level of risk varies by disease and child.

The vaccine schedules of the 20 reviewed countries show that the flu shot is recommended universally in four countries and a shot against hepatitis A is universal only in Greece. The rotavirus shot is recommended for all children in 17 of the 20 countries and shots against meningococcal disease are recommended in 16.

Each of the four vaccines prevents diseases that once caused unnecessary hospitalizations and death in children, said Dr Jesse Goodman, a Georgetown University professor and former FDA chief scientist.

Flu shots can help prevent pediatric deaths from flu, which killed 288 children in the 2024–25 season, according to the CDC. Hepatitis A, which infects the liver, usually resolves on its own but can lead to hospitalisation and lifelong liver damage.

Rotavirus, which causes severe diarrhoea and dehydration, used to send tens of thousands of children to the hospital each year, but vaccines have made this extremely rare, Goodman said.

While meningitis, a bacterial infection of the brain, is rare in children, some 15% of those infected do not respond to antibiotics and die, he said. "If you can safely prevent it, it makes total sense."

The updated recommendations maintain immunisations for 11 diseases , including measles, mumps, and varicella, while categorizing others as either targeted for high-risk groups or subject to the shared-decision-making category, HHS said.

Insurance providers will continue covering immunisation costs regardless of the category, senior HHS officials told reporters on a call.

The new schedule also recommends US children receive a single dose of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, rather than a two-dose course. Recent studies have concluded that a single dose is not inferior to the longer course and noted the World Health Organization also backs a single-dose schedule.

Merck, which makes Gardasil, the only US-approved HPV vaccine, was not immediately available for comment. The drugmaker has said that since there is not sufficient data for the US FDA to license the shot as a single-dose regimen, the CDC's recommendations should be in line with the agency's approval.

Merck recorded $2.4 billion in US Gardasil sales in 2024.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 01:47:10 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/5ae2ee6a-c674-11f0-820b-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25324542716106.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukraine's allies meet with aim to make security pledges concrete</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/ukraines-allies-meet-with-aim-make-security-pledges-concrete-2026-01-06/</link><description>PARIS, Jan 6 (Reuters) - Ukraine's allies meet in Paris on Tuesday, seeking to finalise as much as possible their contributions to future security guarantees to reassure Kyiv in the event of a ceasefire with Russia, diplomats and officials said.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy will be joined by more than 27 leaders in the French capital, along with senior U.S. negotiators Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, as part of broader efforts to put together a common Ukrainian, European and American position that could then be taken to Russia.

Talks to bring the almost four-year conflict to an end have accelerated since November. However, there have been few signals Russia would be willing to accept current proposals on the table, with the issue of territory remaining a key obstacle to negotiations and fighting between the two sides showing no signs of abating.

Ahead of Tuesday's meeting diplomats said military officials, including the head of Ukraine's general staff, were in Paris to put concrete commitments on paper so that leaders could provide political backing. Until now, military pledges have largely been vague.

According to a note sent to the 35 invited delegations and reviewed by Reuters, the meeting will focus on securing contributions to a multinational force for Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire, in coordination with Ukraine and with U.S. support.

The hosts also aim to agree contributions for a wider set of security guarantees for Ukraine, including binding commitments if it is attacked again. Efforts will be made to ensure that planning by the so-called "Coalition of the Willing" contributing countries will be coordinated with the negotiating positions of Ukraine, the U.S. and Europe.

The note also suggests agreeing next steps to increase support for Ukraine and pressure on Russia should Moscow refuse to engage in meaningful negotiations.

"We have reached agreement on the operational details of the security guarantees," a French presidency official told reporters ahead of the summit. "We will explain how they are structured and the need for a long-term commitment from everyone involved."

A senior European official said the hope was that firming up the coalition's guarantees would also help cement U.S. commitments, which have been broadly outlined in bilateral discussions with Ukraine.

In his evening address to the nation on Sunday, Zelenskiy said the meetings in Europe should become one more contribution to Ukraine's defence and bring closer efforts to end the war.

"Ukraine will prepare for both scenarios: diplomacy, which we are pursuing, or further active defence if pressure from partners on Russia proves insufficient. Ukraine wants peace," he said.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 03:40:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/JVCO6ZGT55OBZGUT5AQQZXLOVQ.jpg?auth=86a54ad5204733386094d81cfebafad47adcb0b8ca890fee56b65c3290ecbf57&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Flash floods in Indonesia's North Sulawesi kill 14, four still missing</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/flash-floods-indonesias-north-sulawesi-kill-14-four-still-missing-2026-01-06/</link><description>JAKARTA, Jan 6 (Reuters) - At least 14 people were killed after being swept away by flash floods in Indonesia's North Sulawesi, an official said on Tuesday, as the search for the missing continued.

Heavy rain early on Monday triggered flash floods on the island of Siau, located in the region of Siau Tagulandang Biaro, said Nuriadin Gumeleng, a spokesperson for the local rescue agency.

Sixteen rescuers have been deployed to search for four people who remain missing on Tuesday, Gumeleng told Reuters, adding that 18 people had been injured so far.

"We continue to collect data from local residents in case there are more missing people," he said.

As of Tuesday, main roads in the affected areas were still covered by rocks, debris and thick mud, Gumeleneg said.

At least 444 people have been evacuated to local schools and churches after the flash floods, the country disaster mitigation agency spokesperson Abdul Muhari said in a statement.

Authorities have deployed excavators to clear roads that have been blocked by the debris and mud, he said.

The floods also destroyed hundreds of houses and government buildings, North Sulawesi governor Yulius Selvanus said.

The flash floods took place in the peak of the wet season in Sulawesi island, as forecast by Indonesia's weather agency.

The islands of Java, Sulawesi, Maluku, and Papua are expected to experience their peak wet seasons over January and February this year, bringing more risks of floods, the weather agency had said.

Rain in other parts of Indonesia like Sumatra and Borneo reached its peak in November and December last year.

Last November, cyclone-induced floods and landslides killed more than 1,000 people in Sumatra , with hundreds still missing.

"Actually, I spoke with President Trump on October 10, the same day the (Noble Peace) Prize was announced, (but) not since then," Machado said on Fox News' "Hannity" program.

She was awarded the prize for her fight against what the Norwegian Nobel Committee called a dictatorship.

Machado - widely seen now deposed Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro 's most credible opponent- left Venezuela last month to travel to Norway to accept the award, and hasn't returned since.

"I'm planning to go as soon as possible back home," she told Fox News when asked about her plans to return to Venezuela.

The interview was Machado's first since the U.S. launched strikes on Venezuela on Saturday and captured its president.

She welcomed the U.S. actions as "a huge step for humanity, for freedom and human dignity."

Venezuela's vice president and oil minister Delcy Rodriguez was sworn in as interim president on Monday, but Washington's move over the weekend has left many to wonder about the future leadership of the South American country.

Trump on Saturday dismissed the idea of working with Machado, saying "she doesn't have the support within or the respect within the country."</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 03:41:32 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/L6HYQKEB5NJP3KLEM2FBTN76XI.jpg?auth=359a6a06e3a5ddf01e0b199b8897c9a184911394646153ecd098c69e0d8fa044&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US Republicans insist no 'endless war' looms in Venezuela</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-republicans-insist-no-endless-war-looms-venezuela-2026-01-06/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 5 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump does not plan to occupy or nation-build in Venezuela, Republican U.S. lawmakers said on Monday after attending a briefing by top officials on the administration's policy toward the South American nation.

"We do not have U.S. armed forces in Venezuela, and we are not occupying that country," Republican House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana told reporters after the classified session with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and other senior officials.

"If anybody wants to use the term nation-building, or anything like that, it doesn't look like anything anybody has seen under President Trump," said Representative Brian Mast, the Republican chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.

"They are not the protracted war administration," Mast told reporters after the briefing, which lasted more than 2-1/2 hours, when asked how he would reassure Americans they did not face another 'endless war,' like the 20-year conflict in Afghanistan.

Trump sent U.S. troops into Caracas early on Saturday to seize Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, who pleaded not guilty earlier on Monday to narcotics charges.

Maduro's capture rattled world leaders, left officials in Caracas scrambling to regroup and angered some U.S. Democrats, who said Rubio and other Trump administration officials had lied to them by insisting they were not planning regime change in Venezuela.

Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Senate's Democratic leader, told reporters Monday's briefing had been extensive but posed more questions than it answered.

"Their plan for the U.S. running Venezuela is vague, based on wishful thinking and unsatisfying," he said.

Schumer said he had not received assurances that Trump would not do the same thing in other countries. Republicans also left open that possibility. "There's absolutely a continual plan to use the United States military to protect the homeland of the United States of America," Mast said.

The Senate is due to vote as soon as this week on whether to block further military action against Venezuela without congressional approval, a resolution co-sponsored by Schumer.

Republicans insist the weekend operation did not require congressional approval because it was very short and involved "law enforcement" to bring Maduro to court in New York.

Members of Congress, including some Republicans as well as Democrats, have long accused presidents of seeking to sidestep the Constitution's requirement that Congress, not the president, approve anything other than brief and limited military action needed to defend the United States.

Republicans have defeated repeated attempts to pass similar war powers resolutions since Trump four months ago sent U.S. forces to the Caribbean, where they have been firing missiles at vessels Washington says are carrying drugs.

Trump's administration accuses Maduro of overseeing a cocaine-trafficking network that partnered with violent groups including Mexico’s Sinaloa and Zetas cartels, Colombia's FARC rebels and Venezuela's Tren de Aragua gang.

"I am innocent. I am not guilty. I am a decent man. I am still president of my country," Maduro, 63, said through an interpreter, before being cut off by US District Judge Alvin Hellerstein in Manhattan federal court.

Maduro's wife Cilia Flores also pleaded not guilty. The next court date was set for March 17.

Dozens of protesters, both pro- and anti-Maduro, gathered outside the courthouse before the half-hour hearing.

Hours later in Caracas, Maduro's vice president, Delcy Rodriguez, was sworn in as Venezuela's interim president with words of support for Maduro but no indication she would fight the US move.

A recent US intelligence assessment determined Rodriguez would be best positioned to lead a temporary government in Maduro's absence, finding that opposition figures such as Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Corina Machado or onetime presidential candidate Edmundo Gonzalez would struggle to gain legitimacy, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the classified report.

While many anti-Maduro activists had assumed this would be their moment, Trump appeared to have sidelined the Venezuelan opposition for now. Instead, he has suggested Rodriguez was willing to work with Washington.

In Caracas, senior officials from Maduro's 13-year-old government remain in charge of the South American oil producer of 30 million people, alternating between spitting defiance and possible cooperation with the Trump administration.

The intelligence assessment concluded that Rodriguez was among the few Venezuelan leaders capable of maintaining order, along with the interior and defense ministers, in a government dominated by ideological opponents of the US, the Wall Street Journal said.

Rodriguez's brother, Jorge Rodriguez, was reappointed president of the overwhelmingly pro-Maduro National Assembly on Monday. He pledged "to use all procedures, forums and spaces" to bring Maduro back.

Trump told NBC News the US was not at war with Venezuela. Rather, "we're at war with the people that sell drugs," he said.

The US would need to help address the South American country's problems before any new elections, Trump said, calling a 30-day timeline for a vote unrealistic.

"We have to fix the country first. You can’t have an election. There’s no way the people could even vote," Trump told NBC.

Maduro is accused of overseeing a cocaine-trafficking network that partnered with violent groups including Mexico ’s Sinaloa and Zetas cartels, Colombian FARC rebels and Venezuela's Tren de Aragua gang.

He faces four criminal counts: narco-terrorism, cocaine importation conspiracy and possession of machine guns and destructive devices.

Maduro has long denied the allegations, saying they were a mask for imperialist designs on Venezuela's rich oil reserves. Trump has made no secret of wanting to share in Venezuela's oil riches. US oil companies' shares jumped on Monday, fueled by the prospect of access to those vast reserves.

While world leaders and US politicians grappled with the extraordinary seizure of a head of state, the United Nations Security Council debated the implications of the raid, which was condemned by Russia, China and leftist allies of Venezuela.

UN chief Antonio Guterres raised concerns about instability in Venezuela and the legality of Trump's strike, the most dramatic US intervention in Latin America since the 1989 Panama invasion. US Special Forces swooped into Caracas by helicopter on Saturday, shattered Maduro's security cordon and dragged him from the threshold of a safe room.

On Monday morning, Maduro – his hands zip-tied – and his wife were escorted by armed guards in tactical gear from a Brooklyn detention center to a helicopter bound for the Manhattan federal court. Shackled at the ankles and wearing orange and beige prison garb, Maduro listened to an interpreter through headphones as Judge Hellerstein summarised the charges.

Hellerstein asked Maduro to stand and confirm his identity. He replied in Spanish.

The judge told the couple of their right to inform the Venezuelan consulate of their arrests.

Prosecutors say Maduro has been involved in drug trafficking from the time he began serving in Venezuela's National Assembly in 2000 to his tenure as foreign minister and subsequent 2013 election as the late President Hugo Chavez 's successor.

Maduro lawyer Barry Pollack said he anticipated voluminous and complex litigation over what he called his client's "military abduction." He said Maduro was not requesting his release but may later.

Flores' lawyer, Mark Donnelly, said she sustained significant injuries including severe bruising on her ribs and asked that she be provided X-rays and a physical evaluation.

Federal prosecutors in New York first indicted Maduro in 2020 as part of a long-running narcotics trafficking case against current and former Venezuelan officials and Colombian guerrillas. An updated indictment made public on Saturday added some new details and co-defendants, including Flores.

The US has considered Maduro an illegitimate dictator since he declared victory in a 2018 election marred by allegations of massive irregularities.

Experts in international law have questioned the legality of the raid, with some condemning Trump's actions as a repudiation of a rules-based international order.

American oil companies will return to Venezuela and rebuild the sector's infrastructure, Trump told reporters on Air Force One on Sunday.

"We're taking back what they stole," Trump said. "We're in charge."

Trump said then that the administration had tipped off US oil companies about the operation, but in the NBC interview he said: "The oil companies were absolutely aware that we were thinking about doing something. But we didn’t tell them we were going to do it."

He added that the US may subsidize the rebuilding of the country's oil infrastructure by US majors, a project he said could be completed in less than 18 months.

CBS News, citing two unnamed sources, said representatives of oil majors Exxon Mobil, ConocoPhillips and Chevron Corp would meet with Energy Secretary Chris Wright on Thursday.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 03:42:03 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/d5d37160-ea98-11f0-90e9-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26005726470968-1.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Irish PM aims for deeper trade talks with China in Beijing</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/irish-pm-aims-deeper-trade-talks-with-china-beijing-2026-01-06/</link><description>BEIJING, Jan 6 (Reuters) - Ireland's Prime Minister Micheal Martin is set to have more in-depth talks on trade with China's No. 2 official on Tuesday, working to strengthen strategic ties with the world's second-largest economy amid frosty China-European Union relations.

Martin's scheduled meeting with Chinese Premier Li Qiang forms part of his five-day trip that he said would include "a significant economic dimension", a clip posted on the Irish Taoiseach's X handle on Monday evening showed.

The Irish leader was seen in the clip telling media that he would discuss with Li in "greater detail" trade issues such as beef exports and China's recently imposed tariffs on dairy, a day after a summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping.

"I discussed obviously the situation in terms of Irish beef exports into China, the tariff situation in respect of dairy products," Martin said, adding that Xi "undertook to engage with Chinese officials in respect of those specific issues."

Martin described his meeting with Xi on Monday as a "warm and constructive engagement", covering a range of issues including bilateral and EU-China ties.

"On a broader level, I think the President was keen that Europe and China would have a broader framework to govern trade into the future," he said.

Xi had told Martin during the meeting that China and the EU should "bear the long-term picture in mind", according to state news agency Xinhua.

Ties between China and the EU have been tense since the EU imposed levies on Chinese electric vehicle imports in 2024. China has since retaliated with a series of measures including the latest tariffs on EU dairy products .

Last week, China also set import quotas and additional tariffs on beef imports from this year, a move affecting global exporters of the meat into the Asian country.

The first Taoiseach to visit China since 2012, Martin has recently downplayed the Irish intelligence agency's portrayal of China as a "hostile state actor", preferring instead to adopt a long-term and strategic understanding of China.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 04:40:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/Z7BUYXXK6VIQXMW2WCX3AWWKTQ.jpg?auth=f1288f8087e343eee996cb63f8012469d73af86e984ca154d073a662addb228f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Over a dozen media workers detained in Venezuela, says national press association</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/over-dozen-media-workers-detained-venezuela-says-national-press-association-2026-01-06/</link><description>Jan 5 (Reuters) - More than a dozen media workers were detained on Monday while covering events in the Venezuelan capital Caracas, including a march in support of ousted President Nicolas Maduro and the swearing-in of the country's new legislature, the South American nation's press association said.

All 14 of those detained were later released, the press association (SNTP) said on X, though one was a foreign journalist who was deported.

SNTP said that those detained included 11 people working with international media outlets and one with a national outlet.

Reuters was unable to independently confirm all of the detentions.

Venezuela's information ministry, which handles all contact with the government, did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the detentions. Venezuela's Ministry of Communications also did not respond to requests for comment.

The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and CNN did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Reuters also did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The press detentions come after the U.S. military detained Maduro in an overnight operation this weekend. On Monday the deposed leader pleaded not guilty to narcoterrorism charges in a New York court.

His vice president, Delcy Rodriguez, has since taken the reins as interim leader.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:25:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/EVZGV7BHVBLYRLK3G4QX4I5TDY.jpg?auth=7b052cfb286afc2bb66dc7cc44db4b05182bc966d0c3ef0cb8ba6268d5c52052&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Dutch train traffic halted due to snow and ice</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/dutch-train-traffic-halted-due-snow-ice-2026-01-06/</link><description>AMSTERDAM, Jan 6 (Reuters) - Snow and ice continued to disrupt traffic in the Netherlands on Tuesday halting all trains and forcing the cancellation of hundreds of flights.

The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology, also known as Phivolcs, raised the alert to level three on a five-level scale, which means magma is pushing up inside the volcano and forming a lava dome at the summit.

Phivolcs urged residents within the 6-km no-go zone to evacuate because of risks like lava flows, falling rocks, and other hazards.

Mayon is the most active of 22 volcanoes in the Philippines, having erupted more than 50 times in the last four centuries. Its last magmatic eruption was in June 2023 when it spewed lava and noxious gases.

The most destructive eruption came in February 1841 when lava flows buried an entire town and killed 1,200 people.

The Philippines lies on the "Ring of Fire", a belt of volcanoes circling the Pacific Ocean that is also prone to earthquakes.

Phivolcs urged civil aviation authorities to advise pilots to avoid flying near Mayon's summit because ash from a sudden eruption can be hazardous to aircraft.

Since January 1, 2026, PHIVOLCS has recorded 346 rockfalls and 4 volcanic earthquakes, compared to 599 rockfalls in November–December 2025.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 07:29:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China, South Korea to carry out cultural exchanges in orderly manner, Beijing says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-south-korea-carry-out-cultural-exchanges-orderly-manner-beijing-says-2026-01-06/</link><description>BEIJING, Jan 6 (Reuters) - China and South Korea agreed to carry out cultural exchanges in an orderly manner, the Chinese foreign ministry said on Tuesday, when asked if Beijing would welcome South Korean culture exports in the future.

Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, made their first appearance in Hellerstein's Manhattan courtroom on Monday, pleading not guilty to narco-terrorism and other charges.

Maduro was indicted in 2020 in a sprawling drug trafficking case that has been before Hellerstein for nearly 15 years and has already seen the conviction of Venezuela 's former intelligence chief, Hugo Armando Carvajal.

A graduate of Columbia University law school, Hellerstein served as a lawyer in the US Army from 1957 to 1960 before entering private practice.

He was nominated by former president Bill Clinton in 1998 to be a district court judge for the Southern District of New York .

During his lengthy career, Hellerstein has presided over several civil cases stemming from the September 11, 2001 al Qaeda attacks on New York and Washington.

He has also tangled at times with US President Donald Trump , rejecting a request by the president to have his New York hush money case moved to federal court.

Hellerstein also blocked the Trump administration last year from deporting alleged Venezuelan gang members without a court hearing.

In September, he sentenced tech start-up highflier Charlie Javice to more than seven years in prison after she was convicted of defrauding JPMorgan Chase on a $175 million deal.

A decades-old border dispute between the Southeast Asian nations erupted into military clashes several times last year, with fighting in December killing dozens of people and displacing around one million on both sides.

The two countries agreed a fragile truce on December 27 , ending three weeks of clashes.

"Cambodia has violated the ceasefire" on Tuesday morning, the Thai army said in a statement, accusing Cambodian forces of firing mortar rounds into Thailand's Ubon Ratchathani province.

One soldier was wounded by shrapnel, it added.

The Thai army said in a later statement that the Cambodian side had contacted a Thai military unit and claimed "there was no intention to fire into Thai territory", adding "the incident was caused by an operational error by Cambodian personnel".

The Thai military said it warned Cambodian forces to exercise caution, stressing if a similar incident occurred, Thailand may need to retaliate.

Cambodia's defence ministry spokeswoman Maly Socheata said two Cambodian soldiers were injured, one severely, on Tuesday morning in Cambodia's Preah Vihear province, which sits opposite Thailand's Ubon Ratchathani.

While Cambodian forces were performing "organisation and orderliness" duties, "an explosion occurred from a pile of garbage", she said, resulting in the two injured soldiers being hospitalised.

Socheata did not mention the strike alleged by Thailand, but said both nations' border coordination teams had consulted on the incident involving the Cambodian soldiers and addressed the matter.

The explosion occurred in a frontier region known as the Emerald Triangle, Socheata added where the borders of both countries and Laos meet.

In May, a Cambodian soldier was killed in a firefight with Thai troops in the area, reigniting the border conflict.

Thailand's Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said his government had lodged a protest with Phnom Penh, stating "the truce was violated".

"At the military-to-military level, we have been told the incident was an accident, but we are seeking clarification on how responsibility will be taken," Anutin told reporters in Bangkok.

Charnvirakul added that Thailand had the "capability to respond" to Cambodia, which is vastly outgunned by its neighbour.

The nations' long-standing conflict stems from a dispute over the colonial-era demarcation of their 800-kilometre (500-mile) border, where both sides claim territory and centuries-old temple ruins.

Under the December truce, Cambodia and Thailand pledged to cease fire, freeze troop movements and cooperate on demining efforts along their border.

On December 31, Bangkok released 18 Cambodian soldiers held since July when border clashes that month killed dozens of people.

Thailand's foreign ministry said their release was "a demonstration of goodwill and confidence-building".

Phnom Penh said last week it remained "hopeful" that their return would "significantly contribute to building mutual trust".

The United States, China and Malaysia had brokered a truce to end the fighting between Cambodia and Thailand in July, but that ceasefire was short-lived.

On Saturday, one week after the December truce went into effect, Cambodia called on Thailand to pull out its forces from several border areas Phnom Penh claims as its own.

The Thai military has rejected claims it had used force to seize Cambodia territory, insisting its forces were present in areas that had always belonged to Thailand.

While the two nations agreed late last month to stop fighting, they still need to resolve the demarcation of their disputed border.

Cambodia's defence ministry said in a statement Tuesday that Phnom Penh had proposed a bilateral border committee meeting with Thai counterparts to be held in Cambodia's Siem Reap province this month.

Bangkok has said previously that meetings to discuss border surveying and demarcation may need to be held by Thailand's next government, following elections scheduled for February 8.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 09:27:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/c8a78fcc-ead3-11f0-a772-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25361164510579.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Maduro opponent Machado vows to return to Venezuela, wants election</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/maduro-opponent-machado-vows-return-venezuela-wants-election-2026-01-06/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 6 (Reuters) - Venezuela's main opposition leader Maria Corina Machado has vowed to return home quickly, praising U.S. President Donald Trump for toppling her enemy Nicolas Maduro and declaring her movement ready to win a free election.

"I'm planning to go back to Venezuela as soon as possible," said Machado, 58, a lawyer and mother-of-three who escaped from Venezuela in disguise in October to receive the Nobel Peace Prize, which she dedicated to Trump.

"We believe that this transition should move forward," she told Fox News in an interview late on Monday. "We won an election (in 2024) by a landslide under fraudulent conditions. In free and fair elections, we will win over 90% of the votes."

Machado said she had not spoken to Trump since October 10, when the Nobel award was announced. He has said the United States needs to help address Venezuela's problems before any new elections, calling a 30-day timeline for a vote unrealistic.

"We have to fix the country first. You can’t have an election. There’s no way the people could even vote," Trump told NBC.

In the interview, her first since Maduro was captured by the U.S. at the weekend, Machado did not give her location or any more details on plans to repatriate to Venezuela, where she is wanted for arrest and Socialist Party loyalists remain in power .

To the disappointment of opposition activists and the large diaspora - one in five Venezuelans have left during an economic implosion under Maduro and his predecessor Hugo Chavez - Trump has given little indication of backing Machado.

The opposition, some international observers and many U.S. allies say the opposition was cheated of victory in the 2024 election, from which Machado was banned and an ally stood instead, but Trump has said she lacks support in Venezuela.

The U.S. administration appears so far to be hoping to work with interim President Delcy Rodriguez , a diehard Maduro ally who has denounced his "kidnapping" while also calling for cooperation and respectful relations with Washington.

"Delcy Rodriguez, as you know, is one of the main architects of torture, persecution, corruption, narco-trafficking," Machado said. "She's a main ally and liaison of Russia, China, Iran, certainly not an individual who could be trusted by international investors and she's really rejected by the Venezuelan people."

Machado, who has galvanised an often fractured and demoralised opposition in the last few years, was fulsome in her praise of Trump, saying she would give him the Nobel prize personally.

"He has proven to the world what he means. January 3rd will go down in history as the day justice defeated a tyranny," she said of Saturday's raid on Venezuela.

"I do want to say today on behalf of the Venezuelan people how grateful we are for his courageous vision, the historical actions he has taken against this narco-terrorist regime ... It's a huge step towards a democratic transition."

With the largest oil reserves in the world and the U.S. as its main ally, Venezuela would become the energy hub of the Americas, restore rule of law, open markets, bring exiles home and provide security to foreign investment, Machado promised.

For now, however, Trump has been told by the CIA that Rodriguez and other senior officials from Maduro's government are the best bet to maintain stability, sources said.

They have ordered the arrest of anyone who collaborated with the seizure of Maduro and, in a sign of the nervous atmosphere in Venezuela, 14 media workers were briefly detained covering events in Caracas on Monday.

Footage verified by Reuters showed shots being fired into the night sky in Caracas, which a Venezuelan official said came from police to deter unauthorised drones.

"There was no confrontation, the entire country remains completely calm," vice minister of communications Simon Arrechider told reporters in a message.

Maduro, 63, pleaded not guilty on Monday to narcotics charges, He said he was a "decent man" and still president of Venezuela while standing in a Manhattan court shackled at the ankles and wearing orange and beige prison garb .

His wife Cilia Flores, who was also captured, pleaded innocent. They are next due in court on March 17.

Maduro is accused of overseeing a cocaine-trafficking network with international drug cartels and faces four criminal counts: narco-terrorism, cocaine importation conspiracy and possession of machine guns and destructive devices.

He has long denied the allegations, saying they were a mask for imperialist designs on Venezuela's oil reserves.

Venezuela has the world's largest reserves - about 303 billion barrels, mostly heavy oil in the Orinoco region. But the sector has long been in decline from mismanagement, under-investment and U.S. sanctions, averaging 1.1 million bpd output last year, a third of its output in the 1970s.

Maduro's vice president, Rodriguez, has been sworn in as interim leader as officials in Caracas waver between angry defiance and potential cooperation with Trump, who has threatened another military strike if they displease him.

Trump's actions, the biggest U.S. intervention in Latin America since the 1989 invasion of Panama, have brought condemnation from Russia, China and Venezuela's leftist allies. Legal experts have questioned its validity and many allies have urged adherence to international laws and dialogue.

Trump has said the U.S. is now in charge of Venezuela and will help revive its oil industry with the help of private companies.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 10:24:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/D37QWXG4AVKCJJVMLKZAJI5IDI.jpg?auth=fbfe4c142e7c5512354ce7973ea8bd701be6847d8aef4119c4a587120533ccd9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>No safety inspections at site of Swiss bar fire since 2019, mayor says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/no-safety-inspections-done-site-swiss-bar-fire-between-2020-25-says-mayor-2026-01-06/</link><description>GENEVA, Jan 6 - No safety inspections were carried out since 2019 at the Swiss bar that burst into flames at New Year, killing 40 people, the mayor of the town of Crans-Montana said on Tuesday.

"We are profoundly sorry. We did not have an indication that the checks had not been done," Crans-Montana Mayor Nicolas Feraud told reporters on the absence of fire checks between 2020-2025.

The mayor added that the sound-proof foam used in the bar "Le Constellation" was considered acceptable at the time.

Prosecutors have said that the fire that spread rapidly in the early hours of January 1 was likely caused by sparkling candles igniting the ceiling of the bar's basement.

All sparkler candles have now been banned inside venues, said the mayor at the press conference.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 10:25:08 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4BLMEVFPKZPFRP2CZOHBSQMPDM.jpg?auth=f108ef0dfbdddbbf38a0e47b05b575b4c127cb291344d92cc20bf4f7edf7f075&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Pope Leo, closing Catholic Holy Year, urges kindness to foreigners</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/pope-leo-closing-catholic-holy-year-urges-kindness-foreigners-2026-01-06/</link><description>VATICAN CITY, Jan 6 (Reuters) - Pope Leo closed the Catholic Church's Holy Year on Tuesday by sealing shut the special "Holy Door" in St. Peter's Basilica and urging Christians worldwide to help those in need and treat foreigners with kindness.

Leo, who has made care for immigrants a central theme of his early papacy, said at a Vatican ceremony that the record 33.5 million pilgrims who visited Rome during the Holy Year should have learned not to treat humans as mere "products".

"Around us, a distorted economy tries to profit from everything," said the pope. "After this year, will we be better able to recognise a pilgrim in the visitor, a seeker in the stranger, a neighbour in the foreigner?"

Holy years, or jubilees, typically occur every 25 years and are considered a time of peace, forgiveness and pardon. Pilgrims to Rome can enter special "Holy Doors" at four Rome basilicas, and can attend papal audiences throughout the year.

At 9:41 a.m. (0841 GMT) on Tuesday, Leo, dressed in gold-trimmed robes, pulled shut the special bronze door at St. Peter's, officially ending the year.

The next jubilee is not expected before 2033, when the Church may have a special one to mark 2,000 years since the death of Jesus.

Vatican and Italian officials said on Monday that pilgrims to Rome for the 2025 jubilee came from 185 countries , with Italy, the United States, Spain, Brazil and Poland leading the pack.

The 2025 jubilee was marked by an historical rarity not seen for 300 years. It was opened by one pope, Francis, and closed by his successor, Leo.

Francis died in April after 12 years leading the 1.4-billion-member Church. The last jubilee held under two popes was in the year 1700, when Clement XI closed a holy year opened by Innocent XII.

Leo, who has pledged to keep Francis' signature policies such as welcoming gay Catholics and discussing women's ordination , echoed the late pope's frequent criticisms of the global economic system on Tuesday.

Leo, the first U.S. pope, lamented that the markets "turn human yearnings of seeking, travelling and beginning again into a mere business."</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 10:25:19 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/32HIYYETORKJPFG6FNQERXZ4AE.jpg?auth=2c1ac84944aea09dffc675bcd06985e920d8e4d75eff59580e73cd16f4a6082d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Former Uvalde school officer accused of failing to act against shooter who killed 19 students, two teachers</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/former-uvalde-school-officer-accused-failing-act-against-shooter-who-killed-19-2026-01-06/</link><description>Jan 6 (Reuters) - One of the first police officers on the scene of the 2022 attack at a Texas elementary school that killed 19 students and two teachers is now the first to stand trial, accused of failing to act as the gunman continued one of the deadliest mass killings targeting students in U.S. history.

Opening arguments were to begin Tuesday in the trial of Adrian Gonzales, 52, who was a member of the school district police force. Hundreds of officers from local, state and federal agencies waited 77 minutes before entering a classroom where the gunman was holed up. Teachers and children made lengthy calls to 911 emergency services, saying they were in the room with the gunman and surrounded by bodies.

Gonzales was charged in 2024 with 29 counts of child endangerment, according to his indictment, which said that he "failed to engage, distract, and delay the shooter" and that he also failed "to follow his active shooter training to respond to gun fire by advancing toward the gun fire."

Each count carries the possibility of two years in prison. Gonzales has pleaded not guilty. Gonzales' attorney, Nico LaHood, has said that his client showed up to help children, and that he did in fact help many evacuate.

Pedro "Pete" Arredondo, the former chief of the Uvalde schools police and the person who investigators say was the officer in charge of the scene, faces 10 counts of the same charge. His trial has not yet been scheduled.

State and federal investigations into the shooting found that officers left the 18-year-old gunman alone inside the classroom with children while weighing how to confront him.

By the time a tactical team led by Border Patrol officers stormed in, the toll had reached among the worst in the history of a country known for high-profile school shootings.

Debates between proponents of gun control measures and defenders of the constitutional right to bear arms have resulted in few restrictions on firearms in the United States compared to other industrialized nations.

Former U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland, in remarks made while presenting the federal report on Uvalde in 2024 , said that "lives would have been saved" had the police immediately confronted the gunman.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 10:25:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/6EH5QJBDIBLIBERK2RQKM5H5OA.jpg?auth=f9be34713ee46540414f5a76bdfccbdef6142de2f051ea2bd3d53fab9dc94eca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Tourists on remote Yemeni island stranded after Saudi, UAE rift</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/tourists-remote-yemeni-island-stranded-after-saudi-uae-rift-2026-01-06/</link><description>DUBAI, Jan 6 - When the United Arab Emirates withdrew its troops from Yemen last week under a deadline from Saudi Arabia, it also left behind the remote Yemeni island of Socotra and the roughly 600 tourists who had flown in but could no longer fly out.

Air traffic at the island's main airport came to a halt as a deepening crisis between the UAE and Saudi Arabia translated into fresh conflict on Yemen's mainland, where the two Gulf powers now back opposing groups in the country's civil war .

“Nobody has any information and everyone just wants to go back to their normal lives," said Aurelija Krikstaponiene, a Lithuanian who travelled to Socotra over New Year's Eve.

She was meant to fly back to Abu Dhabi on Sunday, but now may find herself having to travel through Jeddah in Saudi Arabia instead, as Emirati control over the island wanes.

Socotra, which lies more than 300 km (186 miles) south of Yemen's coast, and until recently was mainly accessible by air via the UAE, has been a haven of tranquillity through the years of conflict on the mainland.

For tourists, it offers magical beaches and unique flora, such as its renowned Socotra dragon blood tree. It sits in the Gulf of Aden, alongside a shipping route leading to the Red Sea.

But Socotra came under effective UAE control in 2018 when Emirati military transport planes first landed on the island.

The tanks and troops that unloaded were part of the UAE's push to extend its sway over the region's waters, including the Bab al-Mandab Strait between the Horn of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.

A major oil producer and business hub, the UAE has in the past decade pursued an assertive foreign policy, carving its own sphere of influence in the Middle East and beyond, often using its financial clout to serve its interests.

"Socotra functions like an unsinkable aircraft carrier sitting at the heart of the Bab al-Mandab system, in the middle of the trade corridor that links Europe, Asia and Africa," said Andreas Krieg, associate professor at King's College London.

"Even without firing a shot, an actor with reliable access to the island gains important leverage: to observe, to potentially intercept and project influence."

Less than eight years on, that plan is being derailed by the severest public rift the UAE has had with its fellow Gulf ally and oil-power Saudi Arabia.

The two Gulf countries have navigated many differences in the past, from geopolitcs to oil output, but this latest fallout has brought their disagreements out in the open.

Saudi Arabia has been carrying out airstrikes to aid Yemeni government troops against UAE-backed southern separatists, the same ones who run Socotra.

UAE troops were not initially welcome when they first landed in 2018, with the Saudi-backed Yemeni government accusing Abu Dhabi of seizing the island's ports and airports.

But the UAE exerted control through the separatist Southern Transitional Council (STC) which now finds itself in direct confrontation with the Saudi-backed government forces on mainland Yemen. The STC seeks autonomy for southern Yemen, and ultimately independence, from the more heavily populated north.

The STC is still in control of the island today but the airport is no longer under Emirati control, two airport sources told Reuters. The facility remains shut.

Yemeni airlines said late on Monday it would operate a flight to Jeddah on January 7, a sure sign that control of the airport has shifted.

"On an island where air access often becomes the decisive gateway, influence over connectivity translates into influence over everything else, including security presence, local governance, and commercial life," Krieg said.

The UAE did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether all of its troops had left the island. One source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters the troops left last month.

Saudi Arabia's government media office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on control of the airport.

“We have a limited amount of cash, and most people will run out in two or three days," Maciej, a Polish tourist who is part of a group of 100 others, told Reuters.

"There are no payment terminals or ATMs here and bank transfers are also inoperable. Everything relies on cash. When it runs out, we'll be sleeping rough and relying on food aid from local residents," he said, adding that he was not warned about the probability of conflict when he booked his trip.

With the Emirati presence since 2018 came money poured into infrastructure projects through the Sheikh Khalifa Foundation humanitarian organisation, bringing electricity, safe water and cooking gas to Socotra.

The UAE also renovated the main airport, adding new buildings, two hangars and a modern navigation system for the control towers.

The once sleepy island turned into a niche tourist destination where travellers looking for terrain off the beaten track could book packages solely through Abu Dhabi to experience the island's beaches and wildlife.

Many did not factor in the risk of proximity to turmoil in Yemen, one of the world's worst humanitarian disasters.

Socotra, which is closer to Somalia than it is to Yemen, had so far been isolated from the civil war that has ravaged the mainland for over 10 years.

But this latest flare-up may not spare its peace.

Still, Romanian Bianca Cus is trying to enjoy the remainder of her time on the island until a flight comes in.

"I am enjoying each day on the island, just as I did before we found out that we would be staying longer," she said.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 10:25:42 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/MYG4LZHAPFOVPIOGMGPSKCKEDE.jpg?auth=5589291ba4e33fcabe2fa0b9b58e1bbbdcabfbef2202e6c6ed1b2a003c68e074&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Malaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, in hospital after hip fracture</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/malaysia-ex-pm-mahathir-100-hospital-after-hip-fracture-2026-01-06/</link><description>KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 6 (Reuters) - Malaysian 100-year-old former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad has been admitted to hospital after suffering a hip fracture following a fall at his residence early on Tuesday, his office said.

The centenarian, widely credited for transforming Malaysia into an industrial nation during his first stint as premier from 1981 to 2003, has a history of heart problems and has been in and out of hospital in recent years, including for bypass surgeries.

He was last admitted to hospital for fatigue following a picnic celebration for his 100th birthday last July.

Mahathir was prime minister over two separate stints, with the first lasting 22 years.

The ministry said the two Palestinian mobile operators - Jawwal and Ooredoo - and Swedish infrastructure firm Ericsson (ERICb.ST) , opens new tab signed management agreements that were approved by Israel on Sunday.

Palestinian cellular providers launched high-speed data services in the occupied West Bank based on 3G in 2018, narrowing a technological gap with Israel after a lengthy Israeli ban on the operation of local 3G networks.

The ministry said its approval came as part of a 2022 framework deal between Israel and the Palestinian Authority aimed at allowing 4G and 5G cellular technologies. The agreement was delayed by the Gaza war, according to Israeli media, which also said the process to upgrade to 4G would take up to six months.

The Palestinian providers compete with Israeli cellular firms, which operate faster on much faster 5G mobile frequencies.

Israel is in the process of shutting down older 2G and 3G technologies and has advised the public to equip themselves with devices that support 4G and 5G.

In Gaza, however, only 2G networks are available.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 11:20:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ET6UMJHEF5P3NDG3CA2H2MDWFA.jpg?auth=963a2b1978a08f67331c28f5e9f4c2dc0fc8d80e24cc2ea060ab0b905592b6f7&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US House Democrats holding January 6 riot forum on Trump election 'threats'</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-house-democrats-holding-january-6-riot-forum-trump-election-threats-2026-01-06/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 6 (Reuters) - Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives will mark the fifth anniversary of a deadly attack on the U.S. Capitol by supporters of President Donald Trump with an unofficial hearing that will probe "ongoing threats" to elections and public safety.

Democrats, as the minority party in Congress, do not have the power to set the legislative agenda, but they can hold informal events to highlight their proposals and criticize Republicans.

"We will examine ongoing threats to free and fair elections," House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said in a statement announcing the forum. He said it also will look into Trump's pardons of more than 1,500 people who were criminally charged with participating in the January 6 violence.

The Trump administration has sought states' voter registration lists, leading to fears the information could be misused. Trump has urged states to abandon mail-in ballots and has hinted at running for a third presidential term in 2028, which would violate the U.S. Constitution.

The January 6, 2021 riot, a failed attempt by thousands of Trump supporters to overturn Trump's 2020 defeat by Democrat Joe Biden, sent lawmakers running for their lives and injured about 140 law enforcement officers.

Four people died during the chaos, including a Trump supporter who was shot dead by police. One police officer, who was attacked by protesters, died the following day. Four other police officers subsequently died by suicide.

Trump insisted the election was stolen from him through fraud, even though he lost a series of court cases challenging the election result.

Some Republicans blamed far-left activists for the attack, and party lawmakers set up a new committee last year to "uncover the full truth" from that day.

“True accountability requires focusing on facts, not selective storytelling for partisan gain," the chairman of the subcommittee, Barry Loudermilk, said in reference to the Democrats' hearing.

Also on Tuesday, Enrique Tarrio, a former leader of the Proud Boys far-right militant group who was found guilty of helping to plan the riot, has announced a "patriotic and peaceful march" to honor the memory of protesters who died that day. He received a 22-year sentence for seditious conspiracy but was subsequently pardoned by Trump.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 11:20:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/335557FVUJJSHEUOWYHLOB22UU.jpg?auth=ae61eee01192e8535c65c1ac07aaf1ef9452edc01cf880948bd38335736c11a0&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Mexico condemns attack on Venezuela while seeking to avoid its fate</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/mexico-condemns-attack-venezuela-while-seeking-avoid-its-fate-2026-01-06/</link><description>MEXICO CITY, Jan 6 (Reuters) - In the wake of the U.S. attack on Venezuela , the Mexican government has found itself traversing the most delicate balancing act since President Donald Trump began his second term: strongly condemning the operation while doubling down on bilateral cooperation lest Mexico find itself in Trump’s crosshairs next.

On Saturday, hours after the elite U.S. special forces captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife in their home, Trump floated the prospect of U.S. military action inside Mexico, saying drug cartels are “running” the country and that “something is gonna have to be done with Mexico.”

The weekend’s events clearly rattled Mexico’s President Claudia Sheinbaum . She started her daily morning press conference on Monday reading from a document that detailed Mexico’s position on Venezuela.

“We categorically reject intervention in the internal affairs of other countries,” she said. “The history of Latin America is clear and compelling: intervention has never brought democracy, never generated well-being, nor lasting stability.”

Sheinbaum’s comments rank among her sharpest criticisms of Washington since Trump took office and are among the strongest rebukes in the region of Maduro’s ouster.

Security analysts said Sheinbaum’s fierce condemnation of the attack signaled that she would not tolerate similar actions against drug traffickers in Mexico. The U.S. Justice Department has charged Maduro with crimes related to drug trafficking, terrorism and weapons; he pleaded not guilty in a New York courthouse on Monday and declared himself "a prisoner of war."

But behind the scenes, Mexico City is likely to move even closer to Washington in the wake of the Venezuela attack, hoping that increasingly tight bilateral security cooperation will stave off U.S. aggressions, Mexican officials and security analysts said.

"Increasing joint security cooperation and strengthening Mexico's own fight against the cartels will be key to avoiding unilateral U.S. military intervention," said a Mexican security official who spoke on condition of anonymity.

Security analysts say the attack on Venezuela significantly elevated the stakes for Mexico City by signaling just how far Trump is willing to go to assert U.S. dominance in Latin America.

“It served as a warning to the entire region,” said Mexican security analyst Carlos Perez Ricart. “(Sheinbaum) is walking a very fine line: declaring a firm stance against intervention but also doing the only thing Mexico can do with such an asymmetrical power dynamic: continue to cooperate with the U.S.”

Over the last year, Sheinbaum has successfully traversed this political tight rope, defending Mexico's sovereignty while placating Washington with two mass expulsions to the U.S. of alleged high-level cartel operatives and undertaking a year-long military offensive against the Sinaloa Cartel.

Such actions have drawn praise from top U.S. officials.

“I think that the ongoing bilateral investigations and cooperation has been moving in the right direction,” said Derek Maltz, who served as acting administrator of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration at the beginning of Trump’s second term. He said he doesn’t anticipate U.S. military action in Mexico in the near future.

David Mora, a senior analyst with the International Crisis Group, said he expected to see the Mexican government engage in joint military operations with the U.S., something it hasn’t done to date. “Pressure on Sheinbaum will increase.”

LAW OF THE JUNGLE

As the fallout over Venezuela continues, officials in Mexico weighed the possibility - however remote - of a military attack. While few believe Washington would target Mexican leadership as it did with Maduro, even a unilateral move against drug cartels would deliver a severe blow to the government, undermining its authority and violating the sovereignty it has vowed to defend.

“It would be an international catastrophe,” said Mexican Congressman Alfonso Ramirez Cuellar, a close ally of Sheinbaum’s, who said that he didn’t think Washington would go so far because of the two countries’ close relationship on security and trade, and Mexico’s “strong disposition to collaborate and cooperate” with the U.S. "The world can't live in the law of the jungle."

Analysts, including Perez Ricart, said they thought U.S. attention would turn to other Latin American countries before Mexico, after Trump criticized the leadership of Colombia and Cuba on Sunday.

The Mexican security official agreed.

"Until we see (attacks in) Colombia and Cuba, then we’ll know that we're next," the official said.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 11:20:21 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/EI4PK36HWBKVFL6ROLDPYCRYZA.jpg?auth=09116e109e6540a164114f6859e070b9f8014ce450be50dc3013ea9a260be3ff&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>World is less safe after US action in Venezuela, says UN Human Rights Office</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/world-is-less-safe-after-us-action-venezuela-says-un-human-rights-office-2026-01-06/</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 11:20:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>AI dominates CES 2026 as annual Las Vegas tech trade show kicks off</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/ai-dominates-ces-2026-as-annual-las-vegas-tech-trade-show-kicks-off</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 11:21:10 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/74b33a08-eaef-11f0-812d-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/capture-2118707930695cec3620ae60-75061477.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Central African President leads provisional results in controversial election</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/central-african-president-leads-provisional-results-in-controversial-election</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 11:21:12 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/1b6afe4a-ea90-11f0-8f22-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25362450874462.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Algeria and DR Congo go head to head in one of AFCON's last round of 16 clashes</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/algeria-and-dr-congo-go-head-to-head-in-one-of-afcon-s-last-round-of-16-clashes</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 11:21:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/8ac53940-ea6d-11f0-bb50-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/000-89D4778.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Final pilgrims cross Holy Door as Vatican claims Jubilee success</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/final-pilgrims-cross-holy-door-as-vatican-claims-jubilee-success</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 11:21:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/b28d7e30-eaed-11f0-b671-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/capture-1828210257695ce942715d14-57882319.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Worries that Venezuela crisis could shift US focus away from Ukraine amid key talks</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/worries-that-venezuela-crisis-could-shift-us-focus-away-from-ukraine-amid-key-talks</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 11:21:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/fbdc0d7c-e0b1-11f0-b357-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/Zelensky-Witkoff.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Rights groups say at least 25 dead in Iran protests</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/rights-groups-say-least-25-dead-iran-protests-2026-01-06/</link><description>DUBAI, Jan 6 (Reuters) - At least 25 people have been killed in Iran during the first nine days of protests that started in the bazaar of Tehran over the plunging value of the currency and soaring inflation, according to rights groups.

The protests have spread to some cities in western and southern Iran but do not match the scale of unrest that swept the nation in 2022-23 over the death of Mahsa Amini, who died in the custody of Iran's morality police for allegedly violating the Islamic Republic's strict dress code.

However, even though smaller, these protests have quickly expanded from an economic focus to broader frustrations, with some protesters chanting against the country's clerical rulers.

Iran also remains under international pressure, with U.S. President Donald Trump threatening on Friday to come to the aid of protesters in Iran if security forces fired on them. In response, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed not to "yield to the enemy".

Hengaw, a Kurdish Iranian rights group, put the death toll at 25, including four people under 18. It said more than 1,000 people had been arrested. HRANA, a network of rights activists, said at least 29 had been killed, including two law enforcement agents, in addition to 1,203 arrests, as of January 5.

Reuters has not been able to independently verify the numbers. Iranian authorities have not given a death toll for protesters, but have said at least two members of the security services have died and more than a dozen have been injured in the unrest.

"While drawing a distinction between protesters and rioters, law enforcement has dealt with strength against rioters by arresting them on the scene or later following identification by intelligence units," Iran's police chief Ahmadreza Radan was quoted by state media on Tuesday as saying.

"I pledge that we will deal with the last of these rioters. It is still time for those who were deceived by foreign services to identify themselves and draw on the Islamic Republic’s greatness."

HRANA said that during the protests, slogans have gone beyond economic demands and included criticism of governance and calls for justice. Protests have so far occurred in 27 provinces out of 31 and expanded to smaller cities, it said.

Authorities have acknowledged economic hardships but accused networks linked to foreign powers of "pushing economic protests toward chaos and disorder", with the judiciary chief pledging to have no mercy toward "rioters".

President Masoud Pezeshkian has urged dialogue and promised reforms to stabilise the monetary and banking systems and protect purchasing power.

The government has announced a subsidy reform, removing preferential currency exchange rates for importers in favour of direct transfers to Iranians to boost their purchasing power for essential goods. The measure will come into force on January 10.

The central bank chief was also replaced on December 29.

The rial fell further to 1,489,500 on Tuesday, representing a 4% fall since the protests started.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 11:41:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/OF2RYJRB6ZPB5NJEKB4XKLD3HU.jpg?auth=461f52864b619be8b834871e45181199a26d854fdc812d58504cc32a9b4679cd&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israeli foreign minister visiting Somaliland, sources say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-foreign-minister-visiting-somaliland-sources-say-2026-01-06/</link><description>NAIROBI/JERUSALEM, Jan 6 (Reuters) - Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar is on a visit to Somaliland in East Africa, where he is due to meet the semi-autonomous region's president later on Tuesday, according to a senior Somaliland official.

A second source briefed on the visit confirmed the foreign minister was in Somaliland, without providing further details. The Israeli foreign ministry did not immediately respond when asked if the foreign minsiter was in Somaliland.

The visit comes 10 days after Israel formally recognised the self-declared Republic of Somaliland as an independent and sovereign state, a move that sparked criticism from Somalia, which has long opposed Somaliland's bid to secede.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 11:41:27 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5ZF7VNKVR5OXTAJCMUJPP2WYWU.jpg?auth=d6ef7a909cadafa0b4df469890bf2d73c19b38d71032327fc5776d2ecf46fcb7&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Slovenia's president calls parliamentary election for March 22</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/slovenias-president-calls-parliamentary-election-march-22-2026-01-06/</link><description>Jan 6 (Reuters) - Slovenia's President Natasa Pirc-Musar signed a decree on Tuesday calling a regular parliamentary election for March 22, according to a statement from the president's office.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 11:41:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/6MGIWUXIAFL2HNCPYWXFVGNMDY.jpg?auth=c33cf951a744cdf46289ecd54e14abb767135fbae2c495ea76df6775bce07e64&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Maduro pleads "not guilty" as he faces drug trafficking charges in the US</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/maduro-pleads-not-guilty-as-he-faces-drug-trafficking-charges-in-the-us</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 11:42:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/c4072f3c-eaf0-11f0-8eb7-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260106-120134-120320-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>European leaders back Denmark in face of renewed US interest in Greenland</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/only-greenland-denmark-can-decide-their-future-european-leaders-say-joint-2026-01-06/</link><description>COPENHAGEN, Jan 6 (Reuters) - Leaders from major European powers expressed support for Denmark and Greenland on Tuesday in a joint statement, saying the Arctic island belongs to its people, following renewed interest by U.S. President Donald Trump in taking over the Danish territory.

"Greenland belongs to its people. It is for Denmark and Greenland, and them only, to decide on matters concerning Denmark and Greenland," said the statement by leaders of France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, Britain, and Denmark.

The leaders said that security in the Arctic must be achieved collectively with NATO allies, including the United States.

"NATO has made clear that the Arctic region is a priority and European Allies are stepping up," the statement said. "We and many other Allies have increased our presence, activities and investments, to keep the Arctic safe and to deter adversaries."

Trump has said repeatedly he wants to take over Greenland and told The Atlantic magazine on Sunday: "We do need Greenland, absolutely. We need it for defence."

A U.S. military operation at the weekend which led to the capture of Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro has further rekindled concerns among Washington's NATO allies that Greenland might face a similar scenario.

Greenland, the world's largest island with a population of 57,000 people, is not an independent member of NATO but is covered by Denmark's membership of the Western military alliance.

The island's strategic location between Europe and North America makes it a critical site for the U.S. ballistic missile defence system. Its mineral wealth also aligns with Washington's ambition to reduce reliance on Chinese exports.

Greenland's Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said on Monday that his government was seeking to strengthen ties with the United States and that citizens should not fear an imminent U.S. takeover.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 12:45:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7O5AAB6PGJL45KE3WSUNM2X4H4.jpg?auth=3249739d42dda3975a8cd27765727b9da3679073b8e79460da66ebe9dda42d7d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ruling coalition in eastern German state collapses</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/ruling-coalition-eastern-german-state-collapses-2026-01-06/</link><description>BERLIN, Jan 6 (Reuters) - The centre-left premier of the eastern German state of Brandenburg said on Tuesday he would run a minority government pending talks to form a new majority after the coalition with the far-left Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW) collapsed.

The political turbulence in Brandenburg, the region around the capital Berlin, is unlikely to have any immediate impact on conservative Chancellor Friedrich Merz's national coalition.

But it underlines the volatility in German politics, notably in eastern Germany, ahead of a series of state and local elections this year. The elections, including two in eastern states, could see the already weakening support for the traditional centre-right and centre-left parties in Merz's coalition further eroded.

Brandenburg Premier Dietmar Woidke said repeated disagreements with the BSW made further cooperation impossible. He ruled out new state elections and said he would seek talks with the centre-right Christian Democratic Union - Merz's party - to see whether a new coalition could be formed to succeed the one formed with BSW in November 2024.

In the meantime, he would run the government with his existing ministers, including Finance Minister Robert Crumbach, whose decision to quit the BSW triggered the crisis.

The BSW, formed as a breakaway from the Left party, the successor to the old East German Communist Party, combines left-wing economic policies with calls for immigration restrictions and opposition to military support for Ukraine.

But it has struggled to contain infighting over leadership and strategy, and Wagenknecht, a former co-leader of the Left, herself stepped down as party leader last year.

As well as Crumbach, who accused BSW members of refusing to accept the responsibilities of government, two other BSW state lawmakers resigned, leaving the coalition without a majority.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 12:46:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/J7RMCARKTVKYZIVAIZILDJFAYE.jpg?auth=e4202c06f7e88a91351d6cdae0aa3918299abde59936762bebdcf98ad587e844&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>At least nine Nigerian soldiers killed in bomb blast</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/at-least-nine-nigerian-soldiers-killed-in-bomb-blast</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 12:47:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/99be6d38-eafc-11f0-9be2-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/capture-1850478582695d02439e0f87-71255327.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Buy a king's cake, win a car: French tradition with a twist</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/buy-a-king-s-cake-win-a-car-french-tradition-with-a-twist</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 12:47:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/5f289e18-eaf3-11f0-919e-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260106-111308-111413-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Capture of Maduro by US means Russia, Iran and China lose key ally</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/capture-of-maduro-by-us-means-russia-iran-and-china-lose-key-ally</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 12:47:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/0f56ad42-eaf5-11f0-ba5a-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/capture-1052902815695cf59ceb08b3-14102670.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Who are the key figures in Maduro's trial?</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/who-are-the-key-figures-in-maduro-s-trial</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 12:47:43 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/3c88cadc-ead4-11f0-9818-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/2023-06-27T221052Z-2002262556-RC2YR1ARPQ24-RTRMADP-3-USA-TRUMP-NEW-YORK.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Kyiv allies meet in Paris to discuss security guarantees for Ukraine</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/kyiv-allies-meet-in-paris-to-discuss-security-guarantees-for-ukraine</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 12:47:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/2ee4df88-eaf2-11f0-80ee-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260106-120810-121339-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item></channel></rss>
