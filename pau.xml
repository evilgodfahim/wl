The seized cargo vessel "Fitburg" was en route ​from the Russian port of St Petersburg to Israel at the time of the incident, Finland's Border Guard authority told a press conference ‍in Helsinki.

"At the moment we suspect aggravated disruption of telecommunications and also aggravated sabotage and attempted aggravated sabotage," Helsinki Chief of Police Jari Liukku told reporters.

Concern is growing in Europe at what officials see as ​an increase in hybrid threats from Russia since it launched its war in Ukraine, which Moscow denies.

Earlier this month, NATO 's ​top military commander said the alliance must be ready to respond to these types of threats to defend its territory.

Hybrid threats refer to both military and non-military tactics designed to undermine an adversary's security. They can include cyberattacks, disinformation campaigns, sabotage of key infrastructure and use of drones or irregular armed groups.

The Fitburg's 14 crew members were from Russia, Georgia, Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan, and were all held by Finnish police, investigators said. The ship sailed under the flag of St Vincent and Grenadines.

According to LSEG data, the owner of the vessel is Fitburg Shipping Company Ltd and the manager is Albros Shipping and Trading Ltd. Reuters was ‍not able to reach either of those companies via telephone.

Eight NATO states border the Baltic Sea, which also borders Russia. They have been on high alert after a string of outages of power cables, ​telecoms links and gas pipelines that run along the relatively shallow seabed since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022.

NATO has boosted its presence in the Baltic with frigates, aircraft and naval drones in recent years.

"We remain in contact with the Finnish authorities, through exchange of information, via the NATO ‌shipping centre located at our Allied Maritime Command in Northwood, UK," an official at the military alliance said.

The Fitburg was dragging its anchor in the sea, and was directed to Finnish territorial waters, the police and Finland's Border Guard said. The cable ‍belongs to Finnish telecoms group Elisa.

Estonia's justice ministry said a second telecoms cable connecting the country to Finland had also suffered an outage on Wednesday. It was not immediately clear if the cable, belonging to Sweden's Arelion, was running parallel to Elisa's.

An Arelion spokesperson confirmed that the company had suffered an outage.

"I'm concerned about the reported damage ... Hopefully it was not a deliberate act, but the investigation will clarify," Estonia's President Alar Karis said on X.

The European Commission was closely monitoring the incident, EU technology commissioner Henna Virkkunen wrote on X.

Finland in December 2024 boarded the Russian-linked oil tanker Eagle S which investigators said had damaged a ‍power cable and several telecoms links in the Baltic Sea by dragging its anchor.

A Finnish court in October dismissed a criminal case against the Eagle S captain and other crew members, ‌ruling prosecutors failed to prove intent ​and that any alleged negligence must be pursued by the ship's flag state or the crew's home countries.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 16:51:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/1e7a5fb0-e660-11f0-9e36-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/000-89CT2Q3.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia's Putin, in New Year address, voices confidence in victory in Ukraine</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/russias-putin-new-year-address-voices-confidence-victory-ukraine-2025-12-31/</link><description>MOSCOW, Dec 31 (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin used his annual televised New Year's address to rally his troops fighting in Ukraine, saying he believed in them and in victory in a war that he has framed as part of an existential struggle with the West.

U.S. President Donald Trump is trying to broker an end to the nearly four-year-old conflict, Europe's bloodiest conflagration since World War Two, with both sides' negotiating stances still far apart.

Dressed in a black coat, Putin - whose forces are advancing slowly but steadily in Ukraine - spoke about Russia's destiny and the unity of its people, which he said guaranteed the sovereignty and security of the "Fatherland".

He paid tribute in particular to his forces fighting in Ukraine, calling them heroes.

"Millions of people across Russia — I assure you — are with you on this New Year's Eve," said Putin.

"They are thinking of you, empathising with you, hoping for you. I wish all our soldiers and commanders a happy coming New Year! We believe in you and our Victory!"

His speech, which was first broadcast in Russia's far east, came as Russia released video footage of what it said was a downed drone, presenting it as evidence that Ukraine had tried this week to attack a presidential residence. Kyiv has dismissed Russia's allegation as a lie designed to derail peace talks.

In another video released on Wednesday, Russia's top general told troops to keep carving out buffer zones in Ukraine's Sumy and Kharkiv regions and said Moscow's forces had advanced faster in December than in any other month in 2025.

Reuters could not verify his battlefield assertion.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 17:19:52 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/IFCZ5KFZLNLVZBKNBIASZ4TYQI.jpg?auth=ad337853fcbac45e7afceea2f7625b2742eb7cd987e04feea6f90db11670773a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>What we know about the Saudi-led air strikes on ships in Yemen</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20251231-strike-ships-yemen-saudi-arabia-uae</link><description>Images of the air strike on Yemen’s port of Mukalla on Tuesday, December 30, 2025, have circulated widely across global media, including flames burning along the shoreline and a column of black smoke rising over the port.

The Saudi-led military coalition that carried out the strike claimed the bombardment targeted “weapons and combat vehicles” unloaded from two ships arriving from the port of Fujairah in the United Arab Emirates . According to the coalition, these arms were intended “to support the Southern Transitional Council (STC) forces”, a separatist group that has been waging an offensive for several weeks against the forces of Yemen’s internationally recognised government.

Saudi Arabia backs the government, which also faces opposition from Houthi rebels , a Shia Islamist movement that controls Yemen’s capital, Sanaa . While officially backing the internationally recognised government, the UAE has faced accusations from both Saudi Arabia and the Yemeni government of supporting STC separatists.

According to the Saudi Press Agency (SPA), the bombardment of the Mukalla port resulted in no casualties, a claim that available footage can neither confirm nor deny.

Regarding physical damage, however, a video released by AFP shows one of the targeted areas within the port. The footage clearly depicts dozens of white and beige vehicles parked near an industrial terminal. While some have been burned and completely destroyed, others appear untouched. Firefighters can be seen working among the charred remains of the vehicles to extinguish the blaze.

The scene can be geolocated to the port of Mukalla. It is one of the primary coastal cities in Hadramaut, the region currently targeted by the STC separatist offensive.

The vehicles appearing in this video are also identifiable as troop carriers manufactured by the UAE-based Streit Group. Specifically, the Spartan and Cougar models from their vehicle lineup can be recognised.

In a statement , the United Arab Emirates denied that the vehicles were bound for STC separatists, asserting that “they were not intended for any Yemeni party, but were shipped for use by UAE forces operating in Yemen ”.

This would not be the first time Streit Group vehicles have been identified in the hands of STC fighters. Several journalists and analysts documented their presence on the ground during the group's recent offensive in Hadramaut.

While the Saudi-led coalition’s statement claimed that cargo from "two ships" was targeted, the footage provided by the coalition to the media only shows one vessel in detail.

The letters "SAMC" are visible on a vessel's hull. According to the caption, the ship is the Greenland, which reportedly departed from the port of Fujairah in the UAE.

Data from maritime traffic-tracking sites confirm that the vessel departed from the United Arab Emirates. The ship called at the ports of Jebel Ali in Dubai and Fujairah. Its last known position was recorded off the coast of Yemen on December 26. Since then, the vessel appears to have disabled its tracking system – a common practice for vessels engaged in illicit economic activities or navigating high-risk waters.

According to MarineTraffic, which utilises a wider range of data sources, the vessel arrived at the port of Mukalla on December 28. It reportedly departed on December 30 for the Emirati port of Fujairah, suggesting the ship was not destroyed in the attack.

The "SAMC" logo on the hull refers to the vessel's owner: the Emirati-based Salem Al-Makrani Cargo Company. The Greenland is listed as part of the fleet on the company’s official website .

A second vessel from the same company followed the same path as the Greenland: the Socotra 3. It also transited through the ports of Jebel Ali and Fujairah before arriving at Mukalla on December 26, a few days before the bombing. This may be the second ship from Fujairah that the coalition mentioned.

As evidenced by footage captured following the attack, it appears that not all vehicles delivered by the two Emirati vessels were destroyed. Video released by the coalition shows several of the vehicles travelling in convoys away from the port.

Additional footage released throughout the day on December 30 shows a convoy of Streit Group-manufactured vehicles. Their models and colours match those delivered by Emirati vessels, with the white Cougar variants being identifiable.

These images were captured in the town of Buwaysh, east of Mukalla, where a local bank branch is visible in the background. While the filming date remains unverified, we could not find any record of the video prior to December 30. This suggests that the delivery of these vehicles to Mukalla was, at least in part, successful.

Following the bombardment of the port of Mukalla, Yemen’s internationally recognised government has cancelled a defence pact with the UAE, ordering its forces to leave the country within 24 hours. This demand, backed by Saudi Arabia, has prompted the UAE to announce the withdrawal of its troops from Yemen.

Some 63 percent of French people did not intend to watch the annual New Year 's address, according to the latest Toluna/Harris Interactive poll for LCI news channel, while the president's approval rating is at its lowest since 2017 at 25 percent.

Macron will attempt to regain some momentum and launch the final projects of his second five-year term during his New Year's address.

Macron "will be keen to show that he will do everything to ensure that 2026 is a year of action, a year of purpose", those close to him said ahead of his speech.

The framework of his address is already in place, with the challenges posed by the war in Ukraine – which will enter its fifth year in February – to figure prominently.

Other topics that will be addressed include social media regulation, the return of a voluntary conscription service in France and legislation on end-of-life care.

Macron wants to ensure that 2026 will be characterised by action and progress on a number of fronts, his entourage said.

Without "falling into blind optimism", Macron will also seek to combat the trend of " French bashing " – denigrating France – which is so often pushed by the "self-proclaimed patriots" on the far right .</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 17:43:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/12b9f8da-e5f6-11f0-965b-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/b0074072e43547de4ba9d58ce152e4051df35bfe.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US held talks with Ukraine, European countries on next steps in ending Ukraine war, Witkoff says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/us-held-talks-with-ukraine-european-countries-next-steps-ending-ukraine-war-2025-12-31/</link><description>Dec 31 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's advisers held talks on Wednesday with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and national security advisers from the UK, France and Germany to discuss the next steps in ending Russia's war in Ukraine, U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff said.

"We focused on how to move the discussions forward in a practical way on behalf of @POTUS' peace process, including strengthening security guarantees and developing effective deconfliction mechanisms to help end the war and ensure it does not restart," Witkoff said in a social media post.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and Ukraine's top negotiator Rustem Umerov also participated.

Zelenskiy said on Tuesday that national security advisers from Kyiv's "Coalition of the Willing" backers would meet in Ukraine on Saturday, and then country leaders would gather in France on January 6.

The Coalition grouping led by Britain and France includes more than 30 nations, though it was not immediately clear which would be taking part in the meetings.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 18:31:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/GKPFOWTLX5LJ3FVAODKEEGMQYE.jpg?auth=f315347f4e9a676528d58b9eb282a8b5d04fb77977eaffec4a8a37edfe62eb9a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US judge blocks Trump move to end protected status for thousands from Honduras, Nepal and Nicaragua</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-judge-blocks-trump-move-end-protected-status-thousands-honduras-nepal-2025-12-31/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Dec 31 (Reuters) - A U.S. federal judge on Wednesday blocked the Trump administration from ending deportation protections for thousands of migrants from Honduras, Nepal and Nicaragua after opponents argued the terminations were motivated by racial hostility.

The administration's decisions to end Temporary Protected Status for some 89,000 migrants failed to adequately consider conditions in the three countries that would prevent them from returning, San Francisco-based District Judge Trina Thompson wrote.

Thompson cited statements by Republican President Donald Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem portraying immigrants as criminals and a drain on U.S. society.

"These statements reflect a stereotyping of the immigrants protected under the TPS program as criminal invaders and perpetuate the discriminatory belief that certain immigrant populations will replace the white population," wrote Thompson, an appointee of Trump's Democratic predecessor, Joe Biden.

TPS provides deportation relief and work permits to people already in the U.S. if their home countries experience a natural disaster, armed conflict or other extraordinary event. Under the program, Noem has the authority to grant, extend or terminate TPS designations for specific countries.

Trump has sought to end most TPS enrollment as part of a broader effort to restrict both legal and illegal immigration. In TPS termination notices, the administration has said that allowing the migrants to remain in the U.S. is contrary to the country's interests.

The Supreme Court in October allowed the Trump administration to proceed with ending TPS for some 300,000 Venezuelans, but lower courts have continued to rule against other terminations. On Tuesday, a federal judge in Boston blocked a move to end protections for hundreds of migrants from South Sudan.

In her ruling, Thompson found that the National TPS Alliance, a group representing the TPS enrollees, had plausibly alleged the terminations were motivated by racial animus.

The program covers some 72,000 Hondurans, 13,000 Nepalese and 4,000 Nicaraguans, according to U.S. Department of Homeland Security estimates.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 19:17:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/PCQU2YOBCRMC7L5CQCSPNEMGRE.jpg?auth=99ca905ba7bf78f96a8aff1e3b3986bbe5af1837910ab40c664bef63636bfb02&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US targets crude oil tankers, firms in new Venezuela-related sanctions, Treasury website shows</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/us-targets-crude-oil-tankers-firms-new-venezuela-related-sanctions-treasury-2025-12-31/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Dec 31 (Reuters) - The United States on Wednesday imposed sanctions on four companies it said were operating in Venezuela’s oil sector as well as associated oil tankers, as President Donald Trump's administration increases pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.

The U.S. Treasury Department in a statement said it imposed sanctions on oil traders engaged in sanctions evasion for Maduro's government. Among the targets were four vessels, some of which the Treasury accused of being part of the so-called "shadow fleet".

"Today’s action further signals that those involved in the Venezuelan oil trade continue to face significant sanctions risks," the Treasury said in the statement.

The sanctions mark the latest action in Trump's pressure campaign on Maduro, which has included a ramped-up military presence in the region and more than two dozen military strikes on vessels allegedly trafficking drugs in the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea near the South American nation.

This month, Trump announced a blockade of all sanctioned vessels going in or out of Venezuelan waters as part of a strategy to pressure Maduro. The U.S. move has cut oil exports this month to about half of their November level.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 19:37:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/AJ54ICZPQFJCTDXBXK2WCMZRIY.jpg?auth=46b83184753bbcca3f47722594826764d364341a43b7a2651a3629bebd246afa&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Macron: allies will make commitments on protecting Ukraine at Jan 6 meeting</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/macron-allies-will-make-commitments-protecting-ukraine-jan-6-meeting-2025-12-31/</link><description>PARIS, Dec 31 (Reuters) - European leaders meeting in Paris on January 6 will make firm commitments towards protecting Ukraine after any peace deal with Russia is brokered, French President Emmanuel Macron said on Wednesday during his New Year Eve's speech.

Macron has convened a meeting of the so-called 'Coalition of the Willing' next Tuesday. The Coalition grouping led by Britain and France includes more than 30 nations.

"On January 6 in Paris, many European states and allies will make concrete commitments to protect Ukraine and ensure a just and lasting peace on our European continent," Macron said.

U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff earlier said that ways to strength security guarantees for Ukraine were discussed during Wednesday talks between U.S. officials, Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelenskiy and national security advisers from the UK, France and Germany.

In mid December, the leaders of several European countries including Germany, France and Britain, said there had been "strong convergence" with the U.S. after talks in Berlin and stated a list of goals for both sides to work towards.

These included commitments to supporting Ukraine's armed forces, a European-led peacekeeping force and guarantees to use force if Ukraine came under attack again.

Kyiv has come under intense pressure from the Trump administration to make concessions to Russia to enable a deal. Ukraine's European allies say any peace accord must ensure robust security guarantees backed by U.S. support.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 20:23:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WLJLF76EJVNJ3JAQXFGZYHG52M.jpg?auth=28e69e052636da73b8808b159bd856aca94ab02f420ef3b4a09028b98c57049e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>One killed, several security forces wounded in Syria's Aleppo after suicide attack</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/explosion-heard-syrias-aleppo-ekhbariya-tv-reports-2025-12-31/</link><description>Dec 31 (Reuters) - A suicide bomber targeted a police patrol in Aleppo in Syria, killing one person and wounding several members of the security forces, Syria's state news agency said on Wednesday.

On Monday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov alleged that Ukraine had tried to attack Putin's residence in the northern Novgorod region with dozens of drones, adding that Moscow would review its negotiating position as a result.

U.S. national security officials have found Ukraine did not target Putin or one of his residences in a drone strike, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday. Reuters could not immediately verify the report.

The paper reported the conclusion was supported by a CIA assessment that found no attempt to target Putin or one of his residences. A CIA spokesperson could not be immediately reached for comment.

U.S. President Donald Trump initially expressed sympathy for the Russian charge, telling reporters on Monday that Putin had informed him of the alleged incident and that he was "very angry" about it.

By Wednesday, he appeared more skeptical, sharing on social media a New York Post editorial accusing Russia of blocking peace in Ukraine.

Ukraine has denied it carried out such an attack, describing the allegation as a Russian disinformation campaign meant to drive a wedge between Kyiv and Washington after a meeting between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy that both sides described as cordial and productive.

In a detailed briefing paper that Ukraine distributed to European Union delegations on Tuesday and seen by Reuters, Kyiv alleged the Russian allegations were designed to "sabotage" agreements made during the South Florida meeting between Trump and Zelenskiy.

On Wednesday, Kaja Kallas, the EU's top diplomat, called Russia's claims "a deliberate distraction."

"No one should accept unfounded claims from the aggressor who has indiscriminately targeted Ukraine's infrastructure and civilians since the start of the war," she wrote on X.

As of Wednesday, there was no independent confirmation of the attack. But Russia's charges - and the European and Ukrainian reaction - underscored how both sides have sought to shape Trump's view of the war in Ukraine, now nearly four years old.

“There is no evidence” that Putin seeks peace and wants Ukraine to be successful, as Trump asserted last weekend after speaking to the Russian leader, said Kurt Volker, a former U.S. ambassador to NATO who served as special representative for Ukraine negotiations during Trump’s first term.

"All evidence is to the contrary,” he added.

The Russian and Ukrainian embassies in Washington did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The White House also did not immediately respond.

On Wednesday, Russia's defense ministry released video footage showing a senior officer, Major General Alexander Romanenkov, setting out details of how Moscow says it believes Ukraine attacked Putin's Novgorod residence.

The video included footage of a Russian serviceman standing next to fragments of a device that he said was a downed Ukrainian Chaklun-V drone carrying a 6-kg explosive device, which had not detonated.

Ukraine's foreign ministry dismissed the footage, saying it was "absolutely confident" no attack took place.

Before Lavrov made his accusation on Monday, Novgorod Governor Alexander Dronov said air defense and fighter jets were shooting down Ukrainian drones.

While Trump said on Monday the attack could have been a Russian false flag operation, he has at times appeared willing to accept controversial statements by Putin at face value.

Earlier this year, Trump repeated Putin’s assertions that Russian forces had encircled Ukrainian forces in Russia’s Kursk region, even as U.S. intelligence indicated that was not true.

The debate over the alleged Ukrainian attack also comes as some Western intelligence officials have quietly argued Russia has sought to delay additional punitive moves by Washington designed to force Moscow into a peace deal.

Reuters was unable to determine if the U.S. intelligence community has already made an assessment of the alleged attack or presented any relevant findings to Congress.

In the Ukrainian briefing paper seen by Reuters, Kyiv noted that in the hours after the alleged attack, various Russian officials made extremely similar comments in public that - in Ukraine's view - suggested pre-coordination among officials in Moscow.

The paper also noted that residents of a town near Putin's Novgorod residence told local media they heard no sounds of air defenses on the night of the alleged attack.

The Russian defense ministry published inconsistent accounts of the alleged Ukrainian drone attacks.

In a statement posted late on Sunday on its channel on the Telegram messaging platform, the ministry said 89 long-range Ukrainian attack drones were intercepted around the country between 7 a.m. the day before and 11 p.m. that evening.

They included 18 that were hit over the Novgorod region, it said, without alleging that any were involved in an attack on Putin’s residence there.

On Monday afternoon, the ministry issued a second statement that its air defenses had intercepted 91 drones, all of them bound for Putin’s residence, including 41 that were hit over Novgorod, between Saturday and Sunday.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 22:20:48 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/NIDEVIWJZJJLTLIUNUX663GJOA.jpg?auth=283b3ae32e71d18ebb64467e7ad56a44ba0f6171242922cd75fa7198da1cedc5&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Zelenskiy says he won’t sign weak deal that will only prolong war</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/zelenskiy-says-he-wont-sign-weak-deal-that-will-only-prolong-war-2025-12-31/</link><description>Dec 31 (Reuters) - Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in his New Year address to the nation, said late on Wednesday that Ukraine wanted the war to end, but not at any cost, adding he would not sign a "weak" peace agreement that would only prolong the war.

"What does Ukraine want? Peace? Yes. At any cost? No. We want an end to the war but not the end of Ukraine," Zelenskiy said in the address from his office, issued just before midnight. "Are we tired? Very. Does this mean we are ready to surrender? Anyone who thinks so is deeply mistaken."

Zelenskiy said any signature "placed on weak agreements only fuel the war. My signature will be placed on a strong agreement.

The Trump administration has carried out more than 30 strikes against suspected drug boats in the Caribbean and Pacific since September in a campaign that has killed at least 110 people.

In a statement, the U.S. military's Southern Command said the military had carried out a strike against three vessels.

"Three narco-terrorists aboard the first vessel were killed in the first engagement. The remaining narco-terrorists abandoned the other two vessels, jumping overboard and distancing themselves before follow-on engagements sank their respective vessels," Southern Command wrote on X.

A U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said eight people had abandoned their vessels and were being searched for.

The Coast Guard told Reuters it had deployed a C-130 aircraft to look for survivors and was working with vessels in the area.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 22:21:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>EU warns Yemen developments risk Gulf stability</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/eu-warns-yemen-developments-risk-gulf-stability-2025-12-31/</link><description>Dec 31 (Reuters) - The European Union said on Wednesday that recent developments in the Yemeni provinces of Hadramout and Al Mahra threaten to bring new risks to the Gulf region.

Trump said in a social media post on Wednesday that he was removing the Guard troops for the time being. “We will come back, perhaps in a much different and stronger form, when crime begins to soar again — only a question of time!” he wrote.

Troops had already left Los Angeles after the president deployed them earlier this year as part of a broader crackdown on crime and immigration. They had been sent to Chicago and Portland but were never on the streets as legal challenges played out.

The president has made a crackdown on crime in cities a centrepiece of his second term and has floated invoking the Insurrection Act to prevent opponents from using the courts to block his plans.

He has said he sees his tough-on-crime approach as a winning political issue ahead of next year’s midterm elections .

In November, US Northern Command said it was “shifting and/or rightsizing” operations in Portland, Chicago and Los Angeles, but that there would be a “constant, enduring and long-term presence in each city”.

Trump’s push to deploy troops in Democrat -led cities has been met with legal challenges at nearly every turn.

The Supreme Court in December refused to allow the Trump administration to deploy National Guard troops in the Chicago area as part of its crackdown on immigration. The order was not a final ruling, but it marked a significant and rare setback from the high court for the president’s efforts.

In the nation’s capital, District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb sued to halt the deployment of more than 2,000 guardsmen.

Hundreds of troops from California and Oregon were deployed to Portland, but a federal judge barred them from going on the streets. A judge permanently blocked the deployment of National Guard troops there in November after a three-day trial.

California National Guard troops were removed from the streets of Los Angeles by December 15 after a court ruling. An appeals court had paused a separate part of the order that required control of the Guard to return to Governor Gavin Newsom .

In a court filing on Tuesday, the Trump administration said it was no longer seeking a pause in that part of the order, paving the way for the California National Guard to fully return to state control after Trump federalised the force in June.

California Attorney General Rob Bonta called the development a “major litigation victory” in a press release on Wednesday.

“For six months, California National Guard troops have been used as political pawns by a president desperate to be king,” Bonta said. “There is a reason our founders decided military and civilian affairs must be kept separate; a reason that our military is, by design, apolitical.”

Trump also ordered the deployment of the Tennessee National Guard to Memphis in September to combat crime, a move supported by the state’s Republican Governor Bill Lee and senators. A Tennessee judge blocked the use of the Guard, siding with Democratic state and local officials who sued.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 22:45:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/684d59d2-e0f5-11f0-9372-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2025-12-23T210932Z-1726505758-RC2D8HA495UL-RTRMADP-3-USA-COURT-TRUMP-ILLINOIS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>North Korea's Kim Jong Un attends New Year's celebrations, KCNA says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/north-koreas-kim-jong-un-attends-new-years-celebrations-kcna-says-2025-12-31/</link><description>SEOUL, Jan 1 (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un attended New Year's celebrations in Pyongyang including fireworks, patriotic songs and dances and a taekwondo demonstration, state media KCNA said on Thursday.

In a speech, Kim lauded the North Korean people's efforts which led to "successes and phenomenal changes" in 2025, and called for their unity as a key party congress expected to be held in early 2026 will lay out the future direction for the country.

North Korea is expected to hold the 9th Congress of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea soon, which will lay out the country's plans for the next five years in various fields such as nuclear and weapons development, as well as the economy.

Kim also sent a New Year's message to North Korean troops fighting on Russia's side in the war in Ukraine, calling them the "greatest strength and pride and a strong pillar" of the country and saying he looks forward to their reunion back home.

"Be brave. Behind you are Pyongyang and Moscow," Kim said in the message, according to KCNA.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 23:20:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/X6UQPVRDUZPRLNHB2ZMT32RGF4.jpg?auth=0c0f0b4ddc0bf522471b6fd32b61801b249cb68c8eb6678f409885f4e8a8c98a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Pentagon says Lockheed Martin gets $328.5 million Taiwan military sale contract</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/pentagon-says-lockheed-martin-gets-3285-million-taiwan-military-sale-contract-2025-12-31/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Dec 31 (Reuters) - The Pentagon said on Wednesday that Lockheed Martin (LMT.N) , opens new tab was given a contract involving foreign military sales to Taiwan to meet what Washington calls "an urgent operational need" of the Taiwan Air Force.

The contract has a ceiling value of $328.5 million, with $157.3 million in foreign military sales funds obligated at the time of award, the Pentagon said in a statement , opens new tab .

Washington has formal diplomatic ties with China , but maintains unofficial ties with Taiwan and is the island's most important arms supplier . The U.S. is bound by law to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself, though such arms sales are a persistent source of friction with China.

Taiwan remained on high alert on Wednesday after China staged massive military drills around the island the previous day, keeping its emergency maritime response centre running as it monitored Chinese naval maneuvers, the coast guard said.

"This contract provides for the procurement and delivery of fifty-five Infrared Search and Track Legion Enhanced Sensor pods, processors, pod containers, and processor containers required to meet the urgent operational need of the Taiwan Air Force," the Pentagon said.

It added that the contract's work will be performed in Orlando, Florida, and is expected to be completed by June 2031.

In mid-December, the administration of President Donald Trump announced $11.1 billion in arms sales to Taiwan, the largest ever U.S. weapons package for the island which is under increasing military pressure from China.

China claims democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory, and it has not ruled out using force to take it under Chinese control. Taiwan, which rejects China's claims, condemned the latest drills as a threat to regional security and a blatant provocation.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 23:20:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/B5GS2RJH3JLONEW5ZFI4CHONVU.jpg?auth=223593a14afc23271413a041dd22d190379cb24bac6af393d712a2df3f0c64d0&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US military says three killed in strikes on alleged drug boats</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20251231-us-military-says-three-killed-in-strikes-on-alleged-drug-boats</link><description>The US military announced on Wednesday that three people were killed in strikes on three alleged drug boats in international waters, bringing the death toll in Washington’s campaign against what it says are narcotics traffickers to at least 110.

US Southern Command, which is responsible for American forces operating in Central and South America, said the strikes targeted “three narco-trafficking vessels travelling as a convoy”. All three people killed were on one boat.

The exact location of the strikes was not immediately made clear. Previous strikes have taken place in the Caribbean or the eastern Pacific.

The military said that the targeted vessels were operated by “designated terrorist organisations” that it did not identify.

Accompanying the statement, posted on X, was a video showing three boats travelling together at sea and then hit by a series of explosions.

“Three narco-terrorists aboard the first vessel were killed in the first engagement. The remaining narco-terrorists abandoned the other two vessels, jumping overboard and distancing themselves before follow-on engagements sank their respective vessels,” it said.

The military said it had notified the Coast Guard to “activate the search and rescue system”, without offering more details about the fate of those aboard the other boats.

Since September, the US military has carried out more than 30 such strikes on what it says are boats used to smuggle drugs to the United States, without providing any concrete evidence that the targeted boats are involved in trafficking.

International law experts and rights groups say the strikes likely amount to extrajudicial killings as they have apparently targeted civilians who do not pose an immediate threat to the United States.

In recent months, US President Donald Trump has waged a pressure campaign against Venezuela ’s leftist President Nicolas Maduro , accusing him of running a drug cartel.

Maduro denies the allegation and has accused Washington of seeking regime change to gain access to the Latin American country’s massive oil reserves.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 23:42:02 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/800dbe28-c20e-11f0-9bdd-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/000-74UP2KE.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Taiwan vows to defend sovereignty after China's military drill</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/taiwan-vows-defend-sovereignty-after-chinas-military-drill-2026-01-01/</link><description>TAIPEI, Jan 1 (Reuters) - Taiwan President Lai Ching-te said on Thursday the island is determined to defend its sovereignty and boost defence in the face of China's rising ambition for expansion, after Beijing fired rockets towards the island in a military drill.

Palestinian refugee agency, a U.N. spokesperson said.

The spokesperson said the move would "further impede" the agency's ability to operate and carry out activities.

"The Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations remains applicable to UNRWA ( United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East ), its property and assets, and to its officials and other personnel. Property used by UNRWA is inviolable," Stephane Dujarric, spokesman for the secretary-general, said while adding that UNRWA is an "integral" part of the world body.

UNRWA Commissioner General Phillipe Lazzarini also condemned the move, saying that it was part of an ongoing " systematic campaign to discredit  UNRWA and thereby obstruct" the role it plays in providing assistance to Palestinian refugees.

In 2024, the Israeli parliament passed a law banning the agency from operating in the country and prohibiting officials from having contact with the agency.

As a result, UNRWA operates in East Jerusalem, which the U.N. considers territory occupied by Israel. Israel considers all Jerusalem to be part of the country.

The agency provides education, health and aid to millions of Palestinians in Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria. It has long had tense relations with Israel but ties have deteriorated sharply since the start of the war in Gaza and Israel has called repeatedly for UNRWA to be disbanded, with its responsibilities transferred to other U.N. agencies.

The prohibition of basic utilities to the U.N. agency came as Israel also suspended of dozens of international non-governmental organizations working in Gaza due to a failure to meet new rules to vet those groups.

In a joint statement, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Iceland, Japan, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom said on Tuesday such a move would have a severe impact on the access of essential services, including healthcare. They said one in three healthcare facilities in Gaza would close if international NGO operations stopped.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 01:55:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CGHA6UP6LVNR5BHSCXNXV45BR4.jpg?auth=cd29fc083ea6cf5343277ed24d44c51f9ff06d68713b8d2e62ede9fafe00ad2c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Taiwan vows to defend sovereignty amid Chinese military drills</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260101-taiwan-vows-to-defend-sovereignty-amid-chinese-military-drills</link><description>Taiwan President Lai Ching-te said on Thursday that the island is determined to defend its sovereignty and bolster its defence in the face of China’s growing assertiveness, after Beijing fired rockets towards Taiwan during military drills .

“The international community is watching to see whether the Taiwanese people possess the resolve to defend themselves,” Lai said in a New Year’s speech broadcast live from the presidential office in Taipei.

He urged opposition parties to support his proposal to increase Taiwan’s defence spending by $40 billion, a plan currently stalled amid a political deadlock in the opposition-controlled parliament.

“Whether China can achieve its goals on schedule is one thing,” Lai said when asked about a US report suggesting China could have the capability to win a conflict over Taiwan by 2027.

“The coming year, 2026, will be a crucial one for Taiwan,” he added, saying the island must “make plans for the worst, but hope for the best.”

“We are willing to engage in exchanges and cooperation with China on an equal and dignified basis, promoting a peaceful and shared environment across the strait,” Lai said. “As long as China acknowledges the existence of the Republic of China and respects the Taiwanese people’s desire for a democratic and free way of life.”

China claims democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory and has not ruled out the use of force to bring it under Chinese control. Taiwan rejects these claims.

Lai’s speech came just two days after Chinese exercises named “Justice Mission 2025”. China fired dozens of rockets towards Taiwan and deployed a large number of warships and aircraft near the island, a show of force that drew concern from Western allies including the European Commission and the United Kingdom.

Taipei condemned the drills as a threat to regional security and a blatant provocation. Beijing announced late on Wednesday that it had completed the exercises, stating its military would continue to strengthen combat readiness.

China’s President Xi Jinping struck a familiar tone on Taiwan in his New Year’s address on Wednesday, repeating last year’s warning to what Beijing considers separatist forces that China’s “reunification” with Taiwan cannot be stopped.

The drills, China’s largest by area and the closest yet to Taiwan, forced the island to cancel dozens of domestic commercial flights and dispatch military jets and warships to monitor the exercises.

The Chinese manoeuvres began 11 days after the United States announced a record $11.1 billion arms package for Taiwan. China’s military said for the first time that the drills were aimed at deterring outside intervention.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 03:52:10 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/4a647a80-e510-11f0-b7a1-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25336133707524.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Finland seizes ship sailing from Russia after suspected cable sabotage in Baltic Sea</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/finland-suspects-ship-causing-undersea-cable-damage-president-says-2025-12-31/</link><description>HELSINKI, Dec 31 (Reuters) - Finnish police on Wednesday seized a ship sailing from Russia on suspicion of sabotaging an undersea telecoms cable running from Helsinki to Estonia across the Gulf of Finland, an area hit by a string of similar incidents in recent years.

The seized cargo vessel "Fitburg" was en route from the Russian port of St Petersburg to Israel at the time of the incident, Finland's Border Guard authority told a press conference in Helsinki.

"At the moment we suspect aggravated disruption of telecommunications and also aggravated sabotage and attempted aggravated sabotage," Helsinki Chief of Police Jari Liukku told reporters.

Concern is growing in Europe at what officials see as an increase in hybrid threats from Russia since it launched its war in Ukraine, which Moscow denies.

Earlier this month, NATO's top military commander said the alliance must be ready to respond to these type of threats to defend its territory.

Hybrid threats refer to both military and non-military tactics designed to undermine an adversary's security. They can include cyberattacks, disinformation campaigns, sabotage of key infrastructure and use of drones or irregular armed groups.

The Fitburg's 14 crew members were from Russia, Georgia, Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan, and were all held by Finnish police, investigators said. The ship sailed under the flag of St Vincent and Grenadines.

According to LSEG data, the owner of the vessel is Fitburg Shipping Company Ltd and the manager is Albros Shipping and Trading Ltd. Reuters was not able to reach either of those companies via telephone.

Eight NATO states border the Baltic Sea, which also borders Russia. They have been on high alert after a string of outages of power cables, telecoms links and gas pipelines that run along the relatively shallow seabed since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022.

NATO has boosted its presence in the Baltic with frigates, aircraft and naval drones in recent years.

"We remain in contact with the Finnish authorities, through exchange of information, via the NATO shipping centre located at our Allied Maritime Command in Northwood, UK," an official at the military alliance said.

The Fitburg was dragging its anchor in the sea, and was directed to Finnish territorial waters, the police and Finland's Border Guard said. The cable belongs to Finnish telecoms group Elisa.

Estonia's justice ministry said a second telecoms cable connecting the country to Finland had also suffered an outage on Wednesday. It was not immediately clear if the cable, belonging to Sweden's Arelion, was running parallel to Elisa's.

An Arelion spokesperson confirmed that the company had suffered an outage.

"I'm concerned about the reported damage... Hopefully it was not a deliberate act, but the investigation will clarify," Estonia's President Alar Karis said on X.

The European Commission was closely monitoring the incident, EU technology commissioner Henna Virkkunen wrote on X.

Finland in December 2024 boarded the Russian-linked oil tanker Eagle S which investigators said had damaged a power cable and several telecoms links in the Baltic Sea by dragging its anchor.

A Finnish court in October dismissed a criminal case against the Eagle S captain and other crew members, ruling prosecutors failed to prove intent and that any alleged negligence must be pursued by the ship's flag state or the crew's home countries.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:51:44 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/Z3F6EU7ZYROO5LXWRMIMRGVTHQ.jpg?auth=574d16f439f8dc019ef7217a81e10fb3809e39c926c6a361be0da9bf916e8165&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Several killed after explosion in Swiss ski resort bar, BBC reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/several-killed-after-explosion-swiss-ski-resort-bar-bbc-reports-2026-01-01/</link><description>Jan 1 (Reuters) - Several people were killed and others injured after an explosion in a bar in the Swiss ski resort of Crans-Montana, BBC reported on Thursday, citing police.

Pyongyang has sent thousands of troops to support Russia's nearly four-year invasion of Ukraine, according to South Korean and Western intelligence agencies.

At least 600 have died and thousands more have sustained injuries, according to South Korean estimates that could not be independently confirmed.

On Thursday Kim praised his men fighting in an "alien land", congratulating their "heroic" defence of the nation's honour and instructing them to "be brave", the state-run Korean Central News Agency said.

"As the whole country is enveloped in a festive atmosphere of greeting the new year, I all the more miss you, who are fighting bravely on the battlefields in the alien land even at this moment," he said.

Kim hinted that more overseas action could take place this year, highlighting "remarkable feats you will perform on the overseas battlefields".

Russian air defence units downed five Ukrainian drones headed ​for Moscow ‍on New Year's Eve, Mayor Sergei ​Sobyanin said.

Sobyanin, in a ​series of posts on Telegram over a little more than three hours into early on Thursday morning, said specialist ‍crews were examining fragments from ​the drones at the sites where they had hit the ‌ground.

Sobyanin made no mention of ‍casualties or damage.

Restrictions were placed on Moscow's Domodedovo airport for a time. Other airports in southern and ‍central Russia were also subject to ‌temporary ​restrictions.

Speaking in his New Year address to the nation, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Ukraine ⁠wanted the war to end, but not at any cost. He added that he would not sign a "weak" peace agreement that would only prolong the war.

Zelensky said Ukrainians were exhausted from nearly four years of war.

"What does Ukraine ​want? Peace? Yes. At any cost? No. We want an end to ​the war but not the end of Ukraine," Zelensky, wearing a dark green embroidered Ukrainian shirt, said in the 21-minute address issued just before midnight.

"Are we tired? Very. Does this mean we are ready to surrender? Anyone who thinks so is deeply mistaken."

Zelensky said any signature "placed on weak agreements only fuel the war".

"My signature will be placed on a strong agreement. And that is exactly what every meeting, every phone call, ‍every decision is about now," he said. "To secure a strong peace for everyone, not for a day, a week or two months, ​but peace for years."

Zelensky said weeks of US-led diplomacy, including his talks last weekend with US President Donald Trump in Florida, had produced a peace deal that was nearly ready.

"A ‌peace agreement is 90 percent ready, 10 percent remains," he said. "That 10 percent contains everything, it is the 10 percent that will determine the fate of peace, the ‍fate of Ukraine and Europe and how people will live."

Mamdani, a Democrat , was sworn in as the first Muslim leader of America’s biggest city, placing his hand on a Quran as he took his oath.

“This is truly the honour and the privilege of a lifetime,” Mamdani said in a brief speech.

The ceremony, administered by New York Attorney General Letitia James, a political ally, took place at the old City Hall station, one of the city’s original subway stops, known for its stunning arched ceilings.

In his first speech as mayor, Mamdani said the old subway station was a “testament to the importance of public transport to the vitality, the health and the legacy of our city”, as he announced the appointment of his new Department of Transportation commissioner, Mike Flynn.

The new mayor then closed with a smile. “Thank you all so much, now I will see you later,” he said, before heading up a flight of stairs.

Mamdani will be sworn in again, in grander style, at a public ceremony at City Hall at 1 p.m., to be administered by US Senator Bernie Sanders , one of the mayor’s political heroes. That will be followed by what the new administration is billing as a public block party on a stretch of Broadway known as the “Canyon of Heroes”, famous for its ticker-tape parades.

Mamdani now begins one of the most unrelenting jobs in American politics as one of the country’s most closely watched politicians.

In addition to being the city’s first Muslim mayor, Mamdani is also its first leader of South Asian descent and the first to be born in Africa. At 34, he is also the youngest mayor New York City has had in generations.

In a campaign that helped make “affordability” a buzzword across the political spectrum, the democratic socialist promised transformative change, with policies intended to lower the cost of living in one of the world’s most expensive cities. His platform included free childcare, free buses, a rent freeze for about one million households, and a pilot programme of city-run grocery stores.

But he will also have to contend with the less glamorous responsibilities of City Hall: dealing with rubbish, snow and rats, while being blamed for subway delays and potholes.

Mamdani was born in Kampala, Uganda, the son of filmmaker Mira Nair and academic and author Mahmood Mamdani. His family moved to New York City when he was seven, and he grew up in a post-9/11 city where Muslims did not always feel welcome. He became an American citizen in 2018.

He worked on political campaigns for Democratic candidates in the city before seeking public office himself, winning a state Assembly seat in 2020 to represent part of Queens.

Mamdani and his wife, Rama Duwaji, will leave their one-bedroom, rent-stabilised apartment in the outer boroughs to take up residence in the stately mayoral home in Manhattan.

He inherits a city on the upswing after years of slow recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Violent crime has fallen back to pre-pandemic lows, tourists have returned, and unemployment, which surged during the pandemic years, has also dropped to pre-COVID levels.

Yet deep concerns remain about high prices and rising rents.

Mamdani will also have to deal with Republican President Donald Trump .

During the mayoral race, Trump threatened to withhold federal funding from the city if Mamdani won and mused about sending National Guard troops to New York.

But Trump later surprised supporters and critics alike by inviting the Democrat to the White House for what turned out to be a cordial meeting in November.

“I want him to do a great job and will help him do a great job,” Trump said.

Still, tensions between the two leaders are almost certain to resurface, given their deep policy disagreements, particularly over immigration.

Mamdani also faces scepticism and opposition from some members of the city’s Jewish community over his criticisms of Israel’s government.

Since his election victory, the new mayor and his team have spent weeks preparing for the transition, surrounding Mamdani with seasoned figures who have worked inside or alongside city government.

That included persuading the city’s police commissioner, Jessica Tisch, to remain in her post — a move that helped calm fears in the business community that the new administration might pursue radical changes to policing strategy.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 06:38:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/b4ec0958-bc8a-11f0-bb0d-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25309163715647.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Swiss police say several people have died in fire at bar in ski resort</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/swiss-police-say-several-people-have-died-fire-bar-ski-resort-2026-01-01/</link><description>ZURICH, Jan 1 (Reuters) - Swiss police said on Thursday that several people had died and others were injured due to a fire of unknown causes at a bar called "Le Constellation" in the ski resort of Crans-Montana in southwestern Switzerland.

The governor, Vladimir Saldo, made the allegation in a statement on the Telegram messaging service.

Ukraine's military did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment, and Saldo did not provide visuals or other evidence that would enable Reuters to immediately verify the allegation.

Saldo alleged in his post that three Ukrainian drones had struck the site of new New Year celebrations in Khorly, a coastal village, in what he said was a "deliberate strike".

Russian state news agencies reported that at least 24 people had been killed and 29 more injured, citing the local branch of Russia's emergencies ministry.

Kherson is one of four regions in Ukraine which Russia claimed as its own in 2022, a move Kyiv and most Western countries condemned as an illegal land grab.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 08:30:03 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran Revolutionary Guard member reportedly killed during widening cost-of-living protests</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260101-iran-revolutionary-guard-member-reportedly-killed-during-widening-cost-of-living-protests</link><description>A volunteer member of Iran 's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard was killed in a western province during widening demonstrations sparked by the Islamic Republic's ailing economy , authorities said Thursday, marking the first fatality among security forces during the protests .

Spontaneous protests, driven by dissatisfaction at Iran's economic stagnation, began on Sunday in Tehran's largest mobile phone market, where shopkeepers shuttered their businesses, and have since drawn in students across the country.

The death Wednesday night of the 21-year-old volunteer in the Guard's Basij force may mark the start of a heavier-handed response by Iran's theocracy over the demonstrations, which have slowed in the capital, Tehran, but expanded to other provinces.

The state-run IRNA news agency reported on the Guard member’s death but did not elaborate. An Iranian news agency called the Student News Network, believed to be close to the Basij, directly blamed demonstrators for the Guard member's death, citing comments from Saeed Pourali, a deputy governor in Iran's Lorestan province.

The Guard member “was martyred ... at the hands of rioters during protests in this city in defence of public order”, he reportedly said. Another 13 Basij members and police officers suffered injuries, he added.

“The protests that have occurred are due to economic pressures, inflation and currency fluctuations, and are an expression of livelihood concerns," Pourali said. "The voices of citizens must be heard carefully and tactfully, but people must not allow their demands to be strained by profit-seeking individuals.”

The protests took place in the city of Kouhdasht, more than 400 kilometres southwest of Tehran.

A government building in southern Iran was also attacked on Wednesday, authorities said.

"A portion of the provincial governors' office door and its glass were destroyed in an attack by a number of people," said Hamed Ostovar, the head of the judiciary in the city of Fasa, as quoted by the justice ministry's Mizan agency, without specifying how the attack was carried out.

Iran's civilian government under reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian has been trying to signal it wants to negotiate with protesters . However, Pezeshkian has acknowledged there is not much he can do as Iran's rial currency has rapidly depreciated, with $1 now costing some 1.4 million rials.

Meanwhile, state television separately reported on the arrests of seven people, including five it described as monarchists and two others it said had linked to European-based groups. State TV also said another operation saw security forces confiscate 100 smuggled pistols, without elaborating.

The protests have yet to reach the scale of the 2022 nationwide protests triggered by the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody.

Iran's theocracy had declared Wednesday a public holiday across much of the country, citing cold weather, likely as a bid to get people out of the capital for a long weekend. The Iranian weekend is Thursday and Friday, while Saturday marks Imam Ali's birthday, another holiday for many.

Iran's economy has been in the doldrums for years, with heavy US and international sanctions over Tehran's nuclear programme weighing heavily on it.

The currency, the rial, has also plunged in recent months, losing more than a third of its value against the US dollar since last year.

In December, inflation stood at 52 percent year-on-year, according to official statistics.

Some basic necessities are becoming unaffordable for a portion of the population, which has been suffering from severe international sanctions against Iran for decades.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 08:31:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/722cac02-e6e3-11f0-8a30-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/2025-12-30T123528Z-941861327-RC20RIAYGVT9-RTRMADP-3-IRAN-ECONOMY-PROTESTS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israel says forces open fire on West Bank stone-throwers, one dead</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-says-forces-open-fire-west-bank-stone-throwers-one-dead-2026-01-01/</link><description>Jan 1 (Reuters) - The Israeli military said its forces killed a Palestinian in the occupied West Bank in the early hours on Thursday as they opened fire on people who were throwing stones at soldiers.

Two other people were hit on a main road near the village of Luban al-Sharqiya in Nablus, the military statement added. It described the people as militants and said the stone-throwing was part of an ambush.

Palestinian authorities in the West Bank said a 26-year-old man they named as Khattab Al Sarhan was killed and another person wounded.

Israeli forces had closed the main entrance to the village of Luban al-Sharqiya, in Nablus, and blocked several secondary roads on Wednesday, the Palestinian Authority's official news agency WAFA reported.

More than a thousand Palestinians were killed in the West Bank between October 2023 and October 2025, mostly in operations by security forces and some by settler violence, the U.N. has said.

Over the same period, 57 Israelis were killed in Palestinian attacks.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 09:27:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israel says it will 'enforce' ban on 37 NGOs in Gaza as humanitarian crisis deepens</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260101-israel-says-will-enforce-ban-37-ngos-gaza-humanitarian-crisis-deepens</link><description>Israel said on Thursday that 37 international NGOs operating in Gaza had not complied with a deadline to meet "security and transparency standards," in particular disclosing information on their Palestinian staff, and that it "will enforce" a ban on their activities.

More than 500 aid workers have been killed in the Palestinian territory since October, 2023.

"Organisations that have failed to meet required security and transparency standards will have their licenses suspended," said spokesman for the Ministry of Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism, Gilad Zwick.

Organisations that have had their license revoked will be forced to cease all activities by March 1, 2026.

Organisations that will have their licenses revoked include Doctors Without Borders ( MSF ), the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC), World Vision International, CARE and Oxfam, according to a list provided by Israel’s Ministry of Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism.

In March, Israel gave a ten-month deadline to NGOs to comply with the new rules, which expired on Wednesday night. The UN has warned that the ban will exacerbate the humanitarian situation in Gaza.

The foreign ministers of 10 nations on Tuesday expressed "serious concerns" about a "renewed deterioration of the humanitarian situation" in Gaza, describing the situation "catastrophic" .

"As winter draws in, civilians in Gaza are facing appalling conditions with heavy rainfall and temperatures dropping," the ministers of Britain, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Iceland, Japan, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland said in a joint statement released by the UK's Foreign Office.

"1.3 million people still require urgent shelter support. More than half of health facilities are only partially functional and face shortages of essential medical equipment and supplies. The total collapse of sanitation infrastructure has left 740,000 people vulnerable to toxic flooding," the statement added.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 09:49:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/1d2b48d0-e6f2-11f0-87b2-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25364625314103.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Swiss police believe around 40 died at Swiss bar explosion, Italy says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/swiss-police-believe-around-40-died-swiss-bar-explosion-italy-says-2026-01-01/</link><description>ROME, Jan 1 (Reuters) - Swiss police believe around 40 people died and 100 were injured in a fire during a New Year's Eve party in the resort town of Crans-Montana, the Italian Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Thursday.

State media said on Thursday the person killed was 21-year-old Amirhossam Khodayari Fard, a member of the paramilitary Basij militia which is regularly deployed to suppress unrest, though Reuters was unable to verify this.

The incident in Kuhdasht in Iran's western Lorestan province marks an escalation in the unrest that has spread across the country since shopkeepers began protests on Sunday over inflation and the falling currency.

It comes at a critical moment for Iran's clerical rulers as Western sanctions hammer an economy hit by 40% inflation and after Israeli and U.S. airstrikes in June targeted the country's nuclear infrastructure and military leadership.

Tehran has responded to the unrest with an offer of dialogue , a more conciliatory approach than it has taken during most previous bouts of unrest, though activists have also reported police flooding the streets.

Government spokesperson Fatemeh Mohajerani said on Thursday that the authorities would hold a direct dialogue with representatives of trades unions and merchants, but without giving details.

The activist HRANA news agency said late on Wednesday there was a heavy presence of security forces in cities with arrests, shootings and clashes in some areas. State media said students were detained then released during the demonstrations.

The Basij is a volunteer paramilitary force fiercely loyal to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and affiliated with the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, which said in a statement that 13 of the militia members had been injured.

Many Iranian social media users disputed the authorities' account of the incident and a video widely shared online that Reuters could not immediately verify appeared to show protesters trying to get an injured person into an ambulance.

The Revolutionary Guards statement accused those involved in the unrest in Kuhdasht of "taking advantage of the atmosphere of popular protests".

Merchants, shop owners and students in different Iranian universities have been demonstrating for days and closing major bazaar markets. The government shut down much of the country on Wednesday by declaring a holiday due to cold weather.

Authorities have in recent years quashed protests over issues ranging from high prices, droughts, women's rights and political freedoms, often with tough security measures and extensive arrests.

However, in an unusual response to the latest protests, President Masoud Pezeshkian said he had asked the interior minister to listen to "legitimate demands" of the demonstrators.

Iran's economy has been struggling for years as a result of U.S. and Western sanctions over Tehran's nuclear program. Regional tensions led to a 12-day air war with Israel in June, further straining the country's finances.

The Iranian rial has lost around half its value against the dollar in 2025, with inflation reaching 42.5% in December in a country where unrest has repeatedly flared in recent years.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 11:19:08 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Argentine soccer body in turmoil ahead of World Cup over mystery villa and dirty money claims</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sports/soccer/argentine-soccer-body-turmoil-ahead-world-cup-over-mystery-villa-dirty-money-2026-01-01/</link><description>BUENOS AIRES, Jan 1 (Reuters) - In March 2024, retired Argentine soccer star Carlos Tevez published a tweet , opens new tab hinting at something suspicious going on in a Buenos Aires suburb. The treasurer of the Argentine Football Association, Tevez claimed, was making many trips to Pilar, where he implied the soccer official had buried bags of money and kept a collection of antique cars.

Coalicion Civica, a progressive political party, began investigating after Tevez's post and filed a criminal complaint centered on a mystery villa in Pilar.

As the World Cup approaches, allegations that the villa may have been used for money-laundering have become one of a series of scandals gripping the soccer association that is in charge of the game in Argentina, the current world champions.

In early December, police raided the AFA headquarters and more than a dozen soccer clubs as part of a money-laundering probe that looked at transfers of money tied to clubs and a financial services company.

Three days later, authorities raided the Pilar villa, finding a heliport, stables and 54 vehicles, including luxury cars and collectible cars. In its criminal complaint, Coalicion Civica alleges the property is a front for a money-laundering scheme connected to Chiqui Tapia, the president of the AFA, and its treasurer, Pablo Toviggino.

Last week, in another case, a prosecutor charged Tapia, Toviggino and other AFA leaders for unlawful retention of taxes totaling $13 million following a complaint from Argentina’s tax agency, according to news outlet La Nacion.

The AFA did not respond to an inquiry from Reuters requesting an interview with both Tapia and Toviggino and for comment on the various judicial investigations that have been opened.

In a public statement, the association has said it is being attacked by the government of President Javier Milei, referring to how Milei has pushed for Argentina’s soccer clubs, which have long functioned as nonprofit entities run by their members, to become for-profit companies under private owners.

“We are on the right path,” the AFA said, listing competitions Argentina has won since Tapia became president in 2017, including the World Cup itself in 2022.

A representative for Tevez did not respond to an interview request. Toviggino did not respond to a request for comment.

Despite plaudits for Argentina’s performance on the field, the AFA is going through its biggest crisis in years.

“There are two AFAs,” said Nestor Centra, an Argentine sports journalist, referring to its international success and the instability at home.

Several months after Tevez’s tweet, Matias Yofe, president of Coalicion Civica's branch in Pilar, told Reuters that he and his colleagues talked to about 10 employees who had worked at the Pilar property and presumed that Toviggino or Tapia were the owners.

One person, Yofe said, described Tapia once arriving by helicopter and then gifting employees soccer jerseys.

“What they described was they moved as owners of the place, they got in the pool, used the facilities,” Yofe said. “Everyone indicated that this belongs to people of the AFA.”

Coalicion Civica’s complaint alleged that the property had been purchased in 2024 by a company owned by Ana Lucia Conte and Luciano Nicolas Pantano, a mother and son that it claimed could not afford the purchase. An attorney who has represented Pantano did not respond to a request for comment.

Records viewed by Reuters indicate that the property, several city blocks long, was bought for $1.8 million, although experts suspect it's worth much more. The complaint points to Pantano's connections with the soccer world, such as serving as the head of the Argentine Civil Association of Futsal and Beach Soccer.

According to court documents, officials during the raid found a black imitation leather bag branded with the AFA logo and Toviggino’s name, several books on soccer and a plaque honoring Toviggino. The 54 vehicles included a Ferrari and several Porsches, registered under the company the complaint attributed to Pantano and Conte.

An official with knowledge of the case said that Toviggino’s relatives had authorization to drive at least several of the cars, confirming a report by local television station TN. Authorities have requested information on the pilots who used the heliport in the hopes of learning about the passengers.

The justice ministry has demanded that the AFA and the Superliga, an association that handles transmission rights of matches, give explanations for accounting entries of nearly half a billion dollars going back to 2017. Daniel Vitolo, the head of the ministry’s Inspector General’s office, told Reuters that those amounts fall into categories on balance reports with generic names such as “others." The Superliga declined a request from Reuters for comment.

“If the AFA really has its papers in order, why doesn’t it explain something that’s very easy to explain?” he said.

Experts said it’s unlikely that the judicial cases will affect Argentina’s participation in the World Cup.

“No one can pay the political cost of doing that,” said Alan Wilder, a sports law attorney in Buenos Aires. “No one would approve of the mere idea of taking (Lionel) Messi out of the World Cup, with this possibly being his last World Cup. He’s the sacred cow.”

Soccer worldwide is no stranger to financial scandals, and in recent years top FIFA officials have been charged with corruption. Tapia’s predecessor resigned amid an investigation into irregularities involving management of match broadcasting funds. Those charged in the case were absolved this month.

Prior to the current scandals, AFA had already faced criticism by fans for favoritism. Many were angered when the AFA recently awarded Rosario Central, home team of national star player Angel Di Maria, a new and controversial trophy.

"I think the lid has been blown off the pot," said Enzo Gutierrez, 30, a Buenos Aires resident who roots for the team San Martin from his native province of San Juan. "It has grabbed my attention a lot but if you're a soccer fan you live knowing that these things happen in Argentine soccer."</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 11:19:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/C3VZHMAU3VMPNPB4LLXP3B5B7I.jpg?auth=c72f6f706277eff8e12d45181b85108a54c2d943f0b7177f92fb6dd3bda84dee&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukrainian drones strike Russian energy targets in Krasnodar, Tatarstan regions</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukrainian-drones-strike-russian-energy-targets-krasnodar-tatarstan-regions-2026-01-01/</link><description>MOSCOW, Jan 1 (Reuters) - Ukrainian drones struck an oil refinery in Russia's southern Krasnodar region, as well as an energy storage facility in the oil-rich Volga river region of Tatarstan, Russian authorities and Ukraine's military said on Thursday.

Debris from a drone had hit the Ilskiy oil refinery in Krasnodar, causing no casualties but igniting a fire that was later extinguished, local authorities said.

In Tatarstan, Russian media cited the local governor's press service as saying that an energy storage facility in the city of Almetyevsk had been hit, causing a blaze that was later put out.

Almetyevsk is located around 1,400 km (869 miles) from Ukraine.

The Ukrainian military said in a statement it had struck both facilities. Kyiv has been intensifying strikes against Russian energy infrastructure in recent months, aiming to cut off Moscow's sources of financing for its military campaign in Ukraine.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 12:45:03 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukraine condemns Russian new year drone attack on power infrastructure</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/ukraine-condemns-russian-new-year-drone-attack-power-infrastructure-2026-01-01/</link><description>Jan 1 (Reuters) - A Russian drone attack damaged power infrastructure in several Ukrainian regions overnight, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Thursday, while Moscow accused Ukraine of carrying out a deadly new year attack in a Russian-controlled part of Ukraine.

"On New Year, Russia deliberately brings war. Over 200 attack drones were launched onto Ukraine in the night," Zelenskiy wrote on Telegram.

Zelenskiy said energy infrastructure in seven regions across Ukraine had been targeted.

Russia accused Ukraine of killing at least 24 people, including a child, in a drone strike on a hotel and cafe where civilians were seeing in the New Year in a Russian-controlled part of Ukraine's southern Kherson region.

Ukraine's military, which has accused Russia of killing thousands of civilians in its own attacks on Ukrainian cities, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Moscow's accusation.

Zelenskiy said that Russia's holiday season attacks showed Ukraine could not afford delays in air defence supplies.

"(Our) allies have the names of equipment which we are lacking. We expect that everything agreed with the United States at the end of December for our defence will arrive on time," he said, without clarifying further.

Zelenskiy met with U.S. President Donald Trump in Florida on Sunday to negotiate a peace framework to end the nearly four-year war. Both leaders have said they are close to an agreement, but thorny issues around post-war control of territories remain.

The Ukrainian energy ministry said a "significant number" of households in the Volyn and Odesa regions - in northwestern and southwestern Ukraine, respectively - were disconnected from power supplies by the overnight strikes, as well as some in the Chernihiv region north of the capital Kyiv.

The governor of Volant said more than 103,000 households in that region had lost power as a result of the attack. Volyn region is several hundred kilometres from the front line and borders NATO member Poland.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 13:34:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/IMLOOZ7PH5KMFKKXKOXIYTXLKM.jpg?auth=117d345c066122527292812e7493b5a7fd49da72abbe1989cf7d3a0261bb6a3b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia says it will give U.S. proof of attempted Ukrainian strike on Putin residence</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-says-it-will-give-us-proof-attempted-ukrainian-strike-putin-residence-2026-01-01/</link><description>MOSCOW, Jan 1 (Reuters) - Russia said on Thursday it had extracted and decoded a file from a Ukrainian drone downed earlier this week that it said shows it had been targeting a Russian presidential residence and that it would hand over the relevant information to the United States.

Moscow accused Kyiv on Monday of trying to strike a residence of President Vladimir Putin in Russia's northern Novgorod region with 91 long-range attack drones. It said Russia would review its negotiating position in ongoing talks with the U.S. on ending the Ukraine war.

Ukraine and Western countries have disputed Russia's account of the alleged attempted strike.

In a statement posted on Telegram on Thursday, Russia's Defence Ministry said: "Decryption of routing data revealed that the final target of the Ukrainian drone attack on December 29, 2025, was a facility at the Russian Presidential Residence in the Novgorod region."

"These materials will be transferred to the American side through the established channels," it added.

The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday that U.S. national security officials had found Ukraine did not target Putin or one of his residences in a drone strike. Reuters could not immediately verify the report.

U.S. President Donald Trump initially expressed sympathy for the Russian charge, telling reporters on Monday that Putin had informed him of the alleged incident and that he was "very angry" about it.

By Wednesday, Trump appeared more sceptical, sharing on social media a New York Post editorial accusing Russia of blocking peace in Ukraine.

Ukraine has denied carrying out such an attack and described the accusation as part of a Russian disinformation campaign meant to drive a wedge between Kyiv and Washington after a weekend meeting between Trump and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 13:35:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/SFD6Y6BWAFNEHLTRAK5PCTQ7IQ.jpg?auth=3eac6b4dfc2c835c3f936b8764a66233ccb1c4214a6de2c52c73b5dc833bc9fa&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Somalia says it killed 29 al-Shabaab militants with international support</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/somalia-says-it-killed-29-al-shabaab-militants-with-international-support-2026-01-01/</link><description>NAIROBI, Jan 1 (Reuters) - Somalia's armed forces have eliminated 29 al-Shabaab militants in the town of Jabad Godane in southeastern Somalia, in coordination with international partners, the Defence Ministry said in a statement on Thursday.

Al-Shabaab has waged an insurgency in Somalia since 2007 in a bid to topple the internationally-backed central government and establish its own rule based on its strict interpretation of sharia law.

The ministry said in a statement on X that it also destroyed vehicles and weapons "that were intended for use in terrorist attacks against civilians," through airstrike operations in the Middle Shabelle region conducted overnight.

"The Ministry of Defence extends its appreciation to international partners for their continued support in security cooperation, intelligence sharing, and operational enablement in the fight against terrorism," it said but did not specify which partners it was referring to.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 13:35:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Bulgaria celebrates entry into euro zone, lev currency banished into history</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/bulgaria-celebrates-entry-into-euro-zone-lev-currency-banished-into-history-2026-01-01/</link><description>SOFIA, Jan 1 (Reuters) - EU member Bulgaria marked its entry into the euro zone on Thursday with a display of euro coins on the facade of the central bank in Sofia and fireworks to celebrate a long-awaited milestone.

As of midnight the euro became the country's currency and the lev was banished into history.

Bulgaria's entry into the euro zone will take the number of Europeans using the currency to more than 350 million. The last country to join the single currency group was Croatia in January 2023.

"Our money will be in a different currency - if I have 10,000 leva, now I will have 5,100 euros. It's all the same. And I think it will be better." Stefan Bisterkov, a driving instructor, said.

Aside from changing currency, becoming the euro zone's 21st member means Bulgaria gets a seat at the European Central Bank's rate-setting Governing Council.

Successive Bulgarian governments have tried to make the step since the Balkan country of 6.7 million people joined the EU in 2007. Bulgarians are split on the issue, opinion polls show, although businesses are largely in favour.

"My expectations from (adopting) the euro are positive, I don't think there will be anything to worry about, quite the opposite. We will only benefit from this, and it will only be more useful for us," said Antonia Tsvetkova, a jeweller.

"Anyone who goes on a trip will not have problems exchanging currency, now everything will be normal."

Some Bulgarians worry that using the euro will push up prices, or are suspicious of a domestic political establishment that is in crisis. The government stepped down last month amid widespread protests against proposed tax increases.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 13:35:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/6RBBZ5TDHVNW3DYRVBXPOV6ZUI.jpg?auth=8f4bb39fb7853dce7ebcec333524a68a8e4b92cda8261e8824904a218395c8c9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UK says small boat migrant arrivals approached record levels in 2025</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260101-uk-says-small-boat-migrant-arrivals-approached-record-levels-2025</link><description>The second-highest annual number of migrants arrived on UK shores in small boats since records were started in 2018, government statistics confirmed on Thursday.

The tally comes as Brexit firebrand Nigel Farage 's anti-immigration party Reform UK surges in popularity ahead of bellwether local elections in May.

With Labour Prime Minister Keir Starmer increasingly under pressure over the thorny issue, his interior minister Shabana Mahmood has proposed a drastic reduction in protections for refugees and the ending of automatic benefits for asylum seekers.

Home Office data showed that no small boats were detected on December 31, meaning a total of 41,472 migrants landed on England 's southern coast in 2025 after making the perilous Channel crossing from northern France .

The record of 45,774 arrivals was recorded in 2022 under the last Conservative government.

Former Tory prime minister Rishi Sunak vowed to "stop the boats" when he was in power.

Ousted by Starmer in July 2024, he later said he regretted the slogan because it was too "stark" and "binary" and lacked sufficient context "for exactly how challenging" the goal was.

Adopting his own "smash the gangs" slogan, Starmer pledged to tackle the problem by dismantling the people smuggling networks running the crossings, but has so far had no more success than his predecessor.

Reform has led Starmer's Labour Party by double-digit margins in opinion polls for most of 2025.

In a New Year message, Farage predicted that if Reform got things "right" at the forthcoming local elections "we will go on and win the general election" due in 2029 at the latest.

Without addressing the migrant issue directly, he added: "We will then absolutely have a chance of fundamentally changing the whole system of government in Britain."

In his own New Year message, Starmer insisted his government would "defeat the decline and division offered by others".

Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch, meanwhile, urged people not to let "politics of grievance tell you that we're destined to stay the same".

The small boat figures come after Home Secretary Mahmood in November said irregular migration was "tearing our country apart".

In early December, an interior ministry spokesperson called the number of small boat crossings "shameful" and said Mahmood's "sweeping reforms" would remove the incentives driving the arrivals.

A returns deal with France had so far resulted in 153 people being removed from the UK to France and 134 being brought to the UK from France, border security and asylum minister Alex Norris said.

"Our landmark one-in one-out scheme means we can now send those who arrive on small boats back to France," he said.

The past year has seen multiple protests in UK towns over the housing of migrants in hotels.

Amid growing anti-immigrant sentiment, in September up to 150,000 massed in central London for one of the largest-ever far-right protests in Britain, organised by activist Tommy Robinson.

Asylum claims in Britain are at a record high, with around 111,000 applications made in the year to June 2025, according to official figures as of mid-November.

Labour is currently taking inspiration from Denmark 's coalition government – led by the centre-left Social Democrats – which has implemented some of the strictest migration policies in Europe.

Senior British officials recently visited the Scandinavian country, where successful asylum claims are at a 40-year low.

But the government's plans will likely face opposition from Labour's more left-wing lawmakers, fearing that the party is losing voters to progressive alternatives such as the Greens.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 14:21:19 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/54ace03c-8d71-11f0-ad9a-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/878996b3e56b816308cf78bfe216bec9e121b485.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>More about the Crans-Montana resort</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/crans-montana-swiss-resort-centre-deadly-bar-fire-2026-01-01/</link><description>BERLIN, Jan 1 (Reuters) - Following are some key facts about the Swiss resort of Crans-Montana where officials said dozens of people were killed and 100 injured, most of them seriously, after a fire tore through a crowded bar during a New Year's Eve party.

Crans-Montana is in the Swiss Alps in the French-speaking part of the canton of Valais. It lies on a plateau above the city of Sierre, around 1,500 metres (4,920 feet) above sea level, with views of the Valais Alps and the Weisshorn mountain.

The resort has attracted a long line-up of celebrities, including James Bond star Roger Moore who lived there until his death in 2017. Model Claudia Schiffer, actor Hugh Grant and former French President Nicolas Sarkozy have all passed through.

It hosts major events including the Omega European Masters golf tournament, which drew more than 48,000 spectators in 2024, and the Alpine Ski World Cup, attended by 37,000 people.

Around three million people visit Crans-Montana every year, far more than its local population of 10,500.

From November 2023 to October 2024, Swiss travellers accounted for 66% of hotel stays, according to Crans-Montana Tourism &amp; Congress Committee data.

This was followed by tourists from France (7.3%), Italy (3.7%), Britain (3.5%), the United States (2.8%), the Gulf states (2.4%), Belgium (2.1%) and Germany (2.0%).

Crans-Montana's ski operations are part of the international Epic Pass network operated by U.S.-listed Vail Resorts (MTN.N) , opens new tab , which acquired the resort's ski lift company in 2024.

Vail Resorts manages 42 mountain sites, including Crans-Montana and Andermatt-Sedrun in Switzerland.

In its December 2025 capital plan, Vail highlighted the rising importance of its Swiss resorts in attracting U.S. visitors and boosting revenue in Europe.

The resort has 140 km (87 miles) of ski slopes, mountain biking trails, hiking routes and championship golf courses, according to its annual report.

It also has 2,678 hotel beds and many holiday apartments. In 2024, 1.45 million Swiss francs ($1.83 million) of central reservation sales and 283,515 Swiss francs from activity bookings were recorded.

The Saudi-backed, internationally recognized Yemeni government ordered new restrictions on flights to and from the UAE, aiming to curb escalating tensions in Yemen, a Saudi source told Reuters.

But the move triggered a defiant response: Yemen’s transport minister, aligned with Yemen's southern separatists, ordered a full shutdown of air traffic rather than comply.

The Southern Transitional Council, the UAE-backed Yemeni separatist force that seized most of southern Yemen last month, blamed the closure on “sudden new regulations” Saudi Arabia sought to impose.

The UAE Foreign Ministry did not immediately reply to a request for comment on the airport closure.

The tussle is the latest in a deepening crisis in Yemen that has exposed a deep rift between the two Gulf oil powers.

Saudi Arabia this week accused the UAE of pressuring Yemen's STC to push towards the kingdom's borders and declared its national security a "red line," prompting the UAE to say it was pulling its remaining forces out of Yemen.

That followed an airstrike by Saudi-led coalition forces on the southern Yemeni port of Mukalla that the coalition said was a dock used to provide foreign military support to the separatists.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 15:23:02 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/Y22AAQLLSRNSXEMBDYEV743ZM4.jpg?auth=f349ecb75dd6350610bdd401ca6e34de729636cf9e68a68382499773ae24d38b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump tells WSJ he is taking more aspirin than doctors recommend</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-tells-wsj-he-is-taking-more-aspirin-than-doctors-recommend-2026-01-01/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 1 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal that he is taking a larger daily dose of aspirin than his doctors recommend.

"They say aspirin is good for thinning out the blood, and I don’t want thick blood pouring through my heart," Trump told the paper in an interview published on Thursday. "I want nice, thin blood pouring through my heart. Does that make sense?"

Trump, 79, is the second-oldest person to ever hold the presidency, following his Democratic predecessor President Joe Biden, who dropped his 2024 reelection bid amid questions about his fitness for the job and was aged 82 when he left office a year ago.

Trump's health has been in the spotlight in recent months due to bruises that have been spotted on his hands and an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) exam that he was reported to have undergone in October, as well as instances where the Republican president closed his eyes during public events.

Daily use of aspirin can lower the chances of heart attack or stroke for people over the age of 60, according to the Mayo Clinic, which says a low dose of aspirin is most commonly 81 milligrams.

The president's doctor, Sean Barbabella, told the Journal that Trump takes 325 milligrams of aspirin daily for cardiac prevention.

The bruising is the result of him shaking so many hands , according to the White House, which said last month the MRI was preventative .

When asked about the MRI, Trump and Barbabella told the Journal that the president actually got a CT scan.

Barbabella said Trump's doctors had initially said they would perform either an MRI or a CT scan but decided to do the latter "to definitively rule out any cardiovascular issues."

It revealed no abnormalities, according to Barbabella.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 15:23:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/JS5MXIV3E5PB5CUZYEADUV6E74.jpg?auth=4d58f51f63bb61e229460ed5f58c7d805aca29e57ddd523ea8aad88c450d4d5a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Togo releases Frenchman detained since June over anti-government protests</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/africa/20260101-togo-releases-frenchman-detained-since-june-over-anti-government-protests</link><description>A Frenchman detained last year in Togo over alleged involvement in anti-government protests arrived back in France on Thursday after his release, the French foreign ministry said.

Steeve Rouyar, a 44-year-old father of two originally from Guadeloupe , had been living in the west African nation since late 2024 when he was arrested in June.

The prosecutor's office in the capital Lome said he was one of around 50 protesters arrested on June 6 during a rare anti-government demonstration in Togo, led with an iron fist by Faure Gnassingbe for the past two decades.

"A decision by the Togolese judiciary" allowed his release, the French foreign ministry said, without providing further details.

The demonstrations began in response to calls for civil disobedience sent out on social media by the June 6 Movement (M66), whose name refers to the longtime Togolese leader's birthday and the day the protests began.

A source following the case, speaking on condition of anonymity as they were not allowed to speak to the press, told AFP in September that Rouyar had been accused of "undermining state security", a charge that can be punished with two to three decades in jail.

He was also accused of helping make flyers, the source said.

The Togolese government said on Wednesday that Gnassingbe has pardoned 1,511 prisoners, but there was no immediate list of the names of those released. Such pardons are common at the end of the year.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 15:24:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/91512e5e-e71b-11f0-b3dd-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/000-73QT363.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>New Year party at Swiss ski resort turned into a disaster zone</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/new-year-party-swiss-ski-resort-turned-into-disaster-zone-2026-01-01/</link><description>CRANS-MONTANA, Switzerland, Jan 1 (Reuters) - As he approached Le Constellation bar to celebrate the New Year in a snowy Swiss ski resort bright with Christmas lights, Dominic Dubois saw flames engulfing the building.

"You could see the orange, the orange, yellow, red," Dubois told Reuters, describing chaotic scenes as bystanders and emergency crews worked together to pull victims clear.

He described how people who had managed to escape the burning building were plunged into the cold outside. "So one of the priorities was to get everyone warm ... the curtains of the restaurant were used," he said.

Dozens of people were killed and around 100 injured when fire tore through the crowded bar during a New Year's Eve party in the Crans-Montana resort , officials said on Thursday.

Nearby, local resident Samuel Rapp, 21, was dining at a Mexican restaurant when he heard of the blaze, and rushed with his girlfriend to Le Constellation, a bar popular with young locals.

"Police and paramedics ... had already set up a protective perimeter," he told Reuters. "There were people screaming, and then people lying on the ground, probably dead. They had jackets over their faces."

Fire broke out in the bar at 1.30 a.m. (0030 GMT). The cause of the blaze, which was initially reported as an explosion, was not yet clear but authorities said it appeared to be an accident rather than an attack.

Rapp said he had seen videos showing desperate partygoers trampling each other to escape. "People were shouting, 'help me, please help us.'"

The local branch of UBS bank opened up to give refuge to survivors, said Dubois, standing at the police cordon on Thursday in a green knitted hat.

"All the tables were pushed aside and people entered and it was warm in there, there was more light as well, so the triage was down there," he said.

"Paramedics, police - not the firemen, the firemen were out here. And then it was just ambulances coming back and forth as much as possible."

Video footage showed lines of ambulances queuing and helicopters landing to take victims of the blast to nearby hospitals and specialist burns units in other Swiss cities.

A waiter in a restaurant near the bar, who declined to be named, said first responders approached staff to ask for tablecloths to cover the bodies to conceal them from onlookers.

In daylight on Thursday, the bar was covered in white sheeting with a tent set up outside and a grey hearse parked in front.

The exhibition is also a chance to look back on 50 years of work from the beloved artist, who died in December .

Global Warning at the Jeu de Paume Paris runs from January 30 to May 24.

Pierre-Auguste Renior’s reputation as a “painter of happiness” sometimes saw him derided as a lightweight by his peers, but will no doubt make for an exhibition to lift the spirits.

The theme of love will be explored through around 50 of the impressionist’s paintings, focusing on scenes from everyday life. In these, Renoir represented luminous and vibrant moments of human connection during shared meals, conversations and dancing.

Renoir et l’amour at the Musée d’Orsay runs from March 17 to July 19.

This blockbuster show features more than 230 paintings, drawings, books and Cut Outs documenting the final years of Henri Matisse’s career. The modern master is known for his vivid and innovative use of colour, particularly in his Cut Outs in which he used brightly coloured paper shapes to represent nature , animals and the human form.

Visitors will get a chance to see works borrowed from Paris’ Pompidou centre (which is currently closed for renovation until 2030) and international collections, including Sorrows of the King, Danseuse Créole (“Creole Danser”) and Matisse’s famous Blue Nudes.

Matisse 1941-1954 at the Grand Palais runs from March 24 to July 26.

For billions of gamers around the world, music is an essential and evocative component of successful worldbuilding. With 20 installations investigating the relationship between artistry, storytelling and technology, this interactive exhibition explores the history of video game music, from early sound chips to modern audio landscapes.

Alongside the exhibition, concert-goers can buy tickets for orchestral performances of scores from popular games, including Final Fantasy and Assassin’s Creed.

Hollywood icon Marilyn Monroe would have celebrated her 100th birthday in 2026 and French film museum the Cinématheque is marking the occasion with an exhibition in her honour.

Monroe was a talented comedic actress who starred in more than 30 films, but her technical skill was often eclipsed by her megawatt fame, looks and personal life. This exhibition commemorates her greatest film performances and investigates what the enduring fascination with the star says about the public’s relationship with Hollywood and celebrity .

Marilyn Monroe: 100 ans at the Cinémathèque Française runs from April 8 to July 26.

For two weeks in June, Paris’s oldest bridge will be transformed into a giant cave by the French street artist known as JR. The ambitious installation was inspired by the rocks used to create Pont Neuf’s stone bricks and aims to create a rugged juxtaposition to the capital’s traditional architecture . It is also an homage to artists Christo et Jeanne-Claude, who famously wrapped the bridge in 41,800 square metres of fabric in 1985.

Originally planned for 2025, the JR project was postponed by a year to allow for complicated logistics. It will be freely accessible to visitors who will be able to walk across the bridge and pass underneath on boats while the artwork is in place.

La Caverne du Pont Neuf will be open to the public from June 6-28.

The Netherlands traditionally rings in the New Year with people setting off their own fireworks, which causes hundreds of injuries and millions of euros in damage every year. This year, some 250 people were arrested on New Year's Eve and in several towns riot police were deployed, police said.

"The impact of heavy fireworks and arson this New Year's Eve in some areas was utterly devastating. The targeted violence against emergency services and police was intense again," police said in a statement on Thursday.

The fireworks accidents killed a 38-year-old man in Aalsmeer, close to Amsterdam, and a boy from Nijmegen, a town in the east of the country, police said.

In Amsterdam, the neo-Gothic Vondelkerk, near the city's central Vondelpark, was destroyed by a fire that started shortly after midnight.

The Amsterdam police and fire department said they were investigating and had no comment yet on what caused the blaze in the church, which was built in 1872.

New Year's Eve 2025 marked the last year before a nationwide ban on the sale of fireworks to consumers will come into effect.

Emergency room doctors, police, firefighters and local and national politicians have campaigned for the ban for years.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 16:53:49 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5KCOVJXVANI27B2O3EOLREY7U4.jpg?auth=4b6bc800a2707775280efaa5fdd7844c9ba9eae6036591c06026c1533414c6de&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia and Ukraine trade allegations of civilian attacks on New Year's day</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-ukraine-trade-allegations-civilian-attacks-new-years-day-2026-01-01/</link><description>KYIV, Jan 1 (Reuters) - Russia and Ukraine accused each other of targeting civilians over the New Year, with Moscow reporting a deadly strike on a hotel in territory it occupies in southern Ukraine while Kyiv said there had been another broad attack on its power supplies.

The reports coincide with intensive talks aimed at bringing an end to the nearly four-year-old war , overseen by U.S. President Donald Trump. Both countries have said the other is doing all it can to influence his views and shape the outcome.

"On New Year, Russia deliberately brings war. Over 200 attack drones were launched onto Ukraine in the night," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy wrote on Telegram, saying energy infrastructure in seven regions across Ukraine had been targeted.

Russia accused Ukraine of killing at least 24 people, including a child, in a drone strike on a hotel and cafe where civilians were seeing in the New Year in a Russian-controlled part of the Kherson region in southern Ukraine.

Ukraine's military, which has accused Russia of killing many civilians in its own attacks on Ukrainian cities, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Zelenskiy said that Russia's holiday season attacks showed Ukraine could not afford delays in air defence supplies.

"(Our) allies have the names of equipment which we are lacking. We expect that everything agreed with the United States at the end of December for our defence will arrive on time," he said, without clarifying further.

Vladimir Saldo, the Russian-installed governor of the region, said three Ukrainian drones had hit the celebrations in Khorly, a coastal village, in what he said was a "deliberate strike" against civilians. He said that many people had been burnt alive.

Russia's Foreign Ministry said that as well as the 24 dead, 50 people had been injured, including six minors who were being treated in hospital.

"There is no doubt that the attack was planned in advance, with drones deliberately targeting areas where civilians had gathered to celebrate New Year's Eve," the ministry said in a statement, calling the attack a "war crime".

On Monday, Moscow accused Kyiv of trying to strike a residence of President Vladimir Putin . Ukrainian and European officials have said the incident did not happen and U.S. security officials were also reported to have found that Ukraine did not target the residence. Russia said on Thursday it would send Washington proof.

Reuters was not able to immediately verify the reported Kherson region attack or photographs of what Saldo's press service said was the aftermath on Thursday.

The images showed at least one dead body was visible beneath a white sheet. The building showed signs that a fire had raged and there were what looked like blood stains on the ground. Russia's TASS news agency published video showing drone fragments, some with Ukrainian writing on them.

Ukrainian officials regularly report civilian deaths from Russian air attacks, including in the Ukrainian-held city of Kherson, which lies near the front line.

The Ukrainian governor of Kherson region, Oleksandr Prokudin, said that one man had been killed and an 87-year-old woman injured in attacks on the city on Thursday, posting a video showing the woman's badly damaged apartment.

Ukraine's deputy prime minister Oleksiy Kuleba said rail facilities had been attacked in three regions, including a locomotive depot and a station in the frontline region of Sumy.

The Russian defence ministry said on Thursday its strikes had hit military targets, as well as energy infrastructure which it claimed was being used to support Ukraine's military.

In a separate report, Russia-appointed Saldo said later that a five-year-old child had been killed and three more people injured in a Ukrainian drone strike on a car near Tarasivka, another coastal village, close to Khorly. He did not provide evidence.

Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of Russia's Security Council, told TASS that those who carried out the hotel attack and their commanders should be targeted.

Kherson is one of four regions in Ukraine which Russia claimed as its own in 2022, a move Kyiv and most Western countries denounced as an illegal land grab.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 16:54:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KB7CCJ7TQNKCFMZP6IJACG34MY.jpg?auth=ffb662a0eac1fcc488b8527ee8a3c5dc052828a6355fa7b93e528d7d375bedb0&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US health insurance costs to rise by 114% for millions as subsidies expire</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260101-health-insurance-costs-rise-114-percent-millions-americans-obamacare-subsidies-expire</link><description>Enhanced tax credits that have helped reduce the cost of health insurance for the vast majority of Affordable Care Act (ACA, also known as "Obamacare") enrollees expired overnight, cementing higher health costs for millions of people in the United States at the start of the new year.

The change affects a diverse cross-section of the population who don’t get their health insurance from an employer and don’t qualify for Medicaid or Medicare – a group that includes many self-employed workers, small business owners, farmers and ranchers.

On average, the more than 20 million subsidised enrollees in the Affordable Care Act programme are seeing their premium costs rise by 114 percent in 2026, according to an analysis by the healthcare research nonprofit KFF.

The subsidies were first given to Affordable Care Act enrollees in 2021 as a temporary measure to help US residents get through the Covid-19 pandemic. Democrats in power at the time then extended them, pushing the expiration date to the start of 2026. Some lower-income enrollees received health care with no premiums, and high earners paid no more than 8.5 percent of their income. Eligibility for middle-class earners was also expanded.

Democrats forced a 43-day government shutdown over the issue, demanding the health subsidies be extended before they agreed to a new Republican budget. Some Republicans also called for a bipartisan solution to save their 2026 political aspirations, given the ACA's popularity – two-thirds of Americans favour the system , according to KFF.

But while congressional Republicans acknowledged the issue needed to be addressed, they refused to put it to a vote until late in the year. A House vote expected in January could offer another chance, but success is far from guaranteed.

Health analysts have predicted the expiration of the subsidies will drive many of the 24 million total Affordable Care Act enrollees – especially younger and healthier Americans – to forgo health insurance coverage altogether.

Over time, that could make the programme more expensive for the older, sicker population that remains.

The surging healthcare prices come alongside an overall increase in health costs in the US, which are further driving up out-of-pocket costs in many plans.

It also comes at the start of a high-stakes midterm election year, with affordability – including the cost of health care – topping the list of voters’ concerns.

“It really bothers me that the middle class has moved from a squeeze to a full suffocation, and they continue to just pile on and leave it up to us,” said 37-year-old single mom Katelin Provost, whose healthcare costs are set to jump. “I’m incredibly disappointed that there hasn’t been more action.”

Some enrollees, like Salt Lake City freelance filmmaker and adjunct professor Stan Clawson, have absorbed the extra expense. Clawson said he was paying just under $350 a month for his premiums last year, a number that will jump to nearly $500 a month this year. It’s a strain for the 49-year-old, but one he’s willing to take on because he needs health insurance as someone who lives with paralysis from a spinal cord injury.

Others, like Provost, are dealing with steeper hikes. The social worker’s monthly premium payment is increasing from $85 a month to nearly $750.

An analysis conducted last September by the Urban Institute and Commonwealth Fund projected the higher premiums from expiring subsidies would prompt some 4.8 million Americans to drop coverage in 2026.

But with the window to select and change plans still ongoing until January 15 in most states, the final effect on enrollment is yet to be determined.

Provost said she is holding out hope that Congress finds a way to revive the subsidies early in the year – but if not, she’ll drop herself off the insurance and keep it only for her 4-year-old daughter.

She can’t afford to pay for coverage for both of them without the subsidies.

After Republicans cut more than $1 trillion in federal healthcare and food assistance by passing Trump’s big tax and spending cuts bill, Democrats repeatedly called for the ACA subsidies to be extended.

In December, the GOP-controlled Senate rejected two partisan healthcare bills – a Democratic pitch to extend the subsidies for three more years and a Republican alternative that would instead provide Americans with health "savings accounts".

In the House, four Republicans broke with GOP leadership and joined forces with Democrats to force a vote that could come as soon as January on a three-year extension of the tax credits. But with the Senate already having rejected such a plan, it’s unclear whether it could get enough momentum to pass.

Meanwhile, Americans whose premiums are skyrocketing say lawmakers don’t understand what it’s really like to struggle to get by as health costs ratchet up with no relief.

Many say they want the subsidies restored alongside broader reforms to make health care more affordable for all Americans.

“Both Republicans and Democrats have been saying for years, oh, we need to fix it. Then do it,” said Chad Bruns, a 58-year-old Affordable Care Act enrollee in Wisconsin. “They need to get to the root cause, and no political party ever does that.”</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 17:23:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/ef55d7dc-e727-11f0-a763-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25350476183812.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Seven bodies recovered, 96 rescued after migrant boat capsizes, Gambia says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/seven-bodies-recovered-96-rescued-after-migrant-boat-capsizes-gambia-says-2026-01-01/</link><description>BANJUL, Jan 1 (Reuters) - Seven bodies were recovered and 96 people were rescued after a boat transporting migrants capsized overnight, Gambia's defence ministry said on Thursday.

The vessel was "allegedly carrying over 200 migrants", the ministry said in a statement, adding that 10 of the rescued migrants were in critical condition and receiving urgent medical attention.

The Atlantic migration route from the coast of West Africa to the Canary Islands, typically used by African migrants trying to reach Spain, is one of the world's deadliest.

More than 46,000 irregular migrants reached the Canary Islands in 2024, a record, according to the European Union. More than 10,000 died attempting the journey, a 58% increase over 2023, according to the rights group Caminando Fronteras.

American forces have been pursuing the tanker, which maritime groups have identified as the Bella 1, for almost two weeks .

The U.S. on Wednesday imposed sanctions on four companies it said were operating in Venezuela’s oil sector as well as associated oil tankers, as President Donald Trump's administration increases pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.

Russia made the formal diplomatic request as Trump also seeks to broker a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine.

Most injuries, many of them serious, occurred when the blaze swept through the crowded bar less than two hours after midnight Thursday in southwestern Switzerland .

The Crans-Montana resort is best known as an international ski and golf venue. Overnight, its crowded Le Constellation bar morphed from a scene of revelry into the site of potentially one of Switzerland’s worst tragedies.

Crans-Montana is less than 5 kilometres from Sierre, Switzerland, where 28 people, including many children, were killed when a bus from Belgium crashed inside a Swiss tunnel in 2012.

Here’s what we know about the deadly fire :

The blaze broke out around 1:30am Thursday inside the Le Constellation bar amid the holiday celebration.

Two women told French broadcaster BFMTV they were inside when they saw a male bartender lifting a female bartender on his shoulders as she held a lit candle in a bottle. The flames spread, collapsing the wooden ceiling, they told the broadcaster.

People frantically tried to escape from the basement nightclub up a narrow flight of stairs and through a narrow door, causing a crowd surge, one of the women said.

A young man at the scene said people smashed windows to escape the fire, some gravely injured, reported BFMTV. He said he saw about 20 people scrambling to get out of the smoke and flames, likening what happened to a horror movie.

The injured were so numerous that the intensive care unit and operating theatre at the regional hospital quickly hit full capacity, said Mathias Reynard, head of the regional government of the Valais Canton.

While officials said Thursday it was too early to determine the fire's cause, investigators have already ruled out that it could have been an attack.

Experts have not yet been able to go inside the wreckage, said Beatrice Pilloud, Valais Canton attorney general, at a news conference.

Work is underway to identify the victims and inform their families, according to Valais Canton police commander Frédéric Gisler.

The Swiss officials called the blaze an “embrasement généralisé”, a French firefighting term describing how a blaze can trigger the release of combustible gases that can then ignite violently and cause what English-speaking firefighters would call a flashover or a backdraft.

Victims suffered from serious burns and smoke inhalation. Some were flown to specialist hospitals across the country.

Authorities urged people to show caution in the coming days to avoid any accidents that could require the already overwhelmed medical resources.

With high-altitude ski runs rising around 3,000 metres in the heart of the Valais region’s snowy peaks and pine forests , Crans-Montana is one of the top venues on the World Cup circuit.

The resort will host the best men’s and women’s downhill racers, including Lindsey Vonn, for their final events before the Milan Cortina Olympics in February.

The town’s Crans-sur-Sierre golf club, down the street from the bar, stages the European Masters each August on a picturesque course.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 20:25:31 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/e61933b6-e74b-11f0-a45a-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-01T192903Z-60329277-RC2ISIAC1PJ4-RTRMADP-3-SWITZERLAND-BLAST.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuela frees 88 more prisoners detained after post-election protests</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/venezuela-frees-88-more-prisoners-detained-after-post-election-protests-2026-01-01/</link><description>Jan 1 (Reuters) - Venezuela's government has freed 88 more people detained after protests that followed the South American nation's July 2024 election, marking the second mass release in as many weeks amid U.S. pressure on the government of President Nicolas Maduro.

The New Year's Day release follows the government's announcement that it released 99 people on December 26, which would bring a total of 187 people released in two weeks.

"These actions are part of the comprehensive review process of cases ordered by President Nicolas Maduro," the government said in a statement.

The Committee for the Freedom of Political Prisoners, a local non-governmental organization, said it had verified at least 55 prisoners had been released, with all but one freed from the Tocoron prison in central Venezuela.

Following the December 26 announcement, several NGOs questioned whether the government released as many as it said it had. Venezuelan NGOs have estimated around 900 political prisoners are still detained in Venezuela, including people arrested before the election.

Venezuela's government has said it does not hold political prisoners but rather imprisoned politicians, and those arrested were seeking to destabilize the country.

The releases come amid pressure from the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, who has said it would be smart for Maduro to leave power.

So severe were the burns suffered by the mostly young crowd of revellers in the Le Constellation bar that Swiss officials said it could take days before they name all the victims of the fire that also injured 115, many of them seriously.

Parents of missing youths anxiously issued pleas for news of their loved ones as foreign embassies scrambled to work out if their nationals were among those caught up in one of the worst tragedies to befall modern Switzerland.

"The first objective is to assign names to all the bodies," Crans-Montana's mayor Nicolas Feraud told a press conference on Thursday evening. This, he said, could take days.

Mathias Reynard, head of government of the canton of Valais, said experts were using dental and DNA samples for the task.

"All this work needs to be done because the information is so terrible and sensitive that nothing can be told to the families unless we are 100 percent sure," he said.

What caused the blaze was unclear. Swiss authorities said it appeared to be an accident rather than an attack.

Some accounts from survivors and footage broadcast on social media suggested that the ceiling of the bar's basement may have caught fire when sparkling candles got too close.

Residents of Crans-Montana, which has the distinction of being not only a popular draw for skiers, but also golfers, were stunned by the inferno. Many knew victims and some said they were lucky not to have been there themselves.

Hundreds of people stood in silence near the scene as they came to pay their respects to the victims on Thursday night.

"You think you're safe here but this can happen anywhere. They were people like us," said Piermarco Pani, an 18-year-old who, like many others in the town, knew the bar well.

Dozens of people left flowers or lit candles on a makeshift altar at the top of the road leading to the bar which police had cordoned off. Some cried, others quietly hugged one another.

Behind the cordon, the bodies of some victims still lay in the bar, police said, as they pledged to work around the clock to identify everyone who succumbed to the blaze.

Kean Sarbach, 17, said he had spoken to four people who escaped from the bar, some with burns, and that they had told him the flames had spread very quickly.

Elisa Sousa, 17, said she was meant to be there but ended up spending the evening at a family gathering instead.

"And honestly, I'll need thank my mother a hundred times for not letting me go," she said at the vigil for the victims. "Because God knows where I'd be now."</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 23:20:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/XOGTBIGH4JKWJBTGHYJZKLGVVA.jpg?auth=d8e593a78067e1db45a850481ead6a3f7d033d40959d3eb1cc9a3c772b3af42d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>North Korea leader Kim Jong Un's daughter makes public visit to state mausoleum</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/north-korea-leader-kim-jong-uns-daughter-makes-public-visit-state-mausoleum-2026-01-01/</link><description>SEOUL, Jan 2 (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's daughter, Ju Ae, who is likely being prepared as his successor, accompanied her parents on her first public visit to the Kumsusan mausoleum to pay respects to former leaders, state media photos published on Friday showed.

Ju Ae has been making increasingly prominent appearances in state media over the past three years, fuelling speculation by analysts and South Korea's intelligence agency that she may be in line to be the country's fourth-generation leader.

Kim was also accompanied by his wife, Lee Sol Ju, and senior officials on the visit on January 1, with Ju Ae between her parents in the main hall of the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun, state news agency KCNA photographs showed.

Kim Ju Ae , who is believed to have been born in the early 2010s, attended this year's New Year celebrations , according to state media on Thursday. In September, she travelled to Beijing with her father on her first public overseas outing.

Kim visits Kumsusan to honour his grandfather and state founder, Kim Il Sung, and father Kim Jong Il on key dates and anniversaries in a gesture affirming the dynastic heritage of the nuclear-armed country.

North Korea has never confirmed Ju Ae's age.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 23:21:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ISG4OSFDJRNEJFVJEOI74BFF4E.jpg?auth=9e0424b1a7c68e069d0e76543da542c9efdb566c44cdb73bb4587292c6711047&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Mamdani vows bold left-wing agenda as he takes office as New York mayor</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260101-mamdani-vows-bold-left-wing-agenda-new-york-mayor</link><description>Zohran Mamdani promised Thursday to show left-wing politics can succeed as he took over as New York mayor for a term sure to see him cross swords with US President Donald Trump.

Thousands of people gathered in freezing conditions in the United States ’ largest city to celebrate the 34-year-old Democrat ’s inauguration after his rapid rise from relative anonymity just a year ago.

“They want to know if the left can govern. They want to know if the struggles that afflict them can be solved,” Mamdani said outside City Hall.

“We will do something that New Yorkers do better than anyone else: we will set an example for the world.”

In the 24-minute speech, he added: “Beginning today, we will govern expansively and audaciously.”

Mamdani, New York’s first Muslim mayor, emphasised cost-of-living issues that were central to his campaign, pledging to help those “betrayed by the established order”.

Left-wing allies Senator Bernie Sanders and congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez also spoke before some 4,000 ticketed guests.

“Thank you for giving us, from coast to coast, the hope and the vision that we can create government that works for all, not just the wealthy and the few,” said Sanders, a former presidential hopeful.

At one point, the crowd broke into chants of “tax the rich”. Mamdani wants to raise taxes on New York’s wealthiest residents.

Thousands more thronged downtown Manhattan, many wearing yellow and blue beanies emblazoned with “Zohran”, to watch the ceremony on large screens.

“This is the first time that either of us in our entire lives has felt some kind of political hope at all,” 31-year-old scientist Jacob Byerly told AFP, standing alongside his wife Auburn.

Mamdani, a self-described democratic socialist , comes to power as Trump pushes a hard-right agenda nationally.

It remains to be seen whether he can deliver on his programme, which includes rent freezes, universal childcare and free public buses.

Trump’s approach could prove decisive. The Republican, himself a New Yorker, has repeatedly criticised Mamdani, although the two held unexpectedly cordial talks at the White House in November.

One potential flashpoint is immigration, as Trump expands raids and a broader crackdown on migrants across the United States. Mamdani has vowed to protect immigrant communities.

Before the November vote, Trump threatened to slash federal funding for New York if Mamdani won, branding him a “communist lunatic”. The mayor has said he believes Trump is a fascist.

Mamdani mentioned Trump only once in his speech, reflecting on the city’s diversity and noting that some Trump supporters had also backed him in the mayoral race.

The inauguration was rich in symbolism.

New York Attorney General Letitia James, who successfully prosecuted Trump for fraud , carried out a private midnight swearing-in at a disused subway station.

Mamdani’s office said the understated venue beneath City Hall reflected his commitment to working people.

In a first for the city, he was sworn in using Qurans.

Born in Uganda to a family of Indian origin, Mamdani moved to New York at the age of seven and enjoyed an elite upbringing, with only a relatively brief stint in politics.

To compensate for his inexperience, he is surrounding himself with seasoned aides drawn from previous mayoral administrations and former US president Joe Biden ’s government.

Mamdani has also opened dialogue with business leaders, some of whom had warned of a mass exodus of wealthy New Yorkers if he won. Real estate leaders have since played down those claims.

A vocal defender of Palestinian rights, he faces the task of reassuring New York’s Jewish community — the largest in the US — of his inclusive leadership.

A small group of protesters holding Israeli flags appeared during the ceremony, blowing air horns as Mamdani delivered his speech.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 23:22:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/5d11a098-e760-11f0-b1b7-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26001741473836.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Bolsonaro leaves hospital and returns to prison after being denied house arrest</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260101-bolsonaro-leaves-hospital-returns-to-prison</link><description>Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro left a hospital in capital Brasilia on Thursday, a week after he underwent a double hernia surgery. A car took the embattled ex-leader back to the federal police headquarters where he is serving his 27-year prison sentence for leading a coup d’état aimed at keeping him in office.

Hospital DF Star confirmed Bolsonaro was released after some other minor medical procedures after the double hernia surgery that was completed without complications.

Brazil ’s Supreme Court approved the release of the former president, who governed from 2019 to 2022, for the surgery.

Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who sentenced Bolsonaro to prison, denied the former president’s request for house arrest after he leaves the hospital.

Bolsonaro has undergone several other medical procedures since he was stabbed in the abdomen during a campaign rally in 2018.

Bolsonaro has no contact with the few other inmates at the federal police headquarters in Brasilia, where he is held and where his 12-square-metre (around 130-square-foot) room has a bed, a private bathroom, air conditioning, a television and a desk.

In December, Bolsonaro shook Brazilian politics again by appointing his eldest son, Sen. Flávio Bolsonaro, to become his political party’s presidential candidate in next year’s election, challenging incumbent Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva .

Neither Flávio Bolsonaro nor former first lady Michelle Bolsonaro made comments about the former leader returning to prison after his hospitalisation.

Michelle Bolsonaro said in her social media channels that “there is a Brazil of good people which loves you and prays for you”.

“We will beat the bad days,” she wrote.

Bolsonaro and several of his allies were convicted in September by a panel of Supreme Court justices of attempting to overthrow Brazil’s democratic system following his 2022 election defeat.

The plot included plans to kill Lula , Vice President Geraldo Alckmin and de Moraes. There was also a plan to encourage an insurrection in early 2023.

Bolsonaro was also convicted on charges that include leading an armed criminal organisation and attempting the violent abolition of the democratic rule of law. He has denied any wrongdoing.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 23:43:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/d80e0e1c-e030-11f0-816a-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/2025-12-23T152216Z-613812178-RC2V1HAEN3OD-RTRMADP-3-BRAZIL-BOLSONARO.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China's Xi to host South Korea's Lee in New Year amid Japan tensions</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-xi-host-south-koreas-lee-new-year-amid-japan-tensions-2026-01-02/</link><description>SEOUL/BEIJING, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Chinese President Xi Jinping will host South Korean President Lee Jae Myung on a state visit starting on Sunday, signalling Beijing's intent to strengthen ties with Seoul amidst strained relations with Japan over Taiwan.

The visit marks the second meeting between Xi and Lee in just two months, an unusually short interval that signals China's keen interest in reinforcing ties with Seoul and boosting economic collaboration and tourism, analysts say.

Relations between China and Japan are at their chilliest point in years after Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi suggested in November a hypothetical Chinese attack on Taiwan could trigger a military response from Tokyo.

Xi's invitation to Lee for a state visit from Sunday is a calculated move aimed at deepening bilateral relations especially before the South Korean leader visits Japan, analysts say.

"China wants to emphasize South Korea's importance slightly more than before," said Kang Jun-young, professor of political economics at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies.

"China appears to have strategically decided that it would be better to have (Lee) visit China before South Korea holds a summit with Japan again," he added.

The Lee administration has said it aims to "restore" ties with Beijing, acknowledging China is South Korea's largest trading partner.

The pivot follows the two countries' strained relations under Lee's predecessor Yoon Suk Yeol, due to his closer alignment with Washington and Tokyo, as well as criticism of China's handling of Taiwan.

Now, South Korea is trying to maintain balance but leaning towards cooperation with China to avoid being forced into any troubles that would threaten the Asian industrial powerhouse.

Lee said in December he wouldn't take sides in the diplomatic dispute between China and Japan.

Still, China and South Korea face complex issues as China challenges the U.S., South Korea's major ally in the region, and as nuclear-armed North Korea remains unpredictable.

China is North Korea's major ally and economic lifeline.

Shin Beom-chul, a former South Korean vice defence minister and a senior research fellow at the Sejong Institute, said Xi and Lee might discuss some contentious issues such as efforts to modernise the South Korea- U.S. alliance that apparently aim to curb China's dominance.

Currently, about 28,500 U.S. troops are based in South Korea to counter any threat from North Korea.

U.S. officials have signalled a plan to make those U.S. forces more flexible to respond to other threats, such as defending Taiwan and checking China's growing military reach.

"Korea is not simply responding to threats on the peninsula," General Xavier Brunson, commander of U.S. Forces Korea, said at a forum on Dec. 29. "Korea sits at the crossroads of broader regional dynamics that shape the balance of power across Northeast Asia." he said.

Lee's agenda with Xi includes persuading China to facilitate dialogue with North Korea, experts said.

North Korea has dismissed Lee's outreach, labelling him a "hypocrite" and "confrontational maniac".

Meanwhile, China and North Korea have been seeking closer coordination as North Korean leader Kim Jong Un stood shoulder to shoulder with Xi in September at a big military parade .

Lee's visit to Beijing is expected to address cooperation in areas including critical minerals , supply chain and green industries, his office said earlier.

Seoul sources nearly half of its supply of rare earth minerals, critical to semiconductor manufacturing, come from China. Beijing also accounts for a third of Seoul's annual chip exports, the largest market by far.

Last month, South Korean Industry Minister Kim Jung-kwan and Chinese Commerce Minister Wang Wentao agreed to work towards stable rare earth supplies, the South Korean industry ministry said.

The visit may also foster partnerships on artificial intelligence and advanced technologies, experts said.

China's Huawei Technologies plans to roll out the Ascend 950 AI chips in South Korea next year, aiming to provide an alternative to Nvidia for Korean firms, Huawei's South Korea CEO Balian Wang told a press conference last month.

Wang mentioned ongoing discussions with potential customers, without naming those clients.

Huawei did not address questions from Reuters about Wang's comments.

Another issue at stake is Beijing's effective ban on K-pop content since around the 2017 deployment of a U.S.-led missile defence system in South Korea.

“Wherever they want and whenever they want,” Maduro said of the idea of dialogue with the United States on drug trafficking, oil and migration in an interview on state TV.

To date, Maduro has not confirmed a US land attack on a docking facility in his country that allegedly targeted drug boats , according to comments made on Monday by US President Donald Trump.

Asked point-blank whether he confirmed or denied the attack, Maduro said: “This could be something we talk about in a few days.”

The attack would amount to the first known land strike of the US military campaign against drug trafficking from Latin America.

Trump said on Monday that the United States had hit and destroyed a docking area used by alleged Venezuelan drug boats.

He declined to say whether it was a military or CIA operation or where the strike occurred, noting only that it was “along the shore”.

“There was a major explosion in the dock area where they load the boats up with drugs,” Trump told reporters at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.

“So we hit all the boats and now we hit the area — it’s the implementation area, that’s where they implement. And that is no longer around.”

For weeks, Trump has threatened ground strikes on drug cartels in the region, saying they would start “soon”, but this is the first apparent example.

US forces have also carried out numerous strikes on boats in both the Caribbean Sea and the eastern Pacific Ocean since September, targeting what Washington says are drug smugglers.

The administration has provided no evidence that the targeted boats were involved in drug trafficking, however, prompting debate about the legality of these operations.

International law experts and rights groups say the strikes likely amount to extrajudicial killings, a charge that Washington denies.</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 03:41:32 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/686d089c-da4f-11f0-816f-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25344772186399.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Saudi envoy says leader of Yemen separatist group STC blocked delegation's Aden landing</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/saudi-envoy-says-leader-yemen-separatist-group-stc-blocked-delegations-aden-2026-01-02/</link><description>DUBAI, Jan 2 (Reuters) - The Saudi-backed governor of Yemen's Hadramout province said on Friday he would launch a peaceful operation to take back military positions from the UAE-backed Southern Transitional Council, but that the actions were not a declaration of war.

The move marks the latest escalation in war-torn Yemen where a rift between Gulf powers Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, who back opposing sides, has been playing out since December.

Yemen’s Saudi-backed government said on Friday it had appointed Hadramout Governor Salem Ahmed Saeed al-Khunbashi to take overall command of the "Homeland Shield" forces in the eastern province, granting him full military, security and administrative authority in what it said was a move to restore security and order.

The operation targets military sites only and is "not a declaration of war," it said.

The UAE backs the STC , which seized large swathes of southern Yemen last month from the internationally recognised government, backed by Saudi Arabia, which in turn saw the move as a threat.

The UAE last week said it was pulling its remaining forces out of Yemen after Saudi Arabia backed a call for its forces to leave within 24 hours in one of the severest disagreements between the two Gulf oil powers to ever play out in public.

The STC did not immediately respond to the Hadramout governor's declaration.

Saudi Arabia's ambassador to Yemen also on Friday blamed STC leader Aidarus Al-Zubaidi for refusing to grant landing permission the previous day for a plane carrying a Saudi delegation to Aden.

A halt in flights at Aden international airport on Thursday continued into Friday as both sides traded blame as to who was responsible for the air traffic shutdown.

"For several weeks and until yesterday, the Kingdom sought to make all efforts with the Southern Transitional Council to end the escalation ... but it faced continuous rejection and stubbornness from Aidarus Al-Zubaidi," the Saudi ambassador, Mohammed Al-Jaber, said on X.

Zubaidi issued directives to close air traffic at Aden's airport on Thursday, the ambassador added, saying that a plane carrying a Saudi delegation to Aden aiming to find solutions to the crisis was denied permission to land.

In a statement on Thursday, the STC-controlled Transport Ministry in turn accused Saudi Arabia of imposing an air blockade, saying Riyadh required all flights to go via Saudi Arabia for extra checks.

Aden's international airport is the main gateway for regions of the country outside Houthi control.</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 08:31:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ORRDY2S2D5NGBO64V6WA6FF3XI.jpg?auth=b597960c9819e60afc93944153d2e5917d593e629d179610641e8cec79742245&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump says US will intervene if Iran violently suppresses peaceful protests</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/trump-says-us-will-intervene-if-iran-violently-suppresses-peaceful-protests-2026-01-02/</link><description>Jan 2 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday said that if Iran shoots and violently kills peaceful protesters, the United States of America will come to their rescue.

Hong Kong has stepped up a crackdown on corruption linked to building renovation following a fire in late November that ripped through seven high-rise towers and killed more than 160 people.

John Lee, the city's leader, last month set up an independent committee to investigate the fire and the construction industry, and determine whether there was any bid-rigging in the award of contracts.

The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) said in a statement it conducted enforcement operations last week against a triad-linked corruption syndicate associated with building renovation.

The 21 arrested included middlemen, project consultants, project contractors and members of the owners' corporation of the two housing estates, the agency added.

In one of the estates, the contractor involved was suspected of bribing the project consultant and some members of the owners' corporation to obtain a project contract worth HK$33 million ($4.24 million).

In the other estate, the middlemen allegedly collected instruments of proxy, or authorisation tickets from homeowners "by corrupt means" in an attempt to manipulate votes and win future renovation contracts. It did not elaborate.

"Building maintenance is closely related to the public and involves multiple stakeholders. The ICAC has always attached great importance to corruption in building maintenance," the statement said.

The two estates targeted in last week's operation were in the Kwun Tong district in eastern Kowloon and not related to Wang Fuk Court, the site of the fire that broke out on November 26.

The ICAC has arrested at least 11 people in a corruption probe into renovation work at Wang Fuk Court.

Residents reacted with anger to the inferno, which took nearly two days to extinguish. Authorities have said substandard building materials used in renovating the high-rise blocks fuelled the fire.

Maduro said Venezuela was a "brother country" to the United States and a friendly government. He noted that when he and Trump last spoke in November, the U.S. president had acknowledged his authority by addressing him as "Mr. President."

The longtime Venezuelan strongman spoke in an interview that was filmed on New Year's Eve and aired on Venezuelan state TV on the evening of New Year's Day.

In the broadcast, Maduro and his interviewer walk through a militarized zone of the capital Caracas. Later, Maduro takes the wheel of a car with the journalist in the passenger seat and the president's wife, Cilia Flores, in the back - a gesture commentators interpreted as an attempt to project confidence amid fears of a U.S. strike, despite Maduro's scaling back of public appearances in recent weeks.

The comments represent a shift in Maduro's tone towards the United States since the latter launched a large-scale military buildup in the southern Caribbean. Trump has accused the "illegitimate" Maduro of running a narco-state and threatened to remove him from power.

Maduro has vehemently denied links to crime and says that the U.S. is seeking to oust him to take control of Venezuela's vast oil reserves and rare earth mineral deposits.

At an event shortly before Christmas, Maduro urged Trump to focus on domestic challenges, saying: "Honestly, if I speak with him again, I will tell him that each one should attend to their internal affairs."

In the latest remarks, Maduro told his interviewer: "To the people of the United States I say what I have always said, Venezuela is a brother country... a friendly government.

"We must start to speak seriously, with the facts in hand. The U.S. government knows that, because we have said it a lot to their interlocutors, that if they want to speak seriously about the agreement to battle drug trafficking, we are ready to do that. If they want Venezuela's oil, Venezuela is ready to accept U.S. investments like those of Chevron, when, where and how they want to make them."</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 10:22:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/QDZCB5TGQVPIVENT2TTU2W52RU.jpg?auth=8fcc2e18da5ddaf48ee8a7e6b1f6f80e2206925b628ee4004a01d679bf7efac1&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Molotov cocktail, dead chickens sent to Indonesian government critics, rights groups say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/molotov-cocktail-dead-chickens-sent-indonesian-government-critics-rights-groups-2026-01-02/</link><description>JAKARTA, Jan 2 (Reuters) - A Molotov cocktail was thrown at the home of an Indonesian government critic, while others have received intimidating messages, rights campaigners said on Friday, warning of growing threats to freedom of speech in the Southeast Asian country.

The campaigners had recently been critical of the government response to severe flooding in northern Sumatra province in November that killed more than 1,000 people.

The acts of intimidation "constitute an attack on democratic values ​​and the freedom of expression guaranteed by the constitution", according to a joint statement issued on Wednesday by 91 human rights groups, including the Southeast Asia Freedom of Expression Network and the Human Rights Working Group.

Neither the Jakarta police nor the Indonesian presidential office responded immediately to requests for comment. Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto has repeatedly said that criticism is allowed but it must be constructive.

Ramond Donny Adam, a social media personality and member of the opposition Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle, told Reuters on Friday a Molotov cocktail was sent to his home early on December 31.

Adam, better known as DJ Donny, said the bomb failed to explode, but the attack came two days after he was sent a dead chicken in a plastic box and a printout of his face with a red mark across his neck, along with another note saying, "You will end up like this chicken...Do not mess around".

"I have reported these two incidents to the police and the government must reveal who's behind this," said Donny, who has a million followers on Instagram and often posts messages criticising the government.

It was unclear who was behind the incident.

Greenpeace Indonesia country director Leonard Simanjuntak said a dead chicken was found in front of the house of a Greenpeace campaigner on December 30, with a message tied to its leg saying, "Watch your words if you want to protect your family, your mouth is your sword."

Simanjuntak suspected the intimidation was linked to Greenpeace's criticism of government policies surrounding the Sumatra floods and landslides.

Greenpeace criticised the government's forestry management , including the issuance of mining and palm oil plantation permits that some critics said had caused widespread deforestation and worsened the floods.

On her Instagram account, influencer Sherly Annavita said her car was spray painted and rotten eggs were thrown into her home. Annavita, who has more than two million followers, had recently written posts criticising Jakarta's slow response to the Sumatra floods.

"The Italian Golf Federation mourns the passing of Emanuele Galeppini, a young athlete who carried with him passion and genuine values," the federation said in a statement.

Swiss authorities have said around 40 people died in the fire and more than 110 were injured. Authorities have warned that naming the victims or establishing a definitive death toll would take time because many of the bodies were badly burned.

Italy's ambassador to Switzerland said earlier that six Italians were missing and 13 were in hospital receiving treatment for their injuries.

Galeppini had been in Crans-Montana with his family. Italian media reported that he had gone to the Constellation bar with two friends, who managed to escape the fire and were taken to nearby hospitals.</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 10:23:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump threatens Iran over protest deaths as unrest flares</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/trump-threatens-iran-over-protest-deaths-unrest-flares-2026-01-02/</link><description>DUBAI, Jan 2 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump threatened on Friday to come to the aid of protesters in Iran if security forces fire on them, days into unrest that has left several dead and posed the biggest internal threat to Iranian authorities in years.

"We are locked and loaded and ready to go," he said in a social media post. The United States struck Iranian nuclear facilities in June, joining an Israeli air campaign that targeted Tehran's atomic programme and military leadership.

Top Iranian official Ali Larijani responded to Trump's comments warning that U.S. interference in domestic Iranian issues would equal the destabilisation of the whole region. Iran backs groups in Lebanon, Iraq and Yemen.

The comments came as a local official in western Iran where several deaths were reported was cited by state media as warning that any unrest or illegal gatherings would be met "decisively and without leniency", raising the likelihood of escalation.

This week's protests over soaring inflation have spread across Iran, with deadly confrontations between demonstrators and security forces focused in the western provinces of Lorestan and Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari.

State-affiliated media and rights groups have reported at least six deaths since Wednesday, including one man who authorities said was a member of the Basij paramilitary affiliated with the Revolutionary Guards.

Iran has seen off repeated bouts of major unrest in recent decades, often quelling protests with heavy security measures and mass arrests. But economic problems may leave authorities more vulnerable now .

This week's protests are the biggest in three years, since nationwide demonstrations triggered by the death of a young woman in custody in late 2022 paralysed Iran for weeks, with rights groups reporting hundreds killed.

During the latest unrest, the elected President Masoud Pezeshkian has struck a conciliatory tone, pledging dialogue with protest leaders over the cost-of-living crisis, even as rights groups said security forces had fired on demonstrators.

Speaking on Thursday, before Trump threatened U.S. action, Pezeshkian acknowledged that failings by the authorities were behind the crisis.

"We are to blame... Do not look for America or anyone else to blame. We must serve properly so that people are satisfied with us.... It is us who have to find a solution to these problems," he said.

Pezeshkian's government is attempting a programme of economic liberalisation, but one of its measures, deregulating some currency exchange, has contributed to a sharp decline in the value of Iran's rial on the unofficial market.

The sliding currency has compounded inflation, which has hovered above 36% since March even by official estimates, in an economy battered by Western sanctions over Iran's nuclear programme.

The Israeli and U.S. strikes last year have added to the pressure on the authorities, as have the ousting of Syria's Bashar al-Assad, a close Tehran ally, and the Israeli pounding of its main regional partner, Lebanon's Hezbollah.

Iran continues to back groups in Iraq that have previously fired rockets at U.S. forces in the country, as well as the Houthi group that controls much of northern Yemen.

"American people should know that Trump started the adventurism. They ought to watch over their soldiers," said Larijani, the head of Iran's National Security Council and a top adviser to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

The Hengaw human rights group reported on Thursday that 29 protesters had been detained during the latest wave of demonstrations, including 14 ethnic Kurds, seven Lors, seven women, and two children.

In Lorestan Province, home to much of Iran's Lor ethnic population and site of some intense protests, a senior judicial official told state media: "There will be no tolerance for illegal actions that threaten public order and safety."

The media said law enforcement forces had identified and arrested several "disruptive individuals" in the Lorestan counties of Azna and Delfan.

Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari has also witnessed protests.

The semi-official Fars News Agency reported on Thursday that three protesters were killed and 17 were injured during an attack on a police station in western Lorestan.

Fars and Hengaw also reported fatalities in Lordegan in Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari province. Authorities confirmed one death in Kuhdasht, Lorestan, while Hengaw reported another in the central province of Isfahan.</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 10:46:27 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/A62ZBIR76JMURC3GGE3GRGYDKQ.jpg?auth=185ce78083c9507112249ee78b67c34db48e275c9038278c20caa9cd06406a3d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Pakistan court sentences journalists to life over links to protests after Imran Khan’s arrest</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/pakistan-court-sentences-journalists-life-over-links-protests-after-imran-khans-2026-01-02/</link><description>KARACHI, Jan 2 (Reuters) - A Pakistani anti-terrorism court sentenced eight journalists and social media commentators on Friday to life imprisonment in absentia after convicting them of terrorism-related offences linked to online activity in support of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan.

The convictions stem from cases registered after violent protests on May 9, 2023, when Khan’s supporters attacked military installations following his brief arrest. Since then, the government and military have launched a sweeping crackdown on Khan’s party and dissenting voices, using anti-terrorism laws and military trials to prosecute hundreds accused of incitement and attacks on state institutions.

In its ruling, the court said actions by the accused “fell within the ambit of terrorism” under Pakistani law and that their online material promoted “fear and unrest” in society.

Most of those convicted are believed to be outside Pakistan and did not appear during the proceedings, court documents showed.

The convicted include former army officers-turned YouTubers Adil Raja and Syed Akbar Hussain, journalists Wajahat Saeed Khan, Sabir Shakir and Shaheen Sehbai, commentator Haider Raza Mehdi, and analyst Moeed Pirzada, according to the court’s decision.

Reuters was unable to reach the journalists or their lawyers for comment.

The Committee to Protect Journalists said in 2023 the investigations amounted to retaliation against critical reporting. “Authorities must immediately drop these investigations and cease the relentless intimidation and censorship of the media,” CPJ Asia programme coordinator Beh Lih Yi said.

The court handed down life sentences along with additional prison terms and fines, ordering further jail time if the fines are not paid. All sentences are subject to confirmation by the Islamabad High Court.</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 10:46:39 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HLH2SWXUBVO6BOMQ5ANGG2LS3I.jpg?auth=54ce04cd92d16afbcd81e8a03b75e2e339228e3233080a5b111004f07f3ef6b1&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Turkey's Erdogan says he will discuss Ukraine, Gaza with Trump on Monday</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/turkeys-erdogan-says-he-will-discuss-ukraine-gaza-with-trump-monday-2026-01-02/</link><description>ANKARA, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said he would have a phone call with U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday to discuss peace efforts between Ukraine and Russia as well as issues surrounding Gaza.

Below are details of the key factions in the conflict in Yemen, which has caused one of the world's worst humanitarian crises:

The Yemeni conflict was triggered when the Houthi movement, formally named Ansar Allah, ousted the Saudi-backed, internationally recognised government of then-president Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi in late 2014.

The group remains the dominant military force in the country, controlling the capital Sanaa and Yemen's populous northern highlands. It is estimated to control territory where between 60% to 65% of Yemenis live.

The Saudi-led coalition accuses Iran of arming, training and funding the Houthis. The group denies being an Iranian proxy and says it develops its own weapons.

The Houthis have demonstrated their missile and drone capabilities during the Yemen war in attacks on Saudi Arabia and the UAE, targeting oil installations and vital infrastructure.

Seen as part of a regional alliance known as the "Axis of Resistance" backed by Iran, the Houthis have also rallied behind the Palestinians in the Gaza war , lobbing drones and missiles at Israel and attacking commercial shipping in the Red Sea.

The Houthis have proven resilient, defying over ten years of bombing by the Saudi-led coalition, as well as U.S. and British strikes in recent years.

Riyadh entered Yemen when it led the military coalition against the Houthis in March 2015, seeking to restore Hadi's government. Saudi Arabia sought to prevent an Iran-aligned group from consolidating power on its southern border.

Riyadh and Tehran, despite a China-brokered thawing of relations, have long been regional rivals and deeply distrust one another.

The Southern Transitional Council, which was trained and equipped by the United Arab Emirates, seeks secession for the south, which was an independent state until unification with the north in 1990. The southern leadership at the time tried to secede in 1994 but was swiftly beaten by then-President Ali Abdallah Saleh's army.

The STC, led by Aidarous al-Zubaidi, is ostensibly part of the Saudi-led coalition but declared in 2020 it would establish self-rule in the south. Tensions peaked in December 2025 when the group seized large swathes of land in Hadramout and Al Mahra provinces and swept to the borders of Saudi Arabia, challenging the regional heavyweight's influence.

The Yemeni Congregation for Reform, better known as al-Islah, is a Sunni Islamist movement with historic ties to the Muslim Brotherhood. It is a key faction within the recognised government but is viewed by the UAE and the STC as a terrorist organisation. Its major stronghold has long been Marib, the country's sole gas-producing region with one of its largest oilfields.

The UAE joined the Saudi-led coalition and was among its most effective ground forces. A withdrawal of UAE troops was announced in 2019 and completed in 2020, but it maintained influence on the ground through the STC and other factions.

Abu Dhabi is motivated by its antipathy towards the Muslim Brotherhood and securing shipping lanes in the strategic Bab al-Mandab Strait and Gulf of Aden, analysts have said.

The eight-member Presidential Leadership Council, led by Rashad al-Alimi, is the internationally recognised authority in Yemen but faces dwindling power. It was formed in Riyadh in April 2022 to replace former president Hadi and unify anti-Houthi forces, but the council has been paralysed by the divisions it was meant to solve.

Following the STC’s December offensive, the government’s effective control is likely now limited to small, isolated pockets, and is reliant on Saudi airpower.

The National Resistance Forces are a well-equipped anti-Houthi force led by Tarek Saleh, a nephew of former Yemeni president Saleh and a member of the PLC. Originally established with UAE support to battle the Houthis on Yemen's west coast, the force has maintained ties to Saudi Arabia and aims for a unified Yemen, positioning itself as a counterweight to both the Houthis and southern secessionists.</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 12:42:26 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ZQONLNHQINPE5PJVNRCI6XMAHY.jpg?auth=e55e7b7210d51a91ba30b154869eb03361dd496493c0d0b48602f948ccd86493&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Zelenskiy says he offered position of chief of staff to military intelligence chief</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/zelenskiy-says-he-offered-position-chief-staff-military-intelligence-chief-2026-01-02/</link><description>KYIV, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Friday he has offered the position of presidential chief of staff to military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov.

Condoms and contraceptive pills now incur value-added tax of 13%, the standard rate for most consumer goods.

The move comes as Beijing struggles to boost birth rates in the world's second-largest economy. China's population fell for a third consecutive year in 2024 and experts have cautioned the downturn will continue.

China exempted childcare subsidies from personal income tax and rolled out an annual childcare subsidy last year, following a series of "fertility-friendly" measures in 2024, such as urging colleges and universities to provide "love education" to portray marriage, love, fertility and family in a positive light.

Top leaders again pledged last month at the annual Central Economic Work Conference to promote "positive marriage and childbearing attitudes" to stabilise birth rates.

China's birth rates have been falling for decades as a result of the one-child policy China implemented from 1980 to 2015, and rapid urbanisation.

The high cost of childcare and education as well as job uncertainty and a slowing economy have also discouraged many young Chinese from getting married and starting a family.</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 14:21:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/X4CC3URE6VMW7JFFQH5GYIMV5E.jpg?auth=888b581dac81b0a23c0e6f959c3350795c6deca8bc4414f7143def4963147408&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Yemen is back from the brink, but frenemies Saudi Arabia and UAE have much to negotiate</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260102-yemen-back-from-brink-but-frenemies-saudi-arabia-and-uae-have-much-negotiate</link><description>The New Year kicked off with Yemen , an unstable country straddling a strategic maritime corridor between the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea , seemingly back from the brink.

After an explosive, public blowout in the last weeks of 2025 that saw Saudi Arabia bomb an alleged arms shipment from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to its proxies in Yemen, tensions have cooled. Abu Dhabi denied the arms shipment accusations, but nonetheless complied with a 24-hour deadline to withdraw its forces in southern Yemen.

Saudi Arabia and the UAE came together in a military coalition in 2015 to prevent a takeover of Yemen by Iran-backed Shiite Houthi rebels . But a decade later, the two Gulf powerhouses, who officially refer to each other as “brotherly” countries, have turned into frenemies. Ambition has driven a wedge between Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and UAE President Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan and a once-close relationship between the two royals has been ripped by a divergence of strategic vision.

The Houthis have not been vanquished, but the coalition against them is hanging by a thread. Riyadh backs the internationally recognised Yemeni government under the Presidential Leadership Council (PLC), an unwieldy umbrella body that includes the Islah party, which the UAE accuses of ties to the Muslim Brotherhood and the party denies. Abu Dhabi supports the Southern Transitional Council (STC), which is also within the PLC, but has secessionist aspirations that are at odds with its coalition partners.

The year may have begun with the UAE pulling its “counterterrorism teams” from southern Yemen, but few expect Abu Dhabi to stop wielding its influence and economic heft in a geostrategic coastal zone.

On the regional front, Emirati interests in the Red Sea area are increasing exponentially. Its co-signatory to the Abraham Accords, Israel , ended 2025 with the surprise recognition of the breakaway region of Somaliland , just across the Gulf of Aden from Yemen. Meanwhile the Houthis continue to target Red Sea shipping lanes and Israeli cities under Iran’s “axis of resistance” banner.

Finally, the latest Saudi-UAE spat in Yemen unfolded in the volatile southern region that has long been an al Qaeda stronghold and offers ideal terrain for jihadist groups.

It may not be a very happy new year for Yemenis who have borne the brunt of a devastating conflict, nor for the international community scrambling to cope with the fast-moving pieces on the Middle East chessboard. By the end of the week, Saudi air strikes had already slammed southern separatist camps, causing deaths and injuries, according to a senior STC official.

In southern Yemen, this week's de-escalation came just as swiftly as the dramatic escalation. On Thursday, the UAE-backed STC said Saudi-aligned government forces would enter territories it had seized in recent weeks.

In its statement, the STC said it would continue to operate in the regions but had agreed to the deployment of the Riyadh-backed National Shield government force. “Today, we launched an operation to integrate the southern National Shield forces so that they can assume the responsibilities and missions that fall to our armed forces,” they announced.

But in Yemen, the devil lies in the official statement details. “We are seeing mixed messaging,” said Mohammed al-Basha, founder of the Basha Report, a US-based risk advisory, in a post on X , noting that while Saudi-aligned figures claimed National Shield forces “will take over security” in Hadramawt, “STC influencers say an agreement was reached to share security responsibilities, tasks, and even garrisons and bases”.

The current crisis was sparked by the STC’s lightening sweep in early December from its heartlands around the southwestern port city of Aden towards the east, seizing parts of the resource-rich Hadramawt and Al Mahra provinces.

Yemen’s history has been marked by a north-south divide, with its southern coastal regions – centred around the ancient strategic port of Aden – culturally distinct from the northern area which includes the capital Sanaa . The STC is the latest iteration of longstanding southern secessionist movements fed by grievances against the north.

Over the past few years, “the STC ran most of the south”, said Basha. “Any diplomat, envoy, journalist going to the south did not see any symbols of the Republic of Yemen, it existed only on paper.”

The “southern question”, as it’s known in Yemen policy circles, is a legitimate issue, analysts concede. But in its current form, there are two “major points of contention”, according to Elisabeth Kendall, president of Girton College at the University of Cambridge and a seasoned Yemen expert.

“One is, does the southern cause mean a separate southern region, or does it mean a separate southern state that's independent and sovereign? And two, how big is that southern region or state? Is it just the southern heartlands, the four governorates that are in and around Aden? Or does it include the two vast eastern governorates of Hadramawt and Al Mahra? The Saudis would argue that it does not include Hadramawt and Al Mahra because they border Saudi Arabia,” she added.

The easternmost Al Mahra governorate also borders Oman , a neutral Gulf country that has strained to contain a spillover of the Yemeni conflict into its own Dhofar region that has seen rebellions in the past. “Neither Saudi Arabia nor Oman want a UAE-influenced state on their borders,” Kendall said.

Within Yemen, there are divides between the southwestern and eastern states, notes Basha. “There's no cohesiveness, even though the STC is the largest political bloc. In theory they could run the south, but they don't have the support of the east,” he noted.

While the eruption of the “southern question” exposed the faultlines with the east, it did little to address Yemen’s core security issues. “Two groups are benefiting from everything that's happening right now in the east and the south. It's the Houthis and AQAP,” noted Basha, referring to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. “The Houthis are sitting back, watching the anti-Houthi coalition fight each other, watching the two regional backers have a very public divorce,” he explained. “And al Qaeda loves to flourish wherever there's a vacuum.”

One of the key reasons for the STC’s lightening sweep to the east in December was the fear that the Saudis could reach a peace deal with the Houthis, leaving the Shiite rebels in a commanding position in the north while sidelining southern powerbrokers.

A prisoner swap between the Houthis and the Yemeni government last year sparked some hopes for a peace deal. But given the complexities of the conflict, expectations are low.

“In 2026, will we see a peace deal between the Saudis and the Houthis? Absolutely, yes. Is it going to be implementable on the ground? I am not sure,” said Basha. “The real problems in Yemen will appear after a peace agreement is signed,” he added, predicting that the country’s myriad armed groups are likely to “just either fight each other for territory and resources, or collapse, or join AQAP, or form other militant groups”.

While the UAE agreed to troop withdrawal from southern Yemen to avert a military confrontation with Saudi Arabia, analysts question whether it will mark an end to Abu Dhabi’s funding and support for its proxies in the region.

The 2025 crisis in Yemen has put a spotlight on the UAE’s increasingly assertive foreign policy and extension of its sphere of influence in Middle East, Africa and the seas in between.

“These maritime locations are supremely important geopolitically. The area that the UAE seeks to extend its influence in, via the STC, is right on that very important corner of the Arabian Peninsula, where the Gulf of Aden meets the Red Sea,” explained Kendall.

Yemeni territory includes the island of Perim, located in the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, which is a gateway for oil tankers heading to Europe via the Suez Canal . Further east lies Socotra, an archipelago and UNESCO World Heritage Site that is also a part of Yemen.

Satellite imagery reveals an expanded network of airstrips, military and intelligence bases built by the UAE, according to investigative reports . They extend from Socotra in the Indian Ocean to Yemen’s Arabian Peninsula coast to the Horn of Africa .

The UAE’s strategic partnership with Israel, strengthened by the Abrahams Accord, has also come under the spotlight during the recent tensions in Yemen.

Israeli media last month speculated about the resulting benefits of an independent southern Yemen under Abu Dhabi’s patronage. Arab outlets noted The National ’s interview with Aidarous Al Zubaidi, head of the UAE-backed STC and also vice president of the Saudi-backed PLC, wherein he said he believed “we will be part of the [Abraham] accords”.

While this may be music to the Trump administration’s ears, it adds credence among local populations to the Houthis' self-declared role as defenders of the Palestinian cause.

Last month, when Israel suddenly recognised Somalia’s breakaway region of Somaliland , it raised eyebrows in Middle Eastern capitals and policy circles – and protests in Mogadishu .

It also drew attention to the UAE’s goals in the region. Noting Abu Dhabi’s strategic sweep from Perim island in the west to Socotra in the east, Kendall remarked that the UAE “has a stranglehold on the Gulf of Aden. Add to that, the fact that it was silent when its ally in the Abraham Accords, Israel, expressed its solidarity with the breakaway ‘nation of Somaliland’ on the other side of the Gulf of Aden, and it looks like that whole area is encircled by the UAE.”

Meanwhile across the Red Sea in Sudan, UN sanctions monitors have described what they deemed credible allegations that the UAE provided military support to Sudan 's paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in the civil war against the Sudanese army. Abu Dhabi denies the allegations.

The problem, many analysts say, is not Abu Dhabi’s goal of increasing strategic influence, but its effects on weak states. The UAE bases its foreign policy on “realpolitik and doesn't mind working with secessionist movements or with minorities”, said Basha. “You see that with the Rapid Support Forces. You're seeing that with the southerners in the STC. The Saudis are completely against that.”

This year, until and unless the two Gulf brotherly nations-turned-frenemies manage to sort out their differences, Yemen – and the wider Middle East – is unlikely to enjoy a lasting peace.</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 14:22:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/fd77c40a-e7be-11f0-8c4e-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25365410480398.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Watch live: Swiss officials brief media after deadly NYE fire in Cras-Montana bar</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260102-watch-live-swiss-officials-brief-media-after-deadly-nye-fire-in-cras-montana-bar</link><description>Swiss authorities are holding a press conference on Friday, one day after a deadly fire killed around 40 people and injured more than 115 at the Crans-Montana ski resort in the Swiss Alps .

Sudan’s team has reached the knockout stage of the competition for only the second time since they won the tournament in 1970, overcoming the immense difficulties of being exiled from their country because of the war.

The paramilitary group – which grew from the “Janjaweed” militia mobilised two decades ago by Sudan’s government to subdue its western Darfur province – has been fighting the Sudanese army since April 2023 when the two fell out over how to integrate their forces.

The conflict has since killed tens of thousands of people, displaced millions and spread famine across the vast country.

Despite the conflict, Sudan’s football team have continued to play in exile and against the odds qualified for the Cup of Nations in Morocco, where they will meet the heavily fancied Senegal in the first of the last-16 matches at the weekend.

“Most of the time I try to run away from these questions because the emotions are terrible,” said a visibly upset Appiah at a press conference when asked about the impact of the war on his team.

“It is not something that we want to talk about, but we are hoping that if we win it will let the war calm down or even cease.

“There was a game we won (in recent World Cup qualifying) when the armies put their guns down and everyone was celebrating. Football can change things in this world,” added the Ghanaian born coach.

Sudan has not played a home match over the last three years with its footballing infrastructure damaged. The country’s top two clubs have moved to Rwanda, where they are competing as guests in the local league and Khartoum’s Al Hilal have also made it to the group phase of this season’s Champions League.

“Playing away from home and under these circumstances that you are all aware of, is very difficult,” added captain Bakhit Khamis.

“It’s very hard on us to live away from our families, from our homes. We are trying to cope with these circumstances, trying to please our fans, and hopefully things will get better. Everything we are doing on the pitch is an attempt to make things better for our people,” he said.</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 14:46:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HBMUVP7EIFOXVKYBGQHMB6WWPY.jpg?auth=693e0d2feca24d0a055b84b3a9355c3588ec3e0ed8722778761f92826683d318&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Earthquake of magnitude 6.3 strikes southern Mexico</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/earthquake-magnitude-63-strikes-mexico-gfz-says-2026-01-02/</link><description>Jan 2 (Reuters) - A magnitude 6.3 earthquake struck the southern Mexican state of Guerrero on Friday, the German Research Center for Geosciences (GFZ) said.

The Allied Democratic Forces began as an insurgent force in Uganda but has been based in the forests of neighbouring Congo since the late 1990s, and is recognised by Islamic State as an affiliate.

Congo's army and Ugandan forces have pursued operations against the ADF, but the group's raids persist.

Its latest attacks occurred on Thursday night in Lubero, part of North Kivu province. Nine civilians were killed in Kilonge, two civilians in Katanga and two civilians and two soldiers in Maendeleo, according to Macaire Sivikunula, chief of the Bapere locality where the villages are located.

"The ADF rebels killed most of the victims with bladed weapons," although they also exchanged gunfire with soldiers in Maendeleo, he told Reuters.

Alain Kiwewa, Lubero's military administrator, said on Friday afternoon that 16 people had been confirmed dead.

An army spokesperson, Lieutenant Marc Elongo, said Congolese troops were "pursuing the enemy", without providing details.

Kakule Kagheni Samuel, head of civil society groups in Bapere, said the militants also burnt homes to the ground.

The U.N. peacekeeping mission in the Central African country, known as MONUSCO, said in November that the ADF killed 89 civilians in a spate of strikes over the course of a week.

And in September , the ADF claimed responsibility for an attack that claimed the lives of more than 60 civilians at a funeral in eastern Congo.

Sivikunula said local officials were waiting for soldiers to secure the area before organising funerals for victims of the overnight attacks because "the ADF are cunning (and) can ambush civilians who try to organise this kind of activity."

The ADF violence is separate from the war between Congo and Rwanda-backed M23 rebels that killed thousands of people and displaced hundreds of thousands last year, prompting mediation by U.S. President Donald Trump's administration and Qatar.</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 14:46:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Mexico reports second screwworm case in two days</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/mexico-reports-second-screwworm-case-two-days-2026-01-02/</link><description>Jan 2 (Reuters) - Mexican authorities reported a case of the New World screwworm parasite late on Thursday, the second case reported in two days as Mexico works to contain an outbreak that has kept the U.S.-Mexico border closed to Mexican livestock.

The parasite was detected and treated in a goat in the State of Mexico, which borders capital Mexico City, the ministry said, adding that the 20 other animals at the site tested negative and were given preventive treatment.

On December 31, the ministry reported a case in a six-day-old cow calf in the northern state of Tamaulipas, also the only positive case on site.

Mexico has so far reported a total of 13,106 cases since November of 2024, according to government data through December 31, 2025. Of those cases, 671 were active currently.

The southern border state of Chiapas has the most confirmed cases, followed by Oaxaca, Veracruz and Yucatan.

Screwworms are parasitic flies whose females lay eggs in wounds. Their larvae burrow through the flesh of animals, eventually killing their host if left untreated.

Mexico has been working to contain an outbreak of the screwworm, which has spread northward from Central America, rattling the livestock and beef industries of both the U.S. and Mexico.

Because of the outbreak, the U.S. has kept its southern border largely closed to Mexican livestock since May.

Although U.S. officials say the pest has not yet breached the U.S. border, it threatens $1.8 billion in damage to Texas' economy alone, according to a U.S. Department of Agriculture estimate.</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 15:24:26 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/U6P33BTJGFJJJG3WJM3FOXIVXE.jpg?auth=a7a9f282b07ce81be0ea6b4b25c1092aefefeb5fbe6ca196925168c4f0271d64&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Zelenskiy says he will appoint Oleh Ivashchenko as new military intelligence chief</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/zelenskiy-says-he-will-appoint-oleh-ivashchenko-new-military-intelligence-chief-2026-01-02/</link><description>KYIV, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Friday he will appoint the head of the foreign intelligence service Oleh Ivashchenko as the new military intelligence chief.

Swiss officials put the death toll at 40 with more than 100 injured. Investigators are combing through the ruins of the bar, examining video recordings and interviewing survivors in the hunt for clues on how the fire broke out.

Several witnesses have recounted seeing bar staff holding up sparkling fountain candles attached to bottles of champagne. Prosecutor Beatrice Pilloud said the fountain candles were a leading line of enquiry that looked to be firming up.

"Everything suggests that the fire started from the burning candles or 'Bengal lights' that had been attached to champagne bottles. These went too close to the ceiling," she told a news conference. "From there, a rapid, very rapid and widespread conflagration ensued."

Investigators have questioned the bar's two owners, a French couple who bought the bar in 2015 according to the local canton's company registry.

The probe will focus on previous renovations to the bar and the materials used, the availability of adequate fire extinguishing systems and escape routes, as well as the number of people who were in the bar when the fire started.

Pilloud said further investigations would determine whether there were grounds for criminal liability.

"If this is indeed the case and these individuals are still alive, an investigation will be opened against them for negligent arson, negligent homicide, and negligent bodily injury," the prosecutor added.</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 16:28:32 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/MN3JOIDPUZK3XMBHHBUP7MYEWA.jpg?auth=32503722a21d7fb0304090ba29ec7fc89ea80a3adc2b9a01cadc44cf2b23b66c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Understanding Iran’s protest chants: What are demonstrators’ demands?</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260102-understanding-iran-protest-chants-what-are-demonstrators-demands</link><description>A protest movement, which began in Iran on Sunday with a strike and demonstrations by Tehran's shopkeepers, continued Friday in multiple towns and cities across the country, with university students joining the protests.

Demonstrations are spreading from major cities to smaller provincial towns and are increasingly fraught.

At least seven people died on Thursday in clashes between protesters and security forces in western Iran , local media reported.

The Iranian authorities have ordered the closure of public institutions, placing much of the country on holiday, officially citing the cold weather and the need to save energy.

The discontent is not, so far, on the same scale as the unprecedented national protests seen in the wake of Mahsa Amini’ s death in 2022, during which demonstrators called for increased rights for women and the overthrow of the Islamic Republic.

But videos posted on social media show demonstrators from different social groups taking to the streets to express widespread discontent and voice demands for political, social and economic change. Here is what they are calling for:

This chant, taken up by protesters in the early days of the demonstrations, reflects growing anger over Iran's foreign policy.

For decades, Iran has pursued a policy of regional engagement by supporting the militant groups Hamas in the Palestinian territories and Hezbollah in Lebanon .

The protesters argue that these alliances are diverting resources away from domestic needs at a time when Iran is undergoing a severe economic crisis.

A sharp currency slide has crippled sales of imported goods – sparking unrest among Iran’s shopkeepers – while rampant inflation is affecting the wider population.

Prices rose by an average of 52 percent year-on-year in December, according to the Statistical Centre of Iran, and this average masks even more dramatic increases in the cost of basic necessities, fuelling popular anger against the regime.

On the third day of demonstrations, a young woman, dressed in trainers and with her hair up in a ponytail, led a group of protesting shopkeepers through a throughfare of Tehran’s Grand Bazar.

With her fist raised, video footage shows her turn to the crowd behind her and shout: “Don’t be afraid! Don’t be afraid! We are all together!”

Her courageous rallying cry shocked bystanders and was immediately picked up by the other, mostly male, demonstrators. As the protest passed by, the person filming the scene was impressed. “Well done! That girl is so brave,” they said.

The words the female demonstrator used are familiar – they have been heard at protests in Iran for years. But the sight of a young woman among the bazar traders, who appear to be supporting her, shows how two separate strands of dissent are starting to intertwine.

The bazar traders typically belong to more religious and traditional sections of society, making them unlikely allies of the “Woman, Life, Freedom” movement, sparked by Amini’s death, which calls for the end of repression and discrimination against women.

The joint protest in the Grand Bazar has been echoed in recent days by other chants calling for social unity.

At Yard University in central Iran, female students gathered on December 30 shouted: “ Iranians, speak up and demand your rights!”, “Don't just stand by and watch, join us!” and “ Anyone who says they are neutral is dishonourable .”

This chant, typically heard among university students, has resurfaced in recent days. In a video from December 30, students in the hallways of the Khajeh Nasir Toosi University of Technology in Tehran beat a rhythm with their feet as they chant the words.

Universities in Iran are under high surveillance but remain hotbeds of protest. Students from dormitories at the University of Tehran on Monday evening were heard chanting “ Protest, free students ! Protest!”

Security forces quickly surrounded their building and blocked the entryways. But they could not prevent student marches spreading to a dozen other major universities in the capital the next day.

Female students at Tehran’s Shahid Beheshti University attacked security forces who had come to break up a gathering in their halls of residence on Wednesday night with cries of “Without honour! Without honour!”, French journalist Armin Arefi reported.

The chant has been heard repeatedly at demonstrations since Sunday, breaking out near police roadblocks, during detonations of tear gas, and as the police performed violent arrests.

It can be heard in a video from December 31 showing a student being apprehended in front of his classmates by plainclothes security forces.

Shopkeepers and traders who took to the streets on Thursday started shouting insults at police officers before their cries turned to an exhortation for the forces of order to join the protest.

“Police officers! Support us!” they chanted, hopeful that some officers might switch allegiance and tip the balance of the movement in the protesters' favour.

Young protesters were filmed shouting a direct threat to Iran’s supreme leader on January 1, in the city of Marvdasht in southern Iran. The video has since been shared widely online.

Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , leader of the Islamic Republic, has long been the target of protesters' anger. “Death to the dictator” is a popular chant in Tehran and other provinces.

At the University of Tehran, students were also heard shouting “Death to the principle of Velayate Faqih!”, openly criticising Khamenei’s vision of the Islamic Republic.

Velayate Faqih (or the Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist) is a concept that gives religious leaders more power than their political counterparts and places the supreme leader at the head of State.

The chant targets not just the Khamenei but his entire political system.

Political chants have also referenced the former regime, which was led by Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, until he was overthrown by the Islamic Revolution in 1979. His son, Reza Pahlavi, now lives in the US and is a controversial opposition figure, supported by some protesters.

Chants of “this is the final battle, Pahlavi will return!” and “Reza Shah, may your soul rest in peace,” have been heard at some demonstrations.

Opponents of Reza Pahlavi point to his close ties with Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu . Israeli media outlet Haaretz recently reported on an influence operation aimed at reinstalling him as Shah during the 12-day war between Iran and Israel in June.

Demonstrators who reject both the current and former regime have been heard chanting “ Neither Shah nor Mullah [a title for Muslim clergy]”.

Beyond political allegiance, the majority of protesters are united around a broader aspiration: to turn the page on the Islamic Republic and build a different future.

Accompanied by an American delegation and greeted by former and current officials, Jolie said she was "honoured" to meet aid volunteers at the crossing.

A Red Crescent volunteer told the Oscar winner that "there are thousands of aid trucks just waiting" at the border crossing.

According to local media , the actor and former special envoy for the UN refugee agency made the visit to see the condition of injured Palestinians transferred to Egypt and to look into aid deliveries into the devastated territory.

Jolie and the Egyptian authorities have yet to officially comment on the visit.

The Rafah border crossing was set to be reopened under the ceasefire in effect in Gaza since October, but has so far remained closed.

In a joint statement on Friday, Egypt and six other countries, including Saudi Arabia , "urged the international community to pressure Israel, as the occupying power, to immediately lift the constraints on the entry and distribution of essential supplies" to Gaza.

In early December, Israel announced that the Rafah crossing would be opened only for those wishing to leave Gaza, prompting Cairo to swiftly deny that it had approved such a move.

A first avalanche hit the southwest Alpine Maira Valley, near the French border in the Italian region of Piedmont, killing one person and injuring two others, Alpine Rescue (Soccorso Alpino) said. One of them is in critical condition.

Rescue teams set out on foot from lower altitudes after the strong winds prevented helicopter crews from reaching the site, the organisation said in a statement.

A second avalanche occurred near Pragelato, a popular ski destination about 60 km (37 miles) west of Turin.

A woman caught in the avalanche managed to free herself but was unable to move because of injuries. Rescue teams were working to evacuate her, with helicopters again limited by adverse weather conditions.

Authorities said they were monitoring reports of a third avalanche in Piedmont, but details were not immediately available.

Separately, in the northeastern Italian region of Veneto, an avalanche on the Vajo Gabene slope in the Small Dolomites killed a 50-year-old ski mountaineer, Italian news agency ANSA said.

Rescue teams reached him by helicopter but were unable to save him.

A combination of heavy snowfall and strong winds has raised avalanche risks across the Alps in recent days, prompting warnings for skiers and hikers.

Local officials urged caution and advised against off-piste excursions as conditions remain unstable.</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 16:50:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Nigeria urges civilians to avoid debris from US-backed strikes on Islamists</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/nigeria-urges-civilians-avoid-debris-us-backed-strikes-islamists-2026-01-02/</link><description>ABUJA, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Nigeria's military urged civilians in the country's northwest on Friday not to keep or tamper with unexploded ordnance found at sites targeted in recent U.S.-backed airstrikes .

The alert follows online footage showing locals scavenging debris and unexploded ordnance at strike sites in Sokoto state, sparking fears of deadly blasts.

U.S. forces launched a rare strike deep inside Nigeria on December 25 at the request of Nigeria's government, firing 16 GPS-guided munitions from MQ‑9 Reaper drones at two Islamic State-linked camps in Sokoto.

"We do not expect civilians to pick up or keep such materials," Major General Michael Onoja, director of Defence Media Operations, told reporters on Friday. "We can only appeal to them to return all materials that may prove harmful to them."

Onoja said specialized ordnance units within the armed forces were tasked with recovering debris and other remnants from the strikes.</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 16:50:43 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KKR4VKUILVMCTGRHMWWZRKBW34.jpg?auth=22232ec4f81eff015fb1faec6628e9cb7180b805cb6f182a7827ba830ecfb8a3&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US says it thwarted potential ISIS-inspired New Year's Eve attack in North Carolina</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/fbi-says-it-thwarted-potential-isis-inspired-attack-new-years-eve-2026-01-02/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 2 (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department said on Friday it thwarted an alleged plan by a North Carolina man to carry out an ISIS-inspired attack using knives and hammers on New Year’s Eve.

Photographs and videos posted online showed smoke rising from an area of vast destruction, with emergency crews making their way through rubble and large chunks of building materials.

"Missile strikes in central Kharkiv have nearly destroyed a five-storey dwelling," Regional Governor Oleh Syniehubov told Ukrainian television, saying that according to preliminary information two ballistic missiles had struck the area.

"Rescue teams are on site. They are primarily clearing rubble and searching for people underneath."

Syniehubov said 25 people were injured, with 16 in hospital, including a woman in serious condition.

Mayor Ihor Terekhov put the casualty toll at 30 injured.

Located 30 km (18 miles) from the border, Kharkiv withstood Russian advances in the early weeks of Russia's February 2022 invasion of its smaller neighbour.

With Russia's forces focused since on capturing eastern regions of the country, the city has been a constant target of aerial attacks.</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 17:20:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/XBLXZZN5TVM3HH6JU27XGFPIAM.jpg?auth=95f44cc06b5af9cd35b627eacf51797bd39c89b7d46e97d3a7afd94d2c9ab503&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Nigeria police charge Joshua driver with dangerous driving over fatal collision</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sports/boxing-nigeria-police-charge-joshua-driver-with-dangerous-driving-over-fatal-2026-01-02/</link><description>Jan 2 (Reuters) - Nigerian police said on Friday the driver of the vehicle involved in a crash that injured British former world heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua and killed two of his close friends was charged with four counts.

Adeniyi Mobolaji Kayode, 46, appeared before the Sagamu Magistrate Court on Friday in connection with the accident on the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, Ogun State Police Command said in a statement.

It told Reuters Kayode was charged on four counts, including causing death by dangerous driving. The case was adjourned to January 20.

Reuters was not immediately able to contact Kayode or a legal representative. Kayode has not commented publicly on the case.

Joshua, 36, sustained minor injuries when the Lexus SUV he was travelling in collided with another car on Monday. Two of his friends and team members, Sina Ghami and Latif Ayodele, died in the crash.

Preliminary findings suggested the car was speeding and attempted a wrongful overtaking manoeuvre before hitting a stationary truck, the FRSC has said.

Joshua, who was born in Britain to Nigerian parents, was taken to hospital for checks and remains stable, his promoter Matchroom Boxing said.

President Bola Tinubu expressed condolences to Joshua and the victims' families, calling the incident a "tragic accident."

The crash came just over a week after Joshua knocked out American social media star Jake Paul in the sixth round of a bout in Miami. Joshua is expected to fight fellow Briton Tyson Fury later this year.</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 17:43:21 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/754MCKXBHRP2ZPZFS2TC7LWZ2M.jpg?auth=f4b5f638bbb8ca48e975b236341d97e1834b6d471c9e969bb5864c5a9cf689e3&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukraine's Zelensky names spy chief Kyrylo Budanov as new top aide</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260102-ukraine-s-zelensky-names-spy-chief-kyrylo-budanov-as-new-top-aide</link><description>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday named military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov as the new head of his office, after his previous top aide resigned in November over a corruption scandal.

Budanov, 39, has built up a legendary reputation in Ukraine, credited with a series of daring operations against Russia since it launched an all-out assault against its neighbour in 2022.

"I had a meeting with Kyrylo Budanov and offered him the role of the Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine," Zelensky said on social media.

The nomination comes at a key moment in the nearly four-year war, with Zelensky announcing on Wednesday that a US-brokered deal to end the conflict was "90 percent" ready.

"At this time, Ukraine needs greater focus on security issues, the development of the Defence and Security Forces of Ukraine, as well as on the diplomatic track of negotiations," Zelensky said.

"Kyrylo has specialised experience in these areas and sufficient strength to deliver results."

Budanov said he had accepted the nomination and would "continue to serve Ukraine".

"It is an honour and a responsibility for me to focus on critically important issues of strategic security for our state at this historic time for Ukraine," he said on Telegram.

Procedures to formally appoint him as the president's chief of staff have been launched, Zelensky's adviser Dmytro Lytvyn told journalists.

Zelensky has also announced that Budanov will be replaced by the current head of the Foreign Intelligence Service, Oleg Ivashchenko.

Budanov, when appointed, will succeed Andriy Yermak, who resigned in November after investigators raided his house as part of a sweeping corruption probe.

Yermak was Zelensky's most important ally, but a divisive figure in Kyiv, where his opponents said he had accumulated vast power, gate-kept access to the president and ruthlessly sidelined critical voices.

The four-year conflict, the deadliest on European soil since World War II, has killed tens of thousands and ravaged swathes of Ukrainian territory.</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 17:44:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/2d0603f2-e7d4-11f0-b9c3-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-02T120450Z-1186667708-RC2ZSIA63Q4F-RTRMADP-3-UKRAINE-CRISIS-ZELENSKIY-CHIEF.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US judge orders man accused of planting pipe bombs in Washington to remain in custody</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us-judge-orders-man-accused-planting-pipe-bombs-washington-remain-custody-2026-01-02/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 2 (Reuters) - A federal judge on Friday ordered that the man accused of planting pipe bombs in Washington the night before the January 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol attack should remain behind bars while his case moves forward.

U.S. District Court Judge Matthew Sharbaugh ordered Brian Cole, 30, to be held without bail as he faces two criminal charges related to the attempted bombings of the Democratic and Republican party headquarters. Cole, who faces two explosives-related charges, has not yet entered a plea.

Sharbaugh concluded in his ruling that the U.S. government's evidence against Cole was strong and that the pipe bombs sparked fear and alarm ahead of the congressional certification of the election even though they did not explode.

"If the plan had succeeded, the results could have been devastating: creating a greater sense of terror on the eve of a high-security Congressional proceeding, causing serious property damage in the heart of Washington, D.C., grievously injuring DNC or RNC staff and other innocent bystanders, or worse," Sharbaugh wrote.

A lawyer for Cole argued during a December 30 court hearing that he should be released on strict conditions, pointing to his lack of criminal history and family support.

The attorney said a defense expert was prepared to testify that the devices were not capable of detonating. The FBI has concluded the pipe bombs were viable.

Federal prosecutors have said in a court filing that Cole confessed to planting the pipe bombs and told investigators after his arrest he thought the 2020 election had been “tampered with." President Donald Trump had falsely claimed that the election, which he lost to Democrat Joe Biden, was marred by fraud.

According to the filing, Cole said he didn't like either political party.

The pipe bombs were not discovered until about 1 p.m. on January 6, diverting police resources just as a mob of Trump supporters surged into the Capitol.</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 18:31:12 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/L4OT2JEWGFKABAFQEMYZNAG3PQ.jpg?auth=e6044bb532f4ad4d0c36a5367b5a3038456ed1289e003c361c0a848c1e786c75&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Hiker killed in rare suspected mountain lion attack in Colorado</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/hiker-killed-rare-suspected-mountain-lion-attack-colorado-2026-01-02/</link><description>Jan 2 (Reuters) - A hiker in Colorado has died in the state's first suspected fatal mountain lion attack in over 25 years, authorities said.

The woman was found unresponsive by other hikers on the Crosier Mountain trail northeast of Estes Park around noon on Thursday.

The hikers saw a mountain lion near the woman's body and scared it away by throwing rocks. A doctor was among the hikers and attended to the woman but found no pulse, Colorado Parks and Wildlife spokesperson Kara Van Hoose told reporters.

CPW officers responded to the scene and shot dead two lions in the area. It is not known whether one or multiple animals were involved in the suspected attack, the agency said in a statement. It is believed the woman was hiking alone.

“There were signs that this was consistent with a mountain lion attack,” Van Hoose told a press conference.

Mountain lion attacks on humans in Colorado are rare, with 28 reported to CPW since 1990. The last fatal attack was in 1999.

CPW pathologists are performing necropsies on the dead animals to check for abnormalities and neurological diseases like rabies and avian influenza, as well as human DNA, Van Hoose said.

CPW policy mandates the killing of any mountain lion involved in an attack on a human so as to prevent repeat incidents. If human DNA is not found on either dead lion, authorities will continue to search for animals that may have been involved, Van Hoose said.

Larimer County Coroner will release the identity of the victim and cause of death, she said.

Colorado has a healthy mountain lion population, estimated by CPW to be between 3,800 and 4,400 adults. Conservation efforts have brought the species back from near extinction in the 1960s due to bounty hunting.

Mountain lions are common in the Front Range area where the woman was found, Van Hoose said. The animals go down to lower elevations in winter in search of prey like deer and elk, increasing chances of encounters with humans.

Witnesses reported seeing staff at the Le Constellation bar carrying so-called fountain candles atop bottles of champagne, and questions have also arisen about a foam material used to soundproof the ceiling of the basement where revellers danced.

Beatrice Pilloud, chief prosecutor of Valais, the canton that is home to the bar in the upscale ski resort of Crans-Montana, said that available indications were that the fire started because the sparklers got too near to the ceiling.

"From there, a rapid, very rapid and widespread blaze ensued," she said on Friday afternoon.

Further investigations will show whether anyone faces criminal liability over the fire, Pilloud said.

Police arrived quickly at the scene according to local residents, but the fire burned victims so severely that investigators said they would need days to identify the bodies.

So far, officials have only identified a teenage Italian international golfer, Emanuele Galeppini. According to two people familiar with the investigation, some of the victims may be under 16.

Local residents said the bar was popular with young people and the Swiss government said many of the dead were likely youths. Beer and wine can be drunk from age 16 in Switzerland.

One of the bar's owners, Jacques Moretti, told the Tribune de Geneve newspaper that Le Constellation had been checked three times in 10 years and that everything was done according to the rules. Reuters was not immediately able to contact the bar's owners for comment.

Stephane Ganzer, head of security in Valais, said the investigation would determine if the bar had undergone its annual building inspections, but that the town had not raised concerns or reported defects to the canton.

Grieving residents continued paying their respects to the victims of the blaze on Friday, leaving flowers and tributes nearby, even as police began reopening the area around the cordoned-off bar in the heart of the wealthy mountain town.

One of them, Ashley Hauri, 23, said just before the fire broke out she had been on the verge of going to Le Constellation to catch up with friends. Ultimately, she decided against it.

Six of her former co-workers ranging in age from their 20s to their 40s were inside when the blaze erupted, she said. Two of them ended up in hospital; the other four are still missing.

"I was really shocked," said Hauri, who immediately tried to contact her friends. "But I had no answers, and I was really scared and panicked because I wanted to do something."</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 23:20:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/3JDTZZVCYFOW7K4LK3SQJRGCG4.jpg?auth=25090f65e4e109ab1cbea8a28f606bbdccdda283c7c71dfced505068d35620c6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UN chief deeply concerned over Israel's suspension of NGOs</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/un-chief-deeply-concerned-over-israels-suspension-ngos-2026-01-02/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 2 (Reuters) - UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres is deeply concerned by Israel's announcement of a suspension of the operations of several international non-governmental organizations in occupied Palestinian territory and called for the measure to be reversed, according to a statement on Friday.

The dozen orders Adams issued since his indictment included a directive to allow federal agents, including immigration officers, to use an office on Rikers Island, the city's main jail. That order was later struck down by a court.

The new mayor also struck down executive orders that Adams had portrayed as addressing antisemitism. Mamdani, a Muslim who some have accused of antisemitism over his support of Palestinians in Gaza, told reporters on Friday that he would fund measures to prevent hate crimes, and would make protection of Jewish New Yorkers a focus of his administration.

Mamdani recalled September 26, 2024, the day when Adams was charged with accepting illegal campaign contributions and luxury travel from Turkish nationals seeking to influence him, as "a moment when many New Yorkers lost even more faith in New York City politics and the ability of city government to actually prioritize the needs of the public, as opposed to the needs of the person."

In April, a U.S. judge dismissed the charges against Adams , a Democrat, at the request of the U.S. Justice Department, which had argued that the case was distracting the mayor from helping Republican President Donald Trump step up deportations.

Mamdani, from the left wing of the Democratic Party, has clashed with Trump over the immigration crackdown.

On Thursday, Mamdani revoked orders by Adams that had prevented city institutions from divesting from Israel and that defined antisemitism in a way recognized by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, an intergovernmental organization of 35 countries that promotes Holocaust education.

The Council on American-Islamic Relations is among groups that argue the IHRA definition has been used to try to silence advocates , opens new tab for Palestinian rights.

The father-and-son gunmen are alleged to have carried out the attack at a Hanukkah event at the famed Bondi Beach on December 14. Australia's worst mass shooting in almost three decades shocked the nation and stoked fears of rising antisemitism in the country.

The massacre has sparked more active policing in Sydney, Australia's most populous city and the capital of New South Wales state.

Authorities on Saturday announced a "high-visibility" police presence for the marquee cricket series between Australia and England, which is held every two years. Measures at the cricket ground, some 5 km (3 miles) from Bondi Beach, would include the riot patrol unit, officers on horseback and officers carrying rifles.

“The difference will be in the visibility of long arms and a stronger presence," New South Wales Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon said in a statement.

Police said they expected a capacity crowd for day one of the fixture, the final encounter in the five-match series already claimed by Australia.

"Many people may not be used to seeing police carrying rifles at sporting events, but our objective here is to help the public feel safe," Lanyon said.

Cricket Australia said first responders to the attack and "community members who bravely acted" would be honoured before the start of play on Sunday.

There will be a guard of honour on the field and a round of applause for "emergency response agencies and members of the community in the face of extreme danger", the governing body said in a statement.

On Wednesday, around 3,000 police, some carrying long arms, were deployed in the city during New Year celebrations, which typically attract over a million revellers.

Several New Year events planned at Bondi were cancelled, while traditional Christmas celebrations there were muted, following the attack that authorities believe was inspired by Sunni Muslim militant group Islamic State.</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 01:40:26 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/GILJ3ZBYONOTJHC6VQCOFQLBXQ.jpg?auth=07a1b1bf6a696ec2860d292b4cac806e93eaa675344c0d0062020d8d1371a541&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Military-backed party in Myanmar takes lead in first phase of polls</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/military-backed-party-myanmar-takes-lead-first-phase-polls-2026-01-03/</link><description>Jan 02(Reuters) - Myanmar's military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party is leading after the first phase of a contentious general election , early results cited by state media showed, in the first vote since a 2021 coup.

Having sparked a nationwide rebellion after crushing pro-democracy protests in the wake of its coup, the ruling junta has said the three-phase vote would bring political stability to the impoverished Southeast Asian nation.

Partial results from Myanmar's first election since 2020, released by the Union Election Commission (UEC) for 56 constituencies, showed the junta-backed party winning by a wide margin as expected, despite thin turnout.

The results published on Friday show the Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP), led by retired generals, winning 38 of 40 seats in the Pyithu Hluttaw, or lower house, whose outcomes have been tallied.

The Shan Nationalities Democratic Party, also known as the White Tiger Party and the Mon Unity Party (MUP) got one seat each.

Among a diminished field of competitors handpicked by the military, the USDP also won 14 seats of the 15 regional or State Hluttaw seats tallied in the first-past-the-post system, while the Akha National Development Party took one.

For the upper house, or Amyotha Hluttaw, only one seat has been declared, which was won by the Wa National Party.

No date has been set for the final result of the election, criticised by the United Nations, some Western countries and human rights groups as anti-junta political parties are not in the running and it is illegal to criticise the polls.

The election panel has not revealed the total number of constituencies voting in the first phase, opting instead to release partial results on a constituency-by-constituency basis.

On Wednesday, the junta said 52% of voters , or more than half of those eligible, had cast ballots in the first phase.

That fell short of turnout of about 70% in general elections in 2020 and 2015, however, according to the U.S.-based nonprofit International Foundation for Electoral Systems.

Two more rounds of voting set for January 11 and January 25 will cover 265 of Myanmar's 330 townships, in some of which the junta does not have complete control.

Aung San Suu Kyi , the Nobel Peace Prize winner deposed by the military months after she won the last general election by a landslide in 2020, remains in detention. Her National League for Democracy has been dissolved.

Analysts say the junta's bid to set up a stable government in the midst of war is fraught with risk , and broad foreign recognition is also unlikely for any military-controlled administration with a civilian veneer.</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 04:07:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LDD4LLJKCZLSLD65B4GRZDZ64A.jpg?auth=2d6244012c729ce1eb0a7ba871e1269acc6739d4a341171a07e2cb218c466f46&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US Coast Guard suspends search for survivors after strike on suspected drug vessels</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us-coast-guard-suspends-search-survivors-after-strike-suspected-drug-vessels-2026-01-03/</link><description>Jan 2 (Reuters) - The United States Coast Guard said on Friday it had suspended a search for people in the water in the aftermath of a U.S. military strike earlier in the week on a convoy of suspected drug vessels in the Pacific Ocean.

The cause and precise locations of the disturbances were not immediately clear. Videos circulating on social media showed multiple explosions across Caracas. Reuters could not immediately verify the videos.

U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly promised land operations in Venezuela. He has not publicly detailed his aims but has privately pressured President Nicolas Maduro to flee the nation, Reuters has reported. Trump said on Monday it would be "smart" for Maduro to leave power.

The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The U.S. has made a major military buildup in the region, including an aircraft carrier, warships and advanced fighter jets stationed in the Caribbean.

Trump has announced a "blockade" of Venezuelan oil, expanded sanctions and staged more than two dozen strikes on vessels the U.S. alleges were involved in trafficking drugs in the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea.

Last week, Trump said the United States had "hit" an area in Venezuela where boats are loaded with drugs, marking the first known time Washington has carried out land operations in Venezuela since the pressure campaign began.

He did not say whether those strikes were carried out by the CIA or not. Other media outlets have reported that the spy agency was behind them.

Trump has accused the South American country of flooding the U.S. with drugs, and his administration has for months been bombing boats originating in South America that it alleges were carrying drugs. Many nations have condemned the attacks as extrajudicial killings and Maduro's government has always denied any involvement with drug trafficking.</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 07:19:39 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/QSO4J4MAT5DZZE7RYVYYJ7DXXA.JPG?auth=3e2bd8a9672d8c14afea4e628483e0f9c80fea23d84b7422fd8b8a5136e0a647&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Multiple explosions, aircraft sounds reported in Venezuela’s Caracas</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260103-multiple-explosions-aircraft-sounds-reported-in-venezuela-caracas-maduro-trump</link><description>Airplanes, loud ​noises and at least one ⁠column of smoke were being heard and seen in Venezuelan ​capital Caracas ‍in the early hours of ​Saturday morning, according to Reuters witnesses, ​and the southern area of the city, near a major military base, was without electricity.

Sounds of explosions were still being heard around 2:15 am, although their exact location was unclear.

Trump on Monday said the United States hit and destroyed a docking area for alleged Venezuelan drug boats.

The Republican leader would not say if it was a military or CIA operation or where the strike occurred, noting only that it was "along the shore."

The attack would be the first known land strike on Venezuelan soil.

President Nicolas Maduro has neither confirmed nor denied Monday's strike, but said Thursday he was open to cooperation with Washington after weeks of US military pressure.

The Trump administration has accused Maduro of heading a drug cartel and says it is cracking down on trafficking, but the leftist leader denies any involvement in the narcotics trade, saying Washington is seeking to overthrow him because Venezuela has the largest known reserves of oil on Earth.

Washington has ramped up pressure on Caracas by informally closing Venezuela's airspace, imposing more sanctions and ordering the seizure of tankers loaded with Venezuelan oil.

For weeks Trump has threatened ground strikes on drug cartels in the region, saying they would start "soon," with Monday being the first apparent example.

US forces have also carried out numerous strikes on boats in both the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean since September, targeting what Washington says are drug smugglers.

The administration has provided no evidence that the targeted boats were involved in drug trafficking, however, prompting debate about the legality of these operations.

The deadly maritime campaign has killed at least 107 people in at least 30 strikes, according to information released by the US military.</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 07:20:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/5c8afd86-e86e-11f0-a078-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26003226353978.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Multiple explosions, aircraft sounds reported in Venezuela’s Caracas</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260103-multiple-explosions-aircraft-sounds-reported-in-venezuela-caracas-maduro-trump</link><description>Airplanes, loud ​noises and at least one ⁠column of smoke were being heard and seen in Venezuelan ​capital Caracas ‍in the early hours of ​Saturday morning, according to Reuters witnesses, ​and the southern area of the city, near a major military base, was without electricity.

The rapidly moving crisis in Yemen has opened a major feud between the two Gulf powers and fractured the coalition of forces , headed by the internationally recognised government, who are fighting the Iran-backed Houthi movement.

The UAE statement said Yemenis should exercise restraint and prioritise dialogue to safeguard security and stability.

It came hours after the UAE-backed Southern Transitional Council (STC) announced its intention to hold a referendum on independence in two years as its forces were ejected from important areas they suddenly seized last month.

Saudi-backed forces said on Friday they had taken control of key locations in Hadramout, a large province with stretches of desert along the Saudi border, and on Saturday witnesses said they had entered parts of the region's capital Mukalla.

Yemen, split for a decade between warring regions, sits at a highly strategic location between the world's top oil exporter Saudi Arabia and the Bab al-Mandeb strait that guards the vital sea route between Europe and Asia.

The STC has for years been part of the internationally recognised government that controls southern and eastern Yemen and is backed by Gulf states against the Houthis.

Overnight the leader of that government, Presidential Council chief Rashad al-Alimi, said he had asked Saudi Arabia to host a forum to resolve the southern issue, adding he hoped this would bring all southern factions together.

The crisis began early last month when the STC suddenly seized swathes of territory including Hadramout, establishing firm control over the whole territory of the former state of South Yemen that merged with the north in 1990.

The leadership of the internationally recognised government, which had been based in Aden and included several ministers from the STC, departed for Saudi Arabia, which regarded the southern move as a threat to its security.

The crisis triggered the biggest split in decades between formerly close allies Saudi Arabia and the UAE, as years of divergence on critical issues came to a head, threatening to upend the regional order.

How far the feud over their differences on regional security bleeds into other issues may become plainer over the weekend as both countries join a scheduled OPEC meeting to determine the group's output policy.

Early this week Saudi Arabia bombed a base in Hadramout and asked all remaining UAE forces in Yemen to depart, calling this a red line for its security, and the UAE complied.

The STC declaration on Friday that it wants a two-year transition period leading to a referendum on independence for a new South Arabian state was the movement's clearest indication yet of its intention to secede.</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 10:21:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/XTQIKGOHANJU7ICFMK5AX7EHBI.jpg?auth=62db8daf5fa3a370376c812588080712678ebf12b68d33b8621983b176076c5d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump says US has captured Venezuela President Maduro</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/trump-says-us-has-captured-venezuela-president-maduro-2026-01-03/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 3 (Reuters) - The U.S. struck Venezuela overnight and captured its long-serving President Nicolas Maduro, President Donald Trump said early on Saturday after months of pressuring him over accusations of drug-running and illegitimacy in power.

Washington has not made such a direct intervention in Latin America since the invasion of Panama in 1989 to depose military leader Manuel Noriega, over similar allegations.

"The United States of America has successfully carried out a large scale strike against Venezuela and its leader, President Nicolas Maduro, who has been, along with his wife, captured and flown out of the country," Trump said in a Truth Social post.

The U.S. had accused Maduro of running a "narco-state" and rigging last year's election, which the opposition said it won overwhelmingly. The Venezuelan leader, who succeeded Hugo Chavez to take power in 2013, has said Washington wants to take control of Venezuela's oil reserves, the largest in the world.

Trump said the operation was carried out "in conjunction with U.S. Law Enforcement" and promised more details at an 11 a.m. (1600 GMT) press conference at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.

Maduro was captured by elite special forces troops, a U.S. official told Reuters.

There was no immediate confirmation by the Venezuelan government of Maduro's capture or departure, but Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino was defiant.

"Free, independent and sovereign Venezuela rejects with all the strength of its libertarian history the presence of these foreign troops, which have only left behind death, pain and destruction," Padrino said in a video broadcast on state media about the same time that Trump posted his message.

"Today we clench our fist in defense of what is ours. Let us unite, for in the unity of the people we will find the strength to resist and to triumph."

While various Latin American governments oppose Maduro and say he stole the 2024 election, direct U.S. action revives painful memories of past interventions and is generally strongly opposed by governments and populations in the region.

The Venezuelan opposition, headed by recent Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Corina Machado, said in a statement on X that it had no official comment on the events.

In the early hours on Saturday, explosions rocked Venezuela's capital Caracas and elsewhere, prompting Maduro's government to declare a national emergency and mobilize troops. It said attacks also took place in the states of Miranda, Aragua and La Guaira.

Blasts, aircraft and black smoke could be seen across Caracas from about 2 a.m. (0600 GMT) for roughly 90 minutes, according to Reuters witnesses and images circulating on social media.

Residents expressed shock and fear as they captured video of billowing smoke and bright orange flashes in the sky. “My love, oh no, look at that,” said one woman in a video, gasping at blasts in the distance.

Carmen Marquez, 50, a resident of the eastern part of the capital, said she went to her roof and could hear planes at different altitudes, though she could not see them.

"Flare-like lights were crossing the sky and then explosions could be heard. We’re worried about what’s coming next. We don’t know anything from the government, only what the state television says," she said.

A power outage affected the southern area of Caracas, near a major military base, witnesses said. A local media outlet allied with the ruling socialist party said explosions had taken place near the Fuerte Tiuna and La Carlota military bases.

Venezuelan allies Cuba and Iran were quick to condemn the strikes. Tehran called it "a blatant violation of national sovereignty and territorial integrity" and urged the U.N. Security Council to intervene to stop the "unlawful aggression."

The U.S., Venezuela's opposition and various other nations say Maduro rigged an election last year to stay in power. He has said there is a Western conspiracy to oust him illegally.

Trump had repeatedly promised land operations in the South American oil producer and said on Monday it would be "smart" for Maduro to leave power.

The Venezuelan government, in a statement before Trump's announcement, said the goal of the attack was for the United States to take possession of the country's oil and minerals.

The U.S. has made a major military buildup in the region, including an aircraft carrier, warships and advanced fighter jets stationed in the Caribbean.

Trump has sought a "blockade" of Venezuelan oil, expanded sanctions against the Maduro government and staged more than two dozen strikes on vessels the U.S. alleges were involved in trafficking drugs in the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea.

Last week, Trump said the United States had hit an area in Venezuela where boats are loaded with drugs, marking the first known time Washington has carried out land operations in Venezuela since the pressure campaign began.

Trump has accused Venezuela of flooding the U.S. with drugs, and his administration has for months been bombing boats originating in South America that it alleges were carrying drugs. Many nations have condemned the attacks as extrajudicial killings and Maduro's government has always denied any involvement with drug trafficking.

It was unclear under what legal authority the latest U.S. strikes were carried out. Legal experts have raised questions about the legality of the hits on suspected drug vessels in the region, which have killed more than 110 people so far.</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 10:21:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WLDZOA7YS5PILOSEHS5TNRUFSI.jpg?auth=dc8160ea4511e3c518dedfec0e8816acba644349a6b590fa0660196d34ac5b99&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran supreme leader says will not yield as protests simmer and US threatens</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-supreme-leader-says-will-not-yield-protests-simmer-us-threatens-2026-01-03/</link><description>DUBAI, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed not to yield after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to come to the aid of protesters, as rights groups reported a sharp rise in arrests following days of unrest sparked by soaring inflation.

Speaking in a recorded appearance on television on Saturday, Khamenei said the Islamic Republic "will not yield to the enemy" and said rioters should be "put in their place".

Rights groups say more than 10 people have been killed and scores detained in demonstrations that have flared across Iran since Sunday as the collapsing rial currency hits an economy already undermined by sanctions.

Authorities have attempted to maintain a dual approach to the unrest, saying protests over the economy are legitimate and will be met by dialogue, while meeting some demonstrations with tear gas amid violent street confrontations.

"The bazaaris were right. They are right to say they cannot do business in these conditions," said Khamenei, referring to market traders' concerns over the currency slide.

"We will speak with the protesters but talking to rioters is useless. Rioters should be put in their place," he added.

Reports of violence have centred on small cities in Iran's western provinces, where several people have been killed. Authorities have said two members of the security services had died and more than a dozen were injured in the unrest.

Hengaw, a Kurdish rights group, said late on Friday that it had identified 133 people arrested, an increase of 77 from the previous day.

Trump on Friday said the U.S. was "locked and loaded and ready to go" but did not specify what action it might take against Iran, where it carried out airstrikes last summer , joining an Israeli campaign targeting Iran's nuclear sites and military leaders.

The threat of action adds to the pressure on Iran's leaders as they navigate one of the most difficult periods in decades, with the sanctions-hit economy shrinking and the government struggling to provide water and electricity in some regions.

Iran has suffered a succession of major strategic blows to its regional position since the start of the war in Gaza in 2023 between its ally Hamas and Israel.

Israeli strikes hammered Iran's strongest regional partner Hezbollah. Tehran's close ally Bashar al-Assad was ousted in Syria. The Israeli and U.S. assault strikes on Iran set back the expensive atomic programme and killed senior military leaders, revealing extensive penetration of Tehran's upper echelons.

The protests are the biggest since mass nationwide demonstrations in late 2022 over the death in custody of Kurdish woman Mahsa Amini. This week's demonstrations have not matched those in scale, but still represent the toughest domestic test for authorities in three years.

Rights groups such as Hengaw and activists posting on social media reported continued protests and violence by security forces across Iran, while state-affiliated media reported what it called attacks on property by infiltrators "in the name of protest".

State television has reported arrests of people accused of manufacturing petrol bombs and home-made pistols.

Numerous social media posts overnight said there had been unrest in a number of cities and towns, as well as three districts of the capital Tehran.

Reuters could not immediately verify the reports by rights groups, state media or social media accounts.</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 11:39:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/EEWU6YUEQVPIDFNWFLGZN2ESSA.jpg?auth=a9d6cf030cf986669a1d78083a0dac5e11f25db3b90f62968804e95ddc35f5b9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>World reacts to US strikes on Venezuela</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/world-reacts-us-strikes-venezuela-2026-01-03/</link><description>Jan 3 (Reuters) - Following are reactions to Saturday's U.S. strikes on Venezuela.

RUSSIA FOREIGN MINISTRY:

"This morning, the United States committed an act of armed aggression against Venezuela. This is deeply concerning and condemnable."

"The pretexts used to justify such actions are unfounded. Ideological animosity has prevailed over business pragmatism and the willingness to build relationships based on trust and predictability."

"In the current situation, it is important, first and foremost, to prevent further escalation and to focus on finding a way out of the situation through dialogue."

"Latin America must remain a zone of peace, as it declared itself to be in 2014. And Venezuela must be guaranteed the right to determine its own destiny without any destructive, let alone military, interference from outside."

"We support the statement by the Venezuelan authorities and the leaders of Latin American countries calling for an immediate meeting of the UN Security Council."

EUROPEAN UNION HIGH REPRESENTATIVE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS KAJA KALLAS:

"I have spoken with Secretary of State Marco Rubio and our Ambassador in Caracas. The EU is closely monitoring the situation in Venezuela.

"The EU has repeatedly stated that Mr Maduro lacks legitimacy and has defended a peaceful transition. Under all circumstances, the principles of international law and the UN Charter must be respected. We call for restraint."

IRAN'S SUPREME LEADER AYATOLLAH ALI KHAMENEI:

"What matters is that when a person realizes the enemy is arrogantly trying to impose something on the country, on the officials, on the government, and on the nation, one must stand firmly against the enemy and bare one’s chest in resistance. We will not yield to the enemy."

"Relying on Almighty God, trusting in God, and with confidence in the support of the people, God willing and by divine grace, we will bring the enemy to its knees."

SPANISH FOREIGN MINISTRY:

"Spain calls for de-escalation and moderation, and for action to always be taken in accordance with international law and the principles of the UN Charter."

"In this regard, Spain is willing to offer its good offices to achieve a peaceful and negotiated solution to the current crisis."

"Earlier this morning, Saturday 3rd January 2026, the United States commenced military operations within the territory of Venezuela.2

"Trinidad and Tobago is NOT a participant in any of these ongoing military operations. Trinidad and Tobago continues to maintain peaceful relations with the people of Venezuela."

RODERICH KIESEWETTER, PROMINENT MP FROM GERMANY’S CONSERVATIVE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC UNION:

"With President Trump, the U.S. are abandoning the rules-based order that has shaped us since 1945."

"The coup in Venezuela marks a return to the old U.S. doctrine from before 1940: a mindset of thinking in terms of spheres of influence, where the law of force rules, not international law."

"Trump is destroying what was left of any trust in the U.S."

"The American actions in Venezuela overnight are unorthodox and contrary to international law - but if they make China and Russia think twice, it may be a good thing."

"I hope the Venezuelan people can now turn a new leaf without Maduro."

ITALIAN OPPOSITION PARTY LEADER AND FORMER PRIME MINISTER GIUSEPPE CONTE:

"The American aggression against Venezuela has no legal basis. We are facing a blatant violation of international law, which certifies the dominance of the strongest and best equipped militarily... I hope that the entire international community will make its voice heard and that everyone will understand that if rules only apply to enemies and not to friends, no one can feel safe anymore. Nor can the illiberal nature of a government's rule justify an attack to a sovereign state".

"International law prohibits the use of force as a means of national policy. Short of a U.N. Chapter VII mandate, force is only available in response to an armed attack or possibly to rescue a population under imminent threat of extermination."

"Clearly, none of these requirements are fulfilled by the armed operation against Venezuela. The U.S. interest in repressing the drugs trade or claims that the Maduro government was in essence a criminal enterprise offers no legal justification."

INDONESIA'S FOREIGN MINISTRY SPOKESPERSON, YVONNE MEWENGKANG:

Indonesia is monitoring developments in Venezuela to ensure the safety of its citizens.

"Indonesia also calls on all relevant parties to prioritize peaceful resolution through de-escalation and dialogue, while prioritizing the protection of civilians."

"Indonesia emphasizes the importance of respecting international law and the principles of the UN Charter."

BELGIUM'S DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS MINISTER MAXIME PREVOT:

"The safety of our citizens is a top priority. Our embassy in Bogotá, which is responsible for Venezuela, and our services in Brussels are fully mobilized. The situation is being closely monitored, in coordination with our European partners."</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 11:39:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WB2XHWTHBBMMHG5JNKLBCVXGMY.jpg?auth=ce7b16e1261bb7eafcd67f8cafe9c4f2c598885b7ae64de0bbf9bae7537542d2&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Who is Nicolas Maduro, Venezuela's president?</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/who-is-nicolas-maduro-venezuelas-president-2026-01-03/</link><description>Jan 3 (Reuters) - Following are some key facts about Nicolas Maduro , the Venezuelan president who President Donald Trump said had been captured by U.S. forces on Saturday.

Trump, whose government has accused Maduro of running drug cartels and other crimes, had been pressuring the strongman to leave office for months.

- Maduro was born into a working-class family on November 23, 1962, son of a trade union leader. He worked as a bus driver during the time army officer Hugo Chavez led a failed coup attempt in 1992.

- He campaigned for Chavez’s release from prison and became a fervent supporter of his leftist agenda. He won a seat in the legislature following Chavez's 1998 election.

- He rose to become president of the National Assembly and then foreign minister, travelling the globe to build international alliances through oil-financed assistance programs.

- Chavez named him as his hand-picked successor and Maduro was narrowly elected president in 2013 following Chavez's death.

- His administration oversaw a spectacular economic collapse characterized by hyperinflation and chronic shortages. His rule became best known for allegedly rigged elections, food shortages and rights abuses, including harsh crackdowns on protests in 2014 and 2017. Millions of Venezuelans emigrated abroad.

- His government was subject to aggressive sanctions by the U.S. and other powers. In 2020 Washington indicted him on corruption and other charges. Maduro rejected the accusations.

- He was sworn in for a third term in January 2025 following a 2024 election that was widely condemned by international observers and the opposition as fraudulent. Thousands of people who protested the government's declaration of victory were jailed.

- A U.N. Fact-Finding Mission found last month that the country's Bolivarian National Guard (GNB) committed serious human rights violations and crimes against humanity over more than a decade in targeting political opponents, often with impunity.

- His government's repressive measures were highlighted by the award of the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize to opposition leader Maria Corina Machado.</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 11:39:16 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/FHVBK67CG5NWJALKIX4QYNVY2U.jpg?auth=ed17f12cf6f30e1898ab72cbc5fa7e571687edb0c85504bb05d93b45d461c3c6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'Rioters must be put in their place,' says Iran’s Khamenei as death toll reaches at least 10</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260103-iran-supreme-leader-condemns-rioters-protest-death-toll-reaches-10</link><description>Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Saturday acknowledged the economic demands of Iranian protesters , while warning against what he described as rioting.

"The president and high-ranking officials are working to resolve" the economic difficulties in the sanctions-battered country, Khamenei said in a speech marking a Shiite holiday.

"The shopkeepers have protested against this situation and that is completely fair," he added. But Khamenei nonetheless warned that while "authorities must have dialogue with protesters, it is useless to have dialogue with rioters. Those must be put in their place."

At least eight people were reported on Thursday to have been killed in the protests so far, including members of the security services, according to official figures.

Two deaths overnight into Saturday involved a new level of violence. In Qom, home to the country's major Shiite seminaries, a grenade exploded, killing a man there, the state-owned IRAN newspaper reported. It quoted security officials alleging the man was carrying the grenade to attack people in the city, some 130 kilometres (80 miles) south of the capital, Tehran.

Online videos from Qom purportedly showed fires in the street overnight.

The second death happened in the town of Harsin, some 370 kilometers (230 miles) southwest of Tehran. There, the newspaper said, a member of the Basij, the all-volunteer arm of Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, died in a gun and knife attack in the town in Kermanshah province.

The protests have mostly been concentrated in mid-sized cities in Iran's west and southwest, where clashes and vandalism have been reported.

At least 25 cities have seen protest gatherings of varying sizes, according to an AFP tally based on local media.

However, local media do not necessarily report on every incident, and state media have downplayed coverage of protests, while videos flooding social media are often impossible to verify.

The Fars news agency reported gatherings on Friday in several working-class neighbourhoods of Tehran, which is home to around 10 million people.

But on Saturday, a public holiday, the atmosphere in the capital appeared quiet, with streets mostly empty as the skies spat rain and snow, according to AFP journalists.

In Darehshahr, in the country's west, around 300 people blocked streets, threw molotov cocktails and "brandished Kalashnikovs" on Friday, according to Fars.

The movement kicked off on Sunday when shopkeepers went on strike in Tehran to protest economic conditions, and spread after university students elsewhere in the country took up the cause.

In recent days, the protests have taken on a more overtly political bent.

In Karaj, on the outskirts of the capital, "a few people burned the Iranian flag, shouting 'Death to the dictator!' and 'This isn't the last battle, Pahlavi is coming back!'" Fars reported, adding that others in the crowd objected to the slogans.

The pro-Western Pahlavi dynasty ruled Iran from 1925 to 1979, when it was toppled by the Islamic revolution.

Since the protests began, authorities have adopted a conciliatory tone when it comes to economic demands, while warning that destabilisation and chaos will not be tolerated.

Though widespread, the demonstrations are smaller than the ones that broke out in 2022, triggered by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini , who was arrested for allegedly violating Iran's strict dress code for women.

Her death sparked a nationwide wave of anger that left several hundred people dead, including dozens of members of the security forces.

Iran was also gripped by nationwide protests that began in late 2019 over a rise in fuel prices, eventually leading to calls to topple the country's clerical rulers.</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 11:39:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/263a95d6-e894-11f0-babc-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26003388650698.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuelan security forces patrol Caracas' empty streets</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/shocked-venezuelans-hunker-down-unsure-what-comes-next-2026-01-03/</link><description>Jan 3 (Reuters) - Venezuelan security forces patrolled largely empty streets at dawn in the capital, Caracas, on Saturday, hours after loud explosions woke residents to the news that U.S. commandos had bombed the country and captured President Nicolas Maduro .

Streets close to the Miraflores presidential palace were deserted except for checkpoints manned by uniformed gunmen, as residents expressed their shock at a U.S. military strike that left them guessing who was now in charge of the oil-rich nation.

Smoke streaked the sky, with a dark plume still billowing from the direction of the Port of La Guaira to the north, while another was visible near an air base in the capital.

Most residents stayed home, devouring the latest information on their phones, while some went to stock up on groceries in case they need to hunker down for a prolonged period.

For supporters of the opposition, led by Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Corina Machado , excitement was also in the air.

"My sister, who is in the United States, woke me up with the news; she was crying. We cried together out of happiness," said Jairo Chacin, 39, a mechanic and workshop owner in oil hub Maracaibo, as he waited in a long line to stock up on groceries.

"I went out to check on my business because I was afraid of looting, but the street is deserted. I wanted to fill up my gas tank, but the service stations are already closed, so I took the opportunity to buy food because we don't know what’s coming. Honestly, I have a mix of fear and joy."

U.S. President Donald Trump confirmed Maduro's capture after months of pressuring him over accusations of drug-running and illegitimacy in power. It was the first such U.S. military intervention since the invasion of Panama in 1989 to depose military leader Manuel Noriega .

Soon after the capture of Maduro, Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello appeared on state TV standing on the street and wearing a helmet and flak jacket, urging Venezuelans not to cooperate with the "terrorist enemy".

The Venezuelan opposition said in a statement on X that it had no official comment on the events.

The overnight attack began at about 2 a.m. (0600 GMT), according to Reuters witnesses, who saw blasts, aircraft and black smoke across Caracas for roughly 90 minutes. Video verified by Reuters showed multiple explosions illuminating the night sky, followed by loud blasts. The attack left the southern area of the city, near a major military base, without electricity.

"I couldn’t believe it. I saw it first on social media and then on television. Now, I want to know what will come next," said Nancy Pérez, a 74-year-old woman who went out to a bakery near her home in Valencia, central Venezuela.

One eyewitness video, authenticated by Reuters, captured fire and smoke rising above the Port of La Guaira. The location was confirmed by the port layout, road dividers and buildings, which matched file and satellite imagery.

Other verified videos captured explosions and smoke at the Generalissimo Francisco de Miranda Air Base in eastern Caracas.

Flight radar trackers on Saturday morning showed the airspace over Venezuela was completely empty.

Carmen Marquez, 50, who lives in the east of the capital, said she went to her roof and could hear planes at different altitudes, though she could not see them.

"Flare-like lights were crossing the sky and then explosions could be heard. We're worried about what's coming next. We don't know anything from the government, only what the state television says," she said.</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 12:40:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/6A5FEBSE3VPS5OZ2EMWEW7RRBI.jpg?auth=b7026e0bd3b4472ed500b013e6a02158ec412463da39e7f55f0530ee5fc6a0bb&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UK's Starmer says Britain was not involved in US strikes on Venezuela</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/uks-starmer-says-britain-was-not-involved-us-strikes-venezuela-2026-01-03/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Britain was not involved in the United States' strikes on Venezuela on Saturday and that it was important to uphold international law, and that he wanted to speak to U.S. President Donald Trump and find out exactly what had happened.

Trump said in a post on social media early on Saturday that U.S. forces had captured Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro and removed him from the country while Venezuela's Vice President Delcy Rodriguez said she did not know Maduro's location or if he was still alive.

Asked if he condemned the U.S. action like the leaders of Britain's left-leaning Liberal Democrat and Green parties, who both called it unlawful, Starmer said he first wanted to understand exactly what had happened.

"It's obviously a fast-moving situation and we need to establish all the facts," he said in a statement to British broadcasters.

"I want to speak to President Trump. I want to speak to allies. I can be absolutely clear that we were not involved ... and I always say and believe we should all uphold international law," he added.

Nigel Farage, leader of the Reform UK party which is currently highest in the opinion polls, said he believed the U.S. actions broke international law "but if they make China and Russia think twice, it may be a good thing".

Starmer, a former human rights lawyer, also said the foreign ministry was working to ensure the roughly 500 British citizens in Venezuela remained safe.

His rule abruptly ended on Saturday when President Donald Trump announced U.S. forces had captured him and flown him out of the country.

A 63-year-old socialist and the handpicked successor of the late Hugo Chavez, Maduro was long accused by critics both at home and abroad of being a dictator who jailed or persecuted political opponents and repeatedly staged sham elections.

Maduro, a salsa aficionado with a flair for theatrics, often called opposition politicians "fascist demons" and took pride in resisting U.S. pressure against him, even having his invocation to Trump of "yes peace, not war" remixed into an electronica song.

He was sworn in for a third term in January 2025 following a 2024 election that was widely condemned as fraudulent by international observers and the opposition. Thousands of people who protested against the government's declaration of victory were jailed.

Venezuela's opposition, the United States and many other Western countries also considered Maduro's election win in 2018 to be a sham.

His government's repressive measures were highlighted by the awarding of the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize to opposition leader Maria Corina Machado.

After Trump announced last October that he was authorizing CIA operations in the country, Maduro blasted "those demonic powers that aim to sink their claws into Venezuela to steal our oil." Maduro has long denied U.S. accusations of connections to drug smuggling and corruption.

In August, Washington doubled its reward for Maduro's arrest to $50 million over allegations of drug trafficking and links to criminal groups.

Trump ratcheted up the pressure in recent months with a huge build-up of the U.S. military in the southern Caribbean, more than two dozen strikes on vessels allegedly involved in trafficking drugs in the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea, and a ramping up of sanctions.

A U.N. Fact-Finding Mission found last month that the country's Bolivarian National Guard (GNB) committed serious human rights violations and crimes against humanity over more than a decade in targeting political opponents.

Maduro long denied abusing political and human rights, instead describing his government as being at odds with what he views as a decades-long imperialist campaign to topple Chavez's socialist movement and take Venezuela's oil.

He and his government called sanctions by the U.S. and others illegitimate measures that amounted to an "economic war" designed to cripple the country. His supporters hailed him as a hero who stood up to Washington in the tradition of Cuba's Fidel Castro.

Protesters led months of demonstrations in 2017 against Maduro's government, a period marked by accusations of torture, arbitrary arrests and abuse by security forces. Those protests left 125 people dead.

Dozens more died during protests after Maduro's inauguration to his second term in 2019. After the 2024 election, the U.N. found that Maduro's government escalated repressive tactics to crush peaceful protests, with over two dozen dead and 2,400 arrests.

Maduro's rule was marked by an extended economic collapse in the once relatively affluent nation that prompted an exodus of some 7.7 million migrants.

Almost 82% of Venezuelans live in poverty, with 53% in extreme poverty, unable to buy even basic foodstuffs, a U.N. special rapporteur said in 2024 after visiting the country.

Maduro was born into a working-class family on November 23, 1962, son of a trade union leader. He worked as a bus driver during the time army officer Chavez led a failed coup attempt in 1992.

He agitated for Chavez to be released from prison and backed his fervent leftist agenda in an era when socialism was well out of favor.

After Chavez's 1998 election, Maduro won a seat in the legislature and spent years championing his mentor's self-styled revolution against U.S. intervention in Latin America.

Adversaries took swipes at Maduro's working-class roots and portrayed him as a buffoonish cretin who did little more than slavishly repeat Chavez's bombast.

But the criticism made little dent in his meteoric rise: he became president of the National Assembly and later foreign minister. In that role he crisscrossed the globe to help build alliances with other developing countries through oil-financed assistance programs.

Maduro was narrowly elected president after Chavez died from cancer in 2013. But there was a gaping chasm between his own appeal and the legendary charisma of his predecessor.

His rule was quickly plagued by bread lines and product shortages that smacked of Soviet-era collapse, largely due to his unwillingness to unwind lavish Chavez-era subsidies that were unsustainable after the oil boom came to an end.

As inflation soared in 2013, Maduro sent troops to occupy shops that sold home appliances and forced them to sell off their wares at fire-sale prices, helping fuel his popularity in the run-up to a nationwide election for mayors.

In 2018, militants attempted to assassinate him by sending explosives-laden drones over the top of a rally he was addressing on a Caracas avenue, leading him to reduce his spontaneous public appearances and limit live broadcasts of public events.

Throughout his career, Maduro was often flanked by his wife, Cilia Flores, who held numerous high-ranking positions, including attorney general and chief of parliament, and was often seen as a power broker with as much influence as her spouse.

Trump said on Saturday Flores was also captured and flown out of the country.</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 14:19:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CU653BXW3BNXHPXQGSPQEVJ7SA.jpg?auth=a0df28f27bccaa3c1e37ef8d9f19ee858950aea3967783160cd0b04c95669f84&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Swiss prosecutors place bar managers under investigation after deadly blaze</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/swiss-prosecutors-place-bar-managers-under-investigation-after-deadly-blaze-2026-01-03/</link><description>VIENNA, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Swiss prosecutors said on Saturday they have placed under criminal investigation the two managers of a bar where a blaze on New Year's Day killed at least 40 people.

Zelenskiy called on Ukrainian lawmakers to support Shmyhal, a former prime minister, as the new energy minister, saying his experience was vital to ensure stability in the power sector amid intensifying Russian attacks.

"It is crucial that, after each Russian strike, we can quickly restore what has been destroyed, and that the growth of Ukraine’s energy sector remains stable and sufficient to meet the country’s needs," Zelenskiy said, posting a picture of him meeting Shmyhal in the presidential office on Telegram.

Russia has pounded Ukraine's energy sector with drones and missiles for consecutive winters since the war began nearly four years ago. In recent months, Moscow has again intensified its strikes on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, forcing long blackouts across the country during critical winter months.

Shmyhal, 50, is one of the most experienced government officials in Ukraine, praised by analysts for his skills to maintain economic stability and ensure efficient government operations after Russia's invasion in February 2022.

He was Ukraine's longest-serving prime minister, running the government from 2020 until July 2025, when he was appointed defence minister.

Shmyhal's appointment comes as Zelenskiy launched a major shake-up of the Ukrainian defence sector and security forces.

On Friday, Zelenskiy appointed popular military intelligence head Kyrylo Budanov as his chief of staff and also nominated a new defence minister.

The reshuffle of Ukraine's top officials overseeing security forces and crucial defence and energy sectors comes weeks after a major energy sector corruption scandal that caused Ukraine's biggest wartime political crisis, resulting in the dismissal of Zelenskiy's previous head of office. Justice and energy ministers also resigned as a result of the scandal.

Zelenskiy said the changes were needed to make Ukraine more resilient as the country faces a critical moment in its efforts to end the war with Russia.

The government changes come as Ukrainian negotiators press for security guarantees from the United States and European allies as U.S. President Donald Trump pushes both Kyiv and Moscow to find a solution on how to end the war.

National security advisors from 18 countries met in Kyiv on Saturday to discuss the details of security guarantees and economic agreements on Ukraine's post-war recovery.

Ukraine’s parliament must approve Zelenskiy’s nominations of energy and defence ministers.</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 15:20:39 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/FQ7OV3AFQFJKFIAUNBISE2TNOE.jpg?auth=ae41b9c934f0378af22a83485e994d2e94a7cd245b1aeef6bd1fc7b25c6e47ae&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuela vice president Rodriguez in Russia, four sources say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/venezuela-vice-president-rodriguez-russia-four-sources-say-2026-01-03/</link><description>Jan 3 (Reuters) - Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodriguez is in Russia, four sources familiar with her movements said on Saturday, after President Donald Trump said President Nicolas Maduro had been seized by U.S. forces after an attack on the country.

"These acts represent a grave affront to Venezuela's sovereignty and yet another extremely dangerous precedent for the entire international community," Lula said in a post on X.

Lula also called for a "vigorous" response from the United Nations, adding that Brazil remains open to promoting dialogue and cooperation.

Earlier on Saturday, the U.S. attacked Venezuela and deposed Maduro, President Donald Trump said, in Washington's most direct intervention in Latin America since the 1989 invasion of Panama.

Lula had previously said that an armed intervention in Venezuela would be a "humanitarian catastrophe" , and has repeatedly offered for Brazil to mediate disputes between the countries.

Brazilian officials were holding an emergency cabinet meeting to discuss the situation in Venezuela, the country's foreign ministry told Reuters, while noting that Foreign Minister Mauro Vieira had spoken with his Venezuelan counterpart on Saturday. It did not provide further details.

The head of Brazil's Federal Police also said Venezuela had closed its border with the country, one of the main crossing points for Venezuelan refugees in the region and where Brazil has run operations to assist them since 2018.

After a brief closure, the border was reopened, Roraima state Governor Antonio Denarium told Reuters. Roraima is one of two Brazilian states - along with Amazonas - to share borders with Venezuela and receives around 70% of all Venezuelan refugees that arrive in Brazil, the governor said.

There were no official reports of a higher influx of refugees at the border ahead of its closing due to the military escalation in Venezuela.</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 15:20:47 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/YIDKLLGQXFL2TFEFUPZEUCZJOQ.jpg?auth=ea5f5068d656a71bf5f6201014a91a6146da6ceb349d500e2225f4148292c1a3&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Inside Venezuela’s oil industry: World’s largest oil reserves, failing infrastructure</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260103-world-largest-oil-reserves-failing-infrastructure-inside-venezuela-oil-industry</link><description>⁠The ‍United ​States is ⁠going to be "very strongly involved" in Venezuela 's ​oil ‍industry in the ​wake of the operation to ​capture Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro , President Donald Trump told Fox News ‍on Saturday.

"We have ​the greatest oil companies in the ‌world, the biggest, the greatest, ‍and we're going to be very much involved.

Here's what we know about Venezuela’s oil industry.

Venezuela holds the world’s largest oil reserves – about 303 billion barrels, or 17% of global reserves – surpassing OPEC+ leader Saudi Arabia , according to the London-based Energy Institute. Most of its reserves are heavy oil in the Orinoco Belt, making production costly, though technically straightforward, according to the US Energy Department.

Despite its vast reserves, Venezuela’s crude output remains far below capacity due to mismanagement, underinvestment, and sanctions. Production, which once peaked at 3.5 million barrels per day in the 1970s (over 7% of global output), fell below 2 million bpd during the 2010s and averaged around 1.1 million bpd last year.

Analysts note that any regime change could eventually boost production if sanctions are lifted and foreign investment returns. However, historical precedents in Libya and Iraq suggest recovery is unlikely to be rapid.

Venezuela nationalised its oil sector in the 1970s, creating Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA). In the 1990s, it briefly opened up to foreign investment, but under Hugo Chavez from 1999 onward, PDVSA was required to maintain majority ownership in all projects. The state company partnered with firms including Chevron, China National Petroleum Corporation, ENI, Total, and Russia’s Rosneft to boost production.

The United States was formerly Venezuela’s main oil buyer, but sanctions shifted the main market to China over the past decade. Exports halted entirely after the Trump administration’s blockade on vessels entering or leaving Venezuela in December 2025. PDVSA also owns significant refining capacity abroad, including CITGO in the US, though creditors are contesting control through long-standing legal cases in American courts.</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 15:21:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/378d7240-e8b2-11f0-9359-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25355780619234.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Condemnation and applause in Latin America</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/condemnation-applause-latin-america-after-us-seizes-venezuelas-maduro-2026-01-03/</link><description>SANTIAGO/SAO PAULO, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Latin American leaders were divided between condemnation and jubilation in the wake of a surprise attack on Venezuela early on Saturday that U.S. President Donald Trump said resulted in the capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro.

While much of the region has long been wary of a return to U.S. interventions throughout the 20th century that helped install authoritarian governments from Chile to Honduras, Maduro - who presided over his country’s social and economic collapse - was an increasingly unpopular and isolated leader.

Many Latin American countries have also experienced a shift in recent elections to more right-leaning governments, many of whose leaders view the U.S.-backed military regimes of the last century as necessary bulwarks against socialism.

In a sign of the economic pain faced under Maduro, nearly 8 million Venezuelans have fled the country since 2018, with 85% of them migrating to neighbors in Latin America and the Caribbean, according to the UN's International Organization for Migration.

Many countries in the region have experienced surges in organized crime in recent years and the specter of Venezuela's Tren de Aragua gang has loomed large over voters' minds, leading to a rise in politicians vowing to crack down on crime and immigration.

While few leaders will shed serious tears about Maduro's ousting, governments in the region will react along political lines, said Steven Levitsky, a professor and director of Harvard's David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies.

"I think you'll see right-wing governments applaud because that's what they do. You'll see left-wing governments criticize because how could they not?" Levitsky said.

The strongest condemnation of the attack came in a string of posts on X from neighboring Colombia's President Gustavo Petro, a leftist who has frequently clashed with Trump and has also been threatened by the U.S. president.

“The Colombian government rejects the aggression against the sovereignty of Venezuela and Latin America,” Petro said in one message, while calling for an immediate meeting of the United Nations Security Council, of which Colombia is a member.

His Brazilian counterpart, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, echoed Petro's comments.

“The bombings on Venezuela’s territory and the capture of its president cross an unacceptable line,” Lula said in a statement.

Chile’s outgoing President Gabriel Boric condemned the attack but President-elect Jose Antonio Kast, who rose to power by promising to crack down on migration and crime, said in a post on X that Maduro's arrest was great news for the region.

"Now begins a greater task. The governments of Latin America must ensure that the entire apparatus of the regime abandons power and is held accountable," Kast, who will be sworn in on March 11, said.

Argentina’s President Javier Milei, Trump’s closest ally in the region, has long criticized Maduro and posted videos and statements on X in favor of the attack.

In Ecuador, right-wing President Daniel Noboa said Venezuelans opposed to Maduro and his political godfather Hugo Chavez have an ally in Ecuador.

“All the criminal narco-Chavistas will have their moment,” Noboa said on X. “Their structure will finally collapse across the continent.”

Protests both in favor and against the strikes in Venezuela have been scheduled in Buenos Aires and other cities across the region.

The capture of Maduro by U.S. forces “is one of the most momentous decisions in the history of U.S.-Latin America relations,” said Brian Winter, editor-in-chief of Americas Quarterly and vice president of policy at Americas Society/Council of the Americas.

“The operation confirms return of Washington as policeman in its 'sphere of influence,' an idea that defined much of 19th and 20th centuries but had faded since (the) end of the Cold War,” Winter said in a post on LinkedIn.</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 16:26:03 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WX7XTYXSMROINF3QZVX3BIMS6Q.jpg?auth=328f5341af57b25392cb7b8ea09c7cb824aac3a631cb31650272f44e8fdbf091&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuela diaspora celebrates Maduro's deposition, wonders what's next</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/venezuela-diaspora-celebrates-maduros-deposition-wonders-whats-next-2026-01-03/</link><description>Jan 3 (Reuters) - Venezuelan migrants around the world erupted in celebration on Saturday following the U.S.-led deposition of President Nicolas Maduro, whose government prompted one of the largest migration crises in recent history.

Chants celebrating Maduro's capture were heard in the streets of Chile's capital, where Venezuelans gathered to share their joy.

"We are free. We are all happy that the dictatorship has fallen and that we have a free country," said Khaty Yanez, a Venezuelan woman who has spent the last seven years in Chile.

"My joy is too big," her compatriot Jose Gregorio said. "After so many years, after so many struggles, after so much work, today is the day. Today is the day of freedom."

Since 2014, some 7.7 million Venezuelans or 20% of the population have left the country unable to afford food or seeking better opportunities abroad, according to the U.N. International Organization for Migration , opens new tab .

Neighboring Colombia has received the largest share of the diaspora, around 2.8 million, followed by 1.7 million in Peru, according to the R4V platform, a group of regional NGOs assisting migrants and refugees from Venezuela set up by the U.N. migration agency.

For years, the U.S. was a haven for Venezuelans but in President Donald Trump's second term many are being branded criminals and forced to seek refuge elsewhere .

After the initial joy, doubts about Venezuela's future also set in, as Venezuelans abroad wonder what the future holds for their country and its citizens.

Andres Losada, who has lived in Spain for three years and is among the 400,000 Venezuelans residing in the country according to official data, said he is struggling between worry and joy about the situation in Venezuela.

"Although what people are going through in Caracas is tough, I believe that beyond that there is a light that will lead us to freedom," he added.

Venezuelan security forces patrolled largely empty streets at dawn in the capital, Caracas, on Saturday. Most residents stayed home, devouring the latest information on their phones, while some went to stock up on groceries in case they need to hunker down for a prolonged period.

Speaking to a local TV station in Spain, Agustin Rodriguez, the vice president of a Venezuelan cultural association, expressed concern about the strikes but said they "may be necessary to find a way out for the country in which there can be a return to power alternation, where there can be a future."</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 16:26:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7PLP7FO3E5LLTPJ3L7KPKKGURY.jpg?auth=8e1226105a34031b75a85367aebda05b844d200b746508028a665e1d34a2269f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuelan opposition activists in Madrid warily cheer Maduro capture</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/venezuelan-opposition-activists-madrid-warily-cheer-maduro-capture-2026-01-03/</link><description>MADRID, Jan 3 (Reuters) - In Madrid, Venezuelan opposition activists and others who follow the situation in their homeland were glued to TV and social media on Saturday, amazed by news of Nicolas Maduro's capture by U.S. forces .

But they also wondered what comes next.

U.S. President Donald Trump, who had been applying intense pressure on Maduro for months, announced that U.S. forces had captured Maduro and flown him out of the country, saying later that the Venezuelan leader and his wife would be taken to New York.

Spain is home to the largest Venezuelan migrant population outside Latin America and the U.S., and they include senior opposition figures including Edmundo Gonzalez and Leopoldo Lopez.

"We are all happy," one opposition figure told Reuters by WhatsApp. "But we must ensure that the transition is orderly, peaceful and respectful," said the person, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the situation.

This person rejected the idea that Vice President Delcy Rodriguez might now take power, saying that the opposition leaders who won past elections before being blocked by Maduro were the rightful heirs to the Venezuelan presidency.

Venezuela's opposition, the United States and many other Western countries considered Maduro's election wins in 2018 and 2024 to be fraudulent.

"The Venezuelan people voted massively for Edmundo (Gonzalez) and Maria Corina Machado . Edmundo is the president-elect with constitutional legitimacy," the person said, referring to the July 2024 election and adding this ruled out Rodriguez.

Manuel Garcia, a former opposition leader and lawmaker who left Venezuela after the disputed 2024 election, said the speed of Maduro's removal demonstrated his government did not have the "military capacity they have been boasting about".

"Today marks the beginning of a new stage that will culminate in the consolidation of the transition led by María Corina and President Edmundo Gonzalez," Garcia said.

José Miguel Calvillo, an international affairs and migration professor at Madrid's Complutense University, said it was "very likely" that the U.S. had already had some back-channel discussions with elements of the Venezuelan government and the military to arrange a transition.

"If it is confirmed that the intervention of the United States has been supported by the internal government, a transitional government will be expected to include major players from the current opposition," he said.

"What is desirable for both Venezuela and the U.S. is that there will not be a radical break with the current government but rather a moderate transition."

Manuel Muñiz, chancellor of Madrid's private IE Business School, said the coming days would test the strength both of the opposition and the Venezuelan government beyond just Maduro.

"The Venezuelan regime is quite granular and present throughout Venezuelan society," he said. "There are a number of avenues in front of us, and not all of them lead to open, peaceful elections and a transition of power in Venezuela. There are some that lead to violence, disorder and instability."

Jimena Blanco, chief analyst for risk consultancy Verisk Maplecroft, said there were divergent views in the opposition about whether Machado or Gonzalez should take the presidency.

Machado was barred from running in the 2024 presidential election, despite having won the opposition's primary by a landslide, and her ally Edmundo Gonzalez took her place as the main opposition candidate.

Machado won the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize for her work promoting democracy.

Blanco said that while Gonzalez may be the constitutionally elected president, Machado is credited with unifying the opposition, creating the conditions for his election and risking her life staying in Venezuela to maintain opposition momentum.

"There are others that argue that Edmundo Gonzalez is elected president and he should take office," she said.

Scenarios discussed in opposition circles included a military junta of second or third tier armed forces leaders overseeing a civilian cabinet of opposition leaders that did not include Machado, for her to then run in elections.

"For her it would be very damaging if she was to be seen as to be placed in power rather than ascending to power through democratic channels she has tried to promote," Blanco said.

In the Canary Islands, a Spanish archipelago where many Venezuelans live, Agustín Rodríguez, vice president of the Canarian-Venezuelan Union migrant support network, said he had mixed feelings about Saturday's events.

But he hoped it meant the third of Venezuela's population that lives in exile - something he described as the country's "displaced heart" - could return.

Some 7.7 million Venezuelans left the country in recent years.

"No one likes to see these kinds of fireworks, but they may be necessary to find a way out for the country in which there can be a return to power alternation, there can be a future, people can return to their country," he said.</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 16:26:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LN33CFML4JLY7AICNXPHCIMRF4.jpg?auth=69ead17414fbb589dadee50bf4af6a4356a56562627b8ca0387df20307382685&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Disbelief as fire exploded inside Swiss bar: 'We thought it was a joke'</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/disbelief-fire-exploded-inside-swiss-bar-we-thought-it-was-joke-2026-01-03/</link><description>CRANS-MONTANA, Switzerland, Jan 3 (Reuters) - When a devastating fire broke out in the Swiss ski resort of Crans-Montana at around 1:30 a.m. on Thursday, some New Year’s revellers seemed unsure at first whether to take it seriously.

Le Constellation, a two-storey bar with a glass-enclosed terrace, was still packed with partygoers, many of them teenagers.

Witnesses reported seeing a staff member, who was sitting on the shoulders of a colleague, carrying bottles with fizzing candle-style sparklers in the basement section shortly before the ceiling caught fire.

A video shared on social media and verified by Reuters shows a young man using his shirt to try to beat back flames that are beginning to form in the ceiling as others record the scene on their phones. Loud music plays in the background.

"We thought it was a joke, or that it wasn't necessarily serious," said Axel Clavier, a teenager who was in the basement with friends when the fire started.

Moments later, there was a huge cloud of black smoke, Clavier told the Swiss news agency Keystone. "We couldn't breathe anymore."

It all happened in seconds, said Julia, a 19-year-old from the Swiss city of Lausanne who did not want to give her last name. Panic ensued.

"People just suddenly started running and walking on top of each other," she told Reuters, fighting back tears. "There was an enormous crowd, and this really small entrance, and it was hard to escape."

She was on the ground floor and escaped with an injured foot. A friend, who was with her, got caught in the flames that tore through from the basement and ended up in hospital with severe burns, she said.

At least 40 people were killed and 119 injured in the inferno, said Swiss officials in the southwestern canton of Valais, an "unprecedented" toll in a resort known for panoramic Alpine views and sporting attractions like skiing and golf.

Initial investigations suggest the blaze started when the so-called fountain candles attached to champagne bottles got too close to the ceiling , local prosecutor Beatrice Pilloud told a news conference on Friday. "From there, a rapid, very rapid and widespread conflagration ensued."

Questions have also arisen about a foam material that may have been used to soundproof the ceiling of the basement where revellers danced to rap music.

The investigation will focus on renovations that were made to the bar and the materials used, the fire extinguishing systems and escape routes, as well as the number of people in the building when the blaze started, she said.

Swiss prosecutors said on Saturday they have placed the bar's two managers under investigation on suspicion of homicide by negligence and other crimes. Reuters could not immediately reach them for comment.

The Swiss newspaper Tribune de Geneve quoted one of the owners, Jacques Moretti, as saying the bar had been inspected three times in the past 10 years, and "everything was done according to the rules."

Reuters interviewed more than a dozen witnesses, including three survivors, and reviewed multiple videos and pictures to piece together what unfolded in the early hours of New Year's Day.

Known locally as "Le Constel", the bar was a popular evening hangout for foreign students and local teenagers, who in Switzerland are allowed to buy beer and wine from the age of 16.

"It's a bar where we'd go for our first outings when we were 16 or 17," said 21-year-old Samuel Rapp, who was at a Mexican restaurant next door when the fire broke out. "We'd go there because you can play pool; we'd play darts."

The night of the fire, witnesses described lines out the door with some people turned away because they had not booked tables.

One young survivor, who gave his name only as Nathan, said the display with the sparklers seemed to be a regular attraction.
"We were there the night before, and there was a table next to us that had the same show," he told Keystone.

A promotional video for the bar also showed people carrying bottles of champagne with fizzing sparklers at the venue.

Moretti acquired the bar with his wife in 2015, Swiss company records show. It was substantially refurbished since then, according to witness accounts and local media reports at the time.

Witnesses described a single stairwell leading from the basement to the enclosed terrace, with a small door at the end, where desperate people trying to escape from both floors became trapped. It was not immediately clear whether there were other emergency exits.

Laetitia Place, 17, said she had just entered the basement area expecting to meet friends when the fire exploded and raced across the ceiling.

"I saw a friend of mine, and then we saw the fire, and we went straight back up," she told Reuters.

"The first stairs are pretty easy to get through since they're wide," she said. "But after that, there's the small door where everyone was pushing, and so we all fell. We were piled on top of each other; some people were burning, and some were dead next to us."

Clavier, who was also in the basement, said he got blocked by a mass of people. He described pushing over a table so he could shield behind it from the heat as he waited for the crowd to thin out.

"We couldn't see anything at all, as there was no light," he told reporters on Friday. "There was one door of 1.5 meters (4.9 ft) wide for some two or three hundred people to get out. The people fell, and they suffocated."

Others described seeing people trapped inside banging on the reinforced glass until it yielded. Clavier said he managed to break out after striking a window with a table and kicking it.

Emergency responders arrived at the scene in minutes, police said, but the fire spread so quickly that for many, it was too late. Improvised triage centres were set up in nearby cafes.

"We saw people burnt without any hair, without clothes because they were so burnt," said Jérémy Halna, a 22-year-old student who was visiting from France and said he helped some of those emerging from the flames into the freezing night.

A DEADLY 'FLASHOVER'
Many in the town described an agonising search for friends lost in the scramble and children who never returned from their night out.

The fire burned victims so severely that investigators said they would need days to identify the bodies.

"I don’t know if he is even recognisable," said Laetitia Brodard-Sitre, whose 16-year-old son, Arthur, sent her a New Year's text message from Le Constellation about an hour before the fire started.

"All that I want is to find my son and be close to him, whether he be alive or dead," she said.

Fire safety experts interviewed by Reuters said the evidence points to a familiar scenario: blazes ignited by indoor fireworks and other pyrotechnics have claimed hundreds of lives at bars and nightclubs.

"Nightclubs are not fire-safety friendly places," said Milad Haghani, associate professor of urban resilience and mobility at the University of Melbourne. He noted the danger of flammable soundproofing insulation, commonly found in such disasters.

When flammable surfaces ignite in confined spaces, a so-called "flashover" can occur, where nearly everything in a room explodes into flames at once.

"The fire will look for oxygen in order to grow; that's its physical mechanism," said Olivier Burnier, a partner in Swiss fire safety consultancy Fire Safety &amp; Engineering SA. "That's why we had what people described as an explosion."

Under Swiss law, any venue holding more than 100 people must have at least two 90-centimetre (35.4-inch) exits, he said. For those holding over 200, one exit must be 90 centimetres and the other at least 120 centimetres.

Pilloud, the prosecutor, said investigators would be looking into the safety measures at the bar, including exits and fire extinguishers.

The action came as a surprise, but according to sources familiar with the matter, planning for one of the most complex U.S. operations in recent memory had been in the works for some time and included detailed rehearsals.

Elite U.S. troops, including the Army's Delta Force, created an exact replica of Maduro's safe house and practiced how they would enter the strongly fortified residence.

The CIA had a small team on the ground starting in August who were able to provide insight into Maduro's pattern of life that made grabbing him seamless, according to one source familiar with the matter.

Two other sources told Reuters the intelligence agency also had an asset close to Maduro who would monitor his movements and was poised to pinpoint his exact location as the operation unfolded.

With the pieces in place, Trump approved the operation four days ago, but military and intelligence planners suggested he wait for better weather and less cloud cover.

In the early hours of Saturday, the mission to capture Maduro started. Trump, surrounded by his advisers at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, watched a live stream of the operation.

How the hours-long operation unfolded is based on interviews with four sources familiar with the matter and details Trump himself has revealed.

"I've done some pretty good ones, but I've never seen anything like this," Trump said on Fox News just hours after the mission was completed.

The Pentagon has overseen a massive military build up of forces in the Caribbean, sending an aircraft carrier, 11 warships and more than a dozen F-35 aircraft. In total, more than 15,000 troops have poured into the region for what U.S. officials have long described as anti-drug operations.

According to one of the sources, Trump senior aide Stephen Miller, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and CIA Director John Ratcliffe formed a core team working on the issue for months with regular - sometimes daily - meetings and phone calls. They often also met with the president.

Late on Friday night and into early Saturday, Trump and his advisers huddled as a number of U.S. aircraft took off and carried out strikes against targets inside and close to Caracas, including air defense systems, according to a U.S. military official.

Trump told Fox News Channel's "Fox &amp; Friends" the number of U.S. aircraft involved was "massive".

"We had a fighter jet for every possible situation," Trump said.

Sources have told Reuters that in addition to fighter jets, the Pentagon had also quietly moved into the region refueling air tankers, drones and aircraft specializing in electronic jamming.

U.S. officials told Reuters that the airstrikes hit military targets. Images taken by Reuters at the La Carlota air base in Caracas showed charred military vehicles from a Venezuelan anti-aircraft unit.

With the strikes taking place, U.S. Special Forces made their way into Caracas heavily armed, including with a blow torch in case they had to cut through steel doors at Maduro's location. Officials did not say how the troops entered the city, but video posted on social media by residents showed a convoy of helicopters flying over Caracas at a low altitude.

Once they reached Maduro's safe house the troops, along with FBI agents, made their way into the residence, which Trump described as a "very highly guarded... fortress."

"They just broke in, and they broke into places that were not really able to be broke into, you know, steel doors that were put there for just this reason," Trump said. "They got taken out in a matter of seconds."

It is unclear how U.S. forces were able to capture Maduro and his wife once they entered the house, but Trump said the Venezuelan leader had unsuccessfully tried to get to a safe room.

"He was trying to get into it, but he got bum rushed so fast that he didn't get into that," Trump said.

Some U.S. forces were hit, Trump said, but none were killed.

As the operation unfolded, Rubio started to inform lawmakers that it was underway. The notifications only began after the operation started and not before, as is customary for key lawmakers who play an oversight role, officials told Reuters.

Little is yet known about Maduro's extraction from Caracas. Trump said that one helicopter was hit "pretty hard" but was able to make it back.

The Venezuelan leader was flown to the USS Iwo Jima, an amphibious assault ship, and will be transferred to New York to stand trial.</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 17:18:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/6A5FEBSE3VPS5OZ2EMWEW7RRBI.jpg?auth=b7026e0bd3b4472ed500b013e6a02158ec412463da39e7f55f0530ee5fc6a0bb&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Germany urges political solution for Venezuela crisis</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/germany-urges-political-solution-venezuela-crisis-2026-01-03/</link><description>FRANKFURT, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Germany's foreign ministry on Saturday called for a political solution in Venezuela where the United States attacked and captured leader Nicolas Maduro .

"We call on all involved parties to avoid an escalation of the situation and to seek ways for a political settlement," said a written communication obtained by Reuters after a crisis team had met at the ministry.

"International law has to be respected ... Venezuelans deserve a peaceful and democratic future," it added.

The ministry said it was in close contact with the embassy in Caracas and a travel warning had been issued.

Its note echoed statements by both the European Union's top diplomat Kaja Kallas, who also has repeatedly said that Maduro "lacks legitimacy," and from EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who demanded the observance of international law.

German politicians and commentators on Saturday took mixed stances, with some applauding Maduro's removal and others condemning what they called the abandonment of the rules-based order of the post-1945 Western world.</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 17:18:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/2P62CJLHTRIHXCC3MEH6BUVZCA.jpg?auth=a3e8387ff99d0ecf233c4b4d8c6026e429e6d48f26a26efc884d2b805c5575a4&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Who is Delcy Rodriguez, the vice president who could replace Venezuela's Maduro?</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/who-is-delcy-rodriguez-vice-president-who-could-replace-venezuelas-maduro-2026-01-03/</link><description>Buenos Aires, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Following are some facts about Venezuelan vice president Delcy Rodriguez, who could take charge of the government after U.S. President Donald Trump said on Saturday that President Nicolas Maduro had been captured by U.S. forces.

Security Council meeting.

Venezuela and Colombia, backed by Russia and China, have asked for the 15-member Security Council to meet, diplomats said, after the U.S. attacked Venezuela and deposed its long-serving autocratic President Nicolas Maduro. The meeting has not yet been scheduled.

"These developments constitute a dangerous precedent," Guterres' spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said in a statement. "The Secretary-General continues to emphasize the importance of full respect - by all - of international law, including the UN Charter. He’s deeply concerned that the rules of international law have not been respected."

The U.N. Security Council has met twice - in October and December - over the escalating tensions between the United States and Venezuela.

"The deadly and treacherous U.S. military attack is being carried out against a country that is at peace," Venezuela's U.N. Ambassador Samuel Moncada wrote to the Security Council on Saturday, warning that it "has serious implications for regional and international peace and security."

He said the U.S. had violated the founding U.N. Charter, which states: "
 All members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state."

U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has for months targeted suspected drug trafficking boats off the Venezuelan coast and the Pacific coast of Latin America. The U.S. ramped up its military presence in the region and announced a blockade of all vessels subject to U.S. sanctions, last month intercepting two tankers loaded with Venezuelan crude.

In October, the U.S. justified its action as consistent with Article 51 of the founding U.N. Charter, which requires the Security Council to be immediately informed of any action states take in self-defense against armed attack.

"This is not regime change this is justice," U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Mike Waltz posted on X on Saturday. "Maduro was an indicted, illegitimate dictator that led a declared Narco-terrorism organization responsible for killing American citizens."</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 17:18:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CORQYBRJS5KXPMHLQ3NPWUMEKQ.jpg?auth=e671a3fd8fdd275a183fa4eba36474ad031a796008a7e9dd042d308952b6dbb0&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump signals US may expand focus to Cuba amid Venezuela operation</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/trump-signals-us-may-expand-focus-cuba-amid-venezuela-operation-2026-01-03/</link><description>PALM BEACH, Florida, Jan 3 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday indicated that Cuba could become a topic of discussion as part of broader U.S. policy in the region, highlighting the potential for Washington to expand its focus beyond Venezuela amid rising tensions in Latin America.</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 17:41:07 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/YOU7WQN75RKD5KUWIWHPVRTGTE.jpg?auth=73963609b22e771730813f0691cf52e276341ac3262d68108e50d1101d9a1837&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump says US oil companies will spend billions in Venezuela</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/trump-says-us-oil-companies-will-spend-billions-venezuela-2026-01-03/</link><description>PALM BEACH, Florida, Jan 3 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said that American oil companies were prepared to enter Venezuela and invest to restore production in the South American country, an announcement that came just hours after Nicolás Maduro was captured and removed by U.S. forces.

"We’re going to have our very large U.S. oil companies, the biggest anywhere in the world, go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure, oil infrastructure, and start making money for the country," Trump said on Saturday.

While Chevron is the only American major with current operations in Venezuela, Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) , opens new tab and ConocoPhillips (COP.N) , opens new tab , among others, have storied histories in the country. The American Petroleum Institute, the largest U.S. oil trade group, said on Saturday it was monitoring the emerging situation.

“We’re closely watching developments involving Venezuela, including the potential implications for global energy markets,” an API spokesperson told Reuters.

Chevron, which exports around 150,000 bpd of crude from Venezuela to the U.S. Gulf Coast, said it is focused on the safety and wellbeing of its employees, in addition to the integrity of its assets.

"We continue to operate in full compliance with all relevant laws and regulations,” a Chevron spokesperson said in an emailed response to questions.

Top oilfield service companies SLB (SLB.N) , opens new tab , Baker Hughes (BKR.O) , opens new tab , Halliburton (HAL.N) , opens new tab and Weatherford (WFRD.O) , opens new tab did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Exxon and Conoco did not immediately respond to questions from Reuters.

Trump's plans to have large U.S. oil companies enter Venezuela and get "oil flowing" will be hindered by lack of infrastructure that will require many years and heavy investment, analysts said. "There are still many questions that need to be answered about the state of the Venezuelan oil industry, but it is clear that it will take tens of billions of dollars to turn that industry around," said Peter McNally, Global Head of Sector Analysts at Third Bridge, adding that it could take at least a decade of Western oil majors committing to the country.

A U.S. embargo on all Venezuelan oil, meanwhile, remains in full effect, Trump said. He told reporters that the U.S. military forces would remain in position until U.S. demands had been fully met.

"The American armada remains poised in position, and the U.S. retains all military options until United States demands have been fully met and fully satisfied," he said.</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 18:52:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/UP4TPIQUTRL4RF4JXJLD34NSLY.jpg?auth=f84af9634821dff498b848377234199b8a1d4376712d6204db5e58bdd2dc17f9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Democratic lawmakers say they were misled on Venezuela</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/democratic-lawmakers-say-they-were-misled-venezuela-2026-01-03/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Democratic members of the U.S. Congress said on Saturday that senior officials of President Donald Trump's administration had misled them during recent briefings about plans for Venezuela by insisting they were not planning regime change in Caracas.

The comments came after the U.S. attacked Venezuela and deposed its long-serving President Nicolas Maduro in an overnight operation, in Washington's most direct intervention in Latin America since the 1989 invasion of Panama.

In briefings in November and December by officials including Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, lawmakers said they were told repeatedly that there were no plans for a land invasion inside Venezuela and that the administration was not focused on regime change.

"Because the President and his Cabinet repeatedly denied any intention of conducting regime change in Venezuela when briefing Congress, we are left with no understanding of how the Administration is preparing to mitigate risks to the U.S. and we have no information regarding a long-term strategy following today’s extraordinary escalation," Senator Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in a statement on Saturday.

"Instead, the Administration consistently misled the American people and their elected representatives by offering three differing and contradictory explanations for its actions," Shaheen said.

The Pentagon, State Department and White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Several lawmakers said they felt they had been lied to.

"The Administration lied to Congress and launched an illegal war for regime change and oil," Democratic Representative Don Beyer of Virginia said on X. Beyer's district includes the Pentagon, just across the river from Washington.

At a news conference on Saturday, Trump said Congress had not been kept fully informed on the Venezuela plans because of concerns that word about his plans would get out. "Congress does have a tendency to leak," Trump told reporters.

Members of Congress, including some of Trump's fellow Republicans as well as Democrats, had been clamoring for more information about his strategy toward the oil-rich South American nation since he began a military build-up in the southern Caribbean and ordered strikes on boats he said were carrying drugs.

Democrats had emerged from those meetings dissatisfied. "I asked them what their strategy is, and what they were doing, and again, did not get satisfying answers at all," Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York told reporters at the time.

Democratic Representative Seth Moulton of Massachusetts said on CNN: "When we had briefings on Venezuela, we asked, 'Are you going to invade the country?' We were told no. 'Do you plan to put troops on the ground?' We were told no. 'Do you intend regime change in Venezuela?' We were told no. So in a sense, we have been briefed, we've just been completely lied to."

Lawmakers said they were not briefed before the operation, although Rubio had been calling members of Congress on Saturday morning after it took place. There were no briefings for lawmakers scheduled by Saturday afternoon, although Republican congressional leaders said they hoped to arrange some after lawmakers return to Washington on January 5 following their year-end recess.

Most Republicans praised Trump's action.

Senate Republican Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota said: "President Trump’s decisive action to disrupt the unacceptable status quo and apprehend Maduro, through the execution of a valid Department of Justice warrant, is an important first step to bring him to justice for the drug crimes for which he has been indicted in the United States."

Members of Congress have long accused presidents from both parties of seeking to sidestep the Constitution's requirement that Congress, not the president, approve anything other than brief and limited foreign military action.

On Venezuela, Democratic lawmakers and some Republicans had said even before Saturday's overnight action that they were worried that Trump was conducting a four-month-long military campaign without congressional authorization.</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 19:16:10 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/QG23ESPCYRJVRFBIVIFUWRG6DI.jpg?auth=5dded4c2a2ff1980b4e28d8755b259916dae0752d57009bcfe71a4c6db2d1293&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Spain will not recognize US intervention in Venezuela, PM says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/spain-will-not-recognize-us-intervention-venezuela-pm-says-2026-01-03/</link><description>Jan 3 - Spain will not recognize a U.S. intervention in Venezuela that violates international law, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said on Saturday, after U.S. forces captured long-serving Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro in an overnight operation.

"I'm not thrilled with Putin. He's killing too many people," Trump told reporters at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, during a press conference to discuss the overnight U.S. military operation in Venezuela and capture of its President Nicolas Maduro .

Trump said he did not discuss Maduro with Putin when the two leaders spoke by telephone for over two hours on Monday, shortly before the U.S. president met with Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Palm Beach.

"We never spoke about Maduro," Trump said when asked if he and Putin had discussed the Venezuelan leader.

Russia's foreign ministry said on Saturday it was extremely concerned by reports that Maduro and his wife had been removed from the country during "aggressive actions" by the United States, and called for the pair's immediate release.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters that Maduro had rejected multiple chances to flee the country, and some reports suggested weeks ago that he could have headed to Russia or closely allied states.

Trump on Monday initially expressed sympathy for Russian allegations that Ukrainian drones attacked one of Putin's residences. He later appeared more skeptical and shared a New York Post editorial accusing Russia of blocking peace in Ukraine.

The Wall Street Journal later reported that U.S. national security officials had found Ukraine did not target Putin or one of his residences in a drone strike.

Trump has repeatedly expressed frustration about the lack of progress toward ending the war in Ukraine, which began with Russia's invasion in February 2022, focusing heavily on what he calls tens of thousands of troops being killed on both sides.</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 20:23:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/U4TWW4Z6HVOOVFUZ3CW62SPW7U.jpg?auth=85eac5450e31c9556f28ae53548df0918274ffb44f8e6355d9f009f5535908d1&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Cuban president denounces 'state terrorism' against Venezuela</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/cuban-president-denounces-state-terrorism-against-venezuela-2026-01-03/</link><description>HAVANA, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel on Saturday condemned the United States for attacking Venezuela and capturing its president at a rally of thousands of Havana residents in front of the U.S. Embassy in the Cuban capital.

"Cuba condemns and denounces these actions as an act of state terrorism," Diaz-Canel said.

"It is a shocking violation of the norms of international law - the military aggression against a peaceful nation that poses no threat to the United States," he added.

Venezuela supplies around 30% of Cuba's already scarce oil imports in exchange for thousands of medical personnel who work in the South American country.

Analysts agree the loss of the oil would be a devastating blow to Cuba's already shaky power grid and energy supplies.

Meanwhile, thousands of Cubans are worried over the fate of relatives and friends working in Venezuela. Cuba's health ministry tweeted on Saturday they were "well protected."

In an interview U.S. President Donald Trump gave to the New York Post on Saturday, he said he is not considering additional military action against Cuba.

“No, Cuba is going to fall of its own volition. Cuba is doing very poorly,” Trump said.

“Cuba was always very reliant on Venezuela. That’s where they got their money, and they protected Venezuela, but that didn’t work out too well in this case,” the president said.

Cuba is suffering through a six-year crisis which has seen economic growth fall at least 15%, according to the government, causing shortages of basic goods, soaring inflation, crumbling services and widespread power outages.

The government largely blames tougher U.S. sanctions imposed during the first Trump administration, on top of the decades-old trade embargo, for the crisis.</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 21:18:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WN75XUZOS5L6JJ2ODP53R7RLSU.jpg?auth=cc20fd80cbbf736e904dd4c35f119ba45039dd217d9bf641aba79d13eaf5816b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US airlines cancel flights after Caribbean airspace closure</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/us-airlines-cancel-flights-after-caribbean-airspace-closure-2026-01-03/</link><description>Jan 3 (Reuters) - Major U.S. airlines on Saturday canceled hundreds of flights following a military operation in Venezuela that resulted in the capture of President Nicolas Maduro.

His vision for U.S. involvement in Venezuela, sketched out in a midday news conference, left open the possibility of more military action, ongoing involvement in that nation’s politics and oil industry and “boots on the ground.” The term suggests military deployment of the sort that presidents often avoid for fear of provoking domestic political backlash.

"We are going to run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper, and judicious transition,” Trump said.

He gave little sense of how far he was willing to go to gain control of Venezuela, where Maduro's top aides appeared to be still in power.

As recently as his inauguration for a second term last January, Trump told supporters: "We will measure our success not only by the battles we win, but also by the wars that we end, and perhaps most importantly, by the wars we never get into."

Since then, Trump has bombed targets in Syria, Iraq, Iran, Nigeria, Yemen and Somalia, blown up dozens of alleged drug boats in the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean and made veiled threats to invade Greenland and Panama.

The overnight attack on Venezuela was his most aggressive foreign military action yet, striking the capital Caracas and other parts of the country and capturing President Nicolas Maduro and his wife to face drug-trafficking charges in New York.

These developments ran counter to some Republican hopes that the president would focus more on voters' domestic concerns – affordability, health care and the economy.

Trump told the news conference that intervening in Venezuela was in line with his “America First” policy.

“We want to surround ourselves with good neighbors. We want to surround ourself with stability. We want to surround ourself with energy,” he said, referring to Venezuela’s oil reserves.

But the emerging political stakes were captured by a social media post from U.S. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia Republican, who has broken with Trump because of what she said has been his departure from the America First rhetoric of limiting foreign adventures. She is resigning from Congress next week.

“This is what many in MAGA thought they voted to end. Boy were we wrong.”

RISK OF QUAGMIRE

Trump’s ongoing attention to foreign affairs provides fuel for Democrats to criticize Trump ahead of midterm congressional elections in November, when control of both houses of Congress is likely to turn on just a few races across the United States. Republicans narrowly control both right now, giving the president a largely free hand to enact his agenda.

"Let me be clear, Maduro is an illegitimate dictator, but launching military action without congressional authorization, without a federal plan for what comes next, is reckless," Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a call with reporters.

Trump has worked to end several foreign conflicts, including in Ukraine and Gaza, while lobbying for a Nobel Peace Prize. But U.S. military actions tend to draw more public attention and historically have carried more political risk for presidents and their parties.

Polls have shown that, before the attack, the prospect of U.S. military action in Venezuela was unpopular, with roughly one out of five Americans supporting force to depose Maduro, according to a November Reuters/Ipsos survey.

Trump’s top diplomat and national security adviser Marco Rubio called several members of Congress early on Saturday in an effort to blunt opposition to military action.

Mike Lee, a prominent libertarian-leaning senator, initially questioned the administration taking military action without a declaration of war or authorization for the use of military force, but wrote on X he concluded that the operation likely fell within the president's authority after speaking to Rubio.

Republican Representative Thomas Massie, a frequent Trump critic, wrote in a post on X that Trump’s warning of further strikes on Venezuela “Doesn’t seem the least bit consistent” with Rubio’s characterization to Lee. “If this action were constitutionally sound, the Attorney General wouldn’t be tweeting that they’ve arrested the President of a sovereign country and his wife for possessing guns in violation of a 1934 U.S. firearm law,” Massie wrote in a separate post.

For a president who has consistently contrasted himself with the Republican "neoconservatives" of the late 20th century, Trump’s foreign policy has developed striking similarities with that of his predecessors.

In 1983, under former President Ronald Reagan, the U.S. invaded Grenada, claiming that the government at that time was illegitimate, a claim Trump has also made with respect to Maduro.

In 1989, former President George H.W. Bush invaded Panama to depose dictator Manuel Noriega who, like Maduro, was wanted on U.S. drug-trafficking charges. In that case, the U.S. installed Noriega’s replacement.

Elliott Abrams, who served as Venezuela envoy in Trump's first term, said he did not believe the president was running a political risk at home in ousting Maduro and that he “has a lot of latitude as long as American troops are not dying." But he acknowledged: “I don’t know what running Venezuela means.”

"He's done the right thing in removing Maduro," said Abrams, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations think-tank. "The question is whether he will do the right thing in supporting democracy in Venezuela."

Brett Bruen, a former foreign policy adviser in Barack Obama's administration, said the U.S. could now be sucked into overseeing a complex transition process.

“I don’t see any short version of this story,” said Bruen, now head of the Global Situation Room, an international affairs consultancy. “The U.S. will get tangled up in Venezuela but will also have new problems to contend with related to its neighbors.”</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 21:21:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LDBC2HULRVOQJE6HQTJID4AF2A.jpg?auth=f920564494942db91491882699a8f52b233e7acae66e93d654736391b936e0a0&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuela's oil exports paralyzed amid political turmoil, sources say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/venezuelas-oil-exports-paralyzed-amid-political-turmoil-sources-say-2026-01-03/</link><description>Jan 3 (Reuters) - Venezuela's oil exports, which had fallen to a minimum amid U.S. President Donald Trump's announced blockade of all sanctioned tankers going in and out of the country's waters, are now paralyzed as port captains have not received requests to authorize loaded ships to set sail, four sources close to operations said on Saturday.

The paralysis emerges as the U.S. extracted President Nicolas Maduro and his wife from capital Caracas and announced it will oversee a political transition in the South American country.

President Trump said on Saturday that an "oil embargo" on the country was in full effect.

Several vessels that have recently loaded crude and fuel bound for destinations including the U.S. and Asia have not set sail, while others that had waited to load have left empty, according to monitoring data. No tankers were loading on Saturday at the country's main oil port of Jose, TankerTrackers.com said.

A total suspension of oil exports, including tankers chartered by state-run PDVSA's main partner Chevron (CVX.N) , opens new tab , could accelerate the country's need to cut back output at oilfields, since storage tanks and even ships used for floating storage have filled rapidly in recent weeks, according to sources and PDVSA's documents.

PDVSA and Chevron did not immediately reply to requests for comment.</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 21:40:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WLDZOA7YS5PILOSEHS5TNRUFSI.jpg?auth=dc8160ea4511e3c518dedfec0e8816acba644349a6b590fa0660196d34ac5b99&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Explainer: Was the US capture of Venezuela's president legal?</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/was-us-capture-venezuelas-president-legal-2026-01-03/</link><description>WASHINGTON Jan 3 (Reuters) - The U.S. captured Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro in a military operation early on Saturday morning, culminating a months-long pressure campaign by President Donald Trump's administration that drew condemnation from some international leaders.

Maduro was on a warship bound for New York to face criminal charges, according to U.S. officials.

Below is a look at the legality of the U.S. action.

On Saturday, U.S. forces attacked Venezuela and seized Maduro, who has been widely condemned as an illegitimate leader, and his wife Cilia Flores.

Trump had been urging Maduro to cede power and has accused him of supporting drug cartels that Washington designated as terror groups, alleging they were responsible for thousands of U.S. deaths tied to illegal drug use.

Since September, U.S. forces had killed more than 100 people in at least 30 strikes on alleged drug trafficking boats from Venezuela in the Caribbean and Pacific, which legal experts said likely violated U.S. and international law.

U.S. authorities said the Justice Department sought military assistance to apprehend Maduro, who had been indicted by a New York grand jury along with his wife, son, two political leaders and an alleged leader of an international gang. They were charged with crimes related to terrorism, drugs and weapons.

Attorney General Pam Bondi said on social media that the defendants "will soon face the full wrath of American justice on American soil in American courts."

However, at a press conference, Trump blamed Venezuela for stealing U.S. oil interests and said Washington would take them back and planned to run Venezuela for a period of time, without offering specifics.

Experts in international law said the Trump administration had muddled the legal issues by claiming the operation was both a targeted law enforcement mission and the potential prelude to long-term control of Venezuela by the U.S.

"You cannot say this was a law enforcement operation and then turn around and say now we need to run the country," said Jeremy Paul, a professor at Northeastern University specializing in constitutional law. "It just doesn't make any sense."

The U.S. Congress has the power to declare war but the president is the commander-in-chief, and presidents of both parties have justified carrying out military action when it was limited in scope and in the national interest.

Trump's Chief of Staff Susie Wiles told Vanity Fair magazine in an interview published late last year that if Trump were to authorize "some activity on land" in Venezuela he would need approval from Congress.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Congress was not notified before Saturday's operation.

International law prohibits the use of force in international relations except for narrow exceptions such as authorization by the U.N. Security Council or in self-defense.

Drug trafficking and gang violence are considered criminal activity and do not rise to the accepted international standard of an armed conflict that would justify a military response, according to legal experts.

"A criminal indictment alone doesn't provide authority to use military force to depose a foreign government, and the administration will probably hang this also on a theory of self-defense," said Matthew Waxman, a law professor at Columbia University specializing in national security law.

The U.S. has not recognized Maduro as the legitimate leader of Venezuela since 2019, following an election the U.S. said was rigged.

The U.S. has captured criminal suspects in foreign countries including Libya but it has sought consent of local authorities. While the administration describes Maduro as an illegitimate leader, Washington has not recognized another Venezuelan leader who could have authorized the capture of Maduro.

In 1989, the U.S. arrested General Manuel Noriega, then the leader of Panama, in similar circumstances. Noriega had been indicted on drug-related charges and Washington said it was acting to protect U.S. citizens after Panamanian forces had killed a U.S. soldier.

The United States had also alleged Noriega was an illegitimate leader and had recognized as the country's leader the candidate who Noriega had claimed to have defeated in a recent election.

The former president of Honduras, Juan Orlando Hernández, was extradited to the United States in 2022 and later convicted on drug-related charges and sentenced to 45 years in prison. Trump pardoned Hernandez in December.

Legal experts were skeptical that the United States would face any meaningful accountability for its actions in Venezuela, even if they were unlawful given the lack of enforcement mechanisms in international law.

"It's hard to see how any legal body could impose practical consequences on the administration," said Paul, of Northeastern.</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 21:42:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HGORUN4VPFPYNI2TKXCUDC2N6E.jpg?auth=2d3998dd1dbecfe11f4f123d418eaa1b9842191752bdd7377ac4fa74e97d53af&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UK says it and France bomb Islamic State facility in Syria</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/uk-says-it-france-bomb-islamic-state-facility-syria-2026-01-03/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Britain and France's air forces conducted a joint operation late on Saturday to bomb a suspected underground arms dump previously used by Islamic State in Syria, Britain's defence ministry said on Saturday.

The dramatic mission punctuated a winter sojourn to his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, filled with an unusual mix of activities that have become oddly typical for the unconventional president.

Trump spent Thursday night, for instance, blasting out messages on Truth Social about an eclectic array of topics, none of them related to the South American country.

He wrote that the U.S. was "locked and loaded" and poised to help protesters in Iran if they were attacked by the government in Tehran. The 79-year-old president also presented his 11.2 million Truth Social followers with an image of a bald eagle that had been apparently slain by a windmill, while assuring them in a separate post that he is in "PERFECT HEALTH."

On Friday, less than 24 hours before the Venezuela mission, Trump spent almost an hour perusing marble and onyx at an Italian stone importer in a gritty section of Lake Worth Beach for his planned White House ballroom. Onlookers were left agape as "The Beast" presidential limousine snaked its way down narrow roads flanked by strip malls and trailer parks for the shopping excursion.

Since arriving at Mar-a-Lago in mid-December for a trip that wraps up on Sunday, Trump's days have been a blend of heady geopolitical affairs with visits from foreign leaders and glitzy social occasions, like a black-tie gala on New Year's Eve replete with Palm Beach socialites. No stretch has underlined that juxtaposition more than the last few days.

Supporters see a vigorous executive, capable of juggling several tasks and interests simultaneously. Opponents say he is easily distracted and sometimes focused on trivial matters, even when his administration is engaged in immensely consequential matters, like preparing to attack a sovereign nation.

On New Year's Eve, with hundreds of military assets already in place and awaiting the order to capture Maduro, Trump took to Truth Social with mock celebration of the news that George and Amal Clooney - both critics of the U.S. president - had obtained French citizenship.

During the gala at Mar-a-Lago hours later, Trump invited painter Vanessa Horabuena up to the stage to paint an image of Jesus Christ. He then auctioned off the painting for $2.75 million to a woman in a top hat and a svelte man in modified black-tie attire. The proceeds, the president said, would go to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office.

In the lead-up to the Venezuela mission, Trump also had his most high-profile architectural passion project - the $400 million new White House ballroom - on his mind. The endeavor has faced sharp criticism from Democrats and conservationists, in part because it involved the demolition of a significant chunk of the executive mansion.

A White House official told reporters on Friday that Trump was purchasing marble and onyx for the ballroom at his own expense, without providing further details.

"I'm doing a magnificent, big, beautiful ballroom that the country's wanted, the White House has wanted for 150 years," Trump said last week alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who had traveled to Florida to meet with the U.S. president.

That Trump would venture out days later to view marble options - even as one of the most significant U.S. military operations ever in Latin America was imminent - was not a total surprise for a president who has long had something of an obsession with the white stone.

During his first term in office, Trump appointees on an architectural board demanded that a renovation of the Federal Reserve in Washington include more marble . That demand, revealed by the media last year, has garnered renewed relevance as Trump frequently criticizes Fed Chairman Jerome Powell for the cost of that renovation.

Following Trump's Friday stop at the marble importer, he headed to his golf course, as he did on a near-daily basis while in Florida. In the evening, he met with his ambassador to China, former Senator David Perdue.

Within hours, the plan to capture Maduro was a go.</description><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 01:55:32 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/VKPKNGXKH5LU3DKUFIKFCLEAC4.jpg?auth=d7a4f502eda87e8d90d4fd0c5e6a32fb7b5eaae5012456ce52e0cf6c62bd82d6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>No quick wins in tapping Venezuela's oil reserves</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/no-quick-wins-tapping-venezuelas-oil-reserves-2026-01-04/</link><description>MIAMI, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Venezuela is unlikely to see any meaningful boost to crude output for years even if U.S. oil majors do invest the billions of dollars in the country that President Donald Trump promised just hours following Nicolás Maduro's capture by U.S. forces.

The South American country may have the world's largest estimated oil reserves, but output has plummeted over the past decades amid mismanagement and a lack of investment from foreign firms after Venezuela nationalized oil operations in the 2000s that included the assets of Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) , opens new tab and ConocoPhillips (COP.N) , opens new tab .

Any companies that might want to invest there would need to deal with security concerns, dilapidated infrastructure, questions about the legality of the U.S. operation to snatch Maduro and the potential for long-term political instability, analysts told Reuters.

American firms won't return until they know for sure they will be paid and will have at least a minimal amount of security, said Mark Christian, director of business development at CHRIS Well Consulting. He also said the companies would not go back until sanctions against the country are removed.

Venezuela would also have to reform its laws to allow for larger investment by foreign oil companies.

Venezuela nationalized the industry in the 1970s, and in the 2000s ordered a forced migration to joint ventures controlled by its state oil company, PDVSA [RIC:RIC:PDVSA.UL]. Most companies negotiated exits and migrated, including Chevron, while a handful of others did not reach deals and filed for arbitration.

"I f Trump et al can produce a peaceful transition with little resistance, then in five to seven years there is a significant oil-production ramp up as infrastructure is repaired and investments get sorted out," Thomas O'Donnell, an energy and geopolitical strategist, told Reuters, adding that heavy crude produced in the country works well with U.S. Gulf Coast refineries and can also be blended with lighter oil produced from fracking.

But that would depend on everything going right, and there's a lot that could go wrong.

"A botched political transition that has a feeling of U.S. dominance can lead to years of resistance," O'Donnell said, noting armed groups of citizens and guerrilla groups that operate in the country.

Chevron would be positioned to benefit the most from any potential oil opening in Venezuela, said Francisco Monaldi, director of the Latin America Energy Program at Rice University's Baker Institute in Houston. Other U.S. oil companies would be paying close attention to political stability and would wait to see how the operational environment and contract framework unfolded, he added.

Venezuela - a founding member of OPEC with Iran, Iraq, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia - produced as much as 3.5 million barrels per day in the 1970s, which at the time represented over 7% of global oil output. Production fell below 2 million bpd during the 2010s and averaged around 1.1 million bpd last year, or just 1% of global production.

Chevron is the only American major currently operating in Venezuela. Conoco has been seeking billions for the takeover of three oil projects nearly two decades ago, while Exxon was also involved in lengthy arbitration cases against Venezuela after it exited the country nearly two decades ago.

"The company that probably will be very interested in going back is Conoco, because they are owed more than $10 billion, and it's unlikely that they will get paid without going back into the country," Monaldi said. Exxon could also return, but is not owed as much money, he added.

"ConocoPhillips is monitoring developments in Venezuela and their potential implications for global energy supply and stability. It would be premature to speculate on any future business activities or investments," a company spokesperson said in emailed comments to Reuters.

Chevron, which exports around 150,000 bpd of crude from Venezuela to the U.S. Gulf Coast, has had to carefully maneuver with the Trump administration in an effort to maintain its presence in the country over the past year. CEO Mike Wirth said in December that he had spoken with the Trump administration about what he said was the importance of maintaining an American presence in the country through multiple political cycles.

The oil firm has been in Venezuela for over 100 years and said on Saturday that it is focused on the safety and well-being of its employees, in addition to the integrity of its assets. "We continue to operate in full compliance with all relevant laws and regulations,” a Chevron spokesperson said in an emailed response to questions.

Exxon did not immediately respond to questions from Reuters.

OPEC and allies will meet on Sunday and are expected to maintain current oil output policy. The group has been increasing production since last year, stoking concerns of a global supply glut, but has agreed to pause oil output hikes for January, February and March.

Ed Hirs, an energy fellow at University of Houston, said recent events in Venezuela would have little impact on U.S. prices for oil and gasoline for now, with much of the country's production going to Cuba and China at the moment. He also said that history is full of recent examples of American excursions that didn't produce notable results for U.S. companies.

"Trump now joins the history of U.S. presidents who have overthrown regimes of oil-rich countries. Bush with Iraq. Obama with Libya. In those cases, the United States has received zero benefit from the oil. I’m afraid that history will repeat itself in Venezuela," Hirs said.

Oil tankers chartered by Chevron had been among the few to set sail from Venezuela over the past month, following Trump's December announcement of a " blockade

That's perhaps where one quick win could emerge, if Trump is able to restart the flow of Venezuelan crude into the U.S. Gulf, potentially boosting refiners like Valero in the process. At the moment, it appears that just the opposite is happening.</description><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 01:55:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/NR2Y3TBKNVNBHOE5YRZNWTLDUU.jpg?auth=8e006ffc53c4dfdc9e4acd8fbc4d8c1be03a57f6ac86bb3cd3639672b50a18cd&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuela's Supreme Court orders Delcy Rodriguez become interim president</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/venezuelas-supreme-court-orders-delcy-rodriguez-become-interim-president-2026-01-04/</link><description>CARACAS, Jan 3 (Reuters) - The Constitutional Chamber of Venezuela's Supreme Court ordered on Saturday that Vice President Delcy Rodríguez assume the role of acting president of the country in the absence of Nicolás Maduro, who was detained early Saturday morning in an operation by U.S. forces.

Trump said on Saturday that Vice President Delcy Rodriguez, part of the powerful cabal at the top of the country's government, had been sworn in after Maduro's arrest and that she had spoken with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, leading to speculation that she would take the reins.

Under Venezuela's constitution, Rodriguez becomes acting president in Maduro's absence and the country's top court ordered her to assume the role late Saturday night.

But shortly after Trump's remarks, Rodriguez appeared on state television flanked by her brother, the head of the national assembly Jorge Rodriguez, Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello and Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino Lopez and said that Maduro remained Venezuela's only president.

The joint appearance indicated the group that shared power with Maduro is staying united - for now.

Trump publicly closed the door Saturday on working with opposition leader and Nobel Prize winner Maria Corina Machado, widely seen as Maduro's most credible opponent, saying she doesn't have support inside the country.

After Machado was barred from running in Venezuela's 2024 elections, international observers say her stand-in candidate won the vote in a landslide, despite Maduro's government claiming victory.

For more than a decade, real power in Venezuela has been held by a small circle of senior officials. Analysts and officials say though that the system depends on a sprawling web of loyalists and security organs, fueled by corruption and surveillance.

Within the inner circle, a civilian-military balance reigns. Each member has their own interests and patronage networks. Currently Rodriguez and her brother represent the civilian side. Padrino and Cabello represent the military side.

This power structure makes dismantling Venezuela's current government more complex than removing Maduro, according to interviews with current and former U.S. officials, Venezuelan and U.S. military analysts and security consultants to Venezuela's opposition.

"You can remove as many pieces of the Venezuelan government as you like, but it would have to be multiple actors at different levels to move the needle," said a former U.S. official involved in criminal investigations in Venezuela.

A big question mark surrounds Cabello, who exerts influence over the country's military and civilian counterintelligence agencies, which conduct widespread domestic espionage.

"The focus is now on Diosdado Cabello," said Venezuelan military strategist Jose Garcia. "Because he is the most ideological, violent and unpredictable element of the Venezuelan regime."

The United Nations found both SEBIN, the civilian agency, and DGCIM, the military intelligence service, have committed crimes against humanity as part of a state plan to crush dissent. Eleven former detainees - including some who were once security personnel themselves - described electric shocks, simulated drownings, and sexual abuse at DGCIM black sites to Reuters in interviews before Maduro's capture.

"They want you to feel like you are a cockroach in a cage of elephants, that they are bigger," said a former DGCIM agent who was arrested and accused of treason in 2020 after having contact with military dissidents.

In recent weeks, as the United States mounted its biggest military build-up in Latin America in decades, Cabello has appeared on live TV ordering the DGCIM to "go and get the terrorists" and warning "whoever strays, we will know."

He repeated the rhetoric in a state television appearance on Saturday, clad in a flak jacket and helmet and surrounded by heavily armed guards.

Cabello has also been closely associated with pro-government militias, notably groups of motorcycle-riding armed civilians known as colectivos.

Cabello, a former military officer and a major player in the socialist party, has influence over a meaningful fraction of the armed forces, even though Venezuela's military has been formally run by Defense Minister Padrino for more than ten years.

Venezuela has as many as 2,000 generals and admirals , more than double the number in the United States. Senior and retired officers control food distribution, raw materials and the state oil company PDVSA, while dozens of generals sit on the boards of private firms.

Beyond contracts, military officials profit from illicit trade, defectors and current and former U.S. investigators say.

Documents from an opposition security consultant, shared with the U.S. military and seen by Reuters, say commanders close to Cabello and Padrino are assigned to key brigades along Venezuela's borders and in industrial hubs.

The brigades, while tactically important, also sit on major smuggling routes.

"There are some 20 to 50 officers in the Venezuelan military who need to go, probably even more, to fully remove this regime," said a lawyer who has represented a member of senior Venezuelan leadership.

Some might be considering jumping ship. The lawyer said that around a dozen former officials and current generals had reached out after Maduro's capture, hoping to cut a deal with the U.S. by offering intelligence in exchange for safe passage and legal immunity.

But those close to Cabello said he was not currently interested in cutting a deal, the lawyer said.</description><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 04:49:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WQU4R6U6SBKHFFHWRQN772YPYY.jpg?auth=ce9d0511d13b61592af37fa523ac13c9d0463647410ca0f94786b2d072ab9506&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Myanmar to free 6,186 prisoners in Independence Day amnesty during election</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/myanmar-free-6186-prisoners-independence-day-amnesty-during-election-2026-01-04/</link><description>Jan 4 (Reuters) - Myanmar's military government will release 6,186 prisoners under an amnesty marking Independence Day, state media said on Saturday, a week after a multi-stage general election began in the impoverished Southeast Asian nation.

The amnesty, which includes 52 foreigners, is a humanitarian gesture that takes into consideration the public's peace of mind, state-run MRTV said.

The junta also reduced sentences by one-sixth nationwide, excluding for those convicted of serious crimes such as murder, rape, terrorism, corruption and arms- or drug-related offences.

It was not immediately clear whether any political detainees would be freed.

Myanmar has been in turmoil since 2021, when the military toppled the elected civilian government of Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi and violently suppressed pro-democracy protests, sparking a nationwide armed rebellion.

Suu Kyi is serving 27 years in prison after being detained in the coup, months after her National League for Democracy won a landslide and was later dissolved.

More than 30,000 people have been detained on political charges since the coup, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, a human rights group.

Newly formed resistance groups and long-established ethnic armies are fighting the military across much of the country, forcing an estimated 3.6 million people from their homes.

The first round of the election, Myanmar's first since 2020, was held last weekend in a vote condemned by opposition groups, the U.N. and some Western governments as a sham, given that anti-junta political parties are out of the running and it is illegal to criticise the polls.</description><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 04:50:31 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WPXMPAPVQ5NOXJKWR2XSV7L5PU.jpg?auth=18a6d3382c04958b5a9fdc860fab2be843aeef4647a730840ab1f5caed2d1a9d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Maduro in New York detention centre as Trump says US to 'run' Venezuela</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260104-maduro-in-new-york-detention-centre-as-trump-says-us-to-run-venezuela-drug-trafficking</link><description>Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro was in a New York jail Saturday, hours after American special forces seized and flew him out of his country — which Donald Trump said would come under effective US control.

The US president's announcement followed a lightning pre-dawn attack in which commandos grabbed Maduro and his wife while air strikes pounded sites in and around Caracas.

A US government plane carrying Maduro landed at a military base shortly after nightfall, and he was transported by helicopter to New York City, where the couple were to be arraigned on drug trafficking and weapons charges.

The White House posted video on X of Maduro, handcuffed and in sandals, escorted by federal agents through a US Drug Enforcement Administration facility in New York.

"Good night, happy new year," the 63-year-old leftist is heard saying in English.

Despite the success of the risky raid, what happens next is highly uncertain.

Trump said he was "designating people" from his cabinet to be in charge in Venezuela but gave no further details.

In another surprise, Trump indicated US troops could be deployed, saying Washington is "not afraid of boots on the ground."

But he appeared to reject the possibility of the country's opposition taking power and said he could work instead with Maduro's vice president, Delcy Rodriguez.

One aspect that became clearer was Trump's interest in Venezuela's vast oil reserves.

"We're going to have our very large United States oil companies... go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure," he said.

"We'll be selling large amounts of oil."

US-backed opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, who won last year's Nobel Peace Prize, posted on social media that "the hour of freedom has arrived."

She called for the opposition's 2024 election candidate, Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia, to "immediately" assume the presidency.

But Trump was surprisingly cold about expectations that Machado could become Venezuela's new leader, saying she doesn't have "support or respect" there.

Instead, he touted Rodriguez, saying "she's essentially willing to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again."

Rodriguez poured cold water on that, demanding Maduro's release and vowing to "defend" the country.

Late Saturday, Venezuela's Supreme Court ordered Rodriguez to assume presidential powers "in an acting capacity."

Reflecting the confusion, Trump indicated US involvement is likely for the long haul.

"We're going to stay until such time as the proper transition can take place," he said.

Venezuela ally China said it "strongly condemns" the US operation, while France warned a solution cannot "be imposed from outside."

United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was "deeply concerned that the rules of international law have not been respected."

At Venezuela's request, the UN Security Council will meet Monday to discuss the crisis, the Somali presidency of the Council told AFP.

Venezuelans had been bracing for attacks as US forces spent months massing off the coast.

Caracas residents woke to explosions and the whir of military helicopters around 2:00 am (0600 GMT). Air strikes hit a major military base and an airbase, among other sites, for nearly an hour.

The top US military officer, General Dan Caine, said 150 aircraft took part in the operation, supporting troops who choppered in to seize Maduro with the help of months of intelligence into his daily habits -- down to "what he ate" and what pets he kept.

Maduro and his wife "gave up" without a struggle and there was "no loss of US life," he said.

Venezuelan authorities have yet to release casualty figures. But Trump told the New York Post that "many" Cubans in Maduro's security detail were killed.

Within hours of the operation, Caracas had fallen eerily quiet, with police stationed outside public buildings and the smell of smoke drifting through the streets.

The US and numerous European governments did not recognise Maduro's legitimacy, saying he stole elections in 2018 and 2024.

Maduro -- in power since 2013 after taking over from leftist mentor Hugo Chavez -- long accused Trump of seeking regime change in order to control Venezuela's oil reserves.

Trump has offered several justifications for the aggressive policy toward Venezuela, at times stressing illegal migration, narcotics trafficking and oil.

But he had previously avoided openly calling for regime change.

Several members of Congress quickly questioned the legality of the operation. But Trump's key ally Mike Johnson, top Republican in the House of Representatives, said it was "justified."</description><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 04:51:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/2406bf64-e91c-11f0-b85f-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/ecaca612b59266055f1299b093dc41ca21cb581d.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuela's Maduro in custody, Trump says US will run the country</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/venezuelas-maduro-custody-trump-says-us-will-run-country-2026-01-04/</link><description>CARACAS/NEW YORK, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro was in a New York detention center on Sunday after President Donald Trump ordered an audacious U.S. raid to capture the South American leader and take control of the country and its vast oil reserves.

As part of the dramatic operation early on Saturday that knocked out electricity in parts of Caracas and included strikes on military installations, U.S. Special Forces seized Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, and transported them via helicopter to a U.S. Navy ship offshore before flying them to the U.S.

"We will run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition," Trump told a press conference at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.

For months, his administration criticized Maduro, 63, over what it called his involvement in shipping drugs to the U.S. It ramped up pressure with a massive military build-up in the Caribbean and a series of deadly missile attacks on alleged drug-running boats.

While many Western allies oppose Maduro and say he stole Venezuela's 2024 election, Trump's boasts about controlling the nation and exploiting its oil revived painful memories of past U.S. interventions in Latin America, Iraq and Afghanistan.

Some legal experts questioned the legality of an operation to seize the head of state of a foreign power, while Democrats who said they were misled during recent Congress briefings demanded a plan for what is to follow.

Trump said as part of the takeover, major U.S. oil companies would move back into Venezuela, which has the world's largest oil reserves, and refurbish badly degraded oil infrastructure, a process experts said could take years .

He said he was open to sending U.S. forces into Venezuela. "We're not afraid of boots on the ground," he said.

A plane carrying Maduro landed near New York City on Saturday night, and he was helicoptered to the city before being taken by a large convoy to the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn under a heavy police guard.

Images released by U.S. authorities showed the leader handcuffed and blindfolded during the flight, and later being led down a hallway at the offices of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, where he was heard wishing a "happy New Year."

Indicted on various federal charges, including narco-terrorism conspiracy, Maduro expected to make an initial appearance in Manhattan federal court on Monday, according to a Justice Department official.

It is unclear how Trump plans to oversee Venezuela. U.S. forces have no control over the country, and Maduro's government appears not only to still be in charge but to have no appetite for cooperating with Washington.

Maduro's vice president, Delcy Rodriguez, appeared on Venezuelan television on Saturday afternoon with other top officials to decry what she called a kidnapping.

“We demand the immediate release of President Nicolas Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores," Rodriguez said, calling Maduro "the only president of Venezuela." A Venezuelan court ordered Rodriguez to assume the position of interim president.

Trump did not say who will lead Venezuela when the U.S. cedes control, but appeared to rule out working with opposition figure and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Maria Corina Machado, widely seen as Maduro's most credible opponent.

"She doesn't have the support within or the respect within the country," he said.

In Venezuela, the streets were mostly calm after a rush for groceries and fuel. Soldiers patrolled some parts and small pro-Maduro crowds gathered in Caracas.

Others expressed relief. "I'm happy, I doubted for a moment that it was happening because it's like a movie," said merchant Carolina Pimentel, 37, in the city of Maracay.

Many Venezuelan migrants around the world erupted in celebration.

"We are free. We are all happy that the dictatorship has fallen and that we have a free country," said Khaty Yanez, who lives in the Chilean capital Santiago, one of an estimated 7.7 million Venezuelans - 20% of the population - who have left the country since 2014.

The U.N. Security Council planned to meet on Monday to discuss the actions, which Secretary-General Antonio Guterres described as "a dangerous precedent." Russia and China, both major backers of Venezuela, criticized the U.S.

"China firmly opposes such hegemonic behavior by the U.S., which seriously violates international law, violates Venezuela's sovereignty and threatens peace and security in Latin America and the Caribbean," China's foreign ministry said.

Trump's comments about an open-ended military presence in Venezuela echoed the rhetoric around past invasions in Iraq and Afghanistan, both of which ended in American withdrawals after years of costly occupation and thousands of U.S. casualties.

A U.S. occupation "won't cost us a penny" because the United States would be reimbursed from the "money coming out of the ground," Trump said, referring to Venezuela's oil reserves, a subject he returned to repeatedly during Saturday's press conference.

Trump’s focus on foreign affairs provides fuel for Democrats to criticize him ahead of midterm congressional elections in November, when control of both houses of Congress is at stake, with Republicans controlling both by narrow margins.

Opinion polls show the top concern for voters is high prices at home, not foreign policy.

Trump also runs the risk of alienating some of his own supporters, who have backed his "America First" agenda and oppose foreign interventions.</description><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 06:32:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/FMQGLGBAR5OA5NZKTV5ERDE63I.jpg?auth=f898965558dc6e4e3bae037e1aa2c0ce27ed69f4cf971f5b481f8190516ce1f6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>South Korean President Lee arrives in Beijing for state visit, Chinese state media says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/south-korean-president-lee-arrives-beijing-state-visit-chinese-state-media-says-2026-01-04/</link><description>SHANGHAI, Jan 4 (Reuters) - South Korean President Lee Jae Myung began a state visit to China on Sunday, hoping to promote peace on the Korean Peninsula hours after rival North Korea launched ballistic missiles.

The visit, Lee's first to China since taking office in June, comes amid heightened global tensions after Pyongyang's aggressive display, on the heels of the U.S. attack on Venezuela.

Lee is expected to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping during the trip for their second meeting in just two months, an unusually short interval that, analysts say, signals China's keen interest in boosting economic collaboration and tourism as its relations with neighbouring Japan have sunk to the lowest point in years.

Beijing was incensed when Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi suggested in November that Tokyo could take military action if Beijing attacked Taiwan. China claims the democratically governed island as its own - an assertion rejected by Taiwan's government.

Sunday's missile launches by North Korea represent "a message to China to deter closer ties with South Korea and to counter China's stance on denuclearisation", said Lim Eul-chul, a professor at the Institute for Far Eastern Studies in Seoul.

Lee arrived in Beijing with a delegation that includes more than 200 South Korean business leaders to start a four-day state visit to China, Chinese state news broadcaster CCTV reported.

China and South Korea are expected to discuss matters such as supply chain investment, the digital economy and cultural exchanges during Lee's visit, CCTV said.</description><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 06:33:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/J6ZZCV7F6ZJXFHR4II5POHP4AE.jpg?auth=8ae12e9e53aef0059b6fd5be578616755c77b8f031593d2e2fc345db13e6c680&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Live: Venezuela faces power vacuum after US captures Maduro</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260104-live-venezuela-maduro-held-in-us-custody-as-trump-vows-to-run-the-country-us</link><description>Hours after Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro was captured in an audacious US raid, Vice President Delcy Rodriguez insisted he remains the Latin American country’s only leader.

China's ​foreign ministry said ⁠the United States should immediately ​release Venezuelan ‍leader Nicolas Maduro ​and his wife and ​resolve the situation in Venezuela through dialogue and negotiation.

The ministry said in ‍a statement on ​its website that the United States should also ‌ensure the personal safety ‍of Maduro and his wife, saying that their deportation violated international law ‍and norms.

The United States has advised ⁠airlines its Caribbean airspace curbs will expire at midnight ET (0500 GMT) and flights could resume as schedules are quickly updated, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said.

The comments on X followed the cancelation of hundreds of flights by ​major airlines after the US attack on Venezuela and its capture of Maduro.

Key carriers United Airlines and Delta were readying to resume flights to the Caribbean by Sunday.

The US capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro leaves behind uncertainty about who is running the oil-rich country.

Trump said on Saturday that Vice President Delcy Rodriguez, part of the powerful cabal at the top of the country's government, had been sworn in after Maduro's arrest and that she had spoken with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, leading to speculation that she would take the reins.

Under Venezuela's constitution, Rodriguez becomes acting president in Maduro's absence and the country's top court ordered her to assume the role late Saturday night.

But shortly after Trump's remarks, Rodriguez appeared on state television flanked by her brother, the head of the national assembly Jorge Rodriguez, Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello and Defence Minister Vladimir Padrino Lopez and said that Maduro remained Venezuela's only president.

The joint appearance indicated the group that shared power with Maduro is staying united - for now.

Trump publicly closed the door Saturday on working with opposition leader and Nobel Prize winner Maria Corina Machado, widely seen as Maduro's most credible opponent, saying she doesn't have support inside the country.

A lingering smell of explosives hung over Venezuela's capital Caracas on Saturday as shocked residents took stock after an early-morning US strike that ousted strongman Nicolas Maduro.

While a few hundred Maduro supporters gathered to clamor for his freedom, the streets were otherwise eerily quiet.

"I felt the explosions lift me out of bed. In that instant I thought: 'My God, the day has come,' and I cried," Maria Eugenia Escobar, a 58-year-old resident of the city of six million people, told AFP.

The strikes started around 2:00 am local time, with dozens of detonations that some people at first mistook for fireworks.

Windows rattled from the shockwaves and residents rushed out onto terraces and balconies as military aircraft zoomed overhead.

"It was horrible, we felt the planes flying over our house," said a resident of the Coche neighborhood, near the city's largest military complex, which was targeted in the raid.

The arrest of Maduro and his wife in a stunning military operation early Saturday in Venezuela sets the stage for a major test for US prosecutors as they seek to secure a conviction in a Manhattan courtroom against the longtime leader of the oil-rich South American nation.

Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a post on X that Maduro and his wife “will soon face the full wrath of American justice on American soil in American courts.”

Here's a look at the accusations against Maduro and the charges he faces.

Maduro is charged alongside his wife, his son and three others. Maduro is indicted on four counts: narco-terrorism conspiracy, cocaine importation conspiracy, possession of machine guns and destructive devices and conspiracy to possess machine guns and destructive devices.

Maduro is facing the same charges as in an earlier indictment brought against him in Manhattan federal court in 2020, during the first Trump presidency. The new indictment unsealed on Saturday, which adds charges against Maduro's wife, was filed under seal in the Southern District of New York just before Christmas.

It was not immediately clear when Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, would make their first appearance at the courthouse in Manhattan. A video posted Saturday night on social media by a White House account showed Maduro, smiling, as he was escorted through a US Drug Enforcement Administration office in New York by two federal agents grasping his arms. He was expected to be detained while awaiting trial at a federal jail in Brooklyn.

The indictment accuses Maduro of partnering with “some of the most violent and prolific drug traffickers and narco-terrorists in the world” to allow for the shipment of thousands of tons of cocaine into the Us Authorities allege powerful and violent drug-trafficking organizations, such as the Sinaloa Cartel and Tren de Aragua gang, worked directly with the Venezuelan government and then sent profits to high-ranking officials who helped and protected them in exchange.

Maduro allowed “cocaine-fueled corruption to flourish for his own benefit, for the benefit of members of his ruling regime, and for the benefit of his family members,” the indictment alleges.

“This cycle of narcotics-based corruption lines the pockets of Venezuelan officials and their families while also benefiting violent narco-terrorists who operate with impunity on Venezuelan soil and who help produce, protect, and transport tons of cocaine to the United States,” the indictment says.

The US accuses Maduro and his wife of ordering kidnappings, beatings and murders “against those who owed them drug money or otherwise undermined their drug trafficking operation.” That includes the killing of a local drug boss in Caracas, according to the indictment.

Maduro’s wife is also accused of accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes in 2007 to arrange a meeting between “a large-scale drug trafficker” and the director of Venezuela’s National Anti-Drug Office. In a corrupt deal, the drug trafficker then agreed to pay a monthly bribe to the director of the anti-drug office as well as about $100,000 for each cocaine-carrying flight “to ensure the flight’s safe passage.” Some of that money then went to Maduro’s wife, the indictment says.

Nephews of Maduro's wife were heard during recorded meetings with confidential US government sources in 2015 agreeing to send “multi-hundred-kilogram cocaine shipments” from Maduro's “presidential hanger” at a Venezuelan airport. The nephews during the recorded meetings explained “that they were at ‘war’ with the United States,” the indictment alleges. They were both sentenced in 2017 to 18 years in prison for conspiring to send tons of cocaine into the US before being released in 2022 as part of a prisoner swap in exchange for seven imprisoned Americans.

During a news conference, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Dan Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, cast the military raid that captured Maduro and his wife as an action carried out on behalf of the Department of Justice. Caine said the operation was made “at the request of the Justice Department.”

Rubio, as he responded to a question about whether Congress had been notified, said the US raid to get the couple was “basically a law enforcement function," adding that it was an instance in which the “Department of War supported the Department of Justice." He called Maduro “a fugitive of American justice with a $50 million reward” over his head.</description><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 07:24:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/c2c75cb6-e93b-11f0-9be5-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26003534551418.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UK, France strike suspected IS arms site near Syria's Palmyra</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260104-uk-france-strike-suspected-islamic-state-is-arms-site-near-syria-palmyra</link><description>The British Ministry of Defence said it cooperated with France on Saturday night to strike an underground facility in Syria that had likely been used by the Islamic State group to store weapons.

"Royal Air Force aircraft have completed successful strikes against Daesh in a joint operation with France," the ministry said in a statement, using the Arabic acronym for IS.

"This facility had been occupied by Daesh, most likely to store weapons and explosives. The area around the facility is devoid of any civilian habitation," the statement added.

The ministry said there was no indication the bombing north of the ancient site of Palmyra had posed any risk to civilians.

IS was territorially defeated in Syria in 2019 but still maintains a presence, particularly in the country's vast desert.

Palmyra, home to UNESCO-listed ancient ruins, was once controlled by the jihadist fighters.

Last month, Washington said a lone IS gunman in Palmyra attacked American personnel, killing two US soldiers and a US civilian.

US forces said they struck dozens of IS targets in Syria in retaliation.</description><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 07:24:48 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/4c7a1adc-47ee-11ec-9aae-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/ei_deir_ezzor.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Stunned Swiss Alpine resort seeks solace together after deadly bar fire</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/stunned-swiss-alpine-resort-seeks-solace-together-after-deadly-bar-fire-2026-01-04/</link><description>CRANS-MONTANA, Switzerland, Jan 4 (Reuters) - When 51-year-old Annouk Perret came to pay her respects to the victims of the Swiss New Year bar fire that killed at least 40 people in the ski resort of Crans-Montana, she knew that she too could have been one of the parents mourning a lost child.

Authorities say most of the victims of the blaze that ripped through the Le Constellation bar were young people in a country renowned for orderliness and unaccustomed to mass fatalities.

Laying flowers with her son Emile and her tearful mother-in-law Carmen outside the now cordoned-off popular bar, Perret recalled how her 17-year-old daughter wanted to go in too that night - but did not because of the long queue outside.

Instead, she said her daughter went to a bar opposite with friends. When flames engulfing the bar sparked a blast, they first assumed it was fireworks; when police quickly arrived, the group feared it was gunfire and fled, Perret said.

Afterwards, the family learned that another friend of her daughter decided to enter "Le Constellation" just before the fire and lost her life there, Perret told Reuters.

"We've come today because we need to be here. We need to see the place where it happened," she said. "(She) could have been dead, but is not. But others are dead."

Perret spoke just as Swiss authorities were announcing they had identified four more victims aged 16-21, without naming them. Very few of the dead have so far been identified, with the severity of burns making identification hard.

That will be a tough process for Crans-Montana, she said, a wealthy town of over 10,000 people with a popular golf course.

Prosecutors on Saturday said the two people who ran the bar are now under investigation suspected of crimes including homicide by negligence.

Damiano Vizioli, a 24-year-old living in neighbouring Sion, was in Le Constellation on New Year's Eve but had gone outside to smoke a cigarette when the bar suddenly burst into flames.

He was stunned to see people with their clothes on fire scrambling to escape from the burning bar, he said. The distressing scenes he witnessed have stayed with him.

"I'm not sleeping well because I can hear the people screaming," said Vizioli, who went back to the bar desperate for news of a friend working there whom he has not heard from since.

The blaze has hit many nationalities, with the injured and missing coming from all corners of Europe and as far afield as Australia. But most of the tally are Swiss.

Mutual support was crucial for coping, Perret said.

"Now we call each other, each parents, because everybody has children who were in there or almost were there, or didn't go... and everybody's completely shaken," she said.

Reporters from all around Europe rushed to get to the Alpine retreat as images of the inferno began circulating online.

Eric Schmid, a 63-year-old local businessman, said he had received messages from all over the world since the news broke.

"The scar will be quite deep, and I think it'll take time to heal," he said. But the Swiss are resilient, he added.

"We are mountain people. We will survive, of course, but that's not the most important thing," he said. "It's more about the kids and all these people who have been affected. But the messages and signs of solidarity are super important."

Among those who expressed gratitude for the solidarity is Pierre Pralong, an 89-year-old anxiously awaiting word of his missing granddaughter Emilie, 22, who went to the bar. The uncertainty had caused the family great suffering, he said.

But even as hopes dwindle, faith in God was helping him as he recalled Emilie's joyful nature. "I have a feeling she's probably passed on into the next life," Pralong said.</description><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 08:28:31 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/XLJ2GBF2JBIKPB4GLGL237WAKA.jpg?auth=f108747aa3467c796ac955038bbbd6f824ff4b74a561bd270bfba2e7c2bc88e5&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>One killed, two injured in Ukraine's drone attack in Russia's border region</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/one-killed-two-injured-ukraines-drone-attack-russias-border-region-2026-01-04/</link><description>MOSCOW, Jan 4 (Reuters) - One man was killed and a woman and a four-year old child were injured by a Ukrainian drone attack on a vehicle in Russia's western border region of Belgorod, the governor said on Sunday.

Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said on the Telegram messaging app the two injured were hospitalised in a serious condition. Firefighters put out the fire, which had engulfed the car following the attack, he added.

Separately, Russia's defence ministry said it has downed 42 Ukrainian drones on Sunday morning, on top of 90 it had shot down overnight, including three Moscow-bound drones.

Ukrainian drone attacks frequently hit targets in Belgorod and other border regions.</description><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 08:52:56 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Four more who died in Swiss bar blaze have been identified, police say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/four-more-who-died-swiss-bar-blaze-have-been-identified-police-say-2026-01-04/</link><description>ZURICH, Jan 4 (Reuters) - The bodies of four more people who died in the fire that killed 40 people at a bar in Switzerland on New Year's Eve have been identified, cantonal police said.

Two Swiss women aged 24 and 22 along with two Swiss men aged 21 and 18 have been identified and their bodies have been returned to their families, Valais police said. No further information was given.

The news takes the number of identified bodies following the blaze in the ski resort of Crans-Montana to eight, after the identification of four other bodies on Saturday.

Officials are still trying to identify many of those killed in the fire at the Le Constellation bar, which has become one of Switzerland's worst tragedies.

Some 119 people suffered injuries, including severe burns, with many transferred to burn units in hospitals around Europe. Work on identifying the dead and the injured are continuing, the police said.

The demonstrations first kicked off last Sunday when shopkeepers staged a strike over economic concerns, but have since spread in size and scope, with protesters making political demands.

The protests have affected, to varying degrees, at least 40 different cities, mostly medium-sized and located in the country's west, according to an AFP tally based on official announcements and media reports.

At least 12 people have been killed, including members of the security forces, according to a toll based on official reports.

Protests Saturday evening in Tehran were described as "limited" by the Fars news agency, which said they were "generally made up of groups of 50 to 200 young people".

Tehran's population is about 10 million.

Demonstrations were reported in the districts of Novobat and Tehran Pars in the capital's east; Ekteban, Sadeghieh and Sattarkhan in the west; and Naziabad and Abdolabad in the south, Fars said.

Demonstrators shouted slogans including "death to the dictator", Fars said, though no major incidents were reported beyond some stone throwing and rubbish bins being set alright.

The news agency said the situation in Tehran "contrasted with an intensification of violence and organised attacks in other regions, notably the country's west".

In Malekshahi, a county of about 20,000 residents including a sizeable Kurdish population, a member of the security forces was killed in clashes, Iranian media reported Saturday.

"Rioters attempted to storm a police station," Fars said, adding that "two assailants were killed".

Local media's accounting of the protests is not exhaustive, and state-run outlets have downplayed their coverage of the demonstrations, while videos flooding social media are often impossible to verify.</description><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 09:25:10 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/1308a510-e949-11f0-b4a0-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26004221769471.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US strike on Venezuela to embolden China's territorial claims, Taiwan attack unlikely, analysts say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/us-strike-venezuela-embolden-chinas-territorial-claims-taiwan-attack-unlikely-2026-01-04/</link><description>SHANGHAI/BEIJING, Jan 4 (Reuters) - The U.S. attack on Venezuela will embolden China to strengthen its territorial claims over areas such as Taiwan and parts of the South China Sea but will not hasten any potential invasion of Taiwan, analysts said.

Chinese President Xi Jinping's considerations about Taiwan and his timeline are separate from the situation in Latin America, influenced more by China's domestic situation than by U.S. actions, they said.

Still, analysts said, President Donald Trump's audacious attack on Saturday, capturing Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro, hands China an unexpected opportunity that Beijing will likely use in the near term to amplify criticism of Washington and bolster its own standing on the international stage.

Further out, Beijing could leverage Trump's move to defend its stance against the U.S. on territorial issues including Taiwan, Tibet and islands in the East and South China seas.

"Washington's consistent, long-standing arguments are always that the Chinese actions are violating international law but they are now damaging that," said William Yang, an analyst at International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based NGO.

"It's really creating a lot of openings and cheap ammunition for the Chinese to push back against the U.S. in the future."

China claims democratically governed Taiwan as its own province - an assertion the island's government rejects - and claims almost all of the South China Sea, a position that puts it at odds with several Southeast Asian nations that also claim parts of the vital trade route.

China's foreign ministry and Taiwan Affairs Office, and Taiwan's presidential office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Beijing condemned Trump's strike on Venezuela, saying it violated international law and threatened peace and security in Latin America. It has demanded the U.S. release Maduro and his wife, who are being detained in New York awaiting trial.

Hours before his capture, Maduro met with a high-level Chinese delegation in Caracas, according to photos he posted on his Instagram page.

The Chinese foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the whereabouts of the delegation, which included China's special representative for Latin American and Caribbean affairs, Qiu Xiaoqi.

On Sunday China's official Xinhua news agency called the U.S. attack "naked hegemonic behaviour."

"The US invasion has made everyone see more and more the fact that the so-called 'rules-based international order' in the mouth of the United States is actually just a 'predatory order based on US interests'," state-run Xinhua news agency said.

Taiwan, in particular, has been facing growing pressure from Beijing. China last week encircled the island in its most extensive war games to date, showcasing Beijing's ability to cut off the island from outside support in a conflict.

But analysts said they did not expect China to capitalise on the Venezuelan situation to escalate that into an attack anytime soon.

"Taking over Taiwan depends on China's developing but still insufficient capability rather than what Trump did in a distant continent," said Shi Yinhong, professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing.

Neil Thomas, a fellow on Chinese politics at the Asia Society, said China sees Taiwan as an internal affair and so was unlikely to cite U.S. actions against Venezuela as precedent for any cross-strait military strikes.

"Beijing will want a clear contrast with Washington to trumpet its claims to stand for peace, development and moral leadership," Thomas said. "Xi does not care about Venezuela more than he cares about China. He'll be hoping that it turns into a quagmire for the United States."

Wang Ting-yu, a senior lawmaker from Taiwan’s ruling party who sits on the parliament’s foreign affairs and defence committee, rejected the idea that China might follow the U.S. example and strike Taiwan.

"China has never lacked hostility toward Taiwan, but it genuinely lacks the feasible means," Wang posted on Facebook. "China is not the United States, and Taiwan is certainly not Venezuela. If China could actually pull it off, it would have done so long ago!"

Still, the situation amplifies risks for Taiwan and could press Taipei to seek more favour from the Trump administration, some observers said.

On China's Weibo social media platform, discussions of the U.S. attack trended heavily on Sunday, with several users saying Beijing should learn from what Trump did.

Lev Nachman, a political science professor at National Taiwan University, said he expected Taiwan's government to express lightly worded support for American action on Venezuela. Taiwan has not yet made any statement.

"What I do think Trump's actions could do is to help Xi Jinping's narrative in the future to create more justification for action against Taiwan," he said.</description><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 09:41:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/R676NTGGAZKJXK267DKBKJ5E3Y.jpg?auth=d05140924008721a8d2d986990893db52cd2f58068ff73dbb57ecbc4edaf5747&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israeli forces kill three Palestinians in Gaza, local authorities say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-forces-kill-three-palestinians-gaza-local-authorities-say-2026-01-04/</link><description>CAIRO, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Israeli forces shot and killed at least three Palestinians in separate incidents in the southern Gaza Strip city of Khan Younis on Sunday, local health authorities said.

Medics reported that the dead included a 15‑year‑old boy, a fisherman killed outside areas still occupied by Israel in the enclave, and a third man who was shot and killed east of the city in areas under Israeli control.

The Israeli military had no immediate comment on the reported incidents.

Israel has carried out repeated air strikes since a ceasefire took effect in October, saying they are aimed at preventing attacks or destroying militant infrastructure.

Gaza’s health ministry says 420 Palestinians have been killed since the ceasefire began, while militants have killed three Israeli soldiers.

Israel and Hamas have traded blame for violations of the ceasefire agreement brokered under U.S. President Donald Trump.

Israel retained control of 53% of Gaza under the first phase of Trump's plan, which involved the release of hostages held by militants in Gaza and of Palestinians detained by Israel.

The final hostage remains to be handed over are those of an Israeli police officer killed on October 7, 2023 - the day Gazan militants invaded Israel, killing 1,200 and taking some 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.

Israel's military assault on Gaza has killed more than 71,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza health ministry, and led to accusations of genocide and war crimes that Israel denies.</description><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 09:43:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/6KLKJOWVSROQLCYAKF7KYIQNVE.jpg?auth=6ed23fc7749dbe126e520259f942c88fd69c4a640f712c854df25a8072d98eaa&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Numerous teenagers among the dead in Swiss bar blaze, police say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/numerous-teenagers-among-dead-swiss-bar-blaze-police-say-2026-01-04/</link><description>ZURICH, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Teenagers as young as 14 and 15 years old were among those who died in the bar fire on New Year's Eve that killed 40 people in Switzerland, police said on Sunday.

Police in Valais said they had identified 16 more of those who died in the blaze in Crans-Montana, one of the worst disasters in recent Swiss history.

Those newly identified included 10 Swiss nationals, two Italians, one person with Italian-Emirati citizenship, one Romanian, one person from France and one from Turkey, Valais police said. No names were given.

The youngest person identified so far is a 14-year-old Swiss woman, while two 15-year-old Swiss women were also among the dead.

Ten of the other bodies identified on Sunday were teenagers aged 16 to 18, police said. Also identified among the dead were two Swiss men aged 20 and 31, and a French national aged 39.

In total, police have now identified 24 of those who died in the blaze in the mountain resort, in southern Switzerland.

Late on Saturday police said two Swiss women aged 24 and 22 along with two Swiss men aged 21 and 18 had been identified.

Officials are still trying to identify others killed in the fire at the Le Constellation bar.

Some 119 people suffered injuries, including severe burns, with many transferred to burn units in hospitals around Europe. Work on identifying the dead and the injured are continuing, the police said.

Two people who ran the bar are under criminal investigation on suspicion of offences including homicide by negligence, prosecutors said on Saturday.</description><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 10:21:26 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LJ6SKPU5ZVLXDFLEN4FFFQ6GD4.jpg?auth=66ab360163ee37152562193dffa7f21358010cfbe2a54a933e6fcd93dd994445&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Greek airports halt flights due to radio frequency issues</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/greek-airports-halt-flights-due-radio-frequency-issues-2026-01-04/</link><description>Jan 4 - Airports across Greece have suspended arrivals and departures on Sunday after unspecified issues affecting radio frequencies, Greek state TV and the country's aviation authority said.</description><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 10:45:52 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/J2OT46IMSVO2LHG3HHCW3T5WGM.jpg?auth=1bb42dc711388997fd45b2f1aac58ca16ebd233c55b315fd77faa5f6343d7aff&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Cuba denounces 'state terrorism' against Venezuela as US warns Havana could be next</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260104-cuba-diaz-canel-denounces-state-terrorism-against-venezuela-us-rubio-trump-warns-havana-could-be-next</link><description>Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel on Saturday condemned the United States for attacking Venezuela and capturing its president Nicolas Maduro at a rally of thousands of Havana residents in front of the US Embassy in the Cuban capital.

"Cuba condemns and denounces these actions as an act of state terrorism," Diaz-Canel said.

"It is a shocking violation of the norms of international law – the military aggression against a peaceful nation that poses no threat to the United States," he added.

Venezuela supplies around 30% of Cuba's already scarce oil imports in exchange for thousands of medical personnel who work in the South American country.

Analysts agree the loss of the oil would be a devastating blow to Cuba's already shaky power grid and energy supplies.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio hinted that Cuba could be the next target of the Trump administration’s push to restore American dominance in the Western Hemisphere.

Rubio said he would be a bit concerned if he were a Cuban government official following the overnight US military operation in Venezuela. “If I lived in Havana and I was in the government, I’d be concerned at least a little bit,” said Rubio, who has had a long preoccupation with both Venezuela and Cuba.

The US has had a long history of military interventions in Latin America , including its tacit support for the unsuccessful 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion led by Cuban exiles aimed at toppling Fidel Castro .

Meanwhile, thousands of Cubans are worried over the fate of relatives and friends working in Venezuela. Cuba's health ministry tweeted on Saturday they were "well protected".

In an interview US President Donald Trump gave to the New York Post on Saturday, he said he is not considering additional military action against Cuba.

“No, Cuba is going to fall of its own volition. Cuba is doing very poorly,” Trump said.

“Cuba was always very reliant on Venezuela. That’s where they got their money, and they protected Venezuela, but that didn’t work out too well in this case,” the president said.

Cuba is suffering through a six-year crisis which has seen economic growth fall at least 15%, according to the government, causing shortages of basic goods, soaring inflation, crumbling services and widespread power outages.

The government largely blames tougher US sanctions imposed during the first Trump administration, on top of the decades-old trade embargo, for the crisis.</description><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 10:46:19 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/21779c4c-e957-11f0-8a99-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26003682662963.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>North Korea condemns US strikes on Venezuela as 'serious encroachment of sovereignty'</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/north-korea-condemns-us-strikes-venezuela-serious-encroachment-sovereignty-2026-01-04/</link><description>SEOUL, Jan 4 (Reuters) - North Korea has denounced the U.S. strikes on Venezuela as "the most serious form of encroachment of sovereignty," state news agency KCNA said on Sunday.

"The incident is another example that clearly confirms once again the rogue and brutal nature of the United States," KCNA said, citing a spokesperson for North Korea's Foreign Ministry.

The statement came after North Korea launched ballistic missiles earlier on Sunday, the day the leader of South Korea begins a state visit to China, Pyongyang's chief ally.

Deaths and arrests have been reported through the week both by state media and rights groups, though the numbers have differed. Reuters has not been able to verify the figures independently.

The protests are the biggest in three years and while smaller than some previous bouts of unrest to rattle the Islamic Republic, they come at a moment of vulnerability with the economy in tatters and international pressure building.

U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to come to the protesters' aid if they face violence, saying on Friday "we are locked and loaded and ready to go" but without specifying any actions he was considering.

That warning prompted threats of retaliation against U.S. forces in the region from senior Iranian officials and Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Iran "will not yield to the enemy".

Kurdish rights group Hengaw reported that at least 17 people had been killed since the start of the protests. HRANA, a network of rights activists, said at least 16 people had been killed and 582 arrested.

The most intense clashes have been reported in western parts of Iran but there have also been protests and clashes between demonstrators and police in the capital Tehran, in central areas, and in the southern Baluchistan province.

Late on Saturday the governor of Qom, the conservative centre of Iran's Shi'ite Muslim clerical establishment, said two people had been killed there in unrest, adding that one of them had died when an explosive device he made blew up prematurely.

HRANA and the state-affiliated Tasnim news agency reported that authorities had detained the administrator of online accounts urging protests.

Protests began a week ago among bazaar traders and shopkeepers before spreading to university students and then provincial cities, where some protesters have been chanting against Iran's clerical rulers.

Iran has had inflation above 36% since the start of its year in March and the rial currency has lost around half its value against the dollar, causing hardship for many people.

International sanctions over Iran's expensive nuclear programme have been reimposed, the government has struggled to provide water and electricity across the country through the year and global financial bodies predict a recession in 2026.

Authorities have attempted a dual approach to the protests - acknowledging the economic crisis and offering dialogue with demonstrators while meeting more forceful displays of dissent with violence.

Khamenei said on Saturday that although authorities would talk to protesters, "rioters should be put in their place".</description><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 11:39:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/R55EIDRSYVJZBIBIVXGBQFF5W4.jpg?auth=5183957e771e85a8e590c75dda0c41d32453ec192c30b07941ecef58163867ae&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>At least 30 killed in Nigeria market attack, police say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/least-30-killed-nigeria-market-attack-police-say-2026-01-04/</link><description>MAIDUGURI, Nigeria, Jan 4 (Reuters) - At least 30 people were killed and several others abducted when gunmen attacked a market in Nigeria's Niger State, police said on Sunday.

Police spokesperson Wasiu Abiodun said the gunmen, locally called bandits, stormed Kasuwan Daji market in Demo village, at around 4:30 p.m. on Saturday burning stalls and looting food items.

"Over 30 victims lost their lives during the attack, and some persons were also kidnapped. Efforts are ongoing to rescue the kidnapped victims," Abiodun said.

Witnesses said the gunmen arrived on motorcycles and opened fire indiscriminately. They said the violence was part of a series of raids that began on Friday in the nearby villages Agwarra and Borgu.

“Women and children were not spared,” said Dauda Shakulle, who was wounded while fleeing. "There has been no presence of security forces since the attacks began. We are currently recovering corpses."

The Nigerian military did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The attack came weeks after gunmen seized more than 300 children and staff of a Catholic school in the state in central Nigeria. Those victims were released after nearly a month in captivity.

Such banditry has escalated across northwestern and central Nigeria, with armed groups carrying out mass killings and kidnappings in rural communities. Security forces have struggled to contain the violence despite ongoing operations.

Witness Khalid Pissa said the gunmen attacked communities in Kasuwan Daji, and also in nearby Chukama and Shanga. Pissa put the death toll at 40.</description><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 12:41:26 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Pope Leo calls for Venezuela to remain an independent country</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/pope-leo-calls-venezuela-remain-an-independent-country-2026-01-04/</link><description>VATICAN CITY, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Pope Leo called for Venezuela to remain an independent nation and said he was following developments after the United States' toppling of President Nicolas Maduro with a "soul full of concern" on Sunday.

Leo, the first American pope, also called for respect for human rights and the rule of law "as enshrined" in Venezuela's constitution.

"We must not delay in overcoming violence and embarking on paths of justice and peace, while guaranteeing the country's sovereignty," the pope told pilgrims in St. Peter's Square during his Sunday prayer.

U.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday said the U.S. would take control of oil-rich Venezuela after ordering a raid to capture Maduro, who is currently being held in a New York detention center awaiting drug charges.

Leo, who has criticized some of Trump's right-wing policies, in December had urged the U.S. president not to oust Maduro using military force.

"The good of the beloved Venezuelan people must prevail over every other consideration," said the pontiff.</description><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 12:41:31 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/RPHI4WD2UZLELOK7X7TNM2VB5A.jpg?auth=266f7e2233c94d4f3452446db8cb923da8fd3ebfaca237a312e03db47a384d09&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Britain's Starmer says leadership change would 'not be in national interest'</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/britains-starmer-says-leadership-change-would-not-be-national-interest-2026-01-04/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 4 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on Sunday he would still be in power this time next year, in the face of low poll numbers and speculation about a possible leadership challenge.

Starmer told the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg it was not in the national interest to "chop and change" the country's leader as had happened under the previous Conservative government.

His Labour Party is trailing the populists Reform UK in opinion polls 18 months after winning a landslide victory in the 2024 national election.

The prime minister's personal rating is at historic lows as Labour prepares for local elections in England, Wales and Scotland in May.

Starmer said the elections would not be a "referendum" on his government, but Labour would "fight for every vote".

Asked if there were any circumstances in which he could stand down if a poor showing prompted a challenge to his leadership, he said he would stay the course.

"Under the last government we saw constant chopping and changing of leadership, of teams — it caused utter chaos, utter chaos, and it's amongst the reasons that the Tories (Conservatives) were booted out so effectively at the last election," he said.

"Nobody wants to go back to that. It's not in our national interest. We know from that evidence what happens if you go down that chaotic path, and I'm not going to take us back to that kind of chaos."

Conservative lawmakers in effect forced Prime Minister Boris Johnson to stand down in 2022, resulting in the premiership of Liz Truss, the shortest in British history. She was replaced by Rishi Sunak, who led the party to defeat in 2024.

Starmer said in a New Year message on Thursday that life for many Britons was still "harder than it should be", but people would start to see positive changes in public services and improvements in the cost of living this year.

"I will be judged, and I know I'll be judged, when we get to the next election on whether I've delivered on the key things that matter most to people," he told Kuenssberg.</description><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 12:41:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/JXQVY7TNBFNB3H2GZWK66DLW7Y.jpg?auth=7928cd10e46532dc1317718ab534e969837ad752cfbc15725b3e676b5853aa7c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Spain 'strongly condemns' violation of international law in Venezuela, PM says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/spain-strongly-condemns-violation-international-law-venezuela-pm-says-2026-01-04/</link><description>MADRID, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Spain condemned what it called a violation of international law in Venezuela, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez wrote in a letter sent to members of his Socialist Party on Sunday after U.S. President Donald Trump's raid to capture Nicolas Maduro .

His comments went further than his remarks on Saturday in which he said he would not recognise the intervention.

The Socialists' hard-left coalition partner Sumar had urged the government to condemn the U.S. strikes that resulted in the Venezuelan president's capture, with party sources describing it as an act of imperialist piracy against a member state of the United Nations.

Sanchez's letter described the "violation of international law in Venezuela, an act that we strongly condemn".

Trump says Maduro masterminded the flow of drugs into the U.S. and was illegitimately in power due to vote-rigging. Maduro denies those claims and officials in Caracas have demanded his release.

Spain is home to the largest Venezuelan migrant population outside Latin America and the U.S., and they include senior opposition figures such as Edmundo Gonzalez and Leopoldo Lopez.

On Sunday, hundreds of left-wing protesters demonstrated at the U.S. embassy in Madrid to oppose Washington's actions after thousands of opposition activists and others gathered at Madrid's Puerta del Sol on Saturday to celebrate Maduro's detention.

The question of the legality of the U.S. action is likely to be the subject of much debate. International law prohibits the use of force in international relations except for narrow exceptions such as authorisation by the U.N. Security Council or in self-defence.

The accident occurred just before 8 p.m. local time (1900 GMT) on Saturday when the large canoe, which had departed Adiyani village in northwestern Jigawa State, overturned en route to Garbi in Yobe State. The vessel was carrying 52 passengers, according to Mohammed Goje, head of the Yobe State Emergency Management Agency.

"So far, 13 passengers have been rescued alive, while 25 bodies have been recovered. Search and rescue operations are ongoing for 14 missing persons," Goje said, adding that emergency teams from neighbouring towns had joined local volunteers and security agencies at the scene.

Police in Jigawa State confirmed the incident and said the canoe capsized due to leakage. "It was a market day, and the victims were returning home after trading. If the driver survives, he will be prosecuted for negligence," said Lawan Adam, the state police spokesperson, noting that safety laws banning night journeys and overloading were ignored.

Babagana Shettima, a resident of Adiyani, said casualties were from both his village and the destination in Yobe. "When the boat's arrival was delayed, relatives raised the alarm. It was later discovered the canoe had capsized halfway. Divers recovered some bodies," he told Reuters.

Deadly boat accidents are common in Nigeria, where vessels often operate without safety measures. In September, at least 60 people died when an overloaded boat sank after it collided with a tree stump in Niger State, central Nigeria.</description><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 13:30:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>The week in pictures: New Year celebrations, Venezuela's Maduro captured and AFCON 2025</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260104-the-week-in-pictures-new-year-celebrations-venezuela-s-maduro-captured-and-afcon-2025</link><description /><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 13:30:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/97a393ac-e7c3-11f0-bc0c-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-01T140813Z-1655288027-RC25SIATZP78-RTRMADP-3-NEW-YEAR-USA-NEW-YORK.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Crans-Montana holds silent procession for victims of the fire</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/grieving-swiss-town-holds-silent-procession-victims-deadly-bar-fire-2026-01-04/</link><description>CRANS-MONTANA, Switzerland, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Hundreds of people silently filed through the frosty streets of the Swiss ski resort of Crans-Montana on Sunday to remember victims of a New Year bar fire that killed at least 40 people and injured more than a hundred others.

Following a packed church mass that spilled outdoors, the crowd slowly walked towards an impromptu shrine to the victims next to the "Le Constellation" bar that went up in flames in the early hours of January 1.

"It's to be together with the people who are suffering, who have lost somebody in the family, children or friends," said 76-year-old Charlotte Schumacher, a participant in the procession. "I know people who have lost their grandchildren."

Teenagers as young as 14 or 15 years old were among the dead, and the severity of the burns suffered by the victims has made the process of identifying them difficult.

Attendees of the interconfessional church service hugged and shook hands as the prosperous Alpine town sought to pull together to process the trauma of one of the deadliest tragedies to strike modern Switzerland.

Prosecutors said the fire was likely caused by sparkling candles igniting the ceiling of its basement. Swiss authorities have put the two people who ran the bar under investigation on suspicion of crimes including homicide by negligence.

The injured and missing came from all corners of Europe and as far afield as Australia, underlining the international appeal of the picturesque resort with panoramic views of the Alps.

But most of the tally were Swiss. The toll might have been worse if emergency services had not acted so quickly, residents said.

"Within minutes you had ambulances; within minutes you had the police that did their job and they did it unbelievably well," said Max Haus, a local business owner who witnessed the harrowing aftermath of the blaze.

As Sunday's sombre procession reached its conclusion, applause began rippling from one end to the other as dozens of police and emergency services workers, some of them in tears, came up through the middle to be celebrated as heroes.

"It's unimaginable what they did, what they have seen," Bruno Huggler, the director of tourism for Crans-Montana, said of the rescue workers. "And now it's very important to take care of them."</description><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 13:48:54 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/3VUXTLLIYZLZJJP2GJVQHVIW4I.jpg?auth=fccb4536856fb6d9597fa0cc627f3e8afe36f9b2e83feab3330851f29ee6cbe9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>At least 114 killed in week of fighting in Sudan’s Darfur</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/africa/20260104-at-least-114-killed-in-week-of-fighting-in-sudan-s-darfur</link><description>Attacks by Sudan 's army and its paramilitary foes on two Darfur towns over the past week have killed 114 people, medical sources told AFP Sunday.

Following years of economic crisis and U.S. sanctions that severed the country from international capital markets, Venezuela defaulted in late 2017 after missing payments on international bonds issued by the government and state oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela, known as PDVSA.

Since then, accumulated interest and legal claims tied to past expropriations have added to unpaid principal, swelling total external liabilities far beyond the face value of the original bonds.

Venezuela's distressed debt has rallied since U.S. President Donald Trump came to power in January 2025 as speculators bet on the possibility of political change.

Below is a look at which entities owe money, what could be included in a restructuring and who might be knocking on Caracas' door to collect.

Analysts estimate that Venezuela has about $60 billion of defaulted bonds outstanding. However, total external debt including PDVSA obligations, bilateral loans and arbitration awards stand at roughly $150-$170 billion, depending on how accrued interest and court judgments are counted, according to analysts.

The International Monetary Fund estimates Venezuela's nominal GDP at about $82.8 billion for 2025, implying a debt-to-GDP ratio of between 180%-200%.

A PDVSA bond originally maturing in 2020 was secured by a majority stake in U.S.-based refiner Citgo, which is ultimately owned by Caracas-headquartered PDVSA. Citgo is an asset now at the center of court-supervised efforts by creditors to recover value.

Years of sanctions, including a prohibition on trading Venezuela’s debt, have made it hard to keep tabs on ownership.

The largest share of commercial creditors likely consists of international bondholders, including specialist distressed-debt investors, sometimes called vulture funds.

Among the creditors is a group of companies awarded compensation through international arbitration after assets were expropriated by Caracas. U.S. courts have upheld multi-billion-dollar awards to ConocoPhillips and Crystallex among others, turning those claims into debt obligations and allowing creditors to pursue Venezuelan assets to make themselves whole.

A growing pool of court-recognized claimants is competing for recovery from Citgo’s parent company through U.S. legal proceedings. A Delaware court registered about $19 billion in claims for the auction of PDV Holding, Citgo's parent, which far exceeds the estimated value of Citgo's total assets. PDV Holding is PDVSA’s wholly-owned subsidiary.

Caracas also has bilateral creditors, primarily China and Russia, which extended loans to both Maduro and his mentor, former president Hugo Chavez.

Precise numbers are hard to verify since Venezuela has not published comprehensive debt statistics in years.

Given the plethora of claims, legal proceedings and political uncertainty, a formal restructuring is expected to be complex and lengthy.

A sovereign debt workout could be anchored by an IMF program setting fiscal targets and debt-sustainability assumptions. However, Venezuela has not had an IMF annual consultation in nearly two decades and remains locked out of the lender’s financing.

U.S. sanctions are another obstacle. Since 2017, restrictions imposed under both Republican and Democratic administrations have sharply limited Venezuela's ability to issue or restructure debt without explicit licenses from the U.S. Treasury.

It is unclear what will happen with U.S. sanctions. For now, President Donald Trump has said the U.S. will "run" the .

Bonds have returned some 95% at the index level in 2025.

Many of them currently trade between 27-32 cents on the dollar, MarketAxess data shows.

Citigroup analysts in November estimated that a principal haircut of at least 50% would be needed to restore debt sustainability and satisfy potential conditions from the IMF.

Under Citi’s base case, Venezuela could offer creditors a 20-year bond with a coupon of around 4.4%, alongside a 10-year zero-coupon note to compensate for past-due interest. Using an exit yield of 11%, Citi estimates the net present value of the package in the mid-40s cents on the dollar, with recoveries potentially rising into the high-40s if Venezuela were to hand out additional contingent instruments such as oil-linked warrants.

Other investors sketch a wider range. Aberdeen Investments said in September it had initially assumed recoveries of around 25 cents on the dollar for Venezuelan bonds, but that improved political and sanctions scenarios could lift recoveries into the low-to-mid-30s, depending on the structure of any deal and the use of oil-linked or GDP-style instruments.

Recovery assumptions sit against a grim backdrop .

Venezuela’s economy shrank dramatically after 2013 when oil production fell off a cliff, inflation spiraled and poverty surged. Although output has stabilized somewhat, lower global oil prices and discounts to Venezuela's crude prices limit revenue gains, leaving little room to service debt without deep restructuring. The recent U.S. blockade of sanctioned oil tankers has exacerbated the situation.

Trump said American oil companies were prepared to tackle the difficult task of entering Venezuela and investing to restore production but details and timelines remain unclear. Chevron is the only American major currently operating in Venezuela's oil fields.</description><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 14:42:04 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/FW6UURHTUVJU3F3PBWNR3UUIEA.jpg?auth=ee594f60da6e7996e6f0a4b02cba73caf75bbf6990477684433a1a3552a8597a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Yemeni government accuses separatists of Aden restrictions</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/yemeni-government-accuses-separatists-aden-restrictions-2026-01-04/</link><description>DUBAI, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Yemen's Saudi-backed government on Sunday accused UAE-backed southern separatists of cutting off the port city of Aden and warned it would "take all necessary measures" after recapturing territory from them in the east on Saturday.

The separatists denied having restricted movement into Aden, but the government accusations indicate that hostility between the sides persists despite proposals for a dialogue that had raised hopes of a negotiated solution to the crisis.

The conflict between the government and the Southern Transitional Council since early last month has triggered a major feud between the Gulf powers and fractured the coalition fighting Houthi forces.

The Iran-backed Houthis seized the capital Sanaa in 2014 and Gulf countries intervened the following year in support of the internationally recognised government, splitting Yemen into rival zones of control.

The government, in a statement from the presidential office to official media, said the STC had taken measures to restrict movement of citizens into Aden and that it had also received reports of a campaign of arrests in the city.

The STC told Reuters it rejected the accusations, calling them a complete distortion of the facts, and said the situation in Aden was stable.

Reuters could not verify the accusations.

A senior government official told Reuters that forces would continue to advance towards Aden. Any dialogue would only begin once Aden was secured, the official said, without elaborating.

Aden has been the main seat of power outside Houthi-controlled areas since 2015 but leaders of the internationally recognised government left the city for Saudi Arabia early last month when the STC seized control.

On Saturday, as government forces said they had retaken Mukalla in the eastern province of Hadramout, residents of areas around Aden said STC fighters had put up checkpoints.

Meanwhile Aden airport closed on Thursday after a dispute over flights between the city and the UAE, with the STC and the government trading blame over which side had shut down air traffic. At least one flight took off on Sunday, travellers and airport officials said.

The U.S. embassy also said it had received reports of closures and redirected flights to and from the Yemeni island of Socotra.

The internationally recognised government said late on Friday it had asked Saudi Arabia to host a forum to resolve the southern issue. Riyadh said it would do so and extended invitations to southern factions.

The STC welcomed this late on Saturday, a potential sign that all sides now see negotiation as the eventual means of ending the brief conflict triggered early last month when the separatists suddenly seized swathes of territory.

Government forces backed by Saudi airstrikes on Friday and Saturday took back control of the strategically important Hadramout province in the east of Yemen.</description><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 15:20:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ORRDY2S2D5NGBO64V6WA6FF3XI.jpg?auth=b597960c9819e60afc93944153d2e5917d593e629d179610641e8cec79742245&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Berlin power grid attack caused by 'extreme leftists', officials say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/berlin-power-grid-attack-caused-by-extreme-leftists-officials-say-2026-01-04/</link><description>FRANKFURT, Jan 4 (Reuters) - A fire in southwest Berlin that has left tens of thousands in the German capital without electricity was likely the result of a far-left extremist attack, officials said on Sunday.

Grid company Stromnetz Berlin said on Saturday that the suspected arson attack could leave up to 45,000 households without power until January 8.

On Sunday, it said efforts to restore power were ongoing, with around 35,000 households and 1,900 commercial entities still affected.

Following the attack, local media published a letter purportedly from a far-left activist organisation called the Volcano Group that claimed responsibility for the incident, saying its actions were directed at the fossil-fuel based energy industry.

"The letter claiming responsibility has been classified as authentic by the security authorities," Iris Spranger, Berlin's interior affairs minister, said in a post on x.

"I condemn this inhumane attack on Berliners and visitors to the city in the strongest possible terms. The investigation is ongoing."

French farmers have been protesting over a ​planned European trade deal with the South American Mercosur bloc, and other issues ‍including measures to contain a livestock disease.

Agriculture Minister Annie Genevard said the tighter checks would make sure food coming from ​outside the EU did not include substances banned in food produced in ​the bloc.

A decree would be issued soon announcing the suspension of imports of some food products already known to contain those substances, she added.

"Imports, regardless of from where they come in the world, must comply with our standards. France is setting an example in Europe by issuing this unprecedented decree that concerns more than a dozen food products," wrote Genevard on X.

"Melons, apples, apricots, cherries, strawberries, grapes, potatoes: ‍they will only be on sale in France if they show no residue of these substances banned in our ​country. Other products from South America such as avocados, mangos, guavas, or certain citrus fruits from elsewhere will only be allowed in if they comply with our standards," she added.

Prime ‌Minister Sébastien Lecornu said earlier that any imported product showing traces of these weed and fungus killers – namely mancozeb, glufosinate, thiophanate-methyl, and carbendazim ‍which are banned in Europe – will not be allowed in France.

Germany and Spain back the Mercosur deal, but opponents in France say the trade arrangement would lead to cheap imports of South American commodities, notably beef, that do not meet the European Union 's environmental and food safety standards.

"Protecting our farmers, guaranteeing the health of French people and standing up to any form of unfair competition while making ‍sure our rules are respected – this is non-negotiable. It is up to the European Commission to make ‌sure this is generalised ​across the board. If necessary, we will do it again," added Genevard.</description><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 16:27:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/51a0e8d2-e985-11f0-adf3-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25352523125527.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Large part of Maduro's security team killed in US action, minister says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/large-part-maduros-security-team-killed-us-action-venezuela-defense-minister-2026-01-04/</link><description>Jan 4 (Reuters) - A large part of erstwhile President Nicolas Maduro's security team was killed in the U.S. raid that led to the leader's Saturday capture, Venezuelan Defense Minister General Vladimir Padrino said in a televised statement on Sunday morning.

At least 152 members of the UAE-backed STC forces were wounded and 130 were taken captive, the official said, giving a preliminary toll of casualties since the start of the Saudi-backed operation.

Forces supported by Riyadh began operations on Friday to retake swathes of territory seized by the STC, which is backed by Abu Dhabi , as a struggle for dominance deepened a rift between the two Gulf allies.

Most of the casualties occurred in strikes by the Saudi-led coalition that targeted military camps held by the separatists , the official said, including Al-Khasha and Barshid military camps in Hadramawt province.

An official with the Saudi-backed forces told AFP later Sunday that at least 14 of their fighters had been killed in fighting and over 30 wounded during the offensive.

Yemen's presidency on Saturday announced the retaking of resource-rich Hadramawt , following an apparent retreat of the STC.

Riyadh-aligned government military officials on Saturday also said authorities in neighbouring Mahra province had switched back their allegiance without any resistance.

On Sunday, Saudi-backed forces were consolidating positions in Mukalla, the capital of Hadramawt province, two government military officials told AFP.

But amid the chaos of the fighting and rapid retreats, a law enforcement official in Mukalla told AFP that at least 18 suspected militants affiliated with Al-Qaeda had escaped from a local detention centre in the port city.

Local residents also reported that sporadic clashes were taking place between forces loyal to the STC and the Saudi-backed fighters in Mahra province.

Riyadh and Abu Dhabi have long supported rival groups in Yemen's divided government.

A December offensive by the STC, in which it took control of Hadramawt and Mahra, angered Saudi Arabia , exposing fissures in the ties between the two oil-rich powers.

The Saudi-led coalition launched repeated warnings and air strikes over the past week, including one on an alleged Emirati arms shipment to the separatists.

On Friday, a strike on the Al-Khasha military camp in Hadramawt left 20 dead, according to an earlier toll from the separatist group.

On Saturday, a military official with the STC told AFP Saudi warplanes had carried out "intense" air strikes on another of the group's camps at Barshid, west of Mukalla.

The Yemeni government is a patchwork of groups that includes the separatists, and is held together by shared opposition to the Iran-backed Houthis.

The Houthis pushed the government out of Yemen's capital Sanaa in 2014 and secured control over most of the north.

The Iran-backed group has been at war with the government, backed by a Saudi-led coalition since 2015, in a conflict that has killed hundreds of thousands of Yemenis and triggered a major humanitarian crisis.</description><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 17:42:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/0a9b6000-e991-11f0-a9b5-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-04T145208Z-43020088-RC29UIAX6XAC-RTRMADP-3-YEMEN-SECURITY.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Crans-Montana mourns fire victims, pays tribute to emergency services workers</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260104-swiss-town-mourns-fire-victims-pays-tribute-to-emergency-services-workers</link><description>Hundreds of people silently filed through the frosty streets of the Swiss ski resort of Crans-Montana on Sunday to remember victims of a New Year bar fire that killed at least ​40 people and injured more than a hundred others.

Trump initially praised Rodriguez on Saturday after U.S. forces seized Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro and his wife from Caracas. Rodriguez said later, however, that her country would defend its natural resources.

"If she doesn’t do what’s right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro," Trump was quoted as saying in the telephone interview held as he arrived at his West Palm Beach golf course in Florida.

The U.S. president defended his decision to take Maduro by force, telling the magazine: "You know, rebuilding there and regime change, anything you want to call it, is better than what you have right now. Can’t get any worse."

Trump also said other countries may be subject to American intervention. "We do need Greenland, absolutely,” he said of the island that is part of Denmark, a NATO country.</description><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 18:52:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/P25TAHV7JRLZBN46S63TSG6XXI.jpg?auth=d5810c33f762324f5d31b123c06c3b5039fd466401bcfb397a1b52e31df7eba2&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Latvia PM says Baltic Sea optical cable has been damaged</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/latvia-pm-says-baltic-sea-optical-cable-has-been-damaged-2026-01-04/</link><description>VILNIUS, Jan 4 (Reuters) - An optical cable belonging to a private company has been damaged in the Baltic Sea, Latvia's Prime Minister Evika Silina said in a statement on Sunday, adding that the circumstances of the incident were under investigation.

The cable connects Lithuania and Latvia, and it was not immediately clear what had caused the incident, Lithuania's National Crisis Management Centre said in a separate statement.

The Baltic Sea region is on high alert after a string of power cable, telecom link and gas pipeline outages since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022 , and the NATO military alliance has boosted its presence with frigates, aircraft and naval drones.

The latest incident is made public five days after Finnish police seized a cargo vessel en route from Russia to Israel on suspicion of sabotaging an undersea telecoms cable running from Helsinki across the Gulf of Finland to Estonia.</description><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 19:16:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/K5OKVO55WFK33CHXUEFJVSVWDE.jpg?auth=36dac4994ddfd47a1856f20e979524f383ff00a007811cc16f0fd367670e8040&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Guinea's Supreme Court confirms Mamady Doumbouya as election winner</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/africa/20260104-guinea-s-supreme-court-confirms-mamady-doumbouya-as-election-winner</link><description>Junta chief Mamady Doumbouya won the Guinean presidential election with 86.72 percent of votes, according to official results published by the Supreme Court on Sunday.

Jonatan Mallora, a 50-year-old motorcycle taxi driver, and his neighbor Angel Alvarez, a young street vendor, said they woke on Saturday to explosions in their community in La Guaira state, about 31 kilometers (19 miles) north of Caracas.

Venezuelan authorities have said the U.S. hit areas in La Guaira, Caracas and the neighboring states of Miranda and Aragua and that soldiers, civilians and much of Maduro's security team were killed, though they have not offered specific figures on dead and injured.

The small Romulo Gallegos neighborhood, where Mallora and Alvarez live, was damaged in the U.S. attack on a nearby naval academy.

“It's sheer luck they didn't kill my kids,” Mallora said amid the rubble of his apartment, where the roof was destroyed. He said he fled and escaped unharmed along with his 24-year-old daughter and 22-year-old son.

Alvarez surveyed shrapnel damage to his apartment wall and water tank — vital in a country where water supply is unreliable. He said he was relieved to have a spare tank and his home remained standing, unlike Mallora's.

“We really didn’t know what to do,” Alvarez said, recalling how he ran back and forth after waking to the deafening noise.

“I would never wish on anyone" the experience of an attack, he added. “We’re alive by a miracle.”</description><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 19:37:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/QIZ7KXG7GFN55GVH6CHJ6F3IUY.jpg?auth=e326d4c40ddee248e524b6f81c75b578a80c08b2f230bdf337b1dad572a6bf9b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Swiss police: last 16 victims of New Year's bar fire have been identified</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/swiss-police-last-16-victims-new-years-bar-fire-have-been-identified-2026-01-04/</link><description>ZURICH, Jan 4 (Reuters) - The last 16 people who died in the New Year's Eve bar fire at the Swiss mountain resort of Crans-Montana have been identified, police said on Sunday.

The U.S. attacked Venezuela on Saturday and deposed its long-serving President Nicolas Maduro in an overnight operation, in Washington's most direct intervention in Latin America since the 1989 invasion of Panama.

"The EU recalls that, under all circumstances, the principles of international law and the U.N. Charter must be upheld. Members of the United Nations Security Council have a particular responsibility to uphold those principles, as a pillar of the international security architecture," the EU's top diplomat Kaja Kallas said in a statement supported by 26 of the 27 EU nations.

The joint statement called for restraint from all sides to ensure a peaceful solution. The EU has said Maduro lacked democratic legitimacy, and called for a transition to democracy determined by the will of the Venezuelan people.

"Respecting the will of the Venezuelan people remains the only way for Venezuela to restore democracy and resolve the current crisis," the statement said.

It added that the EU shared the priority of combatting organised crime and drug trafficking. Such challenges must be addressed "through sustained cooperation in full respect of international law and the principles of territorial integrity and sovereignty," the statement said.

Maduro is in a New York detention centre awaiting a Monday court appearance on drug charges. Maduro was indicted in 2020 on U.S. charges including narco-terrorism conspiracy. He has always denied any criminal involvement.

The EU is in close contact with the United States and other partners, the statement said.

A spokesperson for Hungary's representation to the EU did not immediately respond to a request for comment on why it had not signed the statement.</description><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 20:25:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/S3IET3ZQCZLCNLFVTQ3BCSBH7M.jpg?auth=0a2c1664f4a4688781d3b4aee0050ce46c3e931a3ea8d0113955ee956cf2036e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Denmark PM urges Trump to stop threats to take over Greenland</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/denmark-pm-urges-trump-stop-threats-take-over-greenland-2026-01-04/</link><description>COPENHAGEN, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen on Sunday urged U.S. President Donald Trump to stop threatening to take over Greenland, after he reiterated his wish to do so in an interview with The Atlantic magazine.

"It makes absolutely no sense to talk about the U.S. needing to take over Greenland. The U.S. has no right to annex any of the three countries in the Danish Kingdom," Frederiksen said in a statement on Sunday.

Trump told the magazine: "We do need Greenland, absolutely. We need it for defense."

He spoke a day after the U.S. captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and the president said Washington would run the Latin American country.

This raised concerns in Denmark that the same could happen with Greenland, a Danish territory.

Frederiksen said: "I would therefore strongly urge the U.S. stop the threats against a historically close ally and against another country and another people, who have very clearly said that they are not for sale."

The Greenlandic prime minister's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside regular office hours.

Trump on December 21 named Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry as special envoy to Greenland, drawing renewed criticism from Denmark and Greenland over Washington's interest in the mineral-rich Arctic island.

Trump has advocated for Greenland, a self-governing Danish territory, to become part of the United States. Landry publicly supports the idea.

The Arctic island's strategic position between Europe and North America makes it a key site for the U.S. ballistic missile defence system, while its mineral wealth is attractive as the U.S. hopes to reduce its reliance on Chinese exports.

Greenland , a former Danish colony, has the right to declare independence under a 2009 agreement but depends heavily on Danish subsidies.

Denmark has sought to repair strained ties with Greenland over the past year, while also trying to ease tensions with the Trump administration by investing in Arctic defence.</description><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 20:44:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5SYJKI6KEBN5HOYFJKSQ7HWRPM.jpg?auth=b8a23871febe9953bd58630abf8f292a9a0039c6151abcdac05053107bb73ae3&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump bets on intimidation to force Venezuelan leaders into line</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/trump-bets-intimidation-force-venezuelan-leaders-into-line-2026-01-04/</link><description /><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 21:19:31 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Trump warns Venezuela's interim president of 'big price' if she resists US</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260104-trump-warns-venezuela-s-interim-president-of-paying-big-price-if-she-resists-us</link><description>President Donald Trump threatened Sunday that Venezuela 's new leader will pay a "big price" if she does not cooperate with the United States, after US forces seized and jailed her former boss Nicolas Maduro .

If interim president Delcy Rodriguez "doesn't do what's right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro," Trump told The Atlantic in a telephone interview.

US forces attacked Caracas in the early hours of Saturday, bombing military targets and spiriting away Maduro and his wife to face federal narcotrafficking charges in New York. The deposed leader is due to appear in a Manhattan court on Monday.

The Trump administration says it is willing to work with the remainder of Maduro's government as long as Washington's goals, particularly opening access to US investment in Venezuela's enormous crude oil reserves, are met.

The streets of Caracas were calm in the wake of the stunning raid, in which US commandos swooped into Caracas on helicopters, backed by attack jets and naval forces, to capture Maduro.

Residents queued up to buy food in grocery stores, and the masked and heavily armed police visible the previous day were gone, AFP correspondents said.

The Venezuelan military announced it recognized Rodriguez – previously Maduro's vice president – as acting president, and urged people to resume normal life.

Despite the success of the initial US operation, questions mounted over Trump's strategy.

The Senate's top Democrat, Chuck Schumer , told ABC News that Americans were left "scratching their heads in wonderment and in fear".

Trump said Saturday that the United States will "run" Venezuela.

And he told The Atlantic that "rebuilding there and regime change – anything you want to call it – is better than what you have right now".

But Secretary of State Marco Rubio stressed Sunday that Washington is not seeking complete regime change in the South American country of about 30 million people, or elections to restore democracy there.

Rather than seek to topple the entire Maduro government, "we're going to make an assessment on the basis of what they do," he told CBS News.

The United States is fighting drug traffickers, "not a war against Venezuela", Rubio told NBC's "Meet the Press".

However, he said a large US naval presence would remain in the Caribbean to enforce a blockade of Venezuelan oil exports for "tremendous leverage".

Trump has made clear that Washington intends to call the shots in Venezuela, with a focus on securing access to the world's largest proven oil reserves.

"We're going to run the country" until a transition can be made, he said Saturday, also insisting that military "boots on the ground" remained a possibility.

In her first remarks since the US attack, Rodriguez struck a defiant note, saying Maduro was the country's sole legitimate leader and that "we're ready to defend our natural resources".

The deposed Venezuelan leader was in a New York detention centre ahead of his court hearing.

Handcuffed and in sandals, Maduro was escorted by federal agents through a Manhattan US Drug Enforcement Administration facility late Saturday, a video posted by the White House on social media showed.

"Good night, happy new year," the 63-year-old leftist was heard saying in English.

Earlier, he was photographed aboard a US naval ship blindfolded and handcuffed, with noise-canceling ear protectors.

Maduro, a self-described socialist, led Venezuela with an iron fist for more than a decade through a series of elections widely considered rigged. He came to power after the death of his charismatic mentor, Hugo Chavez .

As news of Maduro's capture rippled out, exiled Venezuelans waved flags and celebrated in plazas from Madrid to Santiago. About eight million Venezuelans have fled the grinding poverty and political suppression of their homeland.

Brazil , Chile , Colombia , Mexico , Uruguay and Spain in a joint statement expressed their "rejection" of the US operation and "concern about any attempt at governmental control or administration or outside appropriation of natural or strategic resources".

The UN Security Council was to meet Monday on the crisis.</description><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 21:25:16 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/7f092398-e98a-11f0-9b54-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/000-89K49KE.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>North Korea test-fires hypersonic missiles, KCNA says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/north-korea-test-fires-hypersonic-missiles-kcna-says-2026-01-04/</link><description>SEOUL, Jan 5 (Reuters) - North Korea test-fired hypersonic missiles on Sunday, state media KCNA reported on Monday, to assess its military operational capability regarding war deterrence.</description><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 21:40:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/RXZLLGB6AROHFDG6MKEWBFTOUA.jpg?auth=be463c161c2fca56ace2464834bace85edc616f56884d97834c2f42b98832a0c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Danish PM urges US to stop "threatening" to take control of Greenland</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260104-danish-pm-urges-us-to-stop-threatening-to-take-control-of-greenland</link><description>Denmark called on the United States to stop "threatening" Greenland Sunday as President Donald Trump told US media he "absolutely" needed the territory, a day after Washington seized the leader of Venezuela .

Washington's military intervention in Venezuela has reignited fears for Greenland, which Trump has repeatedly made clear he wants to become an annexed part of the United States.

Those fears were underscored by Trump's comments to The Atlantic magazine and a social media post by the wife of his most influential aide showing Greenland in the colours of the US flag.

"I have to say this very clearly to the United States: it is absolutely absurd to say that the United States should take control of Greenland," Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said in a statement late Sunday.

She called on Washington to stop "threatening its historical ally".

The United States's European allies were rattled by Trump sending in his military on Saturday to attack Caracas and grab Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro , who is now being held in New York.

Trump has said the United States will now "run" Venezuela indefinitely and tap its huge oil reserves.

In Greenland's case, Trump has claimed that making the Danish territory part of the United States would serve US national security interests, given its strategic location on the Arctic.

Greenland is also rich in key critical minerals used in high-tech sectors.

Asked in a telephone interview with The Atlantic about the implications of the Venezuela military operation for Greenland, Trump said that it was up to others to decide, according to the magazine Sunday.

"They are going to have to view it themselves. I really don't know," Trump was quoted as saying.

He added: "But we do need Greenland, absolutely. We need it for defense."

Late Saturday, Katie Miller – wife of Trump's deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller – posted the contentious image of the Danish autonomous territory in the colours of the US flag on her X feed.

Her post had a single word above it: "SOON".

Greenland's Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen called the post "disrespectful".

"Relations between nations and peoples are built on mutual respect and international law – not on symbolic gestures that disregard our status and our rights," he stated on X.

But he also said that "there is neither reason for panic nor for concern. Our country is not for sale, and our future is not decided by social media posts".

Denmark's ambassador to the US, Jesper Moeller Soerensen, reacted earlier on Sunday with his own post saying "we expect full respect for the territorial integrity" of Denmark, above a link to Katie Miller's image.

Moves edging towards that goal by his government – including his appointment of an envoy to the Danish territory – have drawn the ire of both Copenhagen and the European Union.

Stephen Miller is widely seen as the architect of much of Trump's policies, guiding the president on his hardline immigration policies and domestic agenda.

Denmark's ambassador gave a pointed "friendly reminder" in response to Katie Miller's post that his country – a NATO member – has "significantly boosted its Arctic security efforts" and worked together with the US on that.

"We are close allies and should continue to work together as such," Soerensen wrote.

Katie Miller was deputy press secretary under Trump at the Department of Homeland Security during his first term.

She later worked as communications director for then vice president Mike Pence and also acted as his press secretary.</description><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 22:22:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/cbe470fc-e9b5-11f0-86d5-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25297625966686.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Who is 'tsarina' Delcy Rodriguez, the acting president of Venezuela?</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/who-is-tsarina-delcy-rodriguez-acting-president-venezuela-2026-01-04/</link><description>Jan 4 (Reuters) - Delcy Rodriguez, declared the interim president of Venezuela after Nicolas Maduro's capture by U.S. forces, is one of the iron fists in Venezuelan politics, a practitioner of economic orthodoxy who has strived to build relationships with the private sector and who is known for her taste for luxury.

Over more than a decade in public life, the 56-year-old Rodriguez has amassed significant influence, earning her the nickname "the tsarina," while Maduro has called her a "tigress" for her staunch defense of his socialist government, which has presided over a deep economic crisis, alleged torture and arbitrary detentions and the exodus of some 8 million migrants.

She has been vice president since 2018, simultaneously serving first as finance minister and then as oil minister. Before that she was communications minister, foreign minister and the head of a pro-government legislature. She works closely with her brother, Jorge Rodriguez, who is the head of the National Assembly.

The Rodriguez siblings are the children of leftist guerrilla fighter Jorge Antonio Rodriguez, who founded the revolutionary Socialist League Party and was arrested in 1976 for his alleged involvement in the kidnapping of an American businessman.

He died in police custody due to what his family alleges was torture and Maduro has praised him as a hero of the Venezuelan left.

Delcy, a lawyer specializing in labor law, spent nine years in France and England pursuing postgraduate studies.

She participates in table tennis competitions with her brother, which they often share on social media. In public appearances, she's often seen wearing luxury clothing brands.

As vice president, after years of hyperinflation amid U.S. sanctions, she implemented orthodox policies including cutting public spending, limiting credit and a fixed dollar-bolivar rate, which helped lower triple-digit inflation.

She has managed to keep oil production at an average of about 1.1 million barrels per day last year, and her role has put her in close contact with foreign oil companies like Chevron.

Sometimes described by industry leaders as a "workaholic," Rodriguez attends many private sector events, something other public officials neglected to do for years. She is the Venezuelan official who travels most frequently to China, Russia, and Turkey, some of Venezuela's allies.</description><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 23:41:52 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WEP2WT7GR5MTDNKAO6HGVYDN3A.jpg?auth=28013dc0c948fcfa8cc753fc4a9ecce54e4c3f47e756f58efa79db6b3d061313&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump says he doesn't believe Ukraine struck Putin residence</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/trump-says-he-doesnt-believe-ukraine-struck-putin-residence-2026-01-05/</link><description>ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE, Jan 4 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said he did not believe that an alleged Ukrainian strike on President Vladimir Putin's residence took place as claimed by Russia.

"I don't believe that strike happened," Trump told reporters on Sunday aboard Air Force One en route back to Washington, D.C., from Florida. "There is something that happened fairly nearby, but had nothing to do with this."

Moscow accused Kyiv on Monday of trying to strike a residence of Putin in Russia's northern Novgorod region with 91 long-range attack drones, and said Russia would review its negotiating position in ongoing talks with the U.S. on ending the Ukraine war.

While a handful of conservative figures criticized the attack on Venezuela and detainment of Maduro as a betrayal of Trump's "America First" pledge to avoid foreign entanglements, most of the president's Republican allies fell in line.

The early support came even after Trump said the United States would temporarily "run" Venezuela and work to tap its oil reserves, raising the possibility of the kind of open-ended foreign entanglement he and the MAGA base have long opposed.

For now, the base appears willing to cheer on the removal of Maduro, seeing little risk of an escalation into a years-long quagmire like the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, political analysts said.

"This is too recent for there to be significant MAGA-base push back," said Joshua Wilson, a professor of political science at the University of Denver. "There are many questions about how things will develop, and so this could become another test of Trump's ability to frame events and control his base."

The military action comes amid a slump in Trump's approval ratings, with a Reuters/Ipsos poll last month showing that just 39% of U.S. adults approved of his job performance, largely reflecting disappointment over his handling of the economy.

Historically, presidents usually only gain a short-lived political boost from military action, according to Matthew Wilson, a political science professor at Southern Methodist University. That means the risk for Trump and Republicans is on the downside heading into November's midterm elections , when control of Congress is at stake.

"If it goes well, it will largely be forgotten, I suspect, by the time of the midterms," Wilson said. "If it goes poorly, it will be an albatross."

Before Saturday's events, the last time the United States took action to remove the ruler of a Latin American country was the 1989 invasion of Panama that ousted dictator Manuel Noriega. That was the first of two quick, relatively successful military actions under U.S. President George H.W. Bush, who also orchestrated the 1991 Gulf War, yet he still lost his re-election bid to Bill Clinton in 1992 primarily due to a weak economy.

Democrats have widely criticized the Trump administration's actions in Venezuela as ill-advised and potentially unlawful given they were carried out without approval from Congress. The party's leader in the Senate, Chuck Schumer, said Trump risked dragging the U.S. "into another costly foreign war."

The Democrats have been joined by Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, a longtime Trump supporter who had a public falling out with the president this year. Speaking on NBC's "Meet the Press" program on Sunday, the Republican described Maduro's arrest as a betrayal of Trump's pledge during the 2024 presidential campaign to steer clear of foreign conflicts.

"This is the same Washington playbook that we are so sick and tired of that doesn't serve the American people," she said.

Candace Owens, a right-wing podcaster known in part for spreading conspiracy theories, was also critical of Maduro's capture, writing on X that the CIA had staged "another hostile takeover of a country at the behest of a globalist psychopaths [sic]."

Yet most of Trump’s political supporters — and even some critics — either backed the attack or declined to weigh in.

Steve Bannon, a former Trump aide and prominent voice in the Make America Great Again movement, praised the raid as "bold and brilliant" on his podcast hours after the operation, embodying the hawkish tone prevalent across the president's base.

Trump administration officials have gone to lengths to characterize Saturday's operation as a law enforcement action against Maduro, who has been indicted on drug-related charges and has a court hearing on Monday in New York.

Some MAGA influencers said they also supported Trump's stated goal of asserting U.S. dominance in the Western Hemisphere.

Right-wing activist Laura Loomer argued on social media that the United States must exploit Venezuela's vast oil reserves rather than allow adversaries such as Iran, China, Russia and Cuba to benefit from them and finance attacks on the West.

"We will exert our power and take the oil and financially starve the axis of evil," Loomer wrote on X, in a broadside against Representative Thomas Massie, one of the few Republicans to question the legal basis for the strikes on Venezuela.

Nikki Haley, who lost to Trump in the Republican primary of 2024, called Maduro a "brutal socialist dictator" in a post on X and said the Venezuelan people "deserve freedom".

Republican Senator Rand Paul, a longtime opponent of overseas military interventions, did not explicitly criticize Trump's actions in a social media post, but cautioned that "time will tell if regime change in Venezuela is successful without significant monetary or human cost."

Matt McManus, a political science professor at Spelman College, said it would be incorrect to cast the MAGA movement as strictly isolationist, when it has long been comfortable in projecting power. He pointed to Trump backers' support of the U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites in June and of Trump's various threats against other countries during his first term.

"MAGAdom has never really been defined by a great concern for ideological consistency," McManus said. "It very much takes its cues from the leading figures... And of course, right now, Trump is signaling very heavily that Venezuelan intervention is what's good for America."

But McManus and other experts agreed that a prolonged intervention in Venezuela would test Trump's grip over his party and the MAGA movement, especially if U.S. troops are deployed - a possibility the president has not ruled out.

"I guess Venezuela will be the acid test that answers the question is MAGA whatever Donald Trump says it is," said Dante Scala, a political science professor at the University of New Hampshire.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 01:55:44 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LRKHGKZMIBJWHJOKYYKPGIUQRU.jpg?auth=d44a143039e6d038335ea1d4dde223c45dd6eb921390e4e06c262c0fbd199f4a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukraine targets Moscow daily with drones this year, Russia says, in apparent escalation</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/ukraine-targets-moscow-daily-with-drones-this-year-russia-says-apparent-2026-01-04/</link><description>Jan 5 (Reuters) - Ukraine has targeted Moscow with drones every day of 2026 so far, according to data published by Russia’s Defence Ministry, in what appeared to mark an escalation from earlier, more sporadic attacks on the Russian capital.

By midnight on Sunday alone, Russian air defence systems had destroyed 57 drones over the Moscow region out of 437 downed over Russia, the ministry said on its Telegram messaging app.

The daily activity suggests a shift from past patterns, when Moscow was hit more intermittently, often around symbolic dates or as a form of signalling rather than a near routine pressure campaign.

There was no immediate comment from Ukraine, but Kyiv has increasingly used long range drones to strike targets deep inside Russia.

Ukraine says such attacks aim to disrupt military logistics and energy infrastructure, raise costs for Moscow’s war effort and respond to repeated Russian missile and drone attacks in the war that Russia launched nearly four years ago.

Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin has reported multiple interceptions since New Year’s Eve without giving further details.

Russia typically reports only how many drones its air defences say they downed, not how many Ukraine launched, and rarely discloses the full extent of damage unless civilians are killed or civilian sites are hit.

The attacks have forced temporary closures at Moscow airports and at scores of other Russian airports for safety reasons, Russia’s aviation watchdog Rosaviatsiya said on Telegram.

The disruption comes during Russia’s extended New Year and Orthodox Christmas break, which this year runs through January 9, when many Russians take vacations and travel domestically and abroad, making it one of the country’s busiest periods for transport and tourism.

According to RIA state news calculations, Russia’s air defences intercepted and destroyed at least 1,548 Ukrainian drones over Russian territory and the Crimean Peninsula over the past week.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 01:55:48 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/NFUTUSDKRNONNLWUHWPTG52U6E.jpg?auth=9fcfacd567354c0812d76cfc44205e646ade0230f9d73ccd5ebf82c5a479e6cb&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump threatens military operation against Colombia, after Venezuela raid</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/trump-says-new-military-operation-focused-colombia-sounds-good-him-2026-01-05/</link><description>ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE, Jan 4 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Sunday threatened military action against Colombia's government, telling reporters that such an operation "sounds good to me."

"Colombia is very sick, too, run by a sick man, who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States, and he's not going to be doing it very long," Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One, in an apparent reference to Colombia's President Gustavo Petro.

Asked directly whether the U.S. would pursue a military operation against the country, Trump answered, "It sounds good to me."

"We have never believed that any country can act as the world's police, nor do we accept that any nation can claim to be the world's judge," Wang told his Pakistani counterpart Ishaq Dar during a meeting in Beijing on Sunday, referring to "sudden developments in Venezuela" without directly mentioning the U.S.

"The sovereignty and security of all countries should be fully protected under international law," China's top diplomat added, in his first remarks since images of the 63-year-old Maduro blindfolded and handcuffed on Saturday stunned Venezuelans.

Maduro is in a New York detention centre awaiting a Monday court appearance on drug charges.

Beijing has ambition to become a diplomatic heavyweight, a goal it articulated most clearly after brokering a surprise rapprochement between Saudi Arabia and Iran in 2023, pledging to "play a constructive role in global hotspot issues ." Analysts say Beijing's success in going toe-to-toe with the U.S. in trade negotiations has only reinforced China's confidence.

However, President Donald Trump's assertion that the U.S. will oversee Venezuela's government for the time being poses a stern test to the "all-weather comprehensive strategic partnership" Beijing and Caracas struck in 2023, marking almost 50 years of diplomatic ties.

"It was a big blow to China, we wanted to look like a dependable friend to Venezuela," said a Chinese government official briefed on a meeting between Maduro and China's special representative for Latin American and Caribbean affairs, Qiu Xiaoqi, hours before his capture.

Maduro's son visited China's top-ranking Peking University in 2024, where he enrolled in 2016, they said, adding they were unsure whether he would return despite years of diplomatic engagement with Caracas around his education and ties to China.

The world's second-largest economy has provided Venezuela with an economic lifeline since the U.S. and its allies ramped up sanctions in 2017, purchasing roughly $1.6 billion worth of goods in 2024, the most recent full-year data available.

Almost half of China's purchases were crude oil, customs data shows, while its state-owned oil giants had invested around $4.6 billion in Venezuela by 2018, according to data from the American Enterprise Institute think tank, which tracks Chinese overseas corporate investment.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 01:56:03 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/32BD2RSD2BC4ZLMIIGFCTJX7FE.JPG?auth=93c1a1ccbbead0437d7bb72525a5feb5327ea4c39a8bf15f409c79846ff7b9d6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Legality of US capture of Venezuela's Maduro in focus at United Nations</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/legality-us-capture-venezuelas-maduro-focus-united-nations-2026-01-04/</link><description>UNITED NATIONS, Jan 4 (Reuters) - The legality of the U.S. capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro will be under the spotlight at the United Nations on Monday, but Washington is unlikely to face strong criticism from allies over its military operation in the Latin American state.

The 15-member U.N. Security Council will meet on Monday after U.S. Special Forces seized Maduro in an operation on Saturday that knocked out power in parts of Caracas and struck military installations. Venezuelan authorities also said it was deadly . Maduro is now in detention in New York awaiting a court appearance on Monday on drug charges.

Russia, China and other Venezuelan allies have accused the United States of violating international law, but U.S. allies - many of whom opposed Maduro - have been less vocal about any concerns over the use of military force.

"Judging by the reactions from European leaders to date, I suspect that U.S. allies will equivocate exquisitely in the Security Council," said Richard Gowan, director of global issues and institutions at the International Crisis Group, a think-tank.

U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres views the U.S. operation as setting "a dangerous precedent," his spokesperson said on Saturday. Many legal experts also say the U.S. action was illegal, although Washington will be able to block any attempts by the U.N. Security Council to hold it accountable.

In the wake of the U.S. operation, European states have largely called for international law to be respected without specifically calling out Washington, though French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said the U.S. had violated "the principle of not resorting to force, that underpins international law."

The U.N. Charter states that members "shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state." There are currently 193 members of the United Nations.

U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Mike Waltz on Sunday cited Article 51 of the U.N. Charter, which says that nothing "shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defense if an armed attack occurs against a member of the United Nations."

"In this case, you have a drug kingpin, an illegitimate leader indicted in the United States, coordinating with the likes of China, Russia, Iran, terrorist groups like Hezbollah, pumping drugs, thugs, and weapons into the United States of America, threatening to invade its neighbors," he told Fox News.

However, legal experts say the U.S. operation was illegal because it lacked U.N. Security Council authorization, did not have Venezuelan consent, and does not constitute self-defense against an armed attack.

"The action violated international law," said Tom Dannenbaum, a professor at Stanford Law School. "Serious legal objections to Maduro's regime do not eliminate the need for a legal basis to use military force in Venezuela."

But Washington cannot be held accountable for any violation by the U.N. Security Council, which is charged with maintaining international peace and security. The U.S. wields a veto - along with Russia, China, Britain and France - so can block action.

Maduro was indicted in 2020 on U.S. charges including narco-terrorism conspiracy. He has always denied any criminal involvement.

"Even if Maduro were to be responsible for the smuggling of some drugs into the U.S., such smuggling of drugs does not constitute an armed attack and does not authorize the U.S. to use force in self-defense," said Milena Sterio, a professor at Cleveland State University College of Law.

She also said Washington "cannot exercise extra-territorial jurisdiction to arrest individuals anywhere it pleases."

Adil Haque, a professor at Rutgers Law School, also said the U.S. capture of Maduro "was an illegal infringement of the inviolability and immunity of a sitting Head of State, who may lack democratic legitimacy but was clearly effectively discharging his official functions on behalf of his State."</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 01:56:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/GOVVZYXT6ZJTJDRTRU3PKOBWMQ.jpg?auth=08e2188054badd7bdcc2bc92209bb2710d9ee40cc988135d05121f0d759a1861&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russian politicians say Trump strike on Venezuela unlawful, destabilising</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/russian-politicians-say-trump-strike-venezuela-unlawful-destabilising-2026-01-05/</link><description>MOSCOW, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Russia’s Security Council deputy chairman Dmitry Medvedev and a senior lawmaker said over the weekend that U.S. President Donald Trump’s actions in Venezuela were unlawful and destabilising, while portraying them as a blunt assertion of U.S. interests.

The comments followed Trump’s statement that the United States struck Venezuela and that Maduro and his wife were captured and taken out of the country, prompting international reaction and calls for urgent UN discussions.

Medvedev told TASS on Sunday that Trump’s behaviour was illegal but internally coherent because it pursued U.S. interests.

“It must be acknowledged that, despite the obvious unlawfulness of Trump’s behaviour, one cannot deny a certain consistency in his actions. He and his team defend their country’s national interests quite harshly,” Medvedev was quoted as saying.

Medvedev said Latin America was viewed as the United States’ “backyard” and suggested Trump was seeking leverage over Venezuela’s oil supplies.

“Uncle Sam’s main motivation has always been simple: other people’s supplies,” Medvedev said, according to TASS.

He added that if such an operation were carried out against a stronger country, it would be seen as an act of war.

Alexei Pushkov, a Russian senator who chairs a Federation Council commission on information policy, said the operation and Trump’s rhetoric might prove less effective than their dramatic impact.

“One cannot deny that Trump’s actions and especially his statements are striking. Their effectiveness is another matter,” Pushkov said on the Telegram messaging app.

He compared the episode to what he called premature U.S. declarations of victory in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya, arguing that initial “triumphs” later turned into defeat or prolonged crises.

Pushkov said the United States, by attacking Venezuela and seizing its president, had violated norms and “alarmed the whole world,” returning it to “the wild imperialism of the 19th century” and reviving a Wild West right to act at will in the Western Hemisphere.

“But what will the final result be? Will this ‘triumph’ not turn into a catastrophe?” he said.

Russia has long maintained close ties with Venezuela, spanning energy cooperation, military links and high-level political contacts, and Moscow has backed Caracas diplomatically for years as both countries seek to deepen trade and investment.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 01:57:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/I2ZPZCR66FN4XGGNEHG75FG334.jpg?auth=5d4f73b4177f1fbba2b0bbc0f2af0cba5ef37b6dec21be0855a6c455c9c8898f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Anne Frank's step-sister and Auschwitz survivor Eva Schloss dies at 96</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260105-anne-frank-holocaust-eva-schloss</link><description>Eva Schloss, the Auschwitz survivor who dedicated decades to educating people on the Holocaust and was the step-sister of diarist Anne Frank, has died aged 96, her foundation announced Sunday.

Her family expressed their "great sadness" at the loss of this "remarkable woman: an Auschwitz survivor, a devoted Holocaust educator, tireless in her work for remembrance, understanding and peace".

King Charles III , who danced with Schloss at an event in London in 2022, and his wife Camilla, patron of her Anne Frank Trust UK foundation, said they were "greatly saddened".

"We are both privileged and proud to have known her and we admired her deeply," the royal couple said in a statement.

Schloss co-founded the organisation in 1990 to pass on the memory of the Holocaust to young people and combat prejudice.

Born Eva Geiringer in Austria in 1929, she was a child when the Nazis annexed her country.

Her Jewish family first fled to Belgium and then to Amsterdam, in the Netherlands, where they settled opposite Frank's house.

Frank's accounts of the Holocaust in the diary have become a symbol of the suffering inflicted by the Nazis during World War II.

The two girls were the same age and often played together.

But from 1942 onwards, both families had to go into hiding.

Eva, her mother Elfriede, her father Erich and her brother Heinz were betrayed two years later by a Nazi sympathiser. They were arrested on her fifteenth birthday and sent to the Auschwitz extermination camp in May 1944.

Eva, who was able to stay in touch with her mother, was separated from her father and brother, who both died in the camps.

Shortly after their liberation in 1945, she moved to London to study and met her future husband, Zvi Schloss.

Her mother returned to Amsterdam and married Frank's father, Otto, who was also a widower upon his return from Auschwitz.

Eva and Zvi Schloss, who had three daughters, obtained British citizenship. Eva Schloss also regained her Austrian citizenship in 2021, aged 92.

She wrote several books and recounted her experiences around the world, and was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) by the king in 2013, when he was Prince of Wales.

Anne Frank died in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in 1945.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 01:58:08 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/d6ecdde0-e9ba-11f0-87e8-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/992544351f2ce952df1525c0fa7df51fab758340.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Donald Trump ramps up pressure on Iran after fresh clashes erupt</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260105-donald-trump-iran-clashes</link><description>New deadly clashes between protesters and security forces erupted in Iran, rights groups and local media said Sunday, as demonstrations first sparked by anger over the rising cost of living entered a second week.

At least 12 people, including members of the security forces, have been killed since the protests kicked off with a shopkeepers' strike in Tehran on December 28, according to a toll based on official reports.

Overnight, protests featuring slogans criticising the Islamic republic's clerical authorities were reported in Tehran, Shiraz in the south, and in areas of western Iran where the movement has been concentrated, according to the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) monitor.

The demonstrations are the most significant in Iran since a 2022-2023 movement sparked by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, who had been arrested for allegedly violating Iran's strict dress code for women.

The latest protests have been concentrated in parts of the west with large populations of the Kurdish and Lor minorities, and have yet to reach the scale of the 2022-2023 movement, let alone the mass street demonstrations that followed disputed 2009 presidential elections.

But they do present a new challenge for supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei -- 86, and in power since 1989 -- coming on the heels of a 12-day war with Israel in June that saw nuclear infrastructure damaged and key members of the security elite killed.

With the government under pressure to show a response to the economic pain, spokeswoman Fatemeh Mohajerani told state TV on Sunday that citizens would receive a monthly allowance equivalent to $7 for the next four months.

President Donald Trump warned Sunday that Iran would get "hit very hard" by the United States if more protesters die.

"We're watching it very closely. If they start killing people like they have in the past, I think they're going to get hit very hard by the United States," Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One -- a day after the American operation to capture Tehran's ally Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.

The protests have taken place in 23 out of Iran's 31 provinces and affected, to varying degrees, at least 40 different cities, most of them small and medium-sized, according to an AFP tally based on official announcements and media reports.

The Norway-based Hengaw rights group said that Revolutionary Guards opened fire on protesters in the Malekshahi county of the western Ilam province on Saturday, killing four members of Iran's Kurdish minority.

The group said it was checking reports that two other people had been killed, adding dozens more were wounded. It also accused the authorities of raiding the main hospital in the city of Ilam to seize the bodies of the protesters.

The Iran Human Rights NGO, also based in Norway, gave an identical toll of four dead, as well as 30 wounded, after "security forces attacked the protests" in Malekshahi.

It said funerals for the dead took place on Sunday with mourners chanting slogans against the government and Khamenei.

Both organisations posted footage of what appeared to be bloodied corpses on the ground, in videos verified by AFP.

Iranian media said a member of the security forces was killed in a clash with "rioters" who attempted to storm a police office, with "two assailants" killed.

In Tehran, sporadic demonstrations on Saturday night were reported in districts in the east, west and south, the Fars news agency said.

On Sunday, the vast majority of shops were open in the capital, although the streets appeared less crowded than usual, with riot police and security forces deployed at major intersections, AFP observed.

Images verified by AFP showed Iranian security forces using tear gas to disperse a group of protesters who gathered in central Tehran during the day on Sunday.

HRANA said that over the last week at least 582 people have been arrested.

Hengaw said almost all of those killed were from ethnic minorities, chiefly Kurds and Lors.

Abroad, several hundred people took part in two separate rallies in Paris on Sunday to support the protesters, following similar actions in London a day earlier, AFP correspondents said.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 03:56:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/8f5d0f02-e9e4-11f0-9382-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26004477898342.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>North Korea's Kim oversees hypersonic missile test, warns of 'geopolitical crisis'</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260105-north-korea-hypersonic-missiles-nuclear-forces</link><description>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un oversaw the firing of "cutting-edge" hypersonic missiles to ready Pyongyang's nuclear forces for war, state media reported Monday, saying "geopolitical crisis" made the test even more urgent in a clear nod to this weekend's US attack on Venezuela.

Seoul and Tokyo said Sunday they had detected the launch from near Pyongyang of two ballistic missiles -- the country's first test of the year just hours before South Korean leader Lee Jae Myung headed to Beijing for a summit.

Lee has said he hopes to use his visit to harness China's clout over North Korea to improve Seoul's ties with Pyongyang.

On Monday, the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) quoted Kim as saying the test showed "the readiness of the DPRK's nuclear forces", referring to North Korea by its official name.

"Important achievements have been recently made in putting our nuclear forces on a practical basis and preparing them for an actual war," Kim was quoted as saying by KCNA.

Pyongyang's activity, he said, was "aimed at gradually putting the nuclear war deterrent on a high-developed basis".

Photos shared by state media showed Kim puffing on a cigarette accompanied by top officials as a missile soars into the early morning sky.

"Why it is necessary is exemplified by the recent geopolitical crisis and complicated international events," Kim was quoted as saying, a clear reference to Washington's weekend capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.

The operation represents a nightmare scenario for North Korea's leadership, which has long feared a so-called "decapitation strike" of that kind and accused Washington of seeking to remove it from power.

Pyongyang condemned it Sunday as a "serious encroachment of sovereignty" that "clearly confirms once again the rogue and brutal nature of the US".

Pyongyang has for decades justified its nuclear and missile programmes as a deterrent against alleged regime change efforts by Washington.

Sunday's launch "can be interpreted as a message signalling that Pyongyang possesses a war deterrent and nuclear capabilities, unlike Venezuela," Hong Min, an analyst at the Seoul-based Korea Institute for National Unification, told AFP.

He pointed to state media reports Sunday that Kim had visited a facility involved in making tactical guided weapons.

This, he said, "demonstrated a capability to launch more precise strikes than existing multiple rocket launchers from various platforms, including air and ground".

North Korea's new weapon system using hypersonic missiles was first tested in October.

Hypersonic missiles travel at more than five times the speed of sound and can manoeuvre mid-flight, making them harder to track and intercept.

They have been deployed to deadly effect last year on cities in Ukraine by Russia, with whom North Korea has deepened ties in recent years, and by Iran against Israel.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 03:56:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/3a09e8be-e9cf-11f0-8f03-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/a037a233acfd7554f2cba841f29e752f74f2044f.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuela's Maduro to appear in US court, Trump says further strikes possible</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/venezuelas-maduro-appear-us-court-trump-says-further-strikes-possible-2026-01-05/</link><description>Jan 5 (Reuters) - Deposed Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro was due to appear in a U.S. court on Monday after his weekend capture by American forces, with U.S. President Donald Trump leaving open the possibility of another incursion if the United States doesn't get its way with Venezuela's interim government.

Trump told reporters on Sunday that he could order another strike if Venezuela does not cooperate with U.S. efforts to open up its oil industry and stop drug trafficking. He also threatened military action in Colombia and Mexico and said Cuba's communist regime "looks like it's ready to fall" on its own.

The Colombian and Mexican embassies in Washington did not immediately return requests for comment.

The remarks by Trump came on the eve of Maduro's scheduled appearance on Monday before a federal judge in New York. Maduro was detained during a military raid on Saturday in Caracas that has plunged Venezuela into uncertainty.

Trump administration officials have portrayed the seizure as a law-enforcement action to hold Maduro accountable for criminal charges filed in 2020 that accuse him of narco-terrorism conspiracy. But Trump himself has said other factors were at play, saying the raid was prompted in part by an influx of Venezuelan immigrants to the United States and the country's decision to nationalize U.S. oil interests decades ago.

"We're taking back what they stole," he said aboard Air Force One as he returned on Sunday to Washington from Florida.

Oil companies will return to Venezuela and rebuild the country's petroleum industry, Trump said. "They're going to spend billions of dollars and they're going to take the oil out of the ground," he said.

Meanwhile, Maduro's government remains in power in Caracas, and top officials have remained defiant.

Vice President Delcy Rodriguez, who has taken over as interim leader, has said Maduro remains president and has contradicted Trump's claim that she is willing to work with the United States. Rodriguez, who also serves as oil minister, has long been considered the most pragmatic member of Maduro's inner circle.

Maduro, 63, faces charges that accuse him of providing support to major drug trafficking groups, such as the Sinaloa Cartel and the Tren de Aragua gang.

Prosecutors say he directed cocaine trafficking routes, used the military to protect shipments, sheltered violent trafficking groups and used presidential facilities to move drugs. The charges, first filed in 2020, were updated on Saturday to include his wife, Cilia Flores, who is accused of ordering kidnappings and murders.

Maduro has denied wrongdoing, and it could be several months before he stands trial.

The United States has deemed Maduro an illegitimate dictator since he declared victory in a 2018 election marred by allegations of massive irregularities . But Trump has dismissed the idea of opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Corina Machado taking over, saying she lacks support.

Machado was banned from the 2024 election but has said her ally Edmundo Gonzalez has a mandate to take the presidency and some international observers say he overwhelmingly won that vote.

On Sunday, Trump said his administration will try to work with Venezuela's current government to clamp down on drug trafficking and open up its oil industry, rather than pushing for elections to install new leaders.

Though Maduro has few allies on the world stage, many countries have questioned the legality of seizing a foreign head of state and called on the U.S. to respect international law. The U.N. Security Council planned to meet on Monday to discuss the U.S. attack, which Secretary-General Antonio Guterres described as a dangerous precedent.

The attack has also raised questions in Washington, where opposition Democrats say they were misled by the administration about its Venezuela policy. Secretary of State Marco Rubio was due to brief top lawmakers on Capitol Hill later on Monday.

Once one of the most prosperous nations in Latin America, Venezuela's economy has collapsed over the past 20 years, sending about one in five Venezuelans abroad in one of the world's biggest exoduses , opens new tab . The removal of Maduro, a former bus driver who led Venezuela for more than 12 years after the death of strongman Hugo Chavez, could lead to even more destabilization in the nation of 28 million people.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 04:58:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/AWR4B7DQ7VDLBGF6Z54UHWWRYM.JPG?auth=61a8758396619c39aa387dbd721b3488e6800288dff076b08ea61863ee498473&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukraine says Russian strike on Kyiv leaves first civilians dead this year</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-military-says-russian-strike-kyiv-kills-civilian-2026-01-05/</link><description>KYIV, Jan 5 (Reuters) - An overnight Russian air attack on Kyiv and its region killed two people, Ukraine’s authorities said on Monday, in what appeared to be the first reported deaths in Russian strikes on the Ukrainian capital this year.

Ukraine’s State Emergency Service said the strike set ablaze a medical facility in the Obolonskyi district in Kyiv's northern sector, where an inpatient ward was operating. After the fire was extinguished, a body was found inside, the service added.

A woman was also injured and 25 people were evacuated, the service said on the Telegram messaging app.

It released a nighttime photo showing emergency responders carrying a body on a stretcher past an ambulance outside a building, with snow on the ground.

Russia also hit towns and villages across the Kyiv region, damaging homes and critical infrastructure, and killing a civilian in the Fastiv district, just southwest of the capital, the region’s governor Mykola Kalashnyk said on Telegram.

Small parts of the region were left without power, Kalashnyk added.

There was no immediate comment from Russia. Both sides deny targeting civilians in their attacks.

Havana said there would be two days of mourning on January 5 and 6 in honor of those killed and said funeral arrangements would be announced.

The Cuban government statement gave few details, but said all the dead were members of the Cuban armed forces and intelligence agencies.

"True to their responsibilities concerning security and defense, our compatriots fulfilled their duty with dignity and heroism and fell, after fierce resistance, in direct combat against the attackers or as a result of bombings on the facilities," the statement said.

Cuba has provided some security for Maduro since he came to power. It was not clear how many Cubans were guarding the Venezuelan president when they died and how many may have perished elsewhere.

Maduro, 63, and his wife Cilia Flores were seized by U.S. forces in the Venezuela capital Caracas on Saturday and flown to the United States. Maduro is being held in a New York detention center awaiting a Monday court appearance on drug charges.

Maduro was indicted in 2020 on U.S. charges including narco-terrorism conspiracy.

Xi did not elaborate on what cooperation China was interested to further in his opening remarks at their meeting at the Great Hall of the People, but emphasised mutual respect and achieving win-win outcomes as "valuable experiences for the long-term, stable development of China-Ireland ties".

China has shown growing interest in engaging with European Union countries individually as ties with Brussels remain frosty.

Martin, the first Irish Taoiseach to visit Beijing in 14 years, said that Ireland acknowledged China's "indispensable role" in the world, highlighting its role in peacekeeping efforts.

He also stressed Ireland's stance on open trade, a topic that could feature in discussions between the leaders.

"We believe it's fundamental that we try and work towards open trade, recognising the interdependence of the world," the taoiseach said of trade ties with China.

Martin's trip comes two weeks after Beijing announced tariffs on EU dairy products, imposing provisional duties of up to 42.7%, the latest in a series of measures against EU exports widely seen as retaliation for the bloc's electric vehicle tariffs.

Ireland is among Europe's largest exporters of dairy products, shipping overseas more than 90% of the output from its family farms in trade worth 6 billion euros ($7.02 billion). It was among the EU nations that voted in favour of tariffs on Chinese EVs.

Martin will travel to Shanghai before his state visit ends on Thursday.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 04:59:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ZYHGPAWDOVIRFDHGLQ5IMSYVNY.jpg?auth=af18d31e314b5fb08d6de2cfc8318e9c1ec7de49faed45a0ab4aa80e5d5de3f8&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China may take time to lift unofficial ban on Korean culture, South Korean official says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/china-may-take-time-lift-unofficial-ban-korean-culture-south-korean-official-2026-01-05/</link><description>SEOUL, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Beijing is unlikely to lift its unofficial ban on Korean culture anytime soon, South Korean Presidential Chief of Staff Kang Hoon-sik said in a radio interview on Monday.

Taiwan has in recent years complained about what it sees as China's "hybrid warfare" - from daily military drills near the island to disinformation campaigns and cyberattacks - as Beijing ramps up military and political pressure on the democratically governed island to force Taipei to accept its claims of sovereignty.

The average number of daily attacks in 2025 jumped 113% from 2023 when the bureau first began publishing such data, with sectors such as energy, emergency rescue and hospitals seeing the sharpest year‑on‑year increases, according to a report by the National Security Bureau on Sunday.

"Such a trend indicates a deliberate attempt by China to compromise Taiwan’s crucial infrastructure comprehensively and to disrupt or paralyse Taiwanese government and social functions," the report said.

The bureau said China's "cyber army" timed operations to coincide with military and political coercion. For example, China launched 40 "joint combat readiness patrols" by sending military planes and ships close to Taiwan and cyberattacks escalated on 23 of those occasions.

China also ramped up hacking activities during politically sensitive moments such as when President Lai Ching-te marked his first year in office with a speech in May and when Vice President Hsiao Bi-khim spoke at a meeting with lawmakers at the European Parliament in November.

"China’s moves align with its strategic need to employ hybrid threats against Taiwan during both peacetime and wartime," the report said.

China's Taiwan Affairs Office did not respond to a request for comment.

China routinely denies being involved in hacking attacks.

Beijing claims Taiwan as its own territory and has not ruled out the use of force to bring the island under its control. Taipei strongly objects to China's sovereignty claims and says only Taiwan's people can decide their future.

The Taiwanese report said the Chinese attacks included distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks designed to disrupt Taiwan's daily life as well as man-in-the-middle attacks to steal information and penetrate the island's telecommunications networks.

Science parks that anchor Taiwan's semiconductor industry—home to firms such as TSMC (2330.TW) , opens new tab —have also been prime targets, with attackers employing a range of techniques to steal advanced technologies.

The move was "an attempt to support China's self-reliance in technology and economic development and prevent China from being put in a disadvantaged position in the U.S.-China technology competition," the report said.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 05:00:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/RXWNWIVM7NLNPN74WQ52TWZK3I.jpg?auth=84a63adeea274f04f757bacb994fce6ff42268aa220a403ef818b1416eb02bcd&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Live: Maduro to make first US court appearance in New York amid Federal indictment</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260105-live-maduro-us-court-new-york-federal-indictment</link><description>Deposed Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro was due to appear in a US court on Monday after his

weekend capture by American forces, with US President ⁠Donald Trump leaving open the possibility of another incursion if the United States doesn't get its way with Venezuela's interim government.

Trump told reporters on Sunday that he could order another strike if Venezuela does not cooperate with US efforts to open up its oil industry and stop drug trafficking.

He also threatened military action in Colombia and Mexico and said Cuba's ​communist regime "looks like it's ready to fall" on its own.

Venezuela's interim president Delcy Rodriguez on Sunday created a commission to seek the release of president Nicolas Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores, who were removed from power by US forces in Caracas.

Rodriguez tapped her brother Jorge, president of the National Assembly, and Foreign Minister Yvan Gil to co-chair the commission.

Information Minister Freddy Nanez will also be on the commission, he said in the announcement.

Rubio’s statements seemed designed to temper concerns that the assertive action to achieve regime change in Venezuela might lead the US into another prolonged foreign intervention or failed attempt at nation-building.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 05:01:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/c0790070-e9ec-11f0-a757-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26004761336308.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Maduro set to appear in US court to face narco-terrorism charges</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/maduro-set-appear-us-court-face-narco-terrorism-charges-2026-01-05/</link><description>NEW YORK, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Ousted Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro is set to appear in Manhattan federal court on Monday to face narco-terrorism charges, days after his capture by the U.S. military sparked deep uncertainty about the oil-rich South American nation’s future .

Maduro, 63, and his wife, Cilia Flores, have been jailed in Brooklyn after U.S. forces seized them from Caracas in a surprise weekend raid , opens new tab .

They are both set to appear at the hearing scheduled for 12:00 p.m. EST (1700 GMT ) before U.S. District Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein. It is unclear if either had obtained lawyers, or if they would enter pleas.

The U.S. has deemed Maduro an illegitimate dictator since he declared victory in a 2018 election marred by allegations of massive irregularities . His capture marks Washington's most controversial intervention in Latin America since the invasion of Panama 37 years ago.

Prosecutors say Maduro is the kingpin of a cartel of Venezuelan political and military officials who have conspired for decades with drug trafficking groups and U.S.-designated terrorist organizations to flood the U.S. with thousands of tons of cocaine.

Maduro was first indicted in 2020 as part of a long-running narcotics trafficking case against current and former Venezuelan officials and Colombian guerrillas.

In a new indictment unsealed Saturday, prosecutors allege that Maduro personally oversaw a state-sponsored cocaine trafficking network that partnered with some of the world's most violent and prolific drug trafficking groups, including Mexico’s Sinaloa and Zetas cartels, the Colombian paramilitary group FARC and the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.

"As Venezuela's President and now de-facto ruler, Maduro allows cocaine-fueled corruption to flourish for his own benefit, for the benefit of members of his ruling regime, and for the benefit of his family members," according to the indictment filed by prosecutors from the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Southern District of New York.

Maduro is charged with narco-terrorism, cocaine importation conspiracy, possession of machine guns and destructive devices, and conspiracy to possess machine guns and destructive devices. He faces decades to life in prison on each count if convicted.

Prosecutors say Maduro has been involved in drug trafficking from the time of his election to Venezuela's National Assembly in 2000 to his tenure as foreign minister from 2006 to 2013 and ever since his selection as the late president Hugo Chavez's successor in 2013.

The indictment says that while serving as foreign minister, Maduro sold diplomatic passports to known drug traffickers and personally arranged diplomatic cover for flights transporting drug proceeds from Mexico to Venezuela.

From 2004 to 2015, prosecutors say Maduro and his wife used state-sponsored criminal gangs to traffic cocaine that had been seized by Venezuelan authorities and ordered kidnappings, beatings and murders to protect their operations and collect debts.

Prosecutors say that as president, Maduro directed cocaine trafficking routes, used the military to protect shipments, sheltered violent trafficking groups and used presidential facilities to move drugs.

The indictment cites an example from months after Maduro's swearing in April 2013, when he allegedly directed top co-conspirators to find a new smuggling route to replace one uncovered by French authorities. Maduro also authorized the arrests of low-level military officials to deflect blame, prosecutors say.

Legal experts said prosecutors will need to show evidence of Maduro's direct involvement in drug trafficking to secure a conviction, which could prove difficult if he insulated himself from decision making.

Maduro ruled Venezuela with a heavy hand for more than 12 years, presiding over deep economic and social crises and resisting pressure from domestic opponents and foreign governments for political change.

Maduro’s capture followed a monthslong pressure campaign by Trump, who authorized U.S. forces to seize ships suspected of carrying sanctioned Venezuelan oil and carry out missile strikes on small boats said to be ferrying drugs.

Experts in international law have questioned the legality of the raid, with some condemning Trump's actions as a repudiation of a rules-based international order.

The U.N. Security Council planned to meet on Monday to discuss the U.S. attack, which Secretary-General Antonio Guterres described as a dangerous precedent. Russia and China, both major backers of Venezuela, have criticized the U.S.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 07:29:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4XAVTX3OYBKOZGKBWMVOFAYSBY.jpg?auth=faac4c90cdec96329e0c503e13c377435a27aea53cf2d2c254a20e592311ccab&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Amsterdam airport scraps 450 flights due to snow and ice, ANP reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/amsterdam-airport-scraps-450-flights-due-snow-ice-anp-reports-2026-01-05/</link><description>AMSTERDAM, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Amsterdam's Schiphol airport cancelled 450 flights on Monday morning due to snow and icy weather and expected that number to rise throughout the day, Dutch news agency ANP reported citing the airport.

"President Donald Trump, our peoples and our region deserve peace and dialogue, not war. This has always been President Nicolás Maduro's message, and it is the message of all of Venezuela right now. This is the Venezuela I believe in and have dedicated my life to. I dream of a Venezuela where all good Venezuelans can come together.

In a speech to civil servants, Anwar said his administration will table a parliamentary bill to limit the tenure of prime ministers to a maximum of 10 years, a measure that was part of his ruling coalition's election pledges in 2022.

"Everyone has a term limit. If given enough time to deliver, it is better for us to hand over to the next generation," Anwar said.

He said a bill to separate the attorney-general's role as the government's top legal adviser from the function of leading public prosecutor will also be tabled when parliament reconvenes for its first sitting of the year this month.

The independence of Malaysia's attorneys-general has often been questioned as they are appointed by the prime minister, prompting concerns about political interference in the judicial process.

The government also aims to introduce an ombudsman law to strengthen transparency in the public sector and provide the public with a formal channel to raise governance complaints, Anwar said.

A freedom of information law has also been proposed to prevent abuse of power in government projects, he added.

Anwar took office in 2022 on an anti-corruption platform but has faced accusations of backsliding on promised reforms , and his pledge to crack down on graft has also come under intense scrutiny .

The premier has said the government has been working hard to address governance issues and eliminate graft, but he has acknowledged the challenge of stamping out systemic corruption.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 07:51:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/6YGFTS65MRJWREI74CFONCCKBU.jpg?auth=34fc796537aa8acf1d01bf268c8b3652c4b0f0029b9ed1d01cde13f65f34069d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>France reiterates its support of Denmark and Greenland sovereignty after renewed Trump threats</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/france-reiterates-its-support-denmark-greenland-sovereignty-after-renewed-trump-2026-01-05/</link><description>PARIS, Jan 5 (Reuters) - France reiterated on Monday its support of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Denmark and Greenland following renewed threats by U.S. President Donald Trump to take over Greenland.

The Alpine getaway of Crans-Montana in the canton of Valais united in mourning on Sunday with condolences coming in from leaders ranging from Pope Leo to Chinese President Xi Jinping.

Prosecutors said the fire that spread rapidly in the early hours of January 1 was likely caused by sparkling candles igniting the ceiling of the bar's basement.

Authorities are investigating the two people who ran the bar on suspicion of crimes including homicide by negligence. On Sunday, police said circumstances did not currently merit them being put under arrest and they did not see a flight risk.

On Monday morning, Swiss newspaper Blick said anger over the case was growing.

"Why are the couple running the bar free?" the paper said on its front page, pasted over a photo of mourners and media gathered around the huge pile of flowers left in front of the "Le Constellation" bar.

The youngest victims of the blaze, which also injured well over 100 people, were only 14 years old, and the dead were from all around Europe, including several from France and Italy. Swiss authorities have not named the victims.

Italian Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini said in a social media post that "in civilized Switzerland, the prison gates will have to open for quite a few people".

Salvini said there had been a failure to ensure the bar's basement was safe, questioning the emergency systems and whether there had been enough inspections.

Aika Chappaz, a local resident who took part in a silent procession through the town on Sunday, said justice must be done for the sake of future generations.

"It's crucial that such a tragedy never happens again. And the investigation must be thorough, because it's so unbelievable," she said.

Tages-Anzeiger, another leading Swiss newspaper, said questions must be answered about the age checks at the bar, the soundproofing material used in the basement and the standards governing use of the so-called fountain candles.

One of the bar's two operators, Jacques Moretti , told Swiss media that Le Constellation had been checked three times in 10 years and that everything was done according to the rules.

Valais authorities say investigators were checking if the bar had undergone its annual building inspections, but that the town had not raised concerns or reported defects to the canton.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 09:33:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ROP546HFMRLUTHIBKPGVY7OH6A.jpg?auth=f794c33f0fef8618d75690e280a8211ccd657fd95e6d458e6d7bd829a3e735bd&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China, Pakistan reaffirm ties as US outreach to Islamabad deepens</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-pakistan-reaffirm-ties-us-outreach-islamabad-deepens-2026-01-05/</link><description>BEIJING, Jan 5 (Reuters) - China and Pakistan pledged on Monday to further deepen ties and expand cooperation, reaffirming to each other their historically "ironclad" friendship as signs of rapprochement between Islamabad and Washington grow.

Pakistan is one of China's closest partners, diplomatically supporting Beijing on a wide range of internationally sensitive issues ranging from the status of Taiwan to Xinjiang, Tibet, Hong Kong and the South China Sea.

In exchange, Beijing has poured billions of dollars into the South Asian country through the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) - a flagship project under China's Belt and Road trade and infrastructure initiative.

But repeated Islamist militant attacks on Chinese nationals working on the CPEC and other projects in Pakistan have become a major source of tension in recent years.

Adding to the complexity in the Sino-Pakistani relationship, U.S.-Pakistani ties have warmed since President Donald Trump returned to the White House a year ago and landed a diplomatic victory in a region that China regards as within its sphere of influence.

Pakistan even said it would recommend Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize for helping resolve a conflict it had with India.

In a joint statement on Monday, China and Pakistan said they would build an upgraded version of the CPEC, focus on their cooperation on industry, agriculture and mining, and step up collaboration in the financial and banking sector.

China then praised Pakistan's "comprehensive measures" to protect the safety of Chinese personnel and projects, the statement read.

Both sides also called for more "visible and verifiable actions to dismantle and eliminate all terrorist organisations" entrenched in Afghanistan, which shares borders with both Pakistan and China. No details were given.

Pakistan is among an exclusive group of countries that China regards as an "all-weather strategic partner", with close ties dating back decades.

The first premier of the People's Republic of China, Zhou Enlai, once credited Pakistan as a bridge in normalising Beijing's relations with the U.S. in the 1970s, with Islamabad often acting as a channel of communication between Beijing and the outside world at the time.

But warming U.S.-Pakistani ties since 2025 under the Trump administration are creating a counterweight to China's so-called neighbourhood diplomacy with countries with which it shares a border.

Pakistan last March hailed its counter-terrorism cooperation with Washington after the arrest of Mohammad Sharifullah, whom it blames for a 2021 attack on U.S. troops at Kabul airport. Trump publicly thanked Pakistan for its role in the capture.

The Trump administration also released $397 million for a U.S.-backed programme in Pakistan that monitors use of F-16 fighter jets in counter-terrorism efforts despite Washington's global freeze in foreign aid.

On Sunday, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi met with his Pakistani counterpart Ishaq Dar in Beijing to reaffirm the "ironclad friendship and strategic mutual trust" between the two neighbours.

"China and Pakistan will further promote their ironclad ties, deepen mutually beneficial cooperation, and continue to strengthen their strategic cooperation to break new ground," the joint statement said.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 10:26:52 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/AZK5WIMSNFPQRKI5PA6RJHRCAI.jpg?auth=12b1d5eb1426a92584bedc652fc1a993c9f38eee63019f7d403d2edc27535193&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukraine's Zelenskiy appoints Canadian ex-deputy PM as economic adviser</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/ukraines-zelenskiy-appoints-canadian-ex-deputy-pm-economic-adviser-2026-01-05/</link><description>KYIV, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Monday he had appointed Canada's former deputy prime minister Chrystia Freeland as his economic development adviser, citing her experience in attracting investment.

All the identified departed vessels are under U.S. sanctions. A separate group of ships, also under sanctions, left the country in recent days empty after discharging imports or completing domestic transportation trips.

The departures could be a relief for Venezuela's state-run oil company PDVSA, which had accumulated a very large inventory of floating storage amid the U.S. blockade, begun last month, dragging the country's oil exports to a standstill.

Oil exports are Venezuela's main source of revenue. An interim government now led by oil minister and vice president Delcy Rodriguez will need the income to finance spending and secure domestic stability in the country.

At least four of the departed tankers left Venezuelan waters through a route north of Margarita Island after briefly stopping near the country's maritime border, TankerTrackers.com said, after identifying the vessels is satellite images.

A source with knowledge of the departures' paperwork told Reuters that at least four supertankers had been cleared by Venezuelan authorities in recent days to leave Venezuelan waters in dark mode.

It was not immediately clear if the departures happened in defiance of the U.S. measures. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Saturday that an "oil embargo" on Venezuela was in full force, but added that under an incoming transition Venezuela's largest customers, including China, would keep receiving oil.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 10:27:32 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/MSBY2D633FKXLLTHPV22AFLQW4.jpg?auth=c71790c4576d6e386286eb2218680a5093fef16b343ed0518cfc4224270625e3&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Uganda bans live broadcasts of riots and 'unlawful processions' ahead of vote</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/uganda-bans-live-broadcasts-riots-unlawful-processions-ahead-vote-2026-01-05/</link><description>KAMPALA, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Uganda's government said on Monday it was banning live broadcasts of riots, "unlawful processions" and other violent incidents ahead of an election in which President Yoweri Museveni is seeking to extend his 40-year rule.

The authorities have detained hundreds of opposition supporters ahead of the January 15 election , which will again pit the 81-year-old Museveni against the 43-year-old pop-star-turned politician Bobi Wine.

"Live broadcasting or streaming of riots, unlawful processions, or violent incidents is prohibited, as it can escalate tensions and spread panic," the Ministry of Information Communication and Technology said in a statement.

Authorities often describe anti-government protests as riots.

The ministry also prohibited the dissemination of any content it described as "inciting, hateful or violent".

More than 50 people were killed before the last election in 2021 in crackdowns by security forces against Wine supporters, who accused Museveni of stealing the election, which he denied.

Museveni, who came to power in 1986 after leading a five-year rebellion, is Africa's third longest ruling , opens new tab head of state.

Critics and rights groups have long accused his government's security forces of torturing and intimidating opponents to maintain his grip on power, allegations he has denied.

Rights group Amnesty International said on Monday that Ugandan security forces had launched a "brutal campaign of repression" against Wine's supporters in the run-up to the election, subjecting them to arbitrary arrests, beatings and torture.

Spokespeople for the government and police did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the statement.

Another major opposition figure, Kizza Besigye , remains in prison more than a year after he was detained on treason charges. He denies the charges.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 10:51:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/S3WMXCIOSNODZGALQ22UUDUYD4.jpg?auth=503ffd19e120cb44cecc51aa745eb81837cac0436a928bd4c751681e58517150&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ten people convicted for online harassment of France's first lady Brigitte Macron</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/ten-people-convicted-online-harassment-frances-first-lady-brigitte-macron-2026-01-05/</link><description>PARIS, Jan 5 (Reuters) - A Paris court on Monday found 10 people guilty of the cyber-harassment of France's first lady, Brigitte Macron, for spreading false claims she is a transgender woman who was born male, French media reported.

Brigitte and her husband, French President Emmanuel Macron, have long faced such falsehoods, including allegations that she was born under the name Jean-Michel Trogneux — the actual name of her older brother.

The couple's 24-year age gap has also drawn criticism and barbs, which they largely ignored for years but have recently begun challenging in court.

Monday's ruling marks a victory for the Macrons as they pursue a separate high-profile U.S. defamation lawsuit against right-wing influencer and podcaster Candace Owens , who has also claimed Brigitte was born male.

The eight men and two women were found guilty of making malicious comments about Brigitte Macron's gender and sexuality, even equating her age difference with her husband to "paedophilia". They were handed sentences of up to eight months with suspended jail time, France Info reported.

Reuters could not immediately contact Brigitte Macron's lawyer or lawyers for those convicted.

Speaking with TF1 on Sunday night, Brigitte Macron defended her fight against cyber bullies, hoping it would be an example to others. She said the online attacks against her appeared endless, and included "people who broke into my tax website and modified my identity."

She also lamented that her attackers ignored the strong evidence of her gender.

"A birth certificate is not nothing. It is a father or a mother who goes to declare their child, who says who he is or who she is," she said. "I want to help adolescents to fight against harassment, and if I do not set an example, it will be difficult."</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 10:52:12 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/EKAJ3GASYVMK5CBOEQW4SMQMLY.jpg?auth=d2a8ebc3fb41edf70ba1c0e78ef5e8eb5c89c2c7d656e1fcaed78c602683361b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Greenland says 'no more fantasies about annexation' after Trump remarks</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/greenland-says-no-more-fantasies-about-annexation-after-trump-remarks-2026-01-05/</link><description>COPENHAGEN, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Greenland's leader declared "enough is enough," and Denmark's allies in Europe affirmed that the Arctic island's future must be determined by its people, rebuffing renewed remarks by U.S. President Donald Trump about acquiring the vast territory.

Trump spoke a day after the U.S. special forces captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro in a stunning raid, with Trump stating that Washington intended to oversee governance of the oil-rich Latin American country. The U.S. operation rekindled concerns in Denmark that Greenland, an autonomous Danish territory, might face a similar scenario.

Trump has repeatedly said he wants to take over Greenland, an ambition first voiced in 2019 during his first presidency. On Sunday, he told The Atlantic magazine in an interview : "We do need Greenland, absolutely. We need it for defence."

Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One early on Monday, Trump said he would revisit the topic in a few weeks.

"Threats, pressure, and talk of annexation have no place between friends," Greenland Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said on Facebook late on Sunday. "Enough is enough. (...) No more fantasies about annexation."

On December 21, Trump appointed Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry as special envoy to Greenland. Landry has publicly expressed support for incorporating Greenland into the U.S.

Greenland's strategic location between Europe and North America makes it a critical site in the U.S. ballistic missile defence system. The island's significant mineral resources also align with Washington's ambition to reduce dependence on Chinese exports.

Support for Denmark and Greenland came swiftly from Nordic and Baltic leaders following Trump's latest remarks.

President Alexander Stubb of Finland posted on X late on Sunday: "No one decides for Greenland and Denmark but Greenland and Denmark themselves. Our Nordic friend Denmark and @Statsmin have our full support."

France also expressed solidarity, saying Greenland belonged to the people of Greenland. President Emmanuel Macron said last June during a visit to Greenland's capital, Nuuk, that the island was threatened by "predatory ambition".

Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said on Sunday that U.S. comments about needing to take over Greenland made " absolutely no sense ".</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 11:20:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/U3HNOL2P7RIURPYNYDWDYROTLM.jpg?auth=d75c8a61112f4ee7361df4689ba4debcd72482e54ed06dc8af258b099f66441a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Turkey to stress 'strategic priority' of Black Sea security at Ukraine meeting in Paris</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/turkey-stress-strategic-priority-black-sea-security-ukraine-meeting-paris-2026-01-05/</link><description>ANKARA, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Turkey's foreign minister will stress the "strategic priority" of maintaining security in the Black Sea at a summit on Ukraine in Paris this week, a Turkish Foreign Ministry source said on Monday.

French President Emmanuel Macron convened a meeting of the " Coalition of the Willing " on Tuesday. The group, led by Britain and France, includes more than 30 nations.

The source said Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan would attend the meeting and would repeat Turkey's position on the need for "results-oriented" steps to end the war.

Talks at the Paris summit would focus on articles in a U.S. draft plan to end the war, as well as security guarantees for Ukraine and the possible role the Coalition can play, the source said.

The person said Fidan would point to "concrete" results from three previous rounds of direct talks between Ukrainian and Russian officials in Istanbul, including prisoner swaps, and repeat Ankara's offer to host a leaders' meeting of the warring sides.

Fidan would "state that Turkey views maintaining security in the Black Sea as a strategic priority and that it is reminding all sides of its position on this matter", the source said.

NATO member Turkey has maintained cordial ties with Moscow and Kyiv throughout the war. It has provided military support to Ukraine but refused to join Western sanctions on Russia.

Ankara has warned both sides against the recent escalation in the Black Sea, which saw Russian and Turkish vessels struck by drones , as well as Ukrainian ports damaged. Turkey has also seen a series of drones enter its airspace in recent weeks, and downed one near its capital.

Erdogan said last week he would discuss various issues with U.S. President Donald Trump in a phone call on Monday, including matters related to the Russia-Ukraine war.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 11:20:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/GDU2X4RJN5PO7KZKAFYNLQINFM.jpg?auth=07653c7a393e4164dc29196c91d7695bb2897cba59b5b4aea46e703ad9b73b10&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>What are the charges against Venezuela's Nicolas Maduro?</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/what-are-charges-against-venezuelas-nicolas-maduro-2026-01-05/</link><description>Jan 5 (Reuters) - Nicolas Maduro, the president of Venezuela captured in a U.S. military raid, faces criminal charges in Manhattan, where federal prosecutors have targeted him for years.

Here is a recap of the indictment unsealed on Saturday against Maduro, his wife, his son, and other co-defendants.

The indictment , opens new tab alleged Maduro and other Venezuelan leaders have, for more than 25 years, "abused their positions of public trust and corrupted once-legitimate institutions to import tons of cocaine into the United States."

The indictment alleged Maduro and his allies “provided law enforcement cover and logistical support” to major drug trafficking groups, such as the Sinaloa Cartel and Tren de Aragua gang. These criminal organizations sent profits to high-ranking officials who protected them in exchange, the Justice Department said.

Among other specific acts, Maduro is accused of selling Venezuelan diplomatic passports to known drug traffickers and facilitating flights under diplomatic cover to bring drug proceeds back from Mexico to Venezuela.

Maduro was indicted on four counts: narco-terrorism conspiracy, cocaine importation conspiracy, possession of machine guns and destructive devices and conspiracy to possess machine guns and destructive devices.

The case was brought by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, an office within the Justice Department famous for its fierce independence and aggressive prosecutions.

The same prosecutor's office returned an indictment against Maduro in 2020, with the same four charges. The updated indictment made public on Saturday adds some new details and co-defendants, including Maduro's wife, Cilia Flores.

The first lady is accused of ordering kidnappings and murders, as well as accepting bribes in 2007 to arrange a meeting between drug traffickers and the director of Venezuela’s National Anti-Drug Office.

Maduro is expected to make an initial appearance in court on Monday. A judge will likely advise him of the charges against him and ensure he has a defense lawyer.

It could be several months or even more than a year before Maduro stands trial. Prosecutors could eventually offer a plea deal to avoid a trial.

Maduro's case is expected to be overseen by U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein because he was assigned to the 2020 case brought against Maduro.

The 92-year-old jurist who has been skeptical of arguments by U.S. President Donald Trump's administration in other high-profile cases. Earlier this year, Hellerstein rejected efforts to deport alleged Venezuelan gang members under the Alien Enemies Act, saying the wartime law had been improperly invoked by the Trump administration.

As the case unfolds, Maduro is likely to argue to seek dismissal on the grounds that he is immune, or shielded, from criminal prosecution because he is a foreign head of state.

Judges have in some contexts concluded that foreign officials enjoy immunity from legal claims in U.S. courts.

But Maduro faces an uphill battle with this argument because of a historic precedent: the U.S. invasion of Panama in 1989 that ousted the country's leader, Manuel Noriega.

Like Maduro, Noriega was accused of conspiring to smuggle drugs into the U.S., and was captured in a military raid in his home country.

U.S. courts rejected Noriega's immunity argument, showing deference to the U.S. government's assertion that he was not Panama's legitimate leader. Legal experts have said that precedent will likely undermine Maduro's efforts to get charges dismissed.

Maduro is also likely to invoke a legal doctrine that says criminal charges should be dismissed if prosecutors brought them vindictively or selectively. He might also argue that claims against him are time-barred, meaning they are too old to be pursued in court.

Federal conspiracy charges generally have a five-year statute of limitations, meaning charges must be brought within five years of the alleged crime's completion, with some exceptions.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 11:20:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/PEOLZ2BOWNMF7LPCAAE4OJRHYQ.jpg?auth=13ceafbcc26703af0ea318331cee03d1f9472de1ddacb72a57661e425d3dacaa&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>South Korea's Lee seeks to develop strategic cooperative partnership with China</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/south-koreas-lee-seeks-develop-strategic-cooperative-partnership-with-china-2026-01-05/</link><description>SEOUL, Jan 5 (Reuters) - South Korean President Lee Jae Myung told Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday their summit is an important opportunity for full restoration of South Korea-China relations.

Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores face drug trafficking charges in the United States after being captured in a dramatic overnight raid.

They were transported to a U.S. Navy ship, flown to the U.S. and taken Saturday night to the Metropolitan Detention Center, Brooklyn. Both the 63-year old Maduro and his 69-year old wife are due to appear in Manhattan federal court on Monday.

Founded in 1994, MDC Brooklyn holds roughly 1,300 men and women and is currently the only jail for detainees awaiting federal trials in New York City.

Past residents have included everyone from Maxwell and hip-hop mogul Combs to Juan Orlando Hernandez, the former president of Honduras who was convicted of drug trafficking charges before being pardoned in December by President Donald Trump . Luigi Mangione, who pleaded not guilty to killing a UnitedHealth Group executive, is currently housed there awaiting trial.

The jail has been plagued by what inmates and defense lawyers have said are inhumane and unsanitary conditions.

In 2019, some detainees at MDC Brooklyn were left in frigid cells after an electrical fire cut power and heat to the jail in the middle of winter.

In 2024, two men were murdered by fellow inmates using makeshift weapons, according to the Justice Department, prompting a crackdown on violence and contraband smuggling at the facility.

Maxwell, who was housed in MDC Brooklyn before her 2021 conviction for helping Epstein sexually abuse underage girls, complained of raw sewage and vermin feces in her cell.

The U.S. Bureau of Prisons, the division of the Justice Department that operates MDC Brooklyn, did not respond to a request for comment. But the agency said in a September 2025 report that the jail's conditions have improved because of increased staffing and other reforms.

Mitchell Epner, a former federal prosecutor who now practices criminal defense, said all prisoners at MDC Brooklyn face some risk of violence from other inmates. That risk is higher with someone like Maduro who could be targeted by a gang or a prisoner wanting to build a reputation through a "lone-wolf attack," Epner said.

Cameron Lindsay, a former MDC Brooklyn warden who has served an expert witness, said the Bureau of Prisons will likely keep Maduro separated from other inmates and carefully vet the staff who interact with him.

"It's conjecture on my part, but I would expect him to be put in a cell on a floor by himself," Lindsay said. "This is obviously a super sensitive, high-security operation."

Lindsay said Maduro will likely be locked down 23 hours a day, with meals delivered to his cell and one hour allotted for exercise in a small caged area. He likely will have access to a shower three times a week, Lindsay added.

The former warden said Maduro's wife likely would receive the same treatment.

Combs, convicted in July on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution, slept within two feet of other inmates in a dorm-style room during his time at MDC Brooklyn. The bathroom, with no door, was located in the same room.

At one point during Combs's incarceration, guards stopped someone trying to cut him with a makeshift knife, his lawyers said.

There have been some signs of improving conditions at MDC Brooklyn in the last two years.

In 2024, Manhattan-based U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman declined to order a man charged with drug crimes detained pending trial at the MDC, calling the conditions there an "ongoing tragedy."

But in hearing in a different case in May 2025, Furman said conditions had gotten "a lot better" since his 2024 ruling because of improved staffing.

In its September report, the Bureau of Prisons said "there has been a substantial decrease in violence" at MDC Brooklyn, and that the number of inmates dropped from about 1,600 to roughly 1,300.

The same month it issued those statistics, the Justice Department announced criminal charges against 25 people relating to violence and contraband smuggling at MDC Brooklyn.

In one case, a former correctional officer was accused of smuggling in vacuum‑sealed bags of marijuana and cigarettes under his Bureau of Prisons-issued protective vest.

In a different case, an alleged gang member was accused of hiding ceramic scalpels, which can be used as weapons, in a bag of Doritos while in a visiting room at MDC Brooklyn so that he could give them to inmates.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 11:20:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/E77UQ6YNJ5JE3DVOY24XZVHF4Q.jpg?auth=77a6ee4a98469e25a6a5eb88ba012742f9bad851debfe40e16717307d9073de3&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ten people found guilty of cyberbullying France’s First Lady Brigitte Macron</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260105-ten-people-found-guilty-cyberbullying-france-first-lady-brigitte-macron</link><description>A Paris court on Monday found ten people guilty of cyberbullying France’s First Lady Brigitte Macron by spreading false online claims about her gender and sexuality, including allegations she was born a man.

The court convicted all defendants to sentences ranging from a cyberbullying awareness training to 8-month suspended prison sentences.

The court pointed to “particularly degrading, insulting, and malicious” comments referring to false claims regarding alleged trans identity and alleged pedocriminality targeting Brigitte Macron.

The defendants, eight men and two women aged 41 to 65, are accused of having posted “numerous malicious comments” falsely claiming that President Emmanuel Macron ’s wife was born a man and linking their 24-year age gap to paedophilia . Some of the posts were viewed tens of thousands of times.

Brigitte Macron did not attend the two-day trial in October. Speaking on TF1 national television Sunday, she said she launched legal proceedings to “set an example” in the fight against harassment.

Her daughter, Tiphaine Auzière, testified about what she described as the “deterioration” of her mother’s life since the online harassment intensified. “She cannot ignore the horrible things said about her,” Auzière told the court. She said the impact has extended to the entire family, including Macron’s grandchildren.

Defendant Delphine Jegousse, 51, who is known as Amandine Roy and describes herself as a medium and an author, is considered to have played a major role in spreading the rumour after she released a four-hour video on her YouTube channel in 2021. She was given a 6-month prison sentence.

The X account of Aurélien Poirson-Atlan, 41, known as Zoé Sagan on social media, was suspended in 2024 after his name was cited in several judicial investigations. Poirson-Atlan was given an 8-month prison sentence.

Other defendants include an elected official, a teacher and a computer scientist. Several told the court their comments were intended as humor or satire and said they did not understand why they were being prosecuted.

The case follows years of conspiracy theories falsely alleging that Brigitte Macron was born under the name Jean-Michel Trogneux, which is actually the name of her brother. The Macrons have also filed a defamation suit in the United States against conservative influencer Candace Owens.

The Macrons, who have been married since 2007, first met at the high school where he was a student and she was a teacher. Brigitte Macron, 24 years her husband’s senior, was then called Brigitte Auzière, a married mother of three.

The Baltic Sea region is on high alert after a string of power cable, telecom link and gas pipeline outages since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022 , and the NATO military alliance has boosted its presence with frigates, aircraft and naval drones.

The latest cable outage occurred on Friday near Liepaja and investigators on Sunday said they had boarded a ship and initiated criminal proceedings, although they did not name the vessel.

The incident occurred after Finnish police on December 31 seized a cargo vessel en route from Russia to Israel on suspicion of sabotaging an undersea telecoms cable running across the Gulf of Finland to Estonia by dragging its anchor.

MarineTraffic vessel tracking data show four ships crossing the Lithuania-Latvia cable on their way to Liepaja port on January 2, when the damage was first discovered. Three of those ships remained in the port on Monday.

Latvian police said on Monday they had inspected a ship at Liepaja, including its anchor, as well as technical equipment and logs, and that the crew had voluntarily cooperated with the investigation.

"At present, the information obtained in the criminal case does not indicate a connection of the specific ship with the damage to the optical cable," a national police statement said.

Neighbouring Lithuania's National Crisis Management Centre said on Sunday the cable ran from Sventoji in Lithuania to Liepaja, two coastal towns some 65 km (40 miles) apart, and that it was not immediately clear what caused the outage.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 11:42:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>German minister: protection of Greenland will be discussed within NATO if needed</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/german-minister-protection-greenland-will-be-discussed-within-nato-if-needed-2026-01-05/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 5 (Reuters) - German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said on Monday that Greenland belonged to Denmark and that the NATO alliance could discuss strengthening its protection if necessary.

Wadephul was speaking after U.S. President Donald Trump made renewed threats to take over Greenland, a prospect that alarmed NATO allies and has taken on a new urgency after Trump followed through on threats to topple Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro.

Trump has repeatedly said he wants to take over Greenland, an ambition first voiced in 2019 during his first presidency.

On Sunday, he told The Atlantic magazine in an interview: "We do need Greenland, absolutely. We need it for defence."

Speaking to reporters in Lithuania, Wadephul said Germany had questions about Maduro's removal and stressed the Venezuelan people should determine their country's future in free and fair elections, after Trump said the U.S. would run the country.

On Greenland, Wadephul stressed it was part of Denmark.

"And since Denmark is a member of NATO, Greenland will, in principle, also be subject to NATO defence," he said.

"And if there are further requirements to strengthen defence efforts concerning Greenland, then we will have to discuss this within the framework of the alliance."

He did not elaborate on the nature of those discussions.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 11:42:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/MHNUKO63VRONLIKHBE6F7AMXUU.jpg?auth=37df21e2d2632b4f949f90a053b851a78f948af2cb8de3b3f34fefe2172d8be0&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>EU sees opportunity for democratic transition in Venezuela, spokesperson says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/eu-sees-opportunity-democratic-transition-venezuela-spokesperson-says-2026-01-05/</link><description>BRUSSELS, Jan 5 (Reuters) - The capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro by the United States on Saturday creates an opportunity for a democratic transition in the country, a European Commission spokesperson said on Monday.

She did not comment on how the EU would characterise the U.S. action, but said it "created an opportunity for a democratic transition, led by the Venezuelan people."

"It's worth recalling that Nicolas Maduro lacked the legitimacy of a democratically elected leader," she added.

In the biggest U.S. intervention in Latin America since the 1989 invasion of Panama, Special Forces swooped into Caracas in helicopters over the weekend and apprehended Maduro before taking him to New York to face drugs charges.

U.S. President Donald Trump, Orban's ally, who has exempted Hungary from U.S. sanctions on Russian energy for the 2026 Hungarian election year, has made clear that he wants to share in Venezuela's oil riches.

"What I consider important for Hungary from this is that, together with Venezuela, the United States, by my estimation, will be able to control 40-50% of the world's oil reserves," Orban said at an annual news conference for international media.

"This is a power already capable of significantly influencing the world market price of energy... I see a strong chance that as a result of bringing Venezuela under control, a more favourable global energy situation will emerge for Hungary, and that is good news."

Budapest has angered many fellow members of the European Union and NATO by continuing to import Russian oil and gas. While insisting that this remains necessary, Budapest has also been taking steps to diversify supplies.

A U.S. military operation to capture Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, and Trump's intention to oversee governance of the oil-rich Latin American country, has rekindled concerns in Denmark that Greenland, an autonomous Danish territory, might face a similar scenario.

"Greenland and the Kingdom of Denmark must determine the future of Greenland and nobody else," Starmer told reporters.

When asked in a separate interview about Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen telling Trump to stop threatening Greenland , Starmer said: "I stand with her and she's right about the future of Greenland."

Starmer, who has sought to stay on good terms with Trump and adopted a less publicly critical approach than most other European leaders, was also asked about the raid in Venezuela.

He said it was now up to the U.S. to justify its actions, and that Britain would judge other nations against the benchmark of international law.

Starmer said on Saturday he was not sad that Nicolas Maduro was no longer president of Venezuela, but he wanted this to lead to a more democratic government.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 12:49:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/JXQVY7TNBFNB3H2GZWK66DLW7Y.jpg?auth=7928cd10e46532dc1317718ab534e969837ad752cfbc15725b3e676b5853aa7c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Guinea's top court validates Doumbouya's landslide vote win</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/guineas-top-court-validates-doumbouyas-landslide-vote-win-2026-01-05/</link><description>CONAKRY, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Guinea's Supreme Court has validated results showing a landslide election win for coup leader Mamady Doumbouya, clearing the way for the former special forces commander to serve a seven-year term as president.

The court also said late on Sunday the second-place finisher, Abdoulaye Yero Balde, had dropped his legal challenge to the result, which was condemned by opposition supporters online. Balde did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Doumbouya, thought to be in his early 40s, seized power in Guinea, a West African nation rich in bauxite and iron ore, in a 2021 coup, toppling then-president Alpha Conde. On New Year's Eve, Conde gave a speech dismissing the vote as a "masquerade".

The court's validation, required after every vote, confirmed provisional results that said Doumbouya had secured 86.72% of the vote in the December 28 election against a fragmented field of eight challengers .

In a short speech after the ruling, Doumbouya called on "all the daughters and sons of our nation, both here and in the diaspora, to come together to build a new Guinea".

The results showed Balde, the leader of the opposition Democratic Front of Guinea, came in second with 6.59% of the vote.

He had asked the Supreme Court to annul the provisional results, saying the vote count was not transparent and that representatives of his party had been expelled from some polling stations.

The U.S. embassy in Guinea congratulated Doumbouya and said Washington was looking forward to strengthening ties and advancing economic stability.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 12:49:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/2CTPESHPFJPZFNENN5DPD2PK4Q.jpg?auth=4e47bbf9fd2b21932a332e56a12f852b007ce3a59d82e6ff90b17428c2ff09ef&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UK's Starmer says it is for the US to justify actions in Venezuela</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/uks-starmer-says-it-is-us-justify-its-actions-venezuela-2026-01-05/</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 12:49:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Head of Ukraine's security service Maliuk to be replaced, Zelenskiy says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/head-ukraines-security-service-maliuk-be-replaced-zelenskiy-says-2026-01-05/</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 12:49:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Russian embassy warns citizens against travel to Venezuela, TASS reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/russian-embassy-warns-citizens-against-travel-venezuela-tass-reports-2026-01-05/</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 12:49:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Guinea's top court validates Doumbouya's landslide vote win</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/guineas-top-court-validates-doumbouyas-landslide-vote-win-2026-01-05/</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 12:50:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Russian embassy warns citizens against travel to Venezuela, TASS reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/russian-embassy-warns-citizens-against-travel-venezuela-tass-reports-2026-01-05/</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 12:50:03 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Hungary still aiming for US backstop after first attempt fizzles, Orban says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/hungary-still-aiming-us-backstop-after-first-attempt-fizzles-orban-says-2026-01-05/</link><description>BUDAPEST, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Hungary has not managed to secure the type of financial assistance it had originally sought from Washington ahead of a 2026 election, Prime Minister Viktor Orban said on Monday, adding that talks on a possible backstop were ongoing.

In power since 2010, eurosceptic Orban has struggled to revive Hungary's economy from an inflationary surge following Russia's February 2022 invasion of neighbouring Ukraine, with the economy mired in a three-year stretch of stagnation.

With Hungary still strongly reliant on Russian energy imports, President Donald Trump has granted Orban a one-year exemption from U.S. sanctions on Russian energy, staving off an energy price surge, which would have hit Hungary's economy hard.

The two leaders also discussed forms of financial assistance in November, although Trump last month rebuked Orban's claim that Washington had already agreed to provide Hungary a backstop worth up to $20 billion.

"I have requested a (financial) shield, but the type of assistance that would have been acceptable for both the U.S. and Hungary was not available," Orban told a press conference.

Orban is facing what could be the toughest challenge to his 16-year rule from a combination of Hungary's prolonged economic stagnation, a surge in the cost of living and an abuse scandal, which has triggered the rise of a strong opposition rival.

The veteran leader has launched tax cuts, wage hikes and cheap loans for homebuyers to shore up his poll standings at the cost of a higher budget deficit, inflationary risks and the slow decline in the European Union's largest debt pile outside the euro zone stalling.

When asked whether he could expect more help from Washington ahead of the election, likely to be in April, Orban said:

"Whether the American president or some high-ranking American leader will come to Hungary? This is likely, because in spring there will be political events in Hungary that high-ranking American leaders always attend."</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 13:42:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CN4QYNG7IFODFH5GJGEIL2EMOI.jpg?auth=9bb6ddd24880c963f4b7ef6440cdb00d93f91e6e3e7b6f2a935098d235be4ab2&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Syria, Israel resume U.S.-mediated security talks</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/syria-israel-resume-us-mediated-security-talks-2026-01-05/</link><description>Jan 5 (Reuters) - U.S.-mediated talks between Syria and Israel have resumed after an interruption of several months, Syria's state news agency SANA reported on Monday, with Damascus seeking withdrawal of Israeli troops from territory seized after the fall of Bashar al-Assad.

SANA, citing a Syrian government source, said the Syrian delegation was led by Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shibani and intelligence chief Hussein al-Salama. The resumption of the talks reflects a push by Damascus to reclaim what it describes as its non-negotiable national rights, the source said.

The discussions are focused on reviving a 1974 disengagement agreement that established a U.N.-monitored buffer zone between Israel and Syria after the 1973 Middle East war, SANA said.

Israeli troops advanced deeper across the border after Assad was toppled on December 8, 2024 by rebel fighters who assumed Syria's leadership. Israel has also intervened in what it calls missions to protect ethnic minority Druze in southwestern Syria.

Syria is seeking an Israeli withdrawal to positions held before Assad was toppled, and wants a reciprocal security framework guaranteeing its sovereignty and preventing interference in its internal affairs.

A Syrian official told Reuters last month that talks had been stalled since October, but that Syria expected a possible shift following a December 29 meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

The Syrian official said Damascus considered Israel's withdrawal from territory it took after Assad's fall to be a "red line" and that Syria had been asked to consider a phased withdrawal by Israeli troops.

"We're not going to legitimize an Israeli presence in Syria or the Golan Heights for that matter," the official said.

Under previous rounds of U.S.-mediated talks in Paris and Washington, Syria has pressed for a deal similar to the 1974 disengagement accord, which separated forces and maintained a ceasefire for decades, though formal peace was never achieved.

Syria's leadership has also sought an end to Israeli air strikes and incursions.

Israel has said it would conclude an agreement only on terms safeguarding its security interests, including demilitarisation of parts of southwestern Syria and protections for minority communities. It has yet to publicly commit to a full withdrawal to pre-2024 lines.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 13:42:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/IVQFLIYGO5M7VHS7JB7MEDOLLQ.jpg?auth=a75b43e7b2dd1b090ecfcf1fad6a3c61c16fca03322911c9f5db21f5d987b683&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Rome welcomed record 33.5 million pilgrims for Catholic Holy Year</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/rome-welcomed-record-335-million-pilgrims-catholic-holy-year-2026-01-05/</link><description>VATICAN CITY, Jan 5 (Reuters) - About 33.5 million pilgrims came to Rome in 2025 for the Catholic Holy Year, Vatican and Italian officials said on Monday, marking a record number of yearly visitors and a boon for local tourist shops, museums and restaurants.

Holy years, or jubilees, typically occur every 25 years and are considered a time of peace, forgiveness and pardon. Pilgrims to Rome can enter special "Holy Doors" at four Rome basilicas, and can see the pope at special audiences throughout the year.

Officials said the 3.7 billion euros ($4.32 billion) of state and European funds spent on overhauling tourist sites for the occasion had been worth the investment.

"The whole world has come to Rome," Archbishop Rino Fisichella, the Vatican's lead jubilee official, told a news conference. "The Jubilee has not been a losing investment but a driving force that has boosted ... overall growth."

The year, during which Catholics can also earn a special indulgence, or remission of sins, ends on Tuesday.

Visitors over the past 12 months came from 185 countries, officials said, with pilgrims from Italy, the United States, Spain, Brazil and Poland leading the pack.

Much of Rome has resembled one large construction site for the past two years as officials undertook some 3,200 construction projects for the jubilee, creating a new underpass near the Vatican, updating the subway system, and restoring the famed Trevi fountain.

"The Jubilee has been a driving force for the transformation of the city," Rome mayor Roberto Gualtieri told reporters.

Although they typically occur only once every quarter-century, a special Jubilee year is expected in 2033 as part of celebrations to mark 2,000 years since the death of Jesus.

Leo proposed in November that the year might also include a joint pilgrimage by him and other Christian leaders to Jerusalem, to visit the site of Jesus' crucifixion.

The last jubilee tourism record, made during the 2000 holy year, was 25 million.

The 2025 Jubilee was marked by an historical rarity not seen for 300 years. It was opened by one pope, Francis, and will be closed on Tuesday during a formal ceremony in St. Peter's Basilica by his successor, Leo.

Francis died in April after 12 years leading the 1.4-billion-member Church. The last jubilee held under two popes was in the year 1700, when Clement XI closed a holy year opened by Innocent XII.

Hundreds of Jubilee construction projects will continue in Rome beyond the end of the Holy Year.

The frenzy of work has infuriated some residents and left some visitors feeling short-changed because various tourist attractions were hidden behind scaffolding for many months.

Many renters in Rome were also left frustrated as the long-term rental market dried up as landlords sought to cash in on short-term rentals for pilgrims.

Special Forces seized Maduro only eight months after the Russian president agreed a strategic partnership with his "dear friend", and Trump said the U.S. was taking temporary control of Venezuela, which has the world's biggest oil reserves .

Some Russian nationalists have criticised the loss of an ally and contrasted the swift U.S. operation with Russia's failure to take control of Ukraine in almost four years of war.

But on another level, what Russia casts as Trump's "piracy" and "regime change" in the United States' "backyard" is more tolerable for Moscow, especially if Washington becomes bogged down in Venezuela.

"Russia has lost an ally in Latin America," said a senior Russian source, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation.

"But if this is an example of Trump's Monroe Doctrine in action, as it seems to be, then Russia also has its own sphere of influence."

The source was referring to the Trump administration's desire to reassert U.S. dominance in the Western Hemisphere and revive the 19th-century Monroe Doctrine, which declared the area to be Washington's zone of influence.

A second Russian source said Moscow saw the U.S. operation as a clear attempt to gain control of Venezuela's oil wealth and observed that most Western powers had not openly criticised it.

Putin has been trying to stake out a Russian sphere of influence in former Soviet republics in Central Asia, the Caucasus and Ukraine in a push opposed by Washington since the Cold War ended.

Putin has not commented publicly on the U.S. operation in Venezuela although Russia's foreign ministry has urged Trump to release Maduro and called for dialogue. The ministry previously cast Trump's actions as modern-day piracy in the Caribbean.

Russian state media have depicted the operation as a U.S. "kidnapping", reported remarks by Trump on the U.S. having "sick" neighbours and referred to the U.S. capture of military leader Manuel Noriega in Panama on January 3, 1990.

"That Trump just 'stole' the president of another country shows that there is basically no international law - there is only the law of force - but Russia has known that for a long time," Sergei Markov, a former Kremlin adviser, told Reuters.

He said the modern-day Monroe Doctrine - which Trump suggested could be updated as the "Donroe Doctrine" - could be interpreted in different ways.

"Is the United States really ready to recognise Russia's dominance over the former Soviet Union, or is it simply that the United States is so strong that it will not tolerate any great powers even close to it?"

Alexei Pushkov, who chairs the commission on information policy in Russia's Federation Council, or senate, saw the U.S. operation in Venezuela as a direct implementation of the U.S. National Security Strategy, depicting it as an attempt to revive U.S. supremacy and gain sway over more oil reserves.

But he said it risked a return to "the wild imperialism of the 19th century and, in fact, reviving the concept of the Wild West - the Wild West in the sense that the United States has regained the right to do what they want in the Western Hemisphere."

"Will the triumph turn into a disaster?" he asked.

For Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping, having a U.S. president focused on - and potentially bogged down in - the Western Hemisphere would appear to be more than acceptable, given Russia's focus on Ukraine and China's on Taiwan .

But some Russian nationalists have criticised the loss of an ally so soon after Bashar al-Assad's fall in Syria, and compared the speed of the U.S. operation with the much slower pace of Russia's advances in Ukraine.

Russia's largest oil producer, Rosneft (ROSN.MM) , opens new tab , terminated operations in Venezuela in 2020 and sold its assets related to operations there to a company owned by Russia's government.

Jailed Russian nationalist Igor Girkin said the U.S. had shown in Venezuela how a great power should act when facing a potential threat and cast the U.S. operation as part of an attempt to cut oil flows to China.

"We've had another blow to our image - another country that counted on Russia's help did not get it," Girkin said.

"Having got bogged down up to our ears in the bloody swamp of Ukraine, we are practically incapable of anything else, especially since we cannot help Venezuela in another hemisphere that is right next door to the United States."</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 14:25:52 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BV42FG46URNNZDQMT7EHK4UAZE.jpg?auth=1bd4b42493ab5e9d4a45aa2aa5df541893f61a2cdc4b8828c27099304bcc64a8&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russian missile strikes damage energy infrastructure in Ukraine's Kharkiv, mayor says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-missile-strikes-damage-energy-infrastructure-ukraines-kharkiv-mayor-says-2026-01-05/</link><description>KYIV, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Russia carried out five missile strikes on Ukraine's second-biggest city Kharkiv on Monday, causing "very serious damage" to energy infrastructure, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said.

"This is not just an attack on facilities. It's an attack on heating, on water, on people's normal lives. They are trying to break us with fear and darkness," he said on Telegram, without specifying the targets that had been hit.

Kharkiv's regional prosecutors' office said in a statement that at least one civilian was injured in the attack.

In a separate strike in the eastern city of Dnipro, an enterprise owned by major U.S. agricultural producer Bunge (BG.N) , opens new tab was hit, causing a leak of 300 tons of sunflower oil, said Borys Filatov, the mayor.

"Public utilities workers are cleaning up, spreading sand and gravel," Filatov wrote on the Telegram messaging app, adding that the spill would close a major riverside road to traffic for two or three days.

Kharkiv, with over a million inhabitants, is located close to the border with Russia. The temperature was around minus 3 degrees Celsius (27°F) during the day on Monday and will drop at night. According to the local electricity supplier, prior to the latest attack residents received electricity for an average of 14-16 hours out of 24.

Since November, Russia has sharply increased both the number and intensity of attacks on Ukraine's energy system and logistics, plunging entire regions into darkness after large-scale missile and drone attacks.

A third of Ukraine's capital Kyiv was left without heating after a vast Russian attack in late December, after Ukraine's largest seaport, Odesa, was virtually cut off from power for several days following a series of attacks.

Russia also attacked stations that produced heat for Chernihiv and Kherson.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 14:27:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Macron says France ‘does not approve’ of method US used to overthrow Maduro</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260105-macron-says-france-does-not-approve-of-method-us-used-to-overthrow-maduro</link><description>French President Emmanuel Macron on Monday said he "neither supported nor approved" the US military operation to grab Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro , a government spokesman said.

His comment clarified an initial public reaction Macron made that Venezuelans "can only rejoice" at Maduro's overthrow.

That first reaction drew criticism from several political figures in France , some of whom saw the French president as kowtowing to US President Donald Trump .

It also contrasted with a reaction from French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot who on Saturday condemned the US operation – saying it undermined international law, while stressing that no solution to Venezuela 's crisis can be imposed from the outside.

On Monday, government spokeswoman Maud Bregeon reported Macron as telling cabinet ministers: "We defend international law and the freedom of peoples. The method employed is neither supported nor approved."

She said Macron added that, for Venezuela, "if there is to be a transition, then the 2024 winner must obviously play a central role in it".

That was in reference to Venezuelan presidential candidate Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia , who was widely considered the rightful victor of a 2024 presidential election.

Maduro, however, was proclaimed the winner, sparking deadly riots that were brutally repressed.

Maduro's vice president, Delcy Rodriguez, has taken over Venezuela's government as interim leader, and said she wants to discuss "cooperation" with Washington. The country's military has said it recognises her authority.

Trump says the US is now "in charge" of Venezuela . The White House on Sunday indicated it does not want regime change, just a pliant new Venezuelan government, even if filled with former Maduro associates.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 14:28:31 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/21ad66fa-ea25-11f0-8685-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25349479964109.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran's leaders struggle to end protests, US action in Venezuela stokes fears</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/irans-leaders-struggle-end-protests-us-action-venezuela-stokes-fears-2026-01-05/</link><description>DUBAI, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Iran's efforts to quell a wave of anti-government protests have been complicated by Donald Trump's threat to intervene on their side, a warning firmly underlined by the subsequent U.S. capture of Venezuela's Nicolas Maduro , officials and insiders said on Monday.

A day before U.S. special forces seized Maduro and his wife on January 3 and whisked them off to New York, the U.S. president warned in a social media post that if Iran's leadership killed protesters who have taken to the streets since December 28 the U.S. "will come to their rescue". At least 17 people have died so far.

Tehran's options have been limited by Trump's threats and a long-running economic crisis that deepened after Israel, joined by the U.S., launched strikes on the Islamic Republic in June in a 12-day war that pummelled several of Iran's nuclear sites.

"These twin pressures have narrowed Tehran's room for manoeuvre, leaving leaders caught between public anger on the streets and hardening demands and threats from Washington, with few viable options and high risks on every path," one Iranian official told Reuters.

The view was echoed by two other officials and a former Iranian official who remains close to Iran's decision makers. All of them asked not to be identified due to the sensitivity of the situation.

A second official said that, after U.S. action in Venezuela, some of the authorities feared Iran could be "the next victim of Trump's aggressive foreign policy".

Iran's economy has been hammered by years of U.S. sanctions, but its rial has been in freefall since last year's Israeli-U.S. strikes that mainly targeted nuclear sites, where the West says Tehran has been working on nuclear arms. Iran denies this.

The protests that erupted in Tehran and which have spread to some cities in western and southern Iran do not match the scale of unrest that swept the nation in 2022-23 over the death of Mahsa Amini, who died in the custody of Iran's morality police for allegedly violating the hijab law.

But, even if smaller, these protests have quickly expanded from an economic focus to broader frustrations, with some protesters chanting "Down with the Islamic Republic" or "Death to the dictator" - a reference to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei who has the final say in all state matters.

That presents a challenge for the authorities which have been trying to maintain and nurture the spirit of national unity that emerged during and after the Israeli-U.S. strikes.

A third official said worries were growing in Tehran that "Trump or Israel might take military action against Iran, like what they did in June."

Iran, which has for years allied itself with fellow oil producer Venezuela, which like Iran has suffered under years of U.S. sanctions, has condemned Washington's action in Caracas. It has also condemned Trump's statements about Iran.

Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei said such statements about "Iran's internal affairs amount, under international norms, to nothing more than incitement to violence, incitement to terrorism, and incitement to killing".

On Friday, Trump threatened to intervene if protesters faced violence, declaring, "We are locked and loaded and ready to go," though he offered no details on what actions he might take.

The protests threaten what has long been Khamenei's defining priority: preserving the Islamic Republic at any cost. In a sign of the leadership's concern, Khamenei on Saturday accused "enemies of the Islamic Republic" of fomenting unrest and warned that "rioters should be put in their place".

Authorities have attempted to maintain a dual approach to the unrest, saying protests over the economy are legitimate and will be met by dialogue, while meeting some demonstrations with tear gas amid violent street confrontations.

However, at least 17 people have been killed in a week, rights groups said on Sunday. Authorities have said at least two members of the security services had died and more than a dozen were injured in the unrest.

The country's clerical establishment is still coming to terms with the 2025 Israeli and U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear and military targets. The attacks, which killed top Revolutionary Guard commanders and nuclear scientists, were launched just a day before a planned sixth round of talks with Washington over Tehran's disputed nuclear program.

Negotiations have stalled since the June conflict, even as both sides insist they remain open to a deal.

Washington and its allies accuse Iran of using its nuclear program as cover to develop weapons capability, a charge Tehran denies, saying its ambitions are purely peaceful.

Economic grievances remain at the heart of latest unrest.

Widening disparities between ordinary Iranians and a privileged clerical and security elite, compounded by mismanagement, runaway inflation and corruption — factors even acknowledged by state media — have fuelled public anger.

Witnesses in Tehran, Mashhad and Tabriz reported a heavy security presence in main squares. "You can feel the tense atmosphere in Tehran, but life continues as normal," said Amir Reza, 47, a carpet shop owner in Tehran's Grand Bazaar.

President Masoud Pezeshkian has urged dialogue and promised reforms to stabilize the monetary and banking systems and protect purchasing power.

Starting January 10, the government will provide a monthly stipend of 10,000,000 rials per person (about $7) in non-cashable electronic credit for use in select grocery stores, the semi-official Tasnim news agency reported.

For lower-income households, whose monthly salaries barely exceed $150, the measure represents a modest but meaningful boost. The rial lost roughly half its value against the dollar in 2025, while official inflation reached 42.5% in December.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 14:51:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/EEWU6YUEQVPIDFNWFLGZN2ESSA.jpg?auth=a9d6cf030cf986669a1d78083a0dac5e11f25db3b90f62968804e95ddc35f5b9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israel urges evacuation of two villages in southern Lebanon ahead of strike</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-urges-evacuation-two-villages-southern-lebanon-ahead-strike-2026-01-05/</link><description>CAIRO, Jan 5 (Reuters) - An Israeli military spokesperson issued on Monday an evacuation order for two villages in southern Lebanon ahead of a strike.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 14:52:16 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/VMFGG6HMMBO4TIKRYZUONABQOU.jpg?auth=dbff391834117a268e41ede21d5613f4db85be956e314f7404f6026dd8a51280&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israel urges evacuation of two villages in southern Lebanon ahead of strike</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-urges-evacuation-two-villages-southern-lebanon-ahead-strike-2026-01-05/</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 14:52:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Witkoff, Kushner to represent US at Ukraine talks, says White House</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/witkoff-kushner-represent-us-ukraine-talks-says-white-house-2026-01-05/</link><description>Jan 5 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff and his son-in-law Jared Kushner will represent the United States at talks on Ukraine in Paris this week, a White House official said on Monday.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 15:26:52 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/IO4XLOYCONIG7OXJTQDFM2LKTM.jpg?auth=98b5cd6fd3d3ca5ef39f17209e5a65142b786511ef9a77235a1c5cf98b15d867&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israeli airstrike kills two in Gaza including girl, hospital staff say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-airstrike-kills-two-gaza-including-girl-hospital-staff-say-2026-01-05/</link><description>CAIRO, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Israel killed at least two Palestinians including a girl, and wounded four others including other children, in an airstrike on Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip on Monday, officials at the city's main Nasser Hospital said.

The Israeli military said the strike, carried out in an area controlled by Hamas, had targeted a Hamas militant who was planning to attack Israeli troops in southern Gaza.

Israel has carried out repeated air strikes in Gaza since a U.S.-brokered deal took effect in October that halted most fighting. Israel says its strikes are aimed at preventing attacks or destroying militant infrastructure.

Gaza's health ministry says 422 Palestinians have been killed since the ceasefire took effect. Gaza militants have killed three Israeli soldiers during the same period.

Under the first phase of the deal, brokered by U.S. President Donald Trump, Israel has retained control of 53% of Gaza. Hamas agreed to release living hostages and hand over remains in exchange for the freeing of Palestinians detained by Israel.

The final hostage remains still to be handed over belong to an Israeli police officer killed on October 7, 2023 - the day Gazan militants invaded Israel, killing 1,200 and taking some 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.

Israel's offensive in Gaza has killed more than 71,000 Palestinians, most of them civilians, according to local health authorities. Most of the territory is in ruins, with the population of more than 2 million living mainly in makeshift homes or damaged buildings in areas where Israeli forces withdrew.

Earlier on Monday, a father and son in Gaza were killed in the collapse of their house which had been damaged in an earlier Israeli strike, authorities in Gaza said.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 15:48:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/NULNCCXFQBKSPMNVZ6KNJLRKOI.jpg?auth=e72741fa4f7d0d9f8a8911aad4bb5a0a88c67ab682883756a4d0c991bcbf9d8a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Denmark's prime minister says Trump is serious about wanting Greenland takeover</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/denmarks-prime-minister-says-trump-is-serious-about-wanting-greenland-takeover-2026-01-05/</link><description>COPENHAGEN, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said on Monday that she believes U.S. President Donald Trump is serious about wanting to take over Greenland, and that both Denmark and Greenland have clearly rejected his ambition.

Guterres also said in the statement that he was concerned that the U.S. operation to capture Maduro in Caracas early on Saturday did not respect the rules of international law.

A spokesperson for the Swiss Foreign Ministry said the order affects 37 people. The spokesperson said the ministry could not provide any details on the value of the assets in question.

The measure, effective immediately and valid for four years, aims to prevent an outflow of potentially illicit assets and comes in addition to existing sanctions imposed on Venezuela since 2018, the government said in a statement.

The asset freeze does not affect members of the current Venezuelan government, and Switzerland said it will seek to return any funds found to be illicitly acquired to benefit the Venezuelan people.

The government said the situation in Venezuela was volatile, with various outcomes possible in the coming days and weeks.

It said it was following the situation closely, and called for de-escalation and restraint, while also offering its good offices to find a peaceful solution.

"The Federal Council wants to ensure that any illicitly acquired assets cannot be transferred out of Switzerland in the current situation," it said.

The asset freeze was a precautionary measure and applied to Maduro and his associates as foreign politically exposed persons, the government said.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 16:29:31 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/FHVBK67CG5NWJALKIX4QYNVY2U.jpg?auth=ed17f12cf6f30e1898ab72cbc5fa7e571687edb0c85504bb05d93b45d461c3c6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Britain demands Elon Musk's Grok answers concerns about sexualised photos</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/britain-demands-elon-musks-grok-answers-concerns-about-sexualised-photos-2026-01-05/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Britain has demanded Elon Musk's social media site X explain how its AI chatbot Grok was able to produce undressed images of people and sexualised images of children, and whether it was failing in its legal duty to protect users.

Grok said on Friday lapses in safeguards had resulted in "images depicting minors in minimal clothing" on X, saying it was urgently fixing them.

British media regulator Ofcom said it was aware of "serious concerns" raised about the feature.

"We have made urgent contact with X and xAI to understand what steps they have taken to comply with their legal duties to protect users in the UK," a spokesperson said.

Grok said on Friday: "xAI has safeguards, but improvements are ongoing to block such requests entirely."

Creating or sharing non-consensual intimate images or child sexual abuse material, including sexual deepfakes created by artificial intelligence, is illegal in Britain.

In addition, tech platforms have a duty to take steps to stop British users encountering illegal content and take it down when they become aware of it.

The request comes after ministers in France reported X to prosecutors and regulators over the disturbing images, saying in a statement on Friday the "sexual and sexist" content was "manifestly illegal".</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 16:30:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WZUIN6NBUVJEFHFNMY2AU7TDQQ.jpg?auth=07385399c8e03bc163dc51202d900132d76ac75624f01c308a5b2f682299440b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>France asks airlines to cancel 15% of flights at Paris main airports after snowfalls</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/france-asks-airlines-cancel-15-flights-paris-main-airports-after-snowfalls-2026-01-05/</link><description>PARIS, Jan 5 (Reuters) - France's civil aviation authority on Monday asked airlines to cancel 15% of flights until later in the evening at Orly and Charles de Gaulle airports following heavy snowfalls in the French capital Paris.

The airlines are free to choose which flights they cancel so long as they reduce takeoffs and landings, a spokesperson told Reuters.

Airlines were asked to reduce flights until 2000 CET (1900 GMT) at Paris-Charles de Gaulle airport, and until 2330 CET (2230 GMT) at Paris-Orly.

The French transport ministry urged travellers to check if their flight was taking off before leaving home, and to go to the airport by public transportation rather than by car.

Meanwhile, Amsterdam Schiphol airport , one of Europe's busiest hubs, cancelled almost 500 flights on Monday morning and was closed to incoming traffic until 1200 GMT also because of snowfalls, news agency ANP reported.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 16:30:42 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CMAXOSYJVNNSVHUWY2GCDMVMBQ.jpg?auth=833521d89a12b5b9db39decbe7544bfbdfe2acedcd8e61fd7c36de5b0b9980fd&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>All 116 people wounded in Crans-Montana New Year's fire now identified</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260105-all-116-people-wounded-in-crans-montana-new-year-s-fire-now-identified</link><description>Swiss police announced Monday they had now identified all 116 people wounded in the devastating New Year bar blaze in Crans-Montana , with three-quarters of them still in hospital.

Four days on from the blaze that swept through Le Constellation bar in the Alpine ski resort town, everyone killed and injured has now been identified.

A total of 40 people were killed in the tragedy, all of whom had been identified by Sunday. The average age of those killed was 19.

"All 116 injured people have been identified. Eighty-three of them are still hospitalised," the Wallis cantonal police in southwest Switzerland said in a statement.

The total number of people injured in the disaster was revised downwards, with police having warned in the days following the tragedy that the tolls were likely to change.

"Initially, we reported 119 injured. In reality, three injured people admitted to the emergency room that night were mistakenly attributed to the event," the statement said.

Among those injured were 68 Swiss, 21 French, 10 Italians, four Serbs and two Poles, police said.

Nationals from Belgium, Portugal, the Czech Republic, Australia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Republic of Congo and Luxembourg were also among those hurt in the tragedy.

And there were four injured people with dual nationality, given as French-Finnish, Swiss-Belgian, French-Italian, and Philippine-Italian.

The Wallis police said no further information would be given on the identities of those injured, "out of respect for the families".

The most severely burned casualties have been airlifted to specialist burns centres in Switzerland and abroad.

The Swiss government said Sunday that 35 patients had been transferred to specialist clinics in neighbouring Germany, France and Italy, plus Belgium.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 16:32:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/30bbb2b2-e987-11f0-ac25-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-04T152628Z-50281374-RC2BUIA5XSF3-RTRMADP-3-SWITZERLAND-BLAST.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump’s risky gamble: Can the US 'run' Venezuela after Maduro's capture?</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260105-trump-risky-gamble-can-the-us-run-venezuela-maduro-capture</link><description>US President Donald Trump described the next steps following the shock military US action in Venezuela – dubbed “Operation Absolute Determination” – as a temporary phase pending a political transition.

He presented the run-up to this transition as simple and unequivocal: the United States would “run” Venezuela after the capture of Nicolas Maduro on Saturday.

But the US president did not provide details on how this US stewardship – which would be legally fragile – would be implemented. And while he left open the possibility of deploying US troops on Venezuelan soil, he did not specify whether their role would be to maintain order or protect the US oil companies that he said would soon be operating in the country.

"Toppling Maduro is likely to be the easy part for Trump," warned an analysis in The Washington Post . The paper nevertheless offered editorial support for the US operation.

Historically, US attempts to "run" foreign countries, either covertly or openly from Washington, have rarely succeeded. "In Latin America , US interventions have generally ended badly, such as Guatemala in 1954, where a US-backed coup led to decades of internal conflict," said Luca Trenta, a US foreign policy and security specialist at Swansea University in Wales. "Elsewhere, in Iraq and Libya , the American presence was also accompanied by a sharp rise in violence."

Many experts expressed scepticism that Trump might succeed where others had failed. "The statements made during the press conference [on Sunday] were not reassuring," said Rebecca Jarman, a Latin America security specialist at the University of Leeds. "The best-case scenario would have been a negotiated transition, perhaps some kind of diplomatic help in creating a structure that would lead to some sort of coalition. Instead, everything appears to rest on a show of force and the possible deployment of troops ."

Trump has ruled out Venezuelan Maria Corina Machado , the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize laureate , saying she lacked the stature to lead the country, despite her role as a former lawmaker and Venezuela’s leading opposition figure.

Anyone who ascends to the role will be walking a fine line.  "The problem is that the manner in which Maduro was removed will make the next opposition leader look like a US puppet," said Tom Long, a Latin America specialist at the University of Warwick.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio appears to have made his choice. He announced that the United States would cooperate with Delcy Rodriguez , Venezuela’s vice president, who was appointed by the Supreme Court on Saturday to serve as interim president.

But shortly after Rubio made his remarks, Rodriguez showed little willingness to align with Washington. "She was very clear in a press conference that actually, she simply wanted to get Maduro back because he was the legitimate president", Trenta said. Speaking on state television, Rodriguez urged national unity in response to what she called Maduro's "kidnapping" and insisted Venezuela would never become a "colony".

Rodriguez also arouses "a degree of mistrust within the US administration because some see her as appointed by Maduro and so unreliable", the expert added. She thus does not fit the profile of the total political reversal the United States would like to see in Venezuela.

"It would be wrong to assume the previous government disappeared with Maduro’s arrest," Long said.

But some experts argued she could play a stabilising role. "Her hostile rhetoric towards Washington is posturing, it’s unavoidable," Jarman said. Any other tone would have branded her a Washington stooge in the eyes of officials still in place in Caracas.

Jarman described Rodriguez as "not particularly ideologically bound" and, above all, "a careerist politician". She added that Rodriguez’s track record of running the Venezuelan intelligence services since 2018 means she is experienced in dealing with "antagonistic actors", an advantage in the eyes of Trump and Rubio.

Indeed, that skill could allow Rodriguez to maintain a fragile balance between US interests as well as those of the Venezuelan military and "non-state actors", including gangs, potentially sparing Washington the need to deploy troops.

It remains to be seen, however, if Rodriguez’s political skill will be enough to keep Venezuela under control. No one knows, for instance, how the country's powerful military could react. "At the moment, Defence Minister Vladimir Padrino Lopez and high-ranking officials are laying low," Jarman said. "They want to see what happens and how this all plays out before working out where best to invest their loyalty and their efforts."

"The army's appetite to defend Maduro himself is very limited, but its appetite to defend its turf is very high – especially its interests in natural resource extraction such as oil, or in drug trafficking ," she added.

The armed forces, therefore, appear to be waiting to see which entrenched interests they will be able to defend.

Experts also warned of the risk of internal divisions within the armed forces. "If splits emerge, tensions could quickly escalate, potentially leading to violence, chaos and conflict," Trenta said.

Such a scenario would be catastrophic for the population, who would bear the brunt of any escalation in violence. But the alternative is not a cure-all for Venezuelans, even if some welcomed the fall of Maduro, who Jarman notes "was very unpopular” in the country.

A short-term cooperation between Washington and Rodriguez could entrench the existing power structure, Jarman warned. “The ruling elites could tighten their grip on institutions and increase repression, this time without fear of being targeted by the United States,” she said.

Air traffic controllers for Athens airport were guiding planes toward the runway when the usual radio chatter suddenly vanished - replaced by a piercing whistle.

It quickly became clear that controllers had lost contact with most aircraft in Greek airspace, including dozens of incoming flights, according to two controllers and an aviation official on duty at the time.

Internet systems also appeared to fail across the board. Even the civil aviation authority's press office resorted to reading statements over the phone rather than sending by email.

The outage , which lasted several hours and affected most of Greece's airports, stranded thousands of travelers. Authorities have ruled out a cyberattack, but the cause remains unknown - and officials admit the systems didn't get fixed, they simply came back on their own.

"Suddenly communications went down. You could only hear a high-pitched whistle," said one controller, speaking on condition of anonymity. "The thing is, we don't know what caused it and how it ended. We want to find out the exact cause to ensure once and for all that this will not happen again."

Controllers managed to identify a couple of working radio frequencies in the tower, but not enough to maintain safe communication with pilots, a senior official said. Within half an hour, Greece took the unprecedented step of suspending flights into and across its airspace.

Air traffic controllers from across the region stepped in to help. A controller in a neighbouring country said most communication with Greece was done over the telephone because the usual radios were down.

"We had a black hole in Greek airspace," said aviation safety expert Faithon Karaiosifidis. "Imagine if it had happened in the summer at the peak of the tourist season. The chaos."

The incident has reignited calls to upgrade Greece's aviation infrastructure, which unions and experts say is outdated and underfunded after the country's 2009–2018 debt crisis.

The government insisted Monday that modernisation is underway and that current systems meet EU standards. The plan, which includes updating communication systems, is due for completion in 2028.

But last month, the European Commission referred Greece to the EU Court of Justice for failing to implement certain navigation procedures designed to boost safety in low-visibility conditions. It's unclear whether those measures would have made any difference on Sunday - but many worry reform is coming too late.

"This incident once again exposes the critical weaknesses of outdated and underfunded air traffic management infrastructure. Safety was maintained thanks to human expertise — but this cannot continue to compensate for systemic deficiencies," said Panagiotis Psarros, Chair of the Association of Greek Air Traffic Controllers.

Experts say the problems go beyond ageing equipment. Radios dating back to the 1990s remain in use, and staffing shortages persist despite a tourism boom that brings millions of visitors to Greece each year.

"The old technical equipment and the lack of personnel in air traffic controllers and electronic technicians ... create a bottleneck," said Karaiosifidis.

In September, unions protested by limiting flight arrivals they said exceeded permitted limits, causing delays. They have now threatened to do the same again.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 17:23:58 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/3WBX3SWRIFPALHASBUF6MFC5QQ.jpg?auth=f741b55a2d70ba863eeae3b83c7307b24c78b89d4e913344636dfc886a725b47&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US making preparations in case Trump decides to reopen embassy in Caracas, official says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/us-making-preparations-case-trump-decides-reopen-embassy-caracas-official-says-2026-01-05/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 5 (Reuters) - The United States is undergoing preparations in case President Donald Trump decides to reopen the U.S. embassy in Venezuela's capital Caracas, a senior State Department official said on Monday.

"As President Trump said, we are making preparations to allow for a reopening should the President make that decision," the official told Reuters.

Trump on Sunday said that the U.S. was thinking about reopening the embassy in Caracas.

Bloomberg first reported that the Trump administration is taking early steps to allow for the reopening of the American embassy in Venezuela.

The United States captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro in a raid early on Saturday and whisked him to New York to face drug-trafficking charges.

Trump has asserted that the U.S. will run Venezuela until such time as a "safe, proper and judicious transition" can be made, and he has made no secret of wanting to share in Venezuela's oil riches.

But it was unclear how the U.S. intends to run the country. The U.S. president's vow on Saturday to “run” post-Maduro Venezuela appears for now to be more an aspiration to exert outside control - or at least heavy influence - over the OPEC nation without deploying U.S. ground forces, which would have little public support at home.

But Trump said on Sunday that more military intervention was on the table. "If they don't behave, we will do a second strike," he said.

American oil companies will return to Venezuela and rebuild the sector's infrastructure, Trump told reporters on Air Force One on Sunday.

The U.S. in 2019 withdrew all diplomatic personnel from Venezuela, citing the deteriorating situation in the country after months of political unrest.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 17:47:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/JAS2QHNI6FJYBALNZMLXYLTYJA.jpg?auth=baf1d82dfaefef375c2a1d21b0eb7641b14ed07493ec2d39883088d687efa413&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuela's Jorge Rodriguez re-appointed as head of National Assembly</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/venezuelas-jorge-rodriguez-re-appointed-head-national-assembly-2026-01-05/</link><description>Jan 5 - Jorge Rodriguez was re-appointed as the President of Venezuela's National Assembly on Monday.

The far-left Volcano activist group claimed responsibility for the attack which also shut down mobile phone connections, cut heating during freezing weather, stopped trains and forced hospitals to switch to back-up generators.

"Left-wing terrorism is back in Germany with increasing intensity," Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt told the Bild newspaper in an interview.

Volcano, which says it is against the energy industry's use of fossil fuels, has claimed several attacks in Berlin and the neighbouring Brandenburg region.

"There will be talks which we have to have with the federal government about how we can better protect our critical infrastructure, especially in the area of the capital," Berlin mayor Kai Wegner told a news conference.

Germany and other Western powers have also been on the alert for sabotage attacks on power, communications and transport systems at a time of increasing geopolitical uncertainty.

A blaze early on Saturday destroyed a cable duct over a canal, cutting power in around 45,000 households and more than 2,000 businesses in the southwest of the city, including the prosperous areas of Zehlendorf and Wannsee.

Electricity has since been restored for some 14,500 households but full restoration is not expected until Thursday afternoon, Stromnetz Berlin, the city's network operator, said.

In 2024, the Volcano group claimed responsibility for a suspected arson attack on a power pylon near Tesla's car factory outside Berlin.

In its most recent annual report, the domestic intelligence agency said left-wing militancy was a growing danger and made explicit reference to the Volcano group.

Bernhard Büllmann, head of Stromnetz Berlin, said restoring electricity to areas still without power would be a complex operation involving high-tension lines that required specialist staff.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 18:36:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4IAMFFG4ORJL5HCGNYKEDUFDS4.jpg?auth=7b76ec77cdb55bb09a64b9169de3af2f9ced17d54d9c3cf5229594aafa3bc3b6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Who might be next: Countries in US crosshairs after Venezuela</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260105-maduro-ouster-who-next-us-trump-crosshairs-regime-change-cuba-greenland-iran</link><description>A day after the audacious – and successful – US military operation that removed Nicolas Maduro in Venezuela, Secretary of State Marco Rubio indicated in an interview that aired Sunday that Cuba might be next.

Asked directly whether Cuba was the administration's "next target", Rubio called the Cuban government "a huge problem".

"So is that a yes?" the interviewer pressed. "I think they're in a lot of trouble, yes," Rubio replied.

That same day, Trump renewed his calls for a US takeover of the Danish territory of Greenland, citing US security interests, and threatened military action in Colombia for its role in cocaine trafficking.

With such thinly veiled threats, Trump and co. are rattling friends and foes alike, spurring observers around the world to pose a pointed question: Who might be next?

Greenland's melting Arctic ice is creating new, potentially lucrative shipping routes while its land mass is mineral-rich. Its strategic location has also been identified as a potential Achilles' heel for NATO . Russia, China, the United States and Europe have already taken steps to bolster their military presence in the region.

Trump, for his part, tried to buy the semi-autonomous island from Denmark in 2019 during his first term.

“It’s so strategic right now. Greenland is covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place," Trump told reporters as he flew back to Washington from Florida on Sunday.

"We need Greenland from the standpoint of national security, and Denmark is not going to be able to do it.”

The operation in Caracas and Trump’s comments heightened concern in Copenhagen, with Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen stating unequivocally that Trump has "no right to annex" the territory.

She also reminded Trump that Denmark already provides the United States, a fellow member of NATO, broad access to Greenland through existing security agreements.

“I would therefore strongly urge the US to stop threatening a historically close ally and another country and people who have made it very clear that they are not for sale,” Frederiksen said.

Denmark signed onto a European Union statement on Sunday underscoring that “the right of the Venezuelan people to determine their future must be respected” even as Trump vowed the US would “run” Venezuela and pressed the country's acting president, former vice president Delcy Rodriguez, to toe the US line .

Trump mocked Danish efforts to boost Greenland’s national security posture on Sunday by saying the Danes had added “one more dog sled” to their arsenal.

Greenlanders and Danes were further rankled by a social media post from a former Trump administration official turned right-wing podcaster. Katie Miller – who is married to Trump deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, the anti-immigrant campaigner and architect of many of Trump's controversial deportation policies – appeared to threaten Denmark, a US ally. The post showed an illustrated map of Greenland in the colors of the Stars and Stripes accompanied by the caption: “SOON."

In a post responding to Miller, Ambassador Jesper Moller Sorensen, Denmark's chief envoy to Washington, called for the US to respect national borders. “And yes, we expect full respect for the territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Denmark,” he wrote.

During his presidential transition and in the early months of his return to the White House, Trump called for the US to assert control over Greenland and has pointedly not ruled out military force to take control of the Arctic island.

The issue had largely drifted out of the headlines in recent months. But Trump then put the spotlight back on Greenland less than two weeks ago when he said he would appoint Republican Governor Jeff Landry as special envoy to Greenland. The Louisiana governor responded that in his volunteer position he would help Trump “make Greenland a part of the US”.

The Trump administration's National Security Strategy , published last month, cited restoring “American preeminence in the Western Hemisphere” as a central goal, an aim underscored by the Venezuelan adventure.

Trump on Saturday cited the 19th-century Monroe Doctrine , which called on world powers – notably European colonists – to respect American hegemony in the region.

He also cited the doctrine's Roosevelt Corollary – the justification used to support Panama’s secession from Colombia, which helped secure the Panama Canal Zone for the US – as he made his case for a more assertive approach to the Western Hemisphere.

Trump even quipped that James Monroe's 1823 policy declaration could be renamed the “Don-roe Doctrine”.

Concern is thus simmering in Cuba, one of Venezuela’s most important allies and trading partners, fueled by Rubio's hints that the Cuban government might be the next to draw Washington's attention.

Rubio underscored the link between the two countries in his Sunday appearance on NBC's “Meet the Press”, saying Cuban officials were with Maduro ahead of his capture.

“It was Cubans that guarded Maduro,” Rubio said. “He was not guarded by Venezuelan bodyguards. He had Cuban bodyguards.” The secretary of state added that Cuban bodyguards were also in charge of “internal intelligence” in Maduro’s government, including “who spies on who inside, to make sure there are no traitors”.

The Cuban government said in a statement read on state television on Sunday evening that 32 officers were killed in the US military operation that toppled Maduro.

Trump said the Cuban economy, battered by years of a US embargo, is in tatters and will slide further now with the ouster of Maduro, who provided the Caribbean island with subsidized oil. “It's going down,” Trump said of Cuba's economy. “It's going down for the count.”

US-Cuba relations have been hostile since the 1959 Cuban revolution.

As he made his way back to Washington on Sunday evening, Trump also put Venezuela's neighbour Colombia and its leftist president, Gustavo Petro, on notice.

In a back-and-forth with reporters, Trump said Colombia is “run by a sick man who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States”.

The administration imposed sanctions in October on Petro, his family and a member of his government over accusations of involvement in the global drug trafficking.

Trump began his pressure campaign on Maduro by ordering dozens of lethal strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats travelling from Venezuela in the Caribbean. He eventually expanded the operations to target suspected vessels in the eastern Pacific originating from Colombia.

In September the United States added Colombia, the top recipient of US assistance in the region, to a list of nations failing to cooperate in the drug war for the first time in almost 30 years. The designation led to a slashing of assistance to the country.

“He’s not going to be doing it for very long,” Trump said of Petro on Sunday. “He has cocaine mills and cocaine factories. He’s not going to be doing it.”

Asked whether he might order the US to conduct an operation against Colombia, Trump replied vaguely: “It sounds good to me.”

Iran has long been allied to Venezuela, using Caracas to bypass US sanctions and trading oil for gold. The " ghost fleets " operating off the coast of Venezuela are suspected of carrying sanctioned Russian and Iranian oil to global markets, circumventing sanctions.

Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah militants also have economic ties to Venezuela , raising money through narcotics. According to the Atlantic Council think tank, the Maduro regime and Hezbollah have exploited the status quo "to turn Venezuela into a central hub for the convergence of transnational organized crime and international terrorism".

Leaders in Tehran are likely to see the fall of Maduro as an indication that Trump is likely to pursue regime change if he deems it's in the US interest, and will not just stop at curtailing Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile programs, noted Raz Zimmt, head of the Iran and Shiite Axis research program at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv, in comments to the Times of Israel .

Moreover, events in Venezuela could indicate that Trump would not oppose Israeli efforts at regime change in Tehran despite his previous dissembling. Hosting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House last week, Trump dismissed the idea, telling reporters : “I’m not going to talk about an overthrow of a regime.”

But amid reports of widespread Iranian protests just a few days later, Trump returned to more bellicose rhetoric.

“If Iran shots [sic] and violently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue," he posted on Truth Social in the wee hours of January 2. “We are locked and loaded and ready to go,” he said before adding his customary sign-off: “Thank you for your attention to this matter!”</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 18:37:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/3dcbbc5a-ea26-11f0-8e3e-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/Trump-Rubio-Maduro-next.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Snow and ice cause travel disruption in France, UK and Netherlands</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260105-snow-and-ice-cause-travel-disruption-in-france-uk-and-netherlands</link><description>Some of the winter's coldest weather so far hit travel in Britain, France and the Netherlands on Monday, closing roads, grounding flights and forcing train cancellations, including on Eurostar, just days after a power outage caused major disruption.

Eurostar , which links the UK to the European mainland, told passengers travelling between London and the Netherlands to postpone their journeys, as services could not operate beyond Brussels due to the Dutch weather.

Rail traffic through the Channel Tunnel had only resumed on New Year's Eve, after an electricity failure stranded thousands of passengers and even trapped some for a night on a powerless train.

"Due to expected adverse weather conditions, the traffic is suspended in the Netherlands today," Eurostar said in a live service update, urging travellers affected not to turn up to the station.

Six trains between London St Pancras International and Paris Gare du Nord were cancelled, with most others delayed, the timetable indicated.

British railway authorities meanwhile deployed snowploughs in Scotland to try to clear tracks hit by heavy snow, which reached up to 52 centimetres (20 inches) on Monday morning in Tomintoul, near Inverness in northeast Scotland .

NS Dutch railways said services were severely disrupted on Monday, especially in the Amsterdam region, and fewer trains would run in some parts of the country on Tuesday.

The UK's Met Office issued fresh weather warnings for Monday and Tuesday for snow and ice for Scotland, Northern Ireland and parts of northern England and said cold weather health alerts for all English regions would remain in place until Friday.

The disruption follows a cold snap in recent days in the UK.

Temperatures dropped to a low of -10.9C in the high hills of Shap in Cumbria, northwest England, on Sunday night.

"Overnight into Tuesday temperatures will once again fall below freezing for much of the country, with the lowest temperatures over lying snow possibly dipping to -12C," the Met Office said.

A total of 212 schools were closed in Northern Ireland on Monday, the authorities said, with dozens of schools also shut in Scotland, Wales and northern England.

Flights were cancelled at airports including Liverpool in northwest England, Aberdeen and Inverness in northeast Scotland, and Belfast in Northern Ireland.

At France's major Paris airports of Charles de Gaulle and Orly, heavy snowfall forced airlines to reduce their flights by 15 percent.

Some 250 snowploughs were on standby at the two airports, French Transport Minister Philippe Tabarot told a press conference, adding there would likely be "cancellations and some delays".

At Schiphol, the main international airport of the Netherlands, some 700 flights were cancelled -- more than half of those scheduled to take off or land on Monday.

Reduced traffic was expected for the rest of the day, the airport authorities said, with wintry weather forcing further cancellations in the coming days.

In Paris, snow and ice disrupted the bus network on Monday afternoon and roads, particularly in the northwest Normandy region as well as in the French capital, were badly affected with long rush-hour tailbacks.

Weather service Meteo France issued an orange alert for snow and ice for much of northwest France, including Paris, on Monday evening – the second-highest warning.

It forecast sub-zero temperatures into the evening and overnight, with the mercury barely above freezing into Tuesday.

In Scotland, the police cautioned road users not to try to drive through closed roads because of the treacherous conditions.

The UK's roadside assistance provider, the AA, said there had been a 40 percent spike in callouts compared to a typical Monday.

Belfast Zoo remained closed due to the weather conditions on Monday, while snow, ice or low temperature warnings were in place across neighbouring Ireland.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 19:20:42 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/cb446318-ea56-11f0-ab3c-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/000-89NX74R.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Delcy Rodriguez formally sworn in as Venezuela's interim president</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/delcy-rodriguez-formally-sworn-venezuelas-interim-president-2026-01-05/</link><description>Jan 5 - Venezuela's vice president and oil minister Delcy Rodriguez was formally sworn in on Monday as the country's interim president, as U.S.-deposed President Nicolas Maduro appeared in a New York court on drug charges, after the Trump administration removed him from power in a dramatic weekend military action.

Rodriguez, a 56-year-old labor lawyer known for close connections to the private sector and her devotion to the ruling party, was sworn in by her brother Jorge, who is the head of the national assembly legislature.

Also sworn in on Monday were 283 lawmakers elected last May. Just a small number of are classed as opposition - most of the opposition, especially the faction directed by Nobel Prize winner Machado, boycotted the contest.

The two-day poll showed 65% of Republicans back the military operation ordered by Republican President Donald Trump, compared to 11% of Democrats and 23% of independents.

U.S. forces swooped into Caracas before dawn on Saturday in a deadly raid that yielded the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, who the U.S. military turned over to federal authorities for prosecution on charges involving alleged drug trafficking.

The Reuters/Ipsos poll, conducted on Sunday and Monday, showed significant support among Republicans for a foreign policy that includes exerting influence over nearby countries.

Some 43% of Republicans said they agreed with the statement: "The United States should have a policy of dominating affairs in the Western Hemisphere," compared with 19% who disagreed. The rest said they were unsure or did not answer the question.

The poll, which surveyed 1,248 U.S. adults nationwide, showed Trump's approval rating at 42%, the highest rating since October and up from 39% in a December poll. The poll, which was conducted online, had a margin of error of about 3 percentage points.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 19:42:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/37TCBCR6PZMWVJCXXWMTZGIOKU.jpg?auth=687041e210cd3e8f28f2c3d664d9b39632efbfdf0e94a1e74047dac1ec085d2e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Assange's lawyer Barry Pollack to fight Maduro's US narcotics charges</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/assanges-lawyer-barry-pollack-fight-maduros-us-narcotics-charges-2026-01-05/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Barry Pollack — the Washington lawyer who represented WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange — will defend toppled Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro in a U.S. drug case that could test immunity claims for foreign leaders and the legality of his capture.

Pollack appeared with Maduro on Monday as he pleaded not guilty in Manhattan federal court days after Maduro and his wife were seized in a U.S. military raid.

Defending Assange gave Pollack a taste of cases steeped in global intrigue and with consequences for America’s standing in the world. The case tested whether U.S. law could criminalize the publishing of sensitive information.

Assange faced U.S. Espionage Act charges for WikiLeaks’ mass release of secret U.S. documents, including diplomatic cables and accounts of military actions in Iraq and Afghanistan.

After months of negotiations, he pleaded guilty to a single count of conspiring to obtain and disclose classified defense information.

The unusual 2024 deal Pollack struck let Assange walk out of a British prison, enter his plea in the U.S. territory of the Northern Mariana Islands before returning to his native Australia.

POLLACK SAYS HE WILL CHALLENGE MADURO'S 'MILITARY ABDUCTION'

Maduro pleaded not guilty on Monday to a four-count indictment accusing him of leading a conspiracy to funnel cocaine into the United States, including by working with armed guerrilla groups, drug cartels and international gangs.

At Maduro's arraignment in Manhattan federal court on Monday, Pollack said he anticipated extensive legal wrangling over what he termed Maduro's "military abduction," signaling the defense will argue Saturday's operation was unlawful .

Pollack may also claim that Maduro is immune from criminal charges as the head of a foreign government. Pollack did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

"The United States has an extraordinary view of what its worldwide jurisdiction is," Pollack told the legal site Lawdragon in an interview last year about the Assange case.

Both arguments face legal hurdles.

The U.S. has not recognized Maduro as Venezuela's leader since 2019, after Maduro claimed victory in an election the U.S. and other countries deemed fraudulent. U.S. courts have generally declined to dismiss prosecutions based on claims a defendant was brought to the U.S. unlawfully.

Pollack, a partner at the Harris St. Laurent &amp; Wechsler law firm, also previously represented a former Central Intelligence Agency officer who was convicted of sharing classified information with a reporter.

He secured an acquittal for a former Enron Corp executive who faced charges tied to the energy company's collapse in 2001.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 19:43:19 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/6BYKJPMBJRKGHP2PYZ4DC7D3EI.jpg?auth=ec5d26143c5adb809576a747fb51acaf52da2854547e59206c95125440e34e20&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Greenland is not comparable to Venezuela, prime minister says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/greenland-is-not-comparable-venezuela-prime-minister-says-2026-01-05/</link><description>COPENHAGEN, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Greenland hopes to improve relations with the United States and can't be compared to Venezuela, the Arctic island's Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen told a press conference on Monday.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 19:44:04 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ZYDRNAPY4BNE7BRUZQCT75PPOA.jpg?auth=ce887505c2bf65d22ddf66fd64eda0d5944962869f55f766c5c650e8dbbabd73&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>At least nine soldiers killed in ambush attack in Nigeria's Borno state, sources say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/least-nine-soldiers-killed-ambush-attack-nigerias-borno-state-sources-say-2026-01-05/</link><description>MAIDUGURI, Nigeria, Jan 5 (Reuters) - At least nine Nigerian soldiers were killed and several others injured when their convoy struck a landmine and came under fire in Borno state in northeastern Nigeria, two security sources said on Monday.

The attack took place on Sunday near Bindundul village, about 20 kilometres (12 miles) from Kareto, an area where Islamic State West Africa Province fighters operate freely and often set up checkpoints, according to a military source from the Damasak brigade.

"The terrorists planted a mine that our soldiers stepped on. Unfortunately, about nine soldiers died instantly, while five others were seriously injured," said Abba Kaka Tuja, a member of the Civilian Joint Task Force involved in the rescue operation.

He added that an armoured vehicle was destroyed when the mine detonated, followed by sporadic gunfire from militants.

The soldiers were traveling from Maiduguri to Damasak, the headquarters of Mobbar Local Government Area, when the attack occurred around 1600 GMT, Tuja said.

Military officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Nigeria’s northeast, where ISWAP fighters and Boko Haram have intensified attacks in recent months, targeting military convoys and civilians, is the country’s most conflict-prone region.

Other areas are also tense.

Lula has condemned the U.S. actions as crossing an "unacceptable line."

The Brazilian Presidency did not provide further details about Saturday's call.

According to a source from Brazil's government, Lula called Rodriguez to confirm reports he had seen in the media regarding the U.S. military action that removed Maduro from power in Venezuela.

Many Venezuelans said they were still processing the events of Saturday, when a military operation rocked the capital Caracas and other areas, and expect a prolonged period of political and economic uncertainty.

Mariela Gonzalez, 52, the owner of a beauty and makeup business in the northwestern city of Barquisimeto, said that she had chatted with other shopkeepers via WhatsApp and opted to reopen on Monday after closing over the weekend.

"We're afraid, but we can't let ourselves be paralyzed," Gonzalez said.

U.S. President Donald Trump has said the U.S. will "run" Venezuela pending a political transition, while also threatening more military action if a new interim government led by Maduro's former vice president does not cooperate with Washington's demands.

After a spike of panic-buying at the weekend, customer traffic was slower than usual on Monday, said store employees.

"We are open because we have to work and also because there are perishable foods that can spoil. However, people are only coming to buy the basics," said Rosendo Linarez, 38, a supermarket manager in Barquisimeto.

In Venezuela's second-largest city of Maracaibo, in the western state of Zulia, drivers of taxis and buses estimated that over a third of their colleagues were staying home out of fear and for lack of clients.

"There are very few passengers, and a tense calm," said Marielys Urdaneta, a 41-year-old driver, who said she showed up to work because she needed the income. "I went out of necessity ... fear or not, you have to eat," she said.

Douglas Sanchez, who sells snacks from a kiosk in Caracas, agreed.

"You feel anguish, desperation, all of that, but (we) have to go out and work, go out and make our little bit of money to buy food and things. Because if you don't go out to work, you don't have anything," he said.

Daniel Morillo, 30, who migrated to Peru five years ago, was visiting his hometown of Maracaibo for the Christmas holidays. After the events of the weekend he said he was planning to cut his trip short, using his remaining funds to buy medicine and food for his parents.

"I thought I would leave sad just because of the goodbye to my parents ... not with this knot in my chest for leaving them in this uncertainty," Morillo said.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 21:22:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/PN3FR334SRP5BHYEV6OTXQMYV4.jpg?auth=b2bc6a95625c63a1fb448667dfee6a8d88acaddcf83e8e72d59695b58f33c888&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Colombia to continue to work with US on drug trafficking, government says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/colombia-continue-work-with-us-drug-trafficking-government-says-2026-01-05/</link><description>BOGOTA, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Colombia will continue to work with the United States in fighting drug trafficking using Washington's intel and technology, two officials from the South American nation said on Monday.

Aliyev, interviewed by Azeri television channels, said Azerbaijan had been in contact with Donald Trump's U.S. administration with a list of questions about the operation of a peacekeeping force in Gaza.

"We prepared a questionnaire of more than 20 questions and provided it to the American side. No participation in peacekeeping forces is envisaged," Aliyev said.

"I am not considering participation in hostilities outside Azerbaijan at all."

An Azeri government source had said last November that Azerbaijan would provide no troops for such an operation unless there was a complete halt to fighting between Israel and the militant group Hamas.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 21:45:19 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/F7ESATXU3FJRNIMGFZXOV6GJLE.jpg?auth=71e05f9fa7a1c085d58f7506e7b3716d7645c5a482882c129b4365eb930c8276&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>North Korea's Kim inspects memorial for soldiers who died in Russia mission</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/north-koreas-kim-inspects-memorial-soldiers-who-died-russia-mission-2026-01-05/</link><description>SEOUL, Jan 6 (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and his daughter Ju Ae on Monday inspected the construction of a memorial for North Korean troops who died fighting overseas, state media KCNA reported on Tuesday.

Under a mutual defence pact with Russia, in 2024 North Korea sent some 14,000 soldiers to fight alongside Russian troops in Ukraine, where more than 6,000 of them were killed, according to South Korean, Ukrainian and Western sources.

Kim described the dead soldiers as "heroes ... who sacrificed themselves without hesitation", saying "no one in the world can overcome such an army that is absolutely loyal to the orders of the party".

He took part in tree-planting for the memorial with Ju Ae, who wore a red muffler while shoveling earth with her father, KCNA photos showed.

Meanwhile, a photo exhibition detailing North Korea's progress under Kim opened in Pyongyang as the country gears up for a key party congress to be held soon, KCNA said.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 22:48:39 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/R55HLVWOHRMADFD23UMZSO47AQ.jpg?auth=632e47ec82134d70a9a0b046c413616d8aae42d3dff1be78abc5f529dd820fad&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Central African Republic President Touadera wins re-election, results show</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/central-african-republic-president-touadera-wins-re-election-provisional-results-2026-01-05/</link><description>BANGUI, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Central African Republic President Faustin-Archange Touadera has won a third term in office, securing an outright majority in the presidential election held on December 28, provisional results from the electoral commission showed on Monday.

The 68-year-old mathematician who took power a decade ago was seeking a third term after a constitutional referendum in 2023 scrapped the presidential term limit.

He campaigned on his security record in the chronically unstable nation after enlisting help from Russian mercenaries and Rwandan soldiers. He also signed peace deals with several rebel groups this year.

The results announced on Monday showed Touadera received 74.6% of the vote, while former prime minister Anicet-Georges Dologuele received 14% and former prime minister Henri-Marie Dondra received 3.65%.

The main opposition coalition, known by its French acronym BRDC, boycotted the election, saying it would not be fair.

Even before the results were announced, Dologuele and Dondra had cast doubt on their credibility, calling separate press conferences to denounce what they described as election fraud.

Dologuele, the runner-up in the 2020 election, told a press conference on Friday that there had been "a methodical attempt to manipulate" the outcome.

"The Central African people spoke on December 28," Dologuele said. "They expressed a clear desire for change."

The Constitutional Court has until January 20 to adjudicate any challenges and declare definitive results.</description><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 23:22:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KBCNPGHFSZJK7J23RURLZN54JQ.jpg?auth=496f3c420086c9e73d25c2117b568e35a7161a5af398f2b918f1f75bf5530dc3&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Magnitude 6.2 quake strikes western Japan</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/magnitude-62-quake-strikes-western-japan-2026-01-06/</link><description>TOKYO, Jan 6 (Reuters) - An earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 6.2 hit western Japan on Tuesday, the Japan Meteorological Agency said.

US President Donald Trump ’s special envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner will attend the Paris meeting, the latest in a US-led push to end the Russian invasion, which began four years ago next month.

French President Emmanuel Macron is hosting the meeting of the so-called “coalition of the willing” on Tuesday to discuss security guarantees as part of a proposal to end the war between Ukraine and Russia.

The overnight Russian strikes triggered a fire at a private medical clinic in the capital, killing one person and wounding three others, the authorities said.

Emergency services released images of rescuers removing people on stretchers from a gutted building.

“Doctors and nurses were forced to evacuate the wounded under fire,” Ukraine’s Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko said on X.

“It was a terrible night for us,” Margaryta Maliovana, the clinic’s CEO, told AFP.

“One person died. A young man, 30 years old, was killed,” she said, adding that there were 26 patients in the clinic at the moment of the strike.

The pre-dawn attack also killed a man in his 70s in the neighbouring city of Fastiv, the Kyiv regional governor said.

The strikes caused power outages in the area, with backup systems activated to maintain water and heating supplies, the official said, as temperatures dropped to -8C.

Russia launched a total of 165 drones and at least nine missiles overnight, the Ukrainian air force said.

European leaders are in Paris on Tuesday, seeking a breakthrough on a plan to end the fighting that Kyiv says is “90 percent” ready.

“This week, we will be working with our European and American partners to ensure that Ukraine has the assistance it needs,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Monday.

To lay the groundwork, security advisers from 15 countries, including Britain, France and Germany, as well as representatives from NATO and the European Union, gathered in Kyiv over the weekend.

US envoy Witkoff joined the talks virtually, a Ukrainian official told AFP, though the United States ’ large-scale military attack on Venezuela earlier in the day overshadowed proceedings.

Another preparatory meeting between chiefs of staff is scheduled for Monday.

Diplomatic efforts to end Europe’s deadliest conflict since World War II have gained pace in recent weeks, though both Moscow and Kyiv remain at odds over the key issue of territory in a post-war settlement.

Russia, which occupies around 20 percent of Ukraine, is pushing for full control of the country’s eastern Donbas region as part of a deal.

But Kyiv has warned that ceding ground will embolden Moscow and said it will not sign a peace deal that fails to deter Russia from invading again.

On Monday, Russia said it had seized the village of Grabovske in Ukraine’s north-eastern Sumy region, from where Kyiv had last month accused Moscow of forcibly relocating dozens of residents.

Bombarded daily and losing ground, Ukraine has responded with its own drone attacks launched towards Russian territory, targeting in particular energy infrastructure that funds the war effort.

Trump on Sunday dismissed claims by Moscow that Kyiv had launched a drone at one of Russian President Vladimir Putin ’s residences.

“I don’t believe that strike happened,” Trump said in response to a reporter’s question aboard Air Force One. Kyiv has also rejected the accusation.

Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, triggering a conflict that has killed tens, if not hundreds, of thousands, devastated eastern Ukraine and forced millions to flee their homes.

Putin has vowed to press on with his military campaign if his hardline demands are not met at the negotiating table.

Russia in 2025 gained the most ground on the battlefield since the first year of its offensive, according to AFP analysis.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 01:47:08 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/570fe164-dee1-11f0-bee9-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25353746236838.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US scraps universal child vaccine guidance, drawing expert concern</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260106-us-scraps-universal-child-vaccine-guidance</link><description>The United States ended on Monday its longstanding guidance that all children receive vaccines against flu and three other diseases, a sweeping change that advances one of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s long-term goals.

Public health experts warn the latest rollback could lead to preventable hospitalisations and deaths.

The action, which removes the recommendation for rotavirus, influenza, meningococcal disease and hepatitis A, and states that parents should consult healthcare providers under what it calls shared clinical-decision-making, was approved by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Acting Director Jim O’Neill without the agency’s usual outside expert review. It advances Kennedy’s campaign to pare back childhood vaccinations.

Last month, President Donald Trump urged the US to “align with other developed nations” by reducing the number of shots for children.

Trump said the new schedule was "rooted in the Gold Standard of Science" and aligns the United States with other developed nations. In a post on his Truth Social platform, the president congratulated Kennedy and other health officials on the change.

"Many Americans, especially the 'MAHA Moms', have been praying for these COMMON SENSE reforms for many years. Thank you for your attention to this matter!" he wrote, referring to Kennedy's Make America Healthy Again movement.

Kennedy, a prominent vaccine critic, has previously led efforts to drop universal recommendations for COVID-19 and hepatitis B shots for children, citing links to autism that scientists have repeatedly debunked.

Vaccine experts decried the changes they said put American children at risk.

Dr Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, said there should have been public discussion on the risks and benefits of the potential impact of dropping the recommendations.

Dr Sean O'Leary, chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said other developed countries face different disease risks and have different healthcare systems than the United States. Unlike the US, which depends on private healthcare, most countries provide basic universal healthcare that is paid for by the government.

"Any decision about the US childhood vaccination schedule should be grounded in evidence, transparency and established scientific processes, not comparisons that overlook critical differences between countries or health systems," he said.

For the change in policy, two leading officials of the Department of Health and Human Services, Martin Kulldorff and Tracy Beth Hoeg, reviewed vaccine protocols in 20 other developed countries — all of which have universal healthcare — and made the recommendations to change the US schedule, the agency said.

In a report, HHS wrote that the level of risk varies by disease and child.

The vaccine schedules of the 20 reviewed countries show that the flu shot is recommended universally in four countries and a shot against hepatitis A is universal only in Greece. The rotavirus shot is recommended for all children in 17 of the 20 countries and shots against meningococcal disease are recommended in 16.

Each of the four vaccines prevents diseases that once caused unnecessary hospitalizations and death in children, said Dr Jesse Goodman, a Georgetown University professor and former FDA chief scientist.

Flu shots can help prevent pediatric deaths from flu, which killed 288 children in the 2024–25 season, according to the CDC. Hepatitis A, which infects the liver, usually resolves on its own but can lead to hospitalisation and lifelong liver damage.

Rotavirus, which causes severe diarrhoea and dehydration, used to send tens of thousands of children to the hospital each year, but vaccines have made this extremely rare, Goodman said.

While meningitis, a bacterial infection of the brain, is rare in children, some 15% of those infected do not respond to antibiotics and die, he said. "If you can safely prevent it, it makes total sense."

The updated recommendations maintain immunisations for 11 diseases , including measles, mumps, and varicella, while categorizing others as either targeted for high-risk groups or subject to the shared-decision-making category, HHS said.

Insurance providers will continue covering immunisation costs regardless of the category, senior HHS officials told reporters on a call.

The new schedule also recommends US children receive a single dose of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, rather than a two-dose course. Recent studies have concluded that a single dose is not inferior to the longer course and noted the World Health Organization also backs a single-dose schedule.

Merck, which makes Gardasil, the only US-approved HPV vaccine, was not immediately available for comment. The drugmaker has said that since there is not sufficient data for the US FDA to license the shot as a single-dose regimen, the CDC's recommendations should be in line with the agency's approval.

Merck recorded $2.4 billion in US Gardasil sales in 2024.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 01:47:10 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/5ae2ee6a-c674-11f0-820b-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25324542716106.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukraine's allies meet with aim to make security pledges concrete</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/ukraines-allies-meet-with-aim-make-security-pledges-concrete-2026-01-06/</link><description>PARIS, Jan 6 (Reuters) - Ukraine's allies meet in Paris on Tuesday, seeking to finalise as much as possible their contributions to future security guarantees to reassure Kyiv in the event of a ceasefire with Russia, diplomats and officials said.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy will be joined by more than 27 leaders in the French capital, along with senior U.S. negotiators Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, as part of broader efforts to put together a common Ukrainian, European and American position that could then be taken to Russia.

Talks to bring the almost four-year conflict to an end have accelerated since November. However, there have been few signals Russia would be willing to accept current proposals on the table, with the issue of territory remaining a key obstacle to negotiations and fighting between the two sides showing no signs of abating.

Ahead of Tuesday's meeting diplomats said military officials, including the head of Ukraine's general staff, were in Paris to put concrete commitments on paper so that leaders could provide political backing. Until now, military pledges have largely been vague.

According to a note sent to the 35 invited delegations and reviewed by Reuters, the meeting will focus on securing contributions to a multinational force for Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire, in coordination with Ukraine and with U.S. support.

The hosts also aim to agree contributions for a wider set of security guarantees for Ukraine, including binding commitments if it is attacked again. Efforts will be made to ensure that planning by the so-called "Coalition of the Willing" contributing countries will be coordinated with the negotiating positions of Ukraine, the U.S. and Europe.

The note also suggests agreeing next steps to increase support for Ukraine and pressure on Russia should Moscow refuse to engage in meaningful negotiations.

"We have reached agreement on the operational details of the security guarantees," a French presidency official told reporters ahead of the summit. "We will explain how they are structured and the need for a long-term commitment from everyone involved."

A senior European official said the hope was that firming up the coalition's guarantees would also help cement U.S. commitments, which have been broadly outlined in bilateral discussions with Ukraine.

In his evening address to the nation on Sunday, Zelenskiy said the meetings in Europe should become one more contribution to Ukraine's defence and bring closer efforts to end the war.

"Ukraine will prepare for both scenarios: diplomacy, which we are pursuing, or further active defence if pressure from partners on Russia proves insufficient. Ukraine wants peace," he said.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 03:40:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/JVCO6ZGT55OBZGUT5AQQZXLOVQ.jpg?auth=86a54ad5204733386094d81cfebafad47adcb0b8ca890fee56b65c3290ecbf57&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Flash floods in Indonesia's North Sulawesi kill 14, four still missing</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/flash-floods-indonesias-north-sulawesi-kill-14-four-still-missing-2026-01-06/</link><description>JAKARTA, Jan 6 (Reuters) - At least 14 people were killed after being swept away by flash floods in Indonesia's North Sulawesi, an official said on Tuesday, as the search for the missing continued.

Heavy rain early on Monday triggered flash floods on the island of Siau, located in the region of Siau Tagulandang Biaro, said Nuriadin Gumeleng, a spokesperson for the local rescue agency.

Sixteen rescuers have been deployed to search for four people who remain missing on Tuesday, Gumeleng told Reuters, adding that 18 people had been injured so far.

"We continue to collect data from local residents in case there are more missing people," he said.

As of Tuesday, main roads in the affected areas were still covered by rocks, debris and thick mud, Gumeleneg said.

At least 444 people have been evacuated to local schools and churches after the flash floods, the country disaster mitigation agency spokesperson Abdul Muhari said in a statement.

Authorities have deployed excavators to clear roads that have been blocked by the debris and mud, he said.

The floods also destroyed hundreds of houses and government buildings, North Sulawesi governor Yulius Selvanus said.

The flash floods took place in the peak of the wet season in Sulawesi island, as forecast by Indonesia's weather agency.

The islands of Java, Sulawesi, Maluku, and Papua are expected to experience their peak wet seasons over January and February this year, bringing more risks of floods, the weather agency had said.

Rain in other parts of Indonesia like Sumatra and Borneo reached its peak in November and December last year.

Last November, cyclone-induced floods and landslides killed more than 1,000 people in Sumatra , with hundreds still missing. Green groups say deforestation linked to mining and logging exacerbated the impact of the floods .</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 03:40:58 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuela's Machado says she hasn't spoken to Trump since October</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/venezuelas-machado-says-she-hasnt-spoken-trump-since-october-2026-01-06/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Venezuelan opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Corina Machado said on Monday she hasn't spoken to U.S. President Donald Trump since October 2025.

"Actually, I spoke with President Trump on October 10, the same day the (Noble Peace) Prize was announced, (but) not since then," Machado said on Fox News' "Hannity" program.

She was awarded the prize for her fight against what the Norwegian Nobel Committee called a dictatorship.

Machado - widely seen now deposed Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro 's most credible opponent- left Venezuela last month to travel to Norway to accept the award, and hasn't returned since.

"I'm planning to go as soon as possible back home," she told Fox News when asked about her plans to return to Venezuela.

The interview was Machado's first since the U.S. launched strikes on Venezuela on Saturday and captured its president.

She welcomed the U.S. actions as "a huge step for humanity, for freedom and human dignity."

Venezuela's vice president and oil minister Delcy Rodriguez was sworn in as interim president on Monday, but Washington's move over the weekend has left many to wonder about the future leadership of the South American country.

Trump on Saturday dismissed the idea of working with Machado, saying "she doesn't have the support within or the respect within the country."</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 03:41:32 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/L6HYQKEB5NJP3KLEM2FBTN76XI.jpg?auth=359a6a06e3a5ddf01e0b199b8897c9a184911394646153ecd098c69e0d8fa044&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US Republicans insist no 'endless war' looms in Venezuela</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-republicans-insist-no-endless-war-looms-venezuela-2026-01-06/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 5 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump does not plan to occupy or nation-build in Venezuela, Republican U.S. lawmakers said on Monday after attending a briefing by top officials on the administration's policy toward the South American nation.

"We do not have U.S. armed forces in Venezuela, and we are not occupying that country," Republican House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana told reporters after the classified session with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and other senior officials.

"If anybody wants to use the term nation-building, or anything like that, it doesn't look like anything anybody has seen under President Trump," said Representative Brian Mast, the Republican chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.

"They are not the protracted war administration," Mast told reporters after the briefing, which lasted more than 2-1/2 hours, when asked how he would reassure Americans they did not face another 'endless war,' like the 20-year conflict in Afghanistan.

Trump sent U.S. troops into Caracas early on Saturday to seize Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, who pleaded not guilty earlier on Monday to narcotics charges.

Maduro's capture rattled world leaders, left officials in Caracas scrambling to regroup and angered some U.S. Democrats, who said Rubio and other Trump administration officials had lied to them by insisting they were not planning regime change in Venezuela.

Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Senate's Democratic leader, told reporters Monday's briefing had been extensive but posed more questions than it answered.

"Their plan for the U.S. running Venezuela is vague, based on wishful thinking and unsatisfying," he said.

Schumer said he had not received assurances that Trump would not do the same thing in other countries. Republicans also left open that possibility. "There's absolutely a continual plan to use the United States military to protect the homeland of the United States of America," Mast said.

The Senate is due to vote as soon as this week on whether to block further military action against Venezuela without congressional approval, a resolution co-sponsored by Schumer.

Republicans insist the weekend operation did not require congressional approval because it was very short and involved "law enforcement" to bring Maduro to court in New York.

Members of Congress, including some Republicans as well as Democrats, have long accused presidents of seeking to sidestep the Constitution's requirement that Congress, not the president, approve anything other than brief and limited military action needed to defend the United States.

Republicans have defeated repeated attempts to pass similar war powers resolutions since Trump four months ago sent U.S. forces to the Caribbean, where they have been firing missiles at vessels Washington says are carrying drugs.

Trump's administration accuses Maduro of overseeing a cocaine-trafficking network that partnered with violent groups including Mexico’s Sinaloa and Zetas cartels, Colombia's FARC rebels and Venezuela's Tren de Aragua gang.

Maduro has long denied the allegations, saying they were a mask for imperialist designs on Venezuela's rich oil reserves.

Trump has made no secret of wanting to share in Venezuela's oil riches. U.S. oil companies' shares jumped on Monday, fueled by the prospect of access to those vast reserves.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 03:41:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/22GYYXH2BNMQ7JZX2LPE2WIEIQ.jpg?auth=05bff9a359c8761c8c14b3922b930ae45cc5254b8ffc7e4cd5fdd94894b0a507&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Maduro pleads not guilty as Trump seizes control of Venezuela</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260106-maduro-pleads-not-guilty-as-trump-seizes-control-of-venezuela</link><description>Toppled Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro pleaded not guilty on Monday to narcotics charges after President Donald Trump ’s stunning capture of him rattled world leaders and left officials in Caracas scrambling to regroup.

"I am innocent. I am not guilty. I am a decent man. I am still president of my country," Maduro, 63, said through an interpreter, before being cut off by US District Judge Alvin Hellerstein in Manhattan federal court.

Maduro's wife Cilia Flores also pleaded not guilty. The next court date was set for March 17.

Dozens of protesters, both pro- and anti-Maduro, gathered outside the courthouse before the half-hour hearing.

Hours later in Caracas, Maduro's vice president, Delcy Rodriguez, was sworn in as Venezuela's interim president with words of support for Maduro but no indication she would fight the US move.

A recent US intelligence assessment determined Rodriguez would be best positioned to lead a temporary government in Maduro's absence, finding that opposition figures such as Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Corina Machado or onetime presidential candidate Edmundo Gonzalez would struggle to gain legitimacy, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the classified report.

While many anti-Maduro activists had assumed this would be their moment, Trump appeared to have sidelined the Venezuelan opposition for now. Instead, he has suggested Rodriguez was willing to work with Washington.

In Caracas, senior officials from Maduro's 13-year-old government remain in charge of the South American oil producer of 30 million people, alternating between spitting defiance and possible cooperation with the Trump administration.

The intelligence assessment concluded that Rodriguez was among the few Venezuelan leaders capable of maintaining order, along with the interior and defense ministers, in a government dominated by ideological opponents of the US, the Wall Street Journal said.

Rodriguez's brother, Jorge Rodriguez, was reappointed president of the overwhelmingly pro-Maduro National Assembly on Monday. He pledged "to use all procedures, forums and spaces" to bring Maduro back.

Trump told NBC News the US was not at war with Venezuela. Rather, "we're at war with the people that sell drugs," he said.

The US would need to help address the South American country's problems before any new elections, Trump said, calling a 30-day timeline for a vote unrealistic.

"We have to fix the country first. You can’t have an election. There’s no way the people could even vote," Trump told NBC.

Maduro is accused of overseeing a cocaine-trafficking network that partnered with violent groups including Mexico ’s Sinaloa and Zetas cartels, Colombian FARC rebels and Venezuela's Tren de Aragua gang.

He faces four criminal counts: narco-terrorism, cocaine importation conspiracy and possession of machine guns and destructive devices.

Maduro has long denied the allegations, saying they were a mask for imperialist designs on Venezuela's rich oil reserves. Trump has made no secret of wanting to share in Venezuela's oil riches. US oil companies' shares jumped on Monday, fueled by the prospect of access to those vast reserves.

While world leaders and US politicians grappled with the extraordinary seizure of a head of state, the United Nations Security Council debated the implications of the raid, which was condemned by Russia, China and leftist allies of Venezuela.

UN chief Antonio Guterres raised concerns about instability in Venezuela and the legality of Trump's strike, the most dramatic US intervention in Latin America since the 1989 Panama invasion. US Special Forces swooped into Caracas by helicopter on Saturday, shattered Maduro's security cordon and dragged him from the threshold of a safe room.

On Monday morning, Maduro – his hands zip-tied – and his wife were escorted by armed guards in tactical gear from a Brooklyn detention center to a helicopter bound for the Manhattan federal court. Shackled at the ankles and wearing orange and beige prison garb, Maduro listened to an interpreter through headphones as Judge Hellerstein summarised the charges.

Hellerstein asked Maduro to stand and confirm his identity. He replied in Spanish.

The judge told the couple of their right to inform the Venezuelan consulate of their arrests.

Prosecutors say Maduro has been involved in drug trafficking from the time he began serving in Venezuela's National Assembly in 2000 to his tenure as foreign minister and subsequent 2013 election as the late President Hugo Chavez 's successor.

Maduro lawyer Barry Pollack said he anticipated voluminous and complex litigation over what he called his client's "military abduction." He said Maduro was not requesting his release but may later.

Flores' lawyer, Mark Donnelly, said she sustained significant injuries including severe bruising on her ribs and asked that she be provided X-rays and a physical evaluation.

Federal prosecutors in New York first indicted Maduro in 2020 as part of a long-running narcotics trafficking case against current and former Venezuelan officials and Colombian guerrillas. An updated indictment made public on Saturday added some new details and co-defendants, including Flores.

The US has considered Maduro an illegitimate dictator since he declared victory in a 2018 election marred by allegations of massive irregularities.

Experts in international law have questioned the legality of the raid, with some condemning Trump's actions as a repudiation of a rules-based international order.

American oil companies will return to Venezuela and rebuild the sector's infrastructure, Trump told reporters on Air Force One on Sunday.

"We're taking back what they stole," Trump said. "We're in charge."

Trump said then that the administration had tipped off US oil companies about the operation, but in the NBC interview he said: "The oil companies were absolutely aware that we were thinking about doing something. But we didn’t tell them we were going to do it."

He added that the US may subsidize the rebuilding of the country's oil infrastructure by US majors, a project he said could be completed in less than 18 months.

CBS News, citing two unnamed sources, said representatives of oil majors Exxon Mobil, ConocoPhillips and Chevron Corp would meet with Energy Secretary Chris Wright on Thursday.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 03:42:03 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/d5d37160-ea98-11f0-90e9-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26005726470968-1.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Irish PM aims for deeper trade talks with China in Beijing</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/irish-pm-aims-deeper-trade-talks-with-china-beijing-2026-01-06/</link><description>BEIJING, Jan 6 (Reuters) - Ireland's Prime Minister Micheal Martin is set to have more in-depth talks on trade with China's No. 2 official on Tuesday, working to strengthen strategic ties with the world's second-largest economy amid frosty China-European Union relations.

Martin's scheduled meeting with Chinese Premier Li Qiang forms part of his five-day trip that he said would include "a significant economic dimension", a clip posted on the Irish Taoiseach's X handle on Monday evening showed.

The Irish leader was seen in the clip telling media that he would discuss with Li in "greater detail" trade issues such as beef exports and China's recently imposed tariffs on dairy, a day after a summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping.

"I discussed obviously the situation in terms of Irish beef exports into China, the tariff situation in respect of dairy products," Martin said, adding that Xi "undertook to engage with Chinese officials in respect of those specific issues."

Martin described his meeting with Xi on Monday as a "warm and constructive engagement", covering a range of issues including bilateral and EU-China ties.

"On a broader level, I think the President was keen that Europe and China would have a broader framework to govern trade into the future," he said.

Xi had told Martin during the meeting that China and the EU should "bear the long-term picture in mind", according to state news agency Xinhua.

Ties between China and the EU have been tense since the EU imposed levies on Chinese electric vehicle imports in 2024. China has since retaliated with a series of measures including the latest tariffs on EU dairy products .

Last week, China also set import quotas and additional tariffs on beef imports from this year, a move affecting global exporters of the meat into the Asian country.

The first Taoiseach to visit China since 2012, Martin has recently downplayed the Irish intelligence agency's portrayal of China as a "hostile state actor", preferring instead to adopt a long-term and strategic understanding of China.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 04:40:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/Z7BUYXXK6VIQXMW2WCX3AWWKTQ.jpg?auth=f1288f8087e343eee996cb63f8012469d73af86e984ca154d073a662addb228f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Over a dozen media workers detained in Venezuela, says national press association</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/over-dozen-media-workers-detained-venezuela-says-national-press-association-2026-01-06/</link><description>Jan 5 (Reuters) - More than a dozen media workers were detained on Monday while covering events in the Venezuelan capital Caracas, including a march in support of ousted President Nicolas Maduro and the swearing-in of the country's new legislature, the South American nation's press association said.

All 14 of those detained were later released, the press association (SNTP) said on X, though one was a foreign journalist who was deported.

SNTP said that those detained included 11 people working with international media outlets and one with a national outlet.

Reuters was unable to independently confirm all of the detentions.

Venezuela's information ministry, which handles all contact with the government, did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the detentions. Venezuela's Ministry of Communications also did not respond to requests for comment.

The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and CNN did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Reuters also did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The press detentions come after the U.S. military detained Maduro in an overnight operation this weekend. On Monday the deposed leader pleaded not guilty to narcoterrorism charges in a New York court.

His vice president, Delcy Rodriguez, has since taken the reins as interim leader.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:25:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/EVZGV7BHVBLYRLK3G4QX4I5TDY.jpg?auth=7b052cfb286afc2bb66dc7cc44db4b05182bc966d0c3ef0cb8ba6268d5c52052&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Dutch train traffic halted due to snow and ice</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/dutch-train-traffic-halted-due-snow-ice-2026-01-06/</link><description>AMSTERDAM, Jan 6 (Reuters) - Snow and ice continued to disrupt traffic in the Netherlands on Tuesday halting all trains and forcing the cancellation of hundreds of flights.

The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology, also known as Phivolcs, raised the alert to level three on a five-level scale, which means magma is pushing up inside the volcano and forming a lava dome at the summit.

Phivolcs urged residents within the 6-km no-go zone to evacuate because of risks like lava flows, falling rocks, and other hazards.

Mayon is the most active of 22 volcanoes in the Philippines, having erupted more than 50 times in the last four centuries. Its last magmatic eruption was in June 2023 when it spewed lava and noxious gases.

The most destructive eruption came in February 1841 when lava flows buried an entire town and killed 1,200 people.

The Philippines lies on the "Ring of Fire", a belt of volcanoes circling the Pacific Ocean that is also prone to earthquakes.

Phivolcs urged civil aviation authorities to advise pilots to avoid flying near Mayon's summit because ash from a sudden eruption can be hazardous to aircraft.

Since January 1, 2026, PHIVOLCS has recorded 346 rockfalls and 4 volcanic earthquakes, compared to 599 rockfalls in November–December 2025.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 07:29:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China, South Korea to carry out cultural exchanges in orderly manner, Beijing says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-south-korea-carry-out-cultural-exchanges-orderly-manner-beijing-says-2026-01-06/</link><description>BEIJING, Jan 6 (Reuters) - China and South Korea agreed to carry out cultural exchanges in an orderly manner, the Chinese foreign ministry said on Tuesday, when asked if Beijing would welcome South Korean culture exports in the future.

Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, made their first appearance in Hellerstein's Manhattan courtroom on Monday, pleading not guilty to narco-terrorism and other charges.

Maduro was indicted in 2020 in a sprawling drug trafficking case that has been before Hellerstein for nearly 15 years and has already seen the conviction of Venezuela 's former intelligence chief, Hugo Armando Carvajal.

A graduate of Columbia University law school, Hellerstein served as a lawyer in the US Army from 1957 to 1960 before entering private practice.

He was nominated by former president Bill Clinton in 1998 to be a district court judge for the Southern District of New York .

During his lengthy career, Hellerstein has presided over several civil cases stemming from the September 11, 2001 al Qaeda attacks on New York and Washington.

He has also tangled at times with US President Donald Trump , rejecting a request by the president to have his New York hush money case moved to federal court.

Hellerstein also blocked the Trump administration last year from deporting alleged Venezuelan gang members without a court hearing.

In September, he sentenced tech start-up highflier Charlie Javice to more than seven years in prison after she was convicted of defrauding JPMorgan Chase on a $175 million deal.

A decades-old border dispute between the Southeast Asian nations erupted into military clashes several times last year, with fighting in December killing dozens of people and displacing around one million on both sides.

The two countries agreed a fragile truce on December 27 , ending three weeks of clashes.

"Cambodia has violated the ceasefire" on Tuesday morning, the Thai army said in a statement, accusing Cambodian forces of firing mortar rounds into Thailand's Ubon Ratchathani province.

One soldier was wounded by shrapnel, it added.

The Thai army said in a later statement that the Cambodian side had contacted a Thai military unit and claimed "there was no intention to fire into Thai territory", adding "the incident was caused by an operational error by Cambodian personnel".

The Thai military said it warned Cambodian forces to exercise caution, stressing if a similar incident occurred, Thailand may need to retaliate.

Cambodia's defence ministry spokeswoman Maly Socheata said two Cambodian soldiers were injured, one severely, on Tuesday morning in Cambodia's Preah Vihear province, which sits opposite Thailand's Ubon Ratchathani.

While Cambodian forces were performing "organisation and orderliness" duties, "an explosion occurred from a pile of garbage", she said, resulting in the two injured soldiers being hospitalised.

Socheata did not mention the strike alleged by Thailand, but said both nations' border coordination teams had consulted on the incident involving the Cambodian soldiers and addressed the matter.

The explosion occurred in a frontier region known as the Emerald Triangle, Socheata added where the borders of both countries and Laos meet.

In May, a Cambodian soldier was killed in a firefight with Thai troops in the area, reigniting the border conflict.

Thailand's Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said his government had lodged a protest with Phnom Penh, stating "the truce was violated".

"At the military-to-military level, we have been told the incident was an accident, but we are seeking clarification on how responsibility will be taken," Anutin told reporters in Bangkok.

Charnvirakul added that Thailand had the "capability to respond" to Cambodia, which is vastly outgunned by its neighbour.

The nations' long-standing conflict stems from a dispute over the colonial-era demarcation of their 800-kilometre (500-mile) border, where both sides claim territory and centuries-old temple ruins.

Under the December truce, Cambodia and Thailand pledged to cease fire, freeze troop movements and cooperate on demining efforts along their border.

On December 31, Bangkok released 18 Cambodian soldiers held since July when border clashes that month killed dozens of people.

Thailand's foreign ministry said their release was "a demonstration of goodwill and confidence-building".

Phnom Penh said last week it remained "hopeful" that their return would "significantly contribute to building mutual trust".

The United States, China and Malaysia had brokered a truce to end the fighting between Cambodia and Thailand in July, but that ceasefire was short-lived.

On Saturday, one week after the December truce went into effect, Cambodia called on Thailand to pull out its forces from several border areas Phnom Penh claims as its own.

The Thai military has rejected claims it had used force to seize Cambodia territory, insisting its forces were present in areas that had always belonged to Thailand.

While the two nations agreed late last month to stop fighting, they still need to resolve the demarcation of their disputed border.

Cambodia's defence ministry said in a statement Tuesday that Phnom Penh had proposed a bilateral border committee meeting with Thai counterparts to be held in Cambodia's Siem Reap province this month.

Bangkok has said previously that meetings to discuss border surveying and demarcation may need to be held by Thailand's next government, following elections scheduled for February 8.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 09:27:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/c8a78fcc-ead3-11f0-a772-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25361164510579.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Maduro opponent Machado vows to return to Venezuela, wants election</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/maduro-opponent-machado-vows-return-venezuela-wants-election-2026-01-06/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 6 (Reuters) - Venezuela's main opposition leader Maria Corina Machado has vowed to return home quickly, praising U.S. President Donald Trump for toppling her enemy Nicolas Maduro and declaring her movement ready to win a free election.

"I'm planning to go back to Venezuela as soon as possible," said Machado, 58, a lawyer and mother-of-three who escaped from Venezuela in disguise in October to receive the Nobel Peace Prize, which she dedicated to Trump.

"We believe that this transition should move forward," she told Fox News in an interview late on Monday. "We won an election (in 2024) by a landslide under fraudulent conditions. In free and fair elections, we will win over 90% of the votes."

Machado said she had not spoken to Trump since October 10, when the Nobel award was announced. He has said the United States needs to help address Venezuela's problems before any new elections, calling a 30-day timeline for a vote unrealistic.

"We have to fix the country first. You can’t have an election. There’s no way the people could even vote," Trump told NBC.

In the interview, her first since Maduro was captured by the U.S. at the weekend, Machado did not give her location or any more details on plans to repatriate to Venezuela, where she is wanted for arrest and Socialist Party loyalists remain in power .

To the disappointment of opposition activists and the large diaspora - one in five Venezuelans have left during an economic implosion under Maduro and his predecessor Hugo Chavez - Trump has given little indication of backing Machado.

The opposition, some international observers and many U.S. allies say the opposition was cheated of victory in the 2024 election, from which Machado was banned and an ally stood instead, but Trump has said she lacks support in Venezuela.

The U.S. administration appears so far to be hoping to work with interim President Delcy Rodriguez , a diehard Maduro ally who has denounced his "kidnapping" while also calling for cooperation and respectful relations with Washington.

"Delcy Rodriguez, as you know, is one of the main architects of torture, persecution, corruption, narco-trafficking," Machado said. "She's a main ally and liaison of Russia, China, Iran, certainly not an individual who could be trusted by international investors and she's really rejected by the Venezuelan people."

Machado, who has galvanised an often fractured and demoralised opposition in the last few years, was fulsome in her praise of Trump, saying she would give him the Nobel prize personally.

"He has proven to the world what he means. January 3rd will go down in history as the day justice defeated a tyranny," she said of Saturday's raid on Venezuela.

"I do want to say today on behalf of the Venezuelan people how grateful we are for his courageous vision, the historical actions he has taken against this narco-terrorist regime ... It's a huge step towards a democratic transition."

With the largest oil reserves in the world and the U.S. as its main ally, Venezuela would become the energy hub of the Americas, restore rule of law, open markets, bring exiles home and provide security to foreign investment, Machado promised.

For now, however, Trump has been told by the CIA that Rodriguez and other senior officials from Maduro's government are the best bet to maintain stability, sources said.

They have ordered the arrest of anyone who collaborated with the seizure of Maduro and, in a sign of the nervous atmosphere in Venezuela, 14 media workers were briefly detained covering events in Caracas on Monday.

Footage verified by Reuters showed shots being fired into the night sky in Caracas, which a Venezuelan official said came from police to deter unauthorised drones.

"There was no confrontation, the entire country remains completely calm," vice minister of communications Simon Arrechider told reporters in a message.

Maduro, 63, pleaded not guilty on Monday to narcotics charges, He said he was a "decent man" and still president of Venezuela while standing in a Manhattan court shackled at the ankles and wearing orange and beige prison garb .

His wife Cilia Flores, who was also captured, pleaded innocent. They are next due in court on March 17.

Maduro is accused of overseeing a cocaine-trafficking network with international drug cartels and faces four criminal counts: narco-terrorism, cocaine importation conspiracy and possession of machine guns and destructive devices.

He has long denied the allegations, saying they were a mask for imperialist designs on Venezuela's oil reserves.

Venezuela has the world's largest reserves - about 303 billion barrels, mostly heavy oil in the Orinoco region. But the sector has long been in decline from mismanagement, under-investment and U.S. sanctions, averaging 1.1 million bpd output last year, a third of its output in the 1970s.

Maduro's vice president, Rodriguez, has been sworn in as interim leader as officials in Caracas waver between angry defiance and potential cooperation with Trump, who has threatened another military strike if they displease him.

Trump's actions, the biggest U.S. intervention in Latin America since the 1989 invasion of Panama, have brought condemnation from Russia, China and Venezuela's leftist allies. Legal experts have questioned its validity and many allies have urged adherence to international laws and dialogue.

Trump has said the U.S. is now in charge of Venezuela and will help revive its oil industry with the help of private companies.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 10:24:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/D37QWXG4AVKCJJVMLKZAJI5IDI.jpg?auth=fbfe4c142e7c5512354ce7973ea8bd701be6847d8aef4119c4a587120533ccd9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>No safety inspections at site of Swiss bar fire since 2019, mayor says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/no-safety-inspections-done-site-swiss-bar-fire-between-2020-25-says-mayor-2026-01-06/</link><description>GENEVA, Jan 6 - No safety inspections were carried out since 2019 at the Swiss bar that burst into flames at New Year, killing 40 people, the mayor of the town of Crans-Montana said on Tuesday.

"We are profoundly sorry. We did not have an indication that the checks had not been done," Crans-Montana Mayor Nicolas Feraud told reporters on the absence of fire checks between 2020-2025.

The mayor added that the sound-proof foam used in the bar "Le Constellation" was considered acceptable at the time.

Prosecutors have said that the fire that spread rapidly in the early hours of January 1 was likely caused by sparkling candles igniting the ceiling of the bar's basement.

All sparkler candles have now been banned inside venues, said the mayor at the press conference.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 10:25:08 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4BLMEVFPKZPFRP2CZOHBSQMPDM.jpg?auth=f108ef0dfbdddbbf38a0e47b05b575b4c127cb291344d92cc20bf4f7edf7f075&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Pope Leo, closing Catholic Holy Year, urges kindness to foreigners</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/pope-leo-closing-catholic-holy-year-urges-kindness-foreigners-2026-01-06/</link><description>VATICAN CITY, Jan 6 (Reuters) - Pope Leo closed the Catholic Church's Holy Year on Tuesday by sealing shut the special "Holy Door" in St. Peter's Basilica and urging Christians worldwide to help those in need and treat foreigners with kindness.

Leo, who has made care for immigrants a central theme of his early papacy, said at a Vatican ceremony that the record 33.5 million pilgrims who visited Rome during the Holy Year should have learned not to treat humans as mere "products".

"Around us, a distorted economy tries to profit from everything," said the pope. "After this year, will we be better able to recognise a pilgrim in the visitor, a seeker in the stranger, a neighbour in the foreigner?"

Holy years, or jubilees, typically occur every 25 years and are considered a time of peace, forgiveness and pardon. Pilgrims to Rome can enter special "Holy Doors" at four Rome basilicas, and can attend papal audiences throughout the year.

At 9:41 a.m. (0841 GMT) on Tuesday, Leo, dressed in gold-trimmed robes, pulled shut the special bronze door at St. Peter's, officially ending the year.

The next jubilee is not expected before 2033, when the Church may have a special one to mark 2,000 years since the death of Jesus.

Vatican and Italian officials said on Monday that pilgrims to Rome for the 2025 jubilee came from 185 countries , with Italy, the United States, Spain, Brazil and Poland leading the pack.

The 2025 jubilee was marked by an historical rarity not seen for 300 years. It was opened by one pope, Francis, and closed by his successor, Leo.

Francis died in April after 12 years leading the 1.4-billion-member Church. The last jubilee held under two popes was in the year 1700, when Clement XI closed a holy year opened by Innocent XII.

Leo, who has pledged to keep Francis' signature policies such as welcoming gay Catholics and discussing women's ordination , echoed the late pope's frequent criticisms of the global economic system on Tuesday.

Leo, the first U.S. pope, lamented that the markets "turn human yearnings of seeking, travelling and beginning again into a mere business."</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 10:25:19 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/32HIYYETORKJPFG6FNQERXZ4AE.jpg?auth=2c1ac84944aea09dffc675bcd06985e920d8e4d75eff59580e73cd16f4a6082d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Former Uvalde school officer accused of failing to act against shooter who killed 19 students, two teachers</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/former-uvalde-school-officer-accused-failing-act-against-shooter-who-killed-19-2026-01-06/</link><description>Jan 6 (Reuters) - One of the first police officers on the scene of the 2022 attack at a Texas elementary school that killed 19 students and two teachers is now the first to stand trial, accused of failing to act as the gunman continued one of the deadliest mass killings targeting students in U.S. history.

Opening arguments were to begin Tuesday in the trial of Adrian Gonzales, 52, who was a member of the school district police force. Hundreds of officers from local, state and federal agencies waited 77 minutes before entering a classroom where the gunman was holed up. Teachers and children made lengthy calls to 911 emergency services, saying they were in the room with the gunman and surrounded by bodies.

Gonzales was charged in 2024 with 29 counts of child endangerment, according to his indictment, which said that he "failed to engage, distract, and delay the shooter" and that he also failed "to follow his active shooter training to respond to gun fire by advancing toward the gun fire."

Each count carries the possibility of two years in prison. Gonzales has pleaded not guilty. Gonzales' attorney, Nico LaHood, has said that his client showed up to help children, and that he did in fact help many evacuate.

Pedro "Pete" Arredondo, the former chief of the Uvalde schools police and the person who investigators say was the officer in charge of the scene, faces 10 counts of the same charge. His trial has not yet been scheduled.

State and federal investigations into the shooting found that officers left the 18-year-old gunman alone inside the classroom with children while weighing how to confront him.

By the time a tactical team led by Border Patrol officers stormed in, the toll had reached among the worst in the history of a country known for high-profile school shootings.

Debates between proponents of gun control measures and defenders of the constitutional right to bear arms have resulted in few restrictions on firearms in the United States compared to other industrialized nations.

Former U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland, in remarks made while presenting the federal report on Uvalde in 2024 , said that "lives would have been saved" had the police immediately confronted the gunman.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 10:25:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/6EH5QJBDIBLIBERK2RQKM5H5OA.jpg?auth=f9be34713ee46540414f5a76bdfccbdef6142de2f051ea2bd3d53fab9dc94eca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Tourists on remote Yemeni island stranded after Saudi, UAE rift</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/tourists-remote-yemeni-island-stranded-after-saudi-uae-rift-2026-01-06/</link><description>DUBAI, Jan 6 - When the United Arab Emirates withdrew its troops from Yemen last week under a deadline from Saudi Arabia, it also left behind the remote Yemeni island of Socotra and the roughly 600 tourists who had flown in but could no longer fly out.

Air traffic at the island's main airport came to a halt as a deepening crisis between the UAE and Saudi Arabia translated into fresh conflict on Yemen's mainland, where the two Gulf powers now back opposing groups in the country's civil war .

“Nobody has any information and everyone just wants to go back to their normal lives," said Aurelija Krikstaponiene, a Lithuanian who travelled to Socotra over New Year's Eve.

She was meant to fly back to Abu Dhabi on Sunday, but now may find herself having to travel through Jeddah in Saudi Arabia instead, as Emirati control over the island wanes.

Socotra, which lies more than 300 km (186 miles) south of Yemen's coast, and until recently was mainly accessible by air via the UAE, has been a haven of tranquillity through the years of conflict on the mainland.

For tourists, it offers magical beaches and unique flora, such as its renowned Socotra dragon blood tree. It sits in the Gulf of Aden, alongside a shipping route leading to the Red Sea.

But Socotra came under effective UAE control in 2018 when Emirati military transport planes first landed on the island.

The tanks and troops that unloaded were part of the UAE's push to extend its sway over the region's waters, including the Bab al-Mandab Strait between the Horn of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.

A major oil producer and business hub, the UAE has in the past decade pursued an assertive foreign policy, carving its own sphere of influence in the Middle East and beyond, often using its financial clout to serve its interests.

"Socotra functions like an unsinkable aircraft carrier sitting at the heart of the Bab al-Mandab system, in the middle of the trade corridor that links Europe, Asia and Africa," said Andreas Krieg, associate professor at King's College London.

"Even without firing a shot, an actor with reliable access to the island gains important leverage: to observe, to potentially intercept and project influence."

Less than eight years on, that plan is being derailed by the severest public rift the UAE has had with its fellow Gulf ally and oil-power Saudi Arabia.

The two Gulf countries have navigated many differences in the past, from geopolitcs to oil output, but this latest fallout has brought their disagreements out in the open.

Saudi Arabia has been carrying out airstrikes to aid Yemeni government troops against UAE-backed southern separatists, the same ones who run Socotra.

UAE troops were not initially welcome when they first landed in 2018, with the Saudi-backed Yemeni government accusing Abu Dhabi of seizing the island's ports and airports.

But the UAE exerted control through the separatist Southern Transitional Council (STC) which now finds itself in direct confrontation with the Saudi-backed government forces on mainland Yemen. The STC seeks autonomy for southern Yemen, and ultimately independence, from the more heavily populated north.

The STC is still in control of the island today but the airport is no longer under Emirati control, two airport sources told Reuters. The facility remains shut.

Yemeni airlines said late on Monday it would operate a flight to Jeddah on January 7, a sure sign that control of the airport has shifted.

"On an island where air access often becomes the decisive gateway, influence over connectivity translates into influence over everything else, including security presence, local governance, and commercial life," Krieg said.

The UAE did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether all of its troops had left the island. One source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters the troops left last month.

Saudi Arabia's government media office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on control of the airport.

“We have a limited amount of cash, and most people will run out in two or three days," Maciej, a Polish tourist who is part of a group of 100 others, told Reuters.

"There are no payment terminals or ATMs here and bank transfers are also inoperable. Everything relies on cash. When it runs out, we'll be sleeping rough and relying on food aid from local residents," he said, adding that he was not warned about the probability of conflict when he booked his trip.

With the Emirati presence since 2018 came money poured into infrastructure projects through the Sheikh Khalifa Foundation humanitarian organisation, bringing electricity, safe water and cooking gas to Socotra.

The UAE also renovated the main airport, adding new buildings, two hangars and a modern navigation system for the control towers.

The once sleepy island turned into a niche tourist destination where travellers looking for terrain off the beaten track could book packages solely through Abu Dhabi to experience the island's beaches and wildlife.

Many did not factor in the risk of proximity to turmoil in Yemen, one of the world's worst humanitarian disasters.

Socotra, which is closer to Somalia than it is to Yemen, had so far been isolated from the civil war that has ravaged the mainland for over 10 years.

But this latest flare-up may not spare its peace.

Still, Romanian Bianca Cus is trying to enjoy the remainder of her time on the island until a flight comes in.

"I am enjoying each day on the island, just as I did before we found out that we would be staying longer," she said.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 10:25:42 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/MYG4LZHAPFOVPIOGMGPSKCKEDE.jpg?auth=5589291ba4e33fcabe2fa0b9b58e1bbbdcabfbef2202e6c6ed1b2a003c68e074&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Malaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, in hospital after hip fracture</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/malaysia-ex-pm-mahathir-100-hospital-after-hip-fracture-2026-01-06/</link><description>KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 6 (Reuters) - Malaysian 100-year-old former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad has been admitted to hospital after suffering a hip fracture following a fall at his residence early on Tuesday, his office said.

He was last admitted to hospital for fatigue following a picnic celebration for his 100th birthday last July.

The ministry said the two Palestinian mobile operators - Jawwal and Ooredoo - and Swedish infrastructure firm Ericsson (ERICb.ST) , opens new tab signed management agreements that were approved by Israel on Sunday.

Palestinian cellular providers launched high-speed data services in the occupied West Bank based on 3G in 2018, narrowing a technological gap with Israel after a lengthy Israeli ban on the operation of local 3G networks.

The ministry said its approval came as part of a 2022 framework deal between Israel and the Palestinian Authority aimed at allowing 4G and 5G cellular technologies. The agreement was delayed by the Gaza war, according to Israeli media, which also said the process to upgrade to 4G would take up to six months.

The Palestinian providers compete with Israeli cellular firms, which operate faster on much faster 5G mobile frequencies.

Israel is in the process of shutting down older 2G and 3G technologies and has advised the public to equip themselves with devices that support 4G and 5G.

In Gaza, however, only 2G networks are available.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 11:20:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ET6UMJHEF5P3NDG3CA2H2MDWFA.jpg?auth=963a2b1978a08f67331c28f5e9f4c2dc0fc8d80e24cc2ea060ab0b905592b6f7&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US House Democrats holding January 6 riot forum on Trump election 'threats'</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-house-democrats-holding-january-6-riot-forum-trump-election-threats-2026-01-06/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 6 (Reuters) - Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives will mark the fifth anniversary of a deadly attack on the U.S. Capitol by supporters of President Donald Trump with an unofficial hearing that will probe "ongoing threats" to elections and public safety.

Democrats, as the minority party in Congress, do not have the power to set the legislative agenda, but they can hold informal events to highlight their proposals and criticize Republicans.

"We will examine ongoing threats to free and fair elections," House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said in a statement announcing the forum. He said it also will look into Trump's pardons of more than 1,500 people who were criminally charged with participating in the January 6 violence.

The Trump administration has sought states' voter registration lists, leading to fears the information could be misused. Trump has urged states to abandon mail-in ballots and has hinted at running for a third presidential term in 2028, which would violate the U.S. Constitution.

The January 6, 2021 riot, a failed attempt by thousands of Trump supporters to overturn Trump's 2020 defeat by Democrat Joe Biden, sent lawmakers running for their lives and injured about 140 law enforcement officers.

Four people died during the chaos, including a Trump supporter who was shot dead by police. One police officer, who was attacked by protesters, died the following day. Four other police officers subsequently died by suicide.

Trump insisted the election was stolen from him through fraud, even though he lost a series of court cases challenging the election result.

Some Republicans blamed far-left activists for the attack, and party lawmakers set up a new committee last year to "uncover the full truth" from that day.

“True accountability requires focusing on facts, not selective storytelling for partisan gain," the chairman of the subcommittee, Barry Loudermilk, said in reference to the Democrats' hearing.

Also on Tuesday, Enrique Tarrio, a former leader of the Proud Boys far-right militant group who was found guilty of helping to plan the riot, has announced a "patriotic and peaceful march" to honor the memory of protesters who died that day. He received a 22-year sentence for seditious conspiracy but was subsequently pardoned by Trump.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 11:20:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/335557FVUJJSHEUOWYHLOB22UU.jpg?auth=ae61eee01192e8535c65c1ac07aaf1ef9452edc01cf880948bd38335736c11a0&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Mexico condemns attack on Venezuela while seeking to avoid its fate</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/mexico-condemns-attack-venezuela-while-seeking-avoid-its-fate-2026-01-06/</link><description>MEXICO CITY, Jan 6 (Reuters) - In the wake of the U.S. attack on Venezuela , the Mexican government has found itself traversing the most delicate balancing act since President Donald Trump began his second term: strongly condemning the operation while doubling down on bilateral cooperation lest Mexico find itself in Trump’s crosshairs next.

On Saturday, hours after the elite U.S. special forces captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife in their home, Trump floated the prospect of U.S. military action inside Mexico, saying drug cartels are “running” the country and that “something is gonna have to be done with Mexico.”

The weekend’s events clearly rattled Mexico’s President Claudia Sheinbaum . She started her daily morning press conference on Monday reading from a document that detailed Mexico’s position on Venezuela.

“We categorically reject intervention in the internal affairs of other countries,” she said. “The history of Latin America is clear and compelling: intervention has never brought democracy, never generated well-being, nor lasting stability.”

Sheinbaum’s comments rank among her sharpest criticisms of Washington since Trump took office and are among the strongest rebukes in the region of Maduro’s ouster.

Security analysts said Sheinbaum’s fierce condemnation of the attack signaled that she would not tolerate similar actions against drug traffickers in Mexico. The U.S. Justice Department has charged Maduro with crimes related to drug trafficking, terrorism and weapons; he pleaded not guilty in a New York courthouse on Monday and declared himself "a prisoner of war."

But behind the scenes, Mexico City is likely to move even closer to Washington in the wake of the Venezuela attack, hoping that increasingly tight bilateral security cooperation will stave off U.S. aggressions, Mexican officials and security analysts said.

"Increasing joint security cooperation and strengthening Mexico's own fight against the cartels will be key to avoiding unilateral U.S. military intervention," said a Mexican security official who spoke on condition of anonymity.

Security analysts say the attack on Venezuela significantly elevated the stakes for Mexico City by signaling just how far Trump is willing to go to assert U.S. dominance in Latin America.

“It served as a warning to the entire region,” said Mexican security analyst Carlos Perez Ricart. “(Sheinbaum) is walking a very fine line: declaring a firm stance against intervention but also doing the only thing Mexico can do with such an asymmetrical power dynamic: continue to cooperate with the U.S.”

Over the last year, Sheinbaum has successfully traversed this political tight rope, defending Mexico's sovereignty while placating Washington with two mass expulsions to the U.S. of alleged high-level cartel operatives and undertaking a year-long military offensive against the Sinaloa Cartel.

Such actions have drawn praise from top U.S. officials.

“I think that the ongoing bilateral investigations and cooperation has been moving in the right direction,” said Derek Maltz, who served as acting administrator of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration at the beginning of Trump’s second term. He said he doesn’t anticipate U.S. military action in Mexico in the near future.

David Mora, a senior analyst with the International Crisis Group, said he expected to see the Mexican government engage in joint military operations with the U.S., something it hasn’t done to date. “Pressure on Sheinbaum will increase.”

LAW OF THE JUNGLE

As the fallout over Venezuela continues, officials in Mexico weighed the possibility - however remote - of a military attack. While few believe Washington would target Mexican leadership as it did with Maduro, even a unilateral move against drug cartels would deliver a severe blow to the government, undermining its authority and violating the sovereignty it has vowed to defend.

“It would be an international catastrophe,” said Mexican Congressman Alfonso Ramirez Cuellar, a close ally of Sheinbaum’s, who said that he didn’t think Washington would go so far because of the two countries’ close relationship on security and trade, and Mexico’s “strong disposition to collaborate and cooperate” with the U.S. "The world can't live in the law of the jungle."

Analysts, including Perez Ricart, said they thought U.S. attention would turn to other Latin American countries before Mexico, after Trump criticized the leadership of Colombia and Cuba on Sunday.

The Mexican security official agreed.

"Until we see (attacks in) Colombia and Cuba, then we’ll know that we're next," the official said.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 11:20:21 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/EI4PK36HWBKVFL6ROLDPYCRYZA.jpg?auth=09116e109e6540a164114f6859e070b9f8014ce450be50dc3013ea9a260be3ff&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>World is less safe after US action in Venezuela, says UN Human Rights Office</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/world-is-less-safe-after-us-action-venezuela-says-un-human-rights-office-2026-01-06/</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 11:20:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>AI dominates CES 2026 as annual Las Vegas tech trade show kicks off</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/ai-dominates-ces-2026-as-annual-las-vegas-tech-trade-show-kicks-off</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 11:21:10 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/74b33a08-eaef-11f0-812d-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/capture-2118707930695cec3620ae60-75061477.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Central African President leads provisional results in controversial election</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/central-african-president-leads-provisional-results-in-controversial-election</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 11:21:12 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/1b6afe4a-ea90-11f0-8f22-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25362450874462.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Algeria and DR Congo go head to head in one of AFCON's last round of 16 clashes</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/algeria-and-dr-congo-go-head-to-head-in-one-of-afcon-s-last-round-of-16-clashes</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 11:21:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/8ac53940-ea6d-11f0-bb50-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/000-89D4778.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Final pilgrims cross Holy Door as Vatican claims Jubilee success</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/final-pilgrims-cross-holy-door-as-vatican-claims-jubilee-success</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 11:21:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/b28d7e30-eaed-11f0-b671-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/capture-1828210257695ce942715d14-57882319.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Worries that Venezuela crisis could shift US focus away from Ukraine amid key talks</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/worries-that-venezuela-crisis-could-shift-us-focus-away-from-ukraine-amid-key-talks</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 11:21:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/fbdc0d7c-e0b1-11f0-b357-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/Zelensky-Witkoff.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Rights groups say at least 25 dead in Iran protests</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/rights-groups-say-least-25-dead-iran-protests-2026-01-06/</link><description>DUBAI, Jan 6 (Reuters) - At least 25 people have been killed in Iran during the first nine days of protests that started in the bazaar of Tehran over the plunging value of the currency and soaring inflation, according to rights groups.

The protests have spread to some cities in western and southern Iran but do not match the scale of unrest that swept the nation in 2022-23 over the death of Mahsa Amini, who died in the custody of Iran's morality police for allegedly violating the Islamic Republic's strict dress code.

However, even though smaller, these protests have quickly expanded from an economic focus to broader frustrations, with some protesters chanting against the country's clerical rulers.

Iran also remains under international pressure, with U.S. President Donald Trump threatening on Friday to come to the aid of protesters in Iran if security forces fired on them. In response, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed not to "yield to the enemy".

Hengaw, a Kurdish Iranian rights group, put the death toll at 25, including four people under 18. It said more than 1,000 people had been arrested. HRANA, a network of rights activists, said at least 29 had been killed, including two law enforcement agents, in addition to 1,203 arrests, as of January 5.

Reuters has not been able to independently verify the numbers. Iranian authorities have not given a death toll for protesters, but have said at least two members of the security services have died and more than a dozen have been injured in the unrest.

"While drawing a distinction between protesters and rioters, law enforcement has dealt with strength against rioters by arresting them on the scene or later following identification by intelligence units," Iran's police chief Ahmadreza Radan was quoted by state media on Tuesday as saying.

"I pledge that we will deal with the last of these rioters. It is still time for those who were deceived by foreign services to identify themselves and draw on the Islamic Republic’s greatness."

HRANA said that during the protests, slogans have gone beyond economic demands and included criticism of governance and calls for justice. Protests have so far occurred in 27 provinces out of 31 and expanded to smaller cities, it said.

Authorities have acknowledged economic hardships but accused networks linked to foreign powers of "pushing economic protests toward chaos and disorder", with the judiciary chief pledging to have no mercy toward "rioters".

President Masoud Pezeshkian has urged dialogue and promised reforms to stabilise the monetary and banking systems and protect purchasing power.

The government has announced a subsidy reform, removing preferential currency exchange rates for importers in favour of direct transfers to Iranians to boost their purchasing power for essential goods. The measure will come into force on January 10.

The central bank chief was also replaced on December 29.

The rial fell further to 1,489,500 on Tuesday, representing a 4% fall since the protests started.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 11:41:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/OF2RYJRB6ZPB5NJEKB4XKLD3HU.jpg?auth=461f52864b619be8b834871e45181199a26d854fdc812d58504cc32a9b4679cd&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israeli foreign minister visiting Somaliland, sources say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-foreign-minister-visiting-somaliland-sources-say-2026-01-06/</link><description>NAIROBI/JERUSALEM, Jan 6 (Reuters) - Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar is on a visit to Somaliland in East Africa, where he is due to meet the semi-autonomous region's president later on Tuesday, according to a senior Somaliland official.

The visit comes 10 days after Israel formally recognised the self-declared Republic of Somaliland as an independent and sovereign state, a move that sparked criticism from Somalia, which has long opposed Somaliland's bid to secede.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 11:41:27 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5ZF7VNKVR5OXTAJCMUJPP2WYWU.jpg?auth=d6ef7a909cadafa0b4df469890bf2d73c19b38d71032327fc5776d2ecf46fcb7&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Slovenia's president calls parliamentary election for March 22</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/slovenias-president-calls-parliamentary-election-march-22-2026-01-06/</link><description>Jan 6 (Reuters) - Slovenia's President Natasa Pirc-Musar signed a decree on Tuesday calling a regular parliamentary election for March 22, according to a statement from the president's office.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 11:41:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/6MGIWUXIAFL2HNCPYWXFVGNMDY.jpg?auth=c33cf951a744cdf46289ecd54e14abb767135fbae2c495ea76df6775bce07e64&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Maduro pleads "not guilty" as he faces drug trafficking charges in the US</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/maduro-pleads-not-guilty-as-he-faces-drug-trafficking-charges-in-the-us</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 11:42:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/c4072f3c-eaf0-11f0-8eb7-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260106-120134-120320-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>European leaders back Denmark in face of renewed US interest in Greenland</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/only-greenland-denmark-can-decide-their-future-european-leaders-say-joint-2026-01-06/</link><description>COPENHAGEN, Jan 6 (Reuters) - Leaders from major European powers expressed support for Denmark and Greenland on Tuesday in a joint statement, saying the Arctic island belongs to its people, following renewed interest by U.S. President Donald Trump in taking over the Danish territory.

"Greenland belongs to its people. It is for Denmark and Greenland, and them only, to decide on matters concerning Denmark and Greenland," said the statement by leaders of France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, Britain, and Denmark.

The leaders said that security in the Arctic must be achieved collectively with NATO allies, including the United States.

"NATO has made clear that the Arctic region is a priority and European Allies are stepping up," the statement said. "We and many other Allies have increased our presence, activities and investments, to keep the Arctic safe and to deter adversaries."

Trump has said repeatedly he wants to take over Greenland and told The Atlantic magazine on Sunday: "We do need Greenland, absolutely. We need it for defence."

A U.S. military operation at the weekend which led to the capture of Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro has further rekindled concerns among Washington's NATO allies that Greenland might face a similar scenario.

Greenland, the world's largest island with a population of 57,000 people, is not an independent member of NATO but is covered by Denmark's membership of the Western military alliance.

The island's strategic location between Europe and North America makes it a critical site for the U.S. ballistic missile defence system. Its mineral wealth also aligns with Washington's ambition to reduce reliance on Chinese exports.

Greenland's Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said on Monday that his government was seeking to strengthen ties with the United States and that citizens should not fear an imminent U.S. takeover.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 12:45:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7O5AAB6PGJL45KE3WSUNM2X4H4.jpg?auth=3249739d42dda3975a8cd27765727b9da3679073b8e79460da66ebe9dda42d7d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ruling coalition in eastern German state collapses</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/ruling-coalition-eastern-german-state-collapses-2026-01-06/</link><description>BERLIN, Jan 6 (Reuters) - The centre-left premier of the eastern German state of Brandenburg said on Tuesday he would run a minority government pending talks to form a new majority after the coalition with the far-left Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW) collapsed.

The political turbulence in Brandenburg, the region around the capital Berlin, is unlikely to have any immediate impact on conservative Chancellor Friedrich Merz's national coalition.

But it underlines the volatility in German politics, notably in eastern Germany, ahead of a series of state and local elections this year. The elections, including two in eastern states, could see the already weakening support for the traditional centre-right and centre-left parties in Merz's coalition further eroded.

Brandenburg Premier Dietmar Woidke said repeated disagreements with the BSW made further cooperation impossible. He ruled out new state elections and said he would seek talks with the centre-right Christian Democratic Union - Merz's party - to see whether a new coalition could be formed to succeed the one formed with BSW in November 2024.

In the meantime, he would run the government with his existing ministers, including Finance Minister Robert Crumbach, whose decision to quit the BSW triggered the crisis.

The BSW, formed as a breakaway from the Left party, the successor to the old East German Communist Party, combines left-wing economic policies with calls for immigration restrictions and opposition to military support for Ukraine.

But it has struggled to contain infighting over leadership and strategy, and Wagenknecht, a former co-leader of the Left, herself stepped down as party leader last year.

As well as Crumbach, who accused BSW members of refusing to accept the responsibilities of government, two other BSW state lawmakers resigned, leaving the coalition without a majority.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 12:46:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/J7RMCARKTVKYZIVAIZILDJFAYE.jpg?auth=e4202c06f7e88a91351d6cdae0aa3918299abde59936762bebdcf98ad587e844&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>At least nine Nigerian soldiers killed in bomb blast</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/at-least-nine-nigerian-soldiers-killed-in-bomb-blast</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 12:47:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/99be6d38-eafc-11f0-9be2-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/capture-1850478582695d02439e0f87-71255327.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Buy a king's cake, win a car: French tradition with a twist</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/buy-a-king-s-cake-win-a-car-french-tradition-with-a-twist</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 12:47:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/5f289e18-eaf3-11f0-919e-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260106-111308-111413-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Capture of Maduro by US means Russia, Iran and China lose key ally</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/capture-of-maduro-by-us-means-russia-iran-and-china-lose-key-ally</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 12:47:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/0f56ad42-eaf5-11f0-ba5a-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/capture-1052902815695cf59ceb08b3-14102670.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Who are the key figures in Maduro's trial?</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/who-are-the-key-figures-in-maduro-s-trial</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 12:47:43 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/3c88cadc-ead4-11f0-9818-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/2023-06-27T221052Z-2002262556-RC2YR1ARPQ24-RTRMADP-3-USA-TRUMP-NEW-YORK.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Kyiv allies meet in Paris to discuss security guarantees for Ukraine</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/kyiv-allies-meet-in-paris-to-discuss-security-guarantees-for-ukraine</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 12:47:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/2ee4df88-eaf2-11f0-80ee-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260106-120810-121339-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Swiss officials admit safety inspections lapse at bar where 40 died in NYE fire</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260106-swiss-officials-admit-safety-inspections-lapse-bar-where-40-died-nye</link><description>Swiss authorities admitted Tuesday that fire safety inspections had not been carried out for the past five years at a bar where 40 people died in a New Year blaze.

The inferno at Le Constellation in the Swiss Alpine ski resort of Crans-Montana in southwest left 116 people injured , of whom 83 are still in various hospitals. Most of those killed were teenagers.

Prosecutors have said they believe the fire started when people celebrating the New Year raised champagne bottles with sparklers attached, setting light to sound-insulating foam on the ceiling of the basement bar.

Although inspections including fire safety were conducted in 2016, 2018 and 2019, "periodic inspections were not conducted between 2020 and 2025. We bitterly regret this," Crans-Montana mayor Nicolas Feraud told a press conference, five days on from the disaster.

The law requires the municipal fire department to conduct annual inspections in establishments open to the public, he said, admitting that he did not know why the visits had not been carried out.

In a statement, the municipality said it discovered the failure after going through documents sent to the Wallis canton prosecutor's office.

"The courts will determine the influence that such a failure had in the chain of events leading up to the tragedy. The municipality will assume full responsibility as determined by the courts," the statement said.

The council said it would commission a specialist external agency to inspect all public establishments and would ban pyrotechnic devices indoors.

"The municipality of Crans-Montana remains fully committed to supporting the victims of this tragedy and their families and loved ones, who are constantly in its thoughts," the statement said.

"It will continue to do everything in its power to ensure that such a tragedy never happens again."

French couple Jacques and Jessica Moretti owned and managed Le Constellation, which was crammed with young partygoers when the blaze erupted at around 1:30am on Thursday.

A criminal investigation has been opened against the pair. They are charged with manslaughter by negligence, bodily harm by negligence and arson by negligence.

Le Constellation was established in 1967. Reports in the municipal files reference a capacity limit of 100 people on the ground floor and 100 in the basement, Tuesday's statement said.

According to photos taken by the owners in 2015 during renovations that the municipality said "did not require a permit", the sound insulation foam had been stuck on the ceiling since then.

A video filmed by a member of the public, screened Monday by Swiss broadcaster RTS, showed that the danger was known years ago.

"Watch out for the foam!", a bar employee said during 2019 New Year's Eve celebrations, as champagne bottles with sparklers were brought out.

"The security chiefs who inspected this bar (between 2015 and 2020) should probably have been more careful," admitted Feraud, who ruled out resigning for the time being.

"I will carry this burden and the sorrow of all these families for the rest of my life," he concluded, visibly shaken.

The most severely burned survivors have been airlifted to specialist burns centres in Switzerland and abroad.

The average age of those killed was 19. Eight of the dead were aged under 16.

While the majority of those killed were Swiss, nine French and six Italian nationals were among the dead.

"This tragedy could have been avoided" and "should have been avoided through prevention and common sense," Gian Lorenzo Cornado, Rome's ambassador to Switzerland, said Monday.

Switzerland has declared a national day of mourning for Friday.

A memorial ceremony honouring the victims is planned in Martigny, down the Rhone valley from Crans-Montana, with French President Emmanuel Macron expected to attend.

All church bells in Switzerland were to toll at 2:00pm (1300 GMT). A moment of silence is also planned.

Italy and France last month dashed hopes for a December deal, saying they were not ready to support it until farmer fears of an influx of cheap commodities from Mercosur, such as beef and sugar, were resolved.

All 27 EU agriculture ministers have been invited to the meeting at the Commission, the EU presidency holder Cyprus said on Tuesday, although it was not clear yet how many would attend.

European commissioners for agriculture, trade and health are expected to give reassurances over future funding for farmers under the EU's Common Agricultural Policy, including a 6.3 billion euro ($7.4 billion) crisis fund in the next EU budget.

The Commission's move to merge regional cohesion funds and CAP money in the next seven-year budget alarmed farming nations.

In a letter to Cyprus's president and the head of the European Parliament on Tuesday, Commission President Ursula von der Leyen proposed accelerating 45 billion euros of support to farmers and reiterated that the 2028-2034 budget would guarantee them 293.7 billion euros.

The Commission will also review import controls, including permissible maximum levels of pesticide residues, two EU diplomats said.

"It is a critical moment to discuss demands from farmers," one of the diplomats said.

The EU executive, supported by EU-Mercosur proponents such as Germany and Spain, is seeking to garner the broad majority of 15 EU members representing 65% of the EU population required to authorise the EU signature, possibly as early as January 12.

They say the accord, which has been 25 years in the making and would be the EU's largest in terms of tariff reductions, is vital to boosting exports hit by U.S. import taxes and to reduce reliance on China by securing access to critical minerals.

With Poland and Hungary opposed to the deal and France critical, the position of Italy will be a key determinant of whether the deal can be signed. A vote is expected on Friday.

The Commission had held discussions with member states over the past two weeks and the bloc was on track to sign the agreement soon, a spokesperson for the executive said.

Italy is not opposed to the deal, two Italian sources told Reuters on Tuesday, but wanted assurances - notably on reciprocity - so that imported farm products meet EU health and environmental standards. These were due to be discussed on Wednesday.

A second EU diplomat said Italy was not yet fully on board.

One of the sources added that price floors for rare earths would be a point of discussion, among other critical mineral topics.

G7 countries, except Japan, are heavily or exclusively reliant on China for a range of materials from rare earth magnets to battery metals. In June last year, the G7 agreed on an action plan to secure their supply chains and boost their economies.

Officials began discussing price floors last year to make investments in critical minerals outside China economically viable. The United States was the first to set a minimum price in a contract for domestic rare earths supplies last year.

A spokesperson for the U.S. Treasury did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 14:51:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/3CAWKDGUA5MGVK2PWMGQBX25NE.jpg?auth=4534f2fe8d8a4b9908ced04c4096b24f7d7299f37d8dff5ff110458da1926c9e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Somalia condemns Israeli foreign minister visit to Hargeisa as violation of sovereignty</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/somalia-condemns-israeli-foreign-minister-visit-hargeisa-violation-sovereignty-2026-01-06/</link><description>Jan 6 (Reuters) - Somalia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Tuesday condemned a visit by Israel's Foreign Minister Gideon Saar to Hargeisa, saying it was a violation of Somalia's sovereignty and territorial integrity.

KLM said its 25 de-icing trucks have been in continuous use in Amsterdam, its main hub, consuming around 85,000 litres per day of the mixture of heated water and glycol it uses to clear departing aircraft of snow and ice before take off.

"Since Friday KLM has been de-icing aircraft at Schiphol around the clock using de-icing fluid delivered daily," the Dutch arm of airline group Air France-KLM (AIRF.PA) , opens new tab said.

"Due to a combination of extreme weather conditions and delays in supply from the provider, stock levels are running low. This challenge is currently widespread across Europe," it added.

KLM said employees had been sent to its supplier in Germany to pick up more de-icing fluid, and it could not give a specific timeframe for when it might run out if stocks are not replenished.

"We are doing everything we can to prevent it," KLM spokesperson Anoesjka Aspeslagh said.

Schiphol airport, meanwhile, said it still had ample supplies of a different type of de-icing fluid it uses to remove ice and snow from runways.

KLM cancelled at least 300 flights on Tuesday to and from Amsterdam, where it is the largest operator.

Winter conditions are expected to continue in the coming days in the Netherlands, with heavy snowfall and strong winds predicted for Wednesday morning.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 15:25:48 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/VRI37E7VENJLVPXVC7URRZBVEU.jpg?auth=0d244e88689ffb480e9adce239aa04406af950d3bbeaf0e7dc8760c9b5872602&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israel's main airport receives passenger boost from Gaza ceasefire</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israels-main-airport-receives-passenger-boost-gaza-ceasefire-2026-01-06/</link><description>JERUSALEM, Jan 6 (Reuters) - Passenger traffic at Ben Gurion International Airport near Tel Aviv rose 33% in 2025, the Israel Airports Authority reported on Tuesday, reflecting the return of foreign carriers after many airlines halted flights during the two-year Gaza war .

A U.S.-brokered ceasefire in October gave way to the resumption of flights to Israel by carriers who had not yet resumed routes to Tel Aviv. In December, the number of passengers rose 59%.

In all of 2025, passenger traffic at Israel's main air gateway Ben Gurion reached 18.5 million, versus 13.9 million in 2024. The airport handled 21.8 million people in 2023, the year war broke out after the October 7 attacks by Hamas.

Flag carrier El Al Israel Airlines (ELAL.TA) , opens new tab , which did not halt flights during the war other than last June during a 12-day conflict with Iran, showed a 5% annual gain to 6.9 million passengers, though its market share slipped to 37% from 48%.

El Al has posted steep gains in revenue and profit as a result of the conflict, in which just a handful of carriers were operating.

Smaller rivals Israir (ISRG.TA) , opens new tab , with an 11% market share, and Arkia at 9% followed El Al.

Wizz Air (WIZZ.L) , opens new tab was the largest foreign carrier in Israel with 1.23 million passengers - double its 2024 level - for a 7% market share. Wizz is seeking to establish a hub in Israel.

Aegean, flydubai, Etihad, Lufthansa and United also posted large gains in the number of passengers last year.

Separately, Israel's Statistics Bureau said tourist numbers to Israel rose 38% in 2025 to 1.34 million, but remained below the 2023 level of 3.24 million. Outgoing tourism by Israelis grew 33% to 9.42 million last year.

The Gaza war broke out in October 2023. While the ceasefire halted most fighting, it has not stopped entirely.

Israeli strikes since the deal was struck have killed more than 400 Palestinians - most of them civilians, according to Gaza health officials - and Palestinian militants have killed three Israeli soldiers.

Both sides have accused one another of violating the deal's provisions.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 15:25:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/RHQXUJMVJ5LKDK7AY7UQJA7SEM.jpg?auth=38fa3c3180bf599765b9f3818cf8118db7e09c4be2c57b5526fcd3c76100f625&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Five die in weather accidents in France as cold snap grips Europe</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260106-five-die-in-weather-accidents-in-france-as-cold-snap-grips-europe</link><description>Below-freezing winter temperatures plunged swathes of Europe into a second day of travel chaos on Tuesday, with weather-related accidents leading to five deaths from the cold snap in France alone.

Three people died in accidents linked to black ice in southwestern France on Monday morning, authorities said, while a taxi driver died in hospital on Monday night after veering into the Marne river in the Paris region.

His passenger was still being treated for hypothermia, according to a police source, while another driver also lost his life east of Paris on Monday after a collision with a heavy goods vehicle.

Across the English Channel in Britain, the mercury plunged to -12.5C overnight in Norfolk, eastern England , while temperatures below -10C across the Netherlands brought trains to a standstill on Tuesday morning.

"Last night was the coldest night of the winter so far," Britain's Met Office said, with nearly all of the United Kingdom on alert for snow and ice and more snowfall expected.

Amsterdam's Schiphol airport, the Netherlands' main flight hub, saw a second day of weather-driven cancellations, with more than 400 flights grounded Tuesday and travellers facing huge queues at the airline counters.

Trains from the Dutch national railway operator NS only began rolling again after 10:00 am (0900 GMT), with services limited afterwards.

But planes got off the ground again from Liverpool in northwest England and Aberdeen in northeast Scotland , after the cold forced both airports to close on Monday.

More than 300 schools were shut in Scotland Tuesday, the national BBC broadcaster reported, with Scottish train services also severely disrupted.

"Tuesday will bring more severe snow and ice to the north of Scotland -- and with it, continued travel disruption and risks to people and communities," Scottish transport minister Fiona Hyslop warned late on Monday.

"It's important that people plan ahead, consider their travel plans and work from home if that's an option."

Several smaller French airports were closed on Tuesday, according to the transport ministry.

But the main Paris airports of Orly and Charles de Gaulle remained open with no flights cancelled.

In the French capital proper, Monday's snowfall had settled overnight across much of Paris's pavements, with pedestrians forced to navigate the treacherously icy streets and cobbles.

Tour guide Valeria Pitchouguina said the sight of Paris snowed under was "truly extraordinary", but the ice was complicating efforts to shepherd her groups up the steep steps to the picture-postcard district of Montmartre .

"When it's like that and snowy and icy, it's something else, it's less like climbing Montmartre and more like climbing Mont Blanc," Pitchouguina told AFPTV.

Construction and Transport Minister Janos Lazar urged Hungarians to only head out "if absolutely necessary".</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 15:26:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/16e0b5f0-eb0c-11f0-8f31-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/948a7b7d22e396cfd263bb9e8adbb4ab845a9309.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Colombian military must defend against potential US invasion, minister says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/colombian-military-must-defend-against-potential-us-invasion-minister-says-2026-01-06/</link><description>BOGOTA, Jan 6 (Reuters) - Colombia's foreign minister on Tuesday said the country's military must defend the country's territory and sovereignty in the event of a hypothetical U.S. invasion.

The comments follow reporting including from Reuters that Grok, prompted by users, was creating a flood of non-consensual images of women and minors in skimpy clothing.

Technology minister Liz Kendall said in a statement the content was "absolutely appalling" and urged the social media platform to act swiftly.

"No one should have to go through the ordeal of seeing intimate deepfakes of themselves online," Kendall said. "We cannot and will not allow the proliferation of these demeaning and degrading images, which are disproportionately aimed at women and girls."

"X needs to deal with this urgently."

X did not immediately respond to a request for comment following Kendall's statement.

X's Safety account said on Sunday that it removes all illegal content on the platform and permanently suspends accounts involved.

"Anyone using or prompting Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content," it said.

Asked about the subject recently, X told Reuters : "Legacy Media Lies."

Creating or sharing non-consensual intimate images or child sexual abuse material, including AI-generated sexual imagery, is illegal in Britain. Additionally, tech platforms must prevent British users from encountering illegal content and remove it once they become aware of it.

Musk has shrugged off concerns online, posting laughing emojis in response to edited bikini images of public figures.

OFCOM CONTACTS X, xAI OVER LEGAL DUTIES IN THE UK

On Monday, the European Commission said it was aware that X was offering a "spicy mode" and condemned the images as unlawful.

Also on Monday, Britain's media regulator Ofcom said it had made "urgent contact" with X and its AI arm xAI to understand what steps they were taking to comply with legal duties to protect UK users.

French officials have reported X to prosecutors and regulators, calling the content " manifestly illegal ," while Indian authorities have also demanded explanations.

U.S. regulators have yet to comment.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 15:48:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BBH6UACQQFNVVAQQ6SG5OKMBAY.jpg?auth=ad2d8a1b2af9a85eb649f6d96c50106c6b57c21f437b3fa50788b88116879f37&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Only Denmark and Greenland can decide on island's future, says Canada</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/only-denmark-greenland-can-decide-islands-future-says-canada-2026-01-06/</link><description>OTTAWA, Jan 6 (Reuters) - Only Denmark and Greenland can decide questions about the future of the Arctic island, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said on Tuesday when asked about U.S. threats of annexation.

With his comments, Weimer joins a chorus of European leaders, including the EU Commission this week, raising concerns about the flood of sexually explicit content being created using X's built-in AI chatbot Grok.

"What we are currently observing on X looks like the industrialisation of sexual harassment," said Weimer about the images of women and children in very skimpy clothing generated in a Grok feature referred to as "spicy mode."

"It is now crucial that the EU Commission continues to enforce this (legal framework) as rigorously as it has already begun," said Weimer.

The DSA, which requires online platforms to do more to tackle illegal and harmful content, provides all the necessary tools to ensure consistent application of EU law, he said.

Online, Musk has dismissed the criticism, while Grok - which in an earlier model had praised Hitler and produced content with antisemitic tropes - has stated that it will examine gaps in its security measures and make improvements.

Both Musk and the U.S. government accuse Europeans of censorship and suppressing freedom of expression with their regulation, and Washington last month imposed visa bans on five Europeans combating online hate and disinformation.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 15:48:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/TS4T54EDPZPO3BSFC74SC3JXJY.jpg?auth=d389163daf641f8ef8c5dcc4d98f65e5faea9cbee24c23b52ecbfdbf31d75687&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Maduro's capture divides protesters in New York City</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/maduro-s-capture-divides-protesters-in-new-york-city</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 15:49:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/613aebea-eb0a-11f0-b140-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260106-143501-143651-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Explainer: Why is Somaliland strategically important?</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/why-is-somaliland-strategically-important-2026-01-06/</link><description>NAIROBI, Jan 6 (Reuters) - Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar met the president of Somaliland on Tuesday, 10 days after Israel became the first country to formally recognise the breakaway region in the Horn of Africa as an independent and sovereign state.

A Somaliland government source and a regional diplomat said other countries were preparing to follow suit and recognise Somaliland, despite an outcry from Somalia which says such moves threaten its sovereignty.

U.S. Senator Ted Cruz said in a post on X on Monday that recognising Somaliland was aligned with U.S. security interests , calling it "an ally that shares our values in a region vital to global trade and counterterrorism."

Somaliland, which declared independence from Somalia in 1991, occupies a strategic location at the juncture of the Indian Ocean and Red Sea, with its Berbera port giving access to some of the world's busiest shipping lanes.

Ships plying those routes have faced attacks by Yemen's Houthi militia , and analysts say countering that threat is part of Israel's move to recognise Somaliland and could lead to a military cooperation agreement between the two. Somaliland, however, has denied recognition allows for Israel to establish military bases there or for the resettlement of Palestinians from Gaza.

Landlocked Ethiopia, Africa's second most populous country, has also set its sights on Somaliland, announcing in 2024 a memorandum of understanding to lease an area around the Berbera port in exchange for Addis Ababa recognising the region's independence.

That deal prompted an angry response from Somalia, and drew the Mogadishu government closer to Egypt, which has quarrelled with Ethiopia for years over Addis Ababa's construction of a vast hydropower dam on the Nile River, and to Eritrea, another of Ethiopia's longtime foes .

Turkey has close ties with both Ethiopia and Somalia , training Somalia's security forces and supplying development assistance in return for a foothold on the key global shipping route. After talks mediated by Turkey, Ethiopia agreed in December 2024 to work with Somalia to resolve the dispute, but it is now rumoured to be readying to recognise Somaliland.

India has denied talk on X that it was also preparing to recognise Somaliland, although some analysts say it should do so to counter Chinese economic influence in the Horn of Africa, specifically Djibouti, as well as in Kenya and Tanzania.

The United Arab Emirates, which in 2020 normalised relations with Israel under the U.S.-brokered Abraham Accords , has carved its own sphere of influence in the region. It runs the Berbera port through Dubai's state owned company DP World, as well as Berbera's airport and a free-trade zone located between the port and the airport.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 16:30:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LXZLMX7RLNJAFOFUYFAGVRW4U4.jpg?auth=f3d43224b8cdc8d4d55fea2fbf5d5790dfe74d25be4fc5cdcd656704f266bd3e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Three killed in Aleppo attacks, Syrian government, SDF trade blame</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/three-killed-aleppo-attacks-syrian-government-sdf-trade-blame-2026-01-06/</link><description>Jan 6 (Reuters) - At least three people were killed and several others wounded in Syria's northern city of Aleppo, state news agency SANA said on Tuesday, citing Aleppo's health director, after deadly attacks for which Syrian government forces and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces traded blame.

Syria's defence ministry said in a statement that the SDF had continued its "escalation" by targeting army positions and residential areas in Aleppo.

The SDF denied its responsibility, saying that the casualties were caused by "indiscriminate" artillery and missile shelling by factions aligned with the Damascus government.

The violence came days after a meeting between senior officials from the SDF and the Damascus government on implementing a deal agreed nearly 10 months ago that aimed to fully integrate the semi-autonomous Kurdish region into the central Syrian government.

The agreement was meant to be implemented by the end of 2025 but the two sides have made little progress, each accusing the other of stalling or acting in bad faith.

The SDF is reluctant to give up autonomy it won as the main U.S. ally during the war, which left it with control of Islamic State prisons and rich oil resources.

Integrating the SDF into Syria's army would mend Syria's deepest remaining fracture, but failing to do so risks an armed clash that could derail the country's emergence from 14 years of war and potentially draw in Turkey, which has threatened an incursion against Kurdish fighters it views as terrorists.

As progress falters, several rounds of fighting have broken out.

The office of the mayor of the town of Crans-Montana said the bar had no fire alarm, because it was not required for a venue of that size. Other questions remain about the fire that killed or injured people from all over the world.

Following are salient points of the investigation.

Twenty-one of the dead were from Switzerland, seven from France, six from Italy, and there was a Swiss-French dual national and a French-British-Israeli national. The remaining four were Romanian, Turkish, Belgian and Portuguese.

The dead included 26 teenagers. Six were 15 years old, while two were only 14.

The 116 injured included citizens of over a dozen countries. Most were Swiss. Twenty-one were from France, and 10 were Italian. Aside from four with French-Finnish, Swiss-Belgian, French-Italian, and Italian-Filipino dual citizenship, nationals of Belgium, Portugal, the Czech Republic, Australia, Luxembourg, Congo Republic, Serbia, Poland and Bosnia made up the rest.

Prosecutors believe sparkling candles ignited the ceiling of the basement of "Le Constellation" bar after witnesses reported seeing a staff member on the shoulders of a colleague carrying bottles with so-called fountain candles in them.

The basement ceiling was covered with foam soundproofing material deemed acceptable at the time of the bar's last safety check in 2019. Swiss law does not require authorities to verify such materials, but Crans-Montana mayor Nicolas Feraud said the courts must determine whether this should have been done anyway.

Feraud said the bar had an upstairs and a downstairs exit, with each floor intended to hold up to 100 people. He could not say whether the downstairs exit was working. That will be revealed by the investigation.

Residents of Crans-Montana said the bar was popular among school-age teenagers just starting to go out at night. In Switzerland, beer and wine can be consumed from age 16. The average age of those killed in the blaze was 19.

Swiss prosecutors have placed the bar's two French owners under criminal investigation on suspicion of three crimes: homicide by negligence, bodily harm by negligence and fire by negligence. They have not yet been formally charged and are not in custody.

If convicted of all three crimes, they could incur a maximum sentence of 4-1/2 years, according to Swiss lawyer Nicolas Rivard. If found to have known of the fire risk without taking preventative measures, they could face more severe charges carrying a sentence of at least five years, he said.

Class action cases do not exist in Switzerland. Families of the victims could seek compensation by joining the prosecutor's case as plaintiffs, lawyers said. Crans-Montana is trying to join the case as a party, but it has not been approved yet.

Switzerland's cantons have suspended plans to relax fire safety regulations. Crans-Montana has banned sparkling candles in its venues. Flags are flying at half-mast, and Friday will be a day of national mourning.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 16:30:39 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4SHNAC4HGBIYFKU3EHIFHZO4EA.jpg?auth=fd59e4bfd20688efff761f55d02b373ce1cbc898e0ec5436f745b81c173cd3a1&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia slams 'neocolonial threats' against Venezuela, backs new interim leader</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/russia-slams-neocolonial-threats-against-venezuela-backs-new-interim-leader-2026-01-06/</link><description>MOSCOW, Jan 6 (Reuters) - Russia on Tuesday welcomed the appointment of Delcy Rodriguez as Venezuela's interim president, calling it a step to ensure peace and stability in the face of "blatant neocolonial threats and foreign armed aggression".

"We firmly insist that Venezuela must be guaranteed the right to determine its own destiny without any destructive external interference," the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.

It did not refer by name to the United States. President Donald Trump on Saturday sent special forces to capture Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and bring him to the U.S., where he has pleaded not guilty to narcotics charges and insisted he remains the rightful leader of the country.

"We welcome the efforts undertaken by the official authorities of this country to protect state sovereignty and national interests. We reaffirm Russia's unwavering solidarity with the Venezuelan people and government," the Russian statement said, adding that Moscow would continue to provide "necessary support".

Maduro was the second close ally of Russia to be ousted in just over a year, following the toppling of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in December 2024.

But one senior Russian source told Reuters this week that if Trump was asserting a revived Monroe Doctrine of U.S. dominance in the Western Hemisphere, then Russia also had a right to its own sphere of influence .

Russia has been waging full-scale war in neighbouring Ukraine since February 2022, but is in talks with Trump's administration as the U.S. leader pushes for an end to the conflict.

President Vladimir Putin , who has taken care not to criticise Trump since his return to the White House a year ago, is keen to mend bilateral relations and revive economic ties between their two countries. Putin has yet to comment on Trump's removal of Maduro.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 16:30:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/YB4N75BUSVM25HYERDUTWYYNBM.jpg?auth=8e3121456fcc990864b61a4d2b7f57c9528a840cdc3870fa29c6433b89981785&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Explainer: Why is Somaliland strategically important?</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/why-is-somaliland-strategically-important-2026-01-06/</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 16:31:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Russia slams 'neocolonial threats' against Venezuela, backs new interim leader</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/russia-slams-neocolonial-threats-against-venezuela-backs-new-interim-leader-2026-01-06/</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 16:31:03 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Explainer: What is known so far about the Swiss bar fire that killed 40</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/what-is-known-so-far-about-swiss-bar-fire-that-killed-40-2026-01-06/</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 16:31:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Russia slams 'neocolonial threats' against Venezuela, backs new interim leader</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/russia-slams-neocolonial-threats-against-venezuela-backs-new-interim-leader-2026-01-06/</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 16:31:31 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>What is the "Coalition of the Willing" set to discuss with US envoys at key talks in Paris?</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/what-is-the-coalition-of-the-willing-set-to-discuss-with-us-envoys-at-key-talks-in-paris</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 16:31:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/d6924f40-eb06-11f0-9bfd-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-06T122310Z-1447465929-RC2NVIAOAQVU-RTRMADP-3-UKRAINE-CRISIS-COALITION-1.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Questions raised over legality of US operation in Venezuela</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/questions-raised-over-legality-of-us-operation-in-venezuela</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 16:31:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/09c23748-eb18-11f0-b499-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260106-164255-164449-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Replay: Watch Trump's address to House republicans and our analysis</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/replay-watch-trump-s-address-to-house-republicans-and-our-analysis</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 16:32:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/1f25a096-eb1a-11f0-86dd-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/capture-624027208695d33cacfe044-64961548.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Exiled Maduro opponent vows to return to Venezuela and slams interim leader</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/exiled-maduro-opponent-vows-to-return-to-venezuela-and-slams-interim-leader</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 16:32:03 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/ef91ade4-eafa-11f0-93de-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/2025-12-15T151553Z-1901097027-RC29EIAZQ1GH-RTRMADP-3-NOBEL-PRIZE-PEACE-MACHADO.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Is U.S. military operation in Venezuela a 'return to 19th century gunboat diplomacy'?</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/is-u-s-military-operation-in-venezuela-a-return-to-19th-century-gunboat-diplomacy</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 16:32:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/72e7664e-eb13-11f0-b857-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260106-130131-131002-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Last games of AFCON's round of 16 set to take place</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/last-games-of-afcon-s-round-of-16-set-to-take-place</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 16:32:08 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/11a337de-e29c-11f0-b3be-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/000-34J89NT.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US envoys join in 'Coalition of the Willing' talks for first time</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/us-envoys-join-in-coalition-of-the-willing-talks-for-first-time</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 16:32:10 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/c4c527a6-eb10-11f0-bddb-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260106-151949-152457-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump to House Republicans: If we don't win midterms, I will get impeached</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-house-republicans-if-we-dont-win-midterms-i-will-get-impeached-2026-01-06/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 6 (Reuters) -

"This child was struck by a bullet and apparently arrested during demonstrations in Naziabad (Tehran) around 8pm on January 4, 2026,” Maroofian wrote under a picture of missing 14-year-old Sogand Mansouri.

“She was wearing a grey jacket and no information about her condition or place of detention is available at the moment … If someone has news of her, absolutely please let us know.”

Living as a refugee in France since 2023, Maroofian, 25, was herself arrested in 2022 during the widespread protests triggered by the death of Mahsa Amini in custody.

Maroofian was detained for having interviewed Amini’s father after the young Kurdish-Iranian woman was arrested by the country’s morality police for allegedly wearing her headscarf improperly.

Through her contacts with those now taking to Iran’s streets, Maroofian has taken it upon herself to act as a public conduit for the latest wave of protests , which have sparked a crackdown by the Islamic Republic’s security forces.

A series of strikes against hyper-inflation by shopkeepers in Tehran and other major cities erupted on December 28. This latest social movement has since increasingly taken on a political character, with some crowds shouting slogans explicitly calling for the government’s fall.

The demonstrations have spread to the universities , and a number of young Iranians are now joining the protests daily. Teachers’ unions have reported that several high-schoolers have been arrested across the country; their families have been kept largely unaware of their whereabouts.

Iranian security forces have killed at least 27 protesters, including five minors, since late December, the Norway-based NGO Iran Human Rights said on Tuesday.

"At least 27 protesters have been killed by gunfire or other forms of violence carried out by security forces in eight provinces. Five of those killed have been verified to have been children," the NGO said after 10 days of protests, adding that over 1,000 people had been detained

The NGO on Sunday expressed concern about the fate of young Iranians detained during the demonstrations, particularly underage protesters believed to be imprisoned in Isfahan Central Prison.

Several wounded detainees have been transferred to the prison’s infirmary, the group said in a statement , including 16-year-old Soroush Azarmehr, 17-year-old Payam Aminzadeh and 16-year-old Saman Shahamat, who were arrested after being injured in the head and back.

In a prison in the conservative city of Qom, a bastion of theological universities in southern Iran, Soroush Javidi, 17, lost consciousness after suffering major blood loss, the organisation said.

“It is unclear whether he received appropriate medical care after being admitted to the prison infirmary,” the statement said. “On January 3, around 100 prisoners were transferred to Qom Central Prison, where they were all crammed into a single hall.”

According to a January 5 report by Human Rights Activists News Agency, which tracks rights in Iran , at least 1,203 people have been arrested since the demonstrations began in late December. Official figures say that at least 12 people, including members of Iran’s security forces, have been killed.

According to Iran Human Rights, AK-47 assault rifles and possibly even machine guns were used on January 3 to repress street protests in Malekshahi county, an area with a large Kurdish population.

The latest protests have affected at least 45 mostly small to mid-sized towns across Iran , mainly in the country’s west, according to an AFP analysis of media coverage and official announcements. Protests have broken out in at least 25 of Iran’s 31 provinces.

“Each time, there are a few dozen to a few hundred people protesting,” said FRANCE 24 correspondent Siavosh Ghazi. “But the movement is gaining momentum, spreading, and becoming increasingly radical.”

In one viral video taken on January 4 in Hamedan, a city in Iran’s west, protesters – including several women – set upon a pro-government militiaman who had just fired upon them. A number of protesters hurl themselves on a uniformed member of the Basij paramilitary force and disarm him, dragging him to the ground and beating him while others try to stop him from being killed in the street.

Other images shared on social media show similar scenes, with protesters hurling stones at riot police or throwing petrol on a militiaman before setting him ablaze.

In other scenes, demonstrators drop to their knees in front of motorbike-riding security forces in a non-violent display of resistance, seemingly without fear of being arrested.

Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei, head of the country’s judiciary, said on Monday that he recognised protesters have the right to demonstrate peacefully over economic concerns. But there will be “no leniency or indulgence” towards “rioters”, he said.

Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , who had mostly maintained his silence since the new protests erupted, echoed this sentiment during a Shiite festival in Tehran on Saturday. While protesters’ economic demands were “just” he said, “rioters” needed to be “put in their place”.

Iran Human Rights warned that the supreme leader's statement amounted to a blank cheque to security forces to escalate their repression.

“On 3 January, Ali Khamenei, the Supreme Leader of the Islamic Republic, implicitly issued an order to crack down by referring to protesters as ‘rioters’ and ‘agents of the enemy’,” the group said in its statement.

But while she was quick to denounce Maduro's "kidnapping", she also called for cooperation and respectful relations with Washington. And she may just be the steady hand needed to lead the country's political transition.

A lawyer specialising in labour law, Rodriguez, 56, spent almost a decade in France and England during her postgraduate studies. She served Maduro's predecessor, Hugo Chavez , as vice-minister for European affairs among other roles.

As Maduro's foreign minister and then vice president starting in 2018, she added the role of oil minister in 2024 – a key post in a country whose economy depends on oil exports.

Venezuela has the largest proven oil reserves in the world, and US President Donald Trump has made clear that gaining access to that oil is a key goal of his Venezuela campaign.

Trump’s advisers believe they may be able to work behind the scenes with Rodriguez, who despite her public defiance, is seen as a technocrat who might be amenable to working with the US on a political transition and key oil-related issues, according to three people briefed on the US strategy.

Because of her connections in the private sector and her deep knowledge of the oil sector, Rodriguez is considered one of the most pragmatic members of Maduro’s inner circle.

Rodriguez has publicly contradicted Trump on his claims that she is willing to work with the US. But despite her loyalist rhetoric, the Trump administration continues to signal an interest in working with her, albeit with some veiled threats.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the US will judge Rodríguez on what she does moving forward as acting president more than her words. "We're going to make an assessment on the basis of what they do, not what they say publicly in the interim," he told CBS News show " Face the Nation " on Sunday.

Trump, meanwhile, warned that Rodriguez could face a fate worse than Maduro's if she failed to heed US demands.

"If she doesn't do what's right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro," Trump told "The Atlantic" magazine.

Venezuela's military – which had repeatedly vowed loyalty to Maduro – recognised Rodriguez as the country's interim leader on Sunday. A day later, the Supreme Court swore her in to serve as president "in an acting capacity" – the first woman to hold the post in the country, even if temporarily.

"She has probably been one of Maduro's most trusted people over the years," political analyst Pedro Benitez of the Central University of Venezuela told AFP.

Rodriguez was among the Venezuelan officials targeted by US sanctions during the first Trump administration. The US levied sanctions on Rodríguez in 2018, naming her as one of the Maduro loyalists helping him "maintain his grip on power" and blocking her entry to the United States as well as any financial transactions involving American entities.

Rodriguez was subject to EU sanctions that same year, with the bloc accusing her of undermining "democracy and the rule of law in Venezuela".

As oil minister, she faced the challenge of maximising Venezuela's oil trade while navigating US sanctions on the industry.

Rodriguez comes from a long line of leftist political activists. Her brother,Jorge Rodriguez, is the head of Venezuela's parliament and a United Socialist Party of Venezuela insider. Their father was a Marxist activist who died in custody in 1976 under a then centre-left government.

The siblings "have been involved in every internal maneuver in which Maduro has pushed out any power centres that cast a shadow over him", Benitez said.

"The emotional fuel that got them where they are has to do with revenge," he added, notably their father's death.

Another political scientist, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal, said it would be a challenge for Rodriguez to recast herself as a moderate politician, given this history.

Rodriguez served as a lawmaker for many years before being taken up in successive Chavista governments, helped by her brother.

"She didn't have a political base of her own," according to Benitez.

But she soon proved herself a full-blooded Chavista and became a Maduro confidante.

From 2020 to 2024, while serving as both vice president and economy minister, Rodriguez cooled her incendiary rhetoric to make inroads with Venezuela's business community, long demonised by socialist leaders. She eased trade controls in the de facto dollarised economy, providing a breather for business leaders who still view her as a savvy economic manager.

While some hailed her practical approach, detractors called her cynical.

Rodriguez will remain the country's acting president at least until elections are organised, which according to the country's constitution should take place within 30 days. But Trump has already indicated that timeline is moot.

"We have to fix the country first. You can’t have an election. There’s no way the people could even vote," Trump said in an NBC News interview on Monday, the day Rodriguez was sworn in.

"No, it’s going to take a period of time. We have, we have to nurse the country back to health," he added.

Trump also dispelled hopes among many Venezuelans that the country might definitively turn the page on the Chavez-Maduro era by holding a free election that could see right-wing opposition leader and 2025 Nobel Peace Prize laureate Maria Corina Machado take the presidency.

Trump asserted that Machado did not have sufficient "support or respect" in the country to become president, despite her being Maduro's most credible opponent. Machado was barred from challenging Maduro in the last election in July 2024.

Machado “doesn’t have the support or the respect within the country. She’s a very nice woman, but she doesn’t have the respect,” Trump told reporters .

A Machado-backed candidate, Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia, " overwhelmingly" beat Maduro , according to international assessments, but the electoral commission quickly declared Maduro the victor despite "no supporting evidence", according to the US State Department . The US later recognised Gonzalez as the rightful president-elect and helped Machado go into hiding.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 17:30:16 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/6edf7596-eae1-11f0-ad58-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/Delcy-Rodriguez.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Watch live: Leaders of Ukraine’s 'Coalition of the Willing' speak from Paris</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260106-watch-live-leaders-of-ukraine-s-coalition-of-the-willing-speak-from-paris</link><description>The summit, hosted by President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday, gathered an unprecedented number of officials in person including European leaders, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and American envoys.

Trump says Maduro masterminded the flow of drugs into the U.S. and was illegitimately in power due to vote-rigging.

Demand for the PAC-3, or Patriot Advanced Capability missile interceptors, has grown as the U.S. and allied countries step up air defense capabilities in response to heightened geopolitical tensions.

Alongside the U.S., Lockheed Martin supplies PAC-3 to sixteen other countries, including Sweden, Qatar, Japan and Poland.

The Patriot system is also among the weapons the West has supplied to Ukraine as it fights Russia's invasion .

In 2025, Lockheed Martin delivered 620 units of the Patriot missile. Over the last two years, it has increased production by 60%.

Lockheed Martin will work with the U.S. government towards an initial contract award, which is expected in final fiscal year 2026 Congressional appropriations.

In September 2025, the Bethseda, Maryland-based company was awarded a $9.8 billion contract for 1970 Patriot missiles, the largest order to ever be placed for the weapon.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 18:33:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/3QWVX43QPVPZ3IJYGKNSBZMRTM.jpg?auth=27052d0a2c208c368b82c73199e1cdb5aa6c8726b7a2fe5bd808dac44d4c7579&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>How AI-generated images contributed to the disinformation about Maduro's capture</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260106-ai-generated-images-contributed-disinformation-spreading-maduro-capture</link><description>On the night of Friday, January 2, the US carried out a special forces raid and captured the president of Venezuela , Nicolas Maduro , and his wife, Cilia Flores. They were then transported to the US.

As soon as the news broke, a number of images said to show the capture of the Venezuelan leader were widely shared on social media. However, these images were fake: they were generated by AI.

A series of photos posted on January 3 – some taken face-on, others from above – were described as the first images to show the Venezuelan president after his capture by the US Army. According to one X user , they show Maduro being escorted across the tarmac by two US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agents before being loaded onto a US-bound plane.

The image of Maduro was even shared by several news sites (examples here and here ) to illustrate articles about his capture, and was also retweeted by a Republican lawmaker on X .

At first glance, these images seem pretty realistic. They show the Venezuelan leader being escorted by DEA agents from a few different angles. Maduro is wearing the same black suit, and the agents are wearing identical uniforms in all the images.

However, these photos are fake and were created by Google’s AI image generator, Nano Banana Pro, which is able to create realistic images.

These images are stamped with a watermark, which proves that they were AI-generated. This is a precaution put in place by Google so that artificially-generated content can be identified. This watermark is invisible to the naked eye, but it is visible to SynthID, a verification tool integrated into Google Lens. If you upload these images into Google Lens, it then reads, "Created with Google’s AI” in the “About this image” section.

The photo also features a defect that gives away the fact that it was AI-generated. There is an anomaly in Maduro’s jacket: a giant, blurred mark on the right leaves a gaping hole in his jacket. AI sometimes struggles to reproduce specific details.

Finally, @ultravfx , the name that appears on the watermark that is visible on the image, is an artist who creates AI-generated images.

Another image of the capture posted online on January 3 has so far garnered more than 4 million views on X . The image appears to show the Venezuelan president in an embarrassing situation: in custody and en route to the United States in his pyjamas.

This image also looks realistic: there are no flagrant anomalies, but its poor resolution means that it is hard to discern the details. However, there are a few clues that this image, too, was AI-generated.

First of all, the soldier sitting to the right of the Venezuelan president isn’t wearing the regulation camouflage print used by the US military . It actually seems to be a reproduction of the "Universal Camouflage Pattern" (UCP), a pattern that hasn’t been used by the US Army since 2019 . The US Army actually currently uses a pattern called the " Operational Camouflage Pattern ". The OCP is made up of green and brown patches, unlike the UCP, which features grey and black patches.

Maduro is wearing white pyjamas in the image shared online. US President Donald Trump posted an image on January 3 on the social media network Truth Social that features the Venezuelan president on board the USS Iwo Jima en route to the United States, wearing not white pyjamas but what appears to be a grey tracksuit. It is important to note that we can’t guarantee the authenticity of this image shared by Trump, as underlined in an article published in the New York Times .

Another image, posted on January 4 on X , where it garnered more than 800,000 views, shows Maduro apparently incarcerated in a US prison. You can see the Venezuelan leader in chains, wearing the classic orange prison jumpsuit.

SynthID, Google’s AI verification tool, shows that this image was created by Nano Banana, just like the images said to show Maduro on the tarmac.

Images published by the media of Maduro’s arrival in New York , or during his first appearance in court on January 5, show the president wearing black or brown, not an orange prisoner's uniform.

The gathering was meant to finalise as much as possible contributions to future security guarantees to reassure Kyiv in the event of a ceasefire with Russia, which launched a full scale invasion of its neighbour almost four years ago.

The talks, Meloni said in a statement, were constructive and underscored a high degree of alignment among Ukraine, the U.S., Europe and other partners on measures designed to ensure a durable and just peace.

"Central to the discussions was the refinement of security commitments inspired by NATO's Article 5, a model long advocated by Italy, which would be embedded in a broader package of agreements coordinated closely with Washington," the statement released by Meloni's press office said.

The proposed system aims to safeguard Ukraine's sovereignty through strengthened military capabilities and a robust mechanism to monitor any eventual ceasefire, Italy added.

According to the statement, the declaration adopted in Paris highlights the voluntary nature of countries' participation in a future multinational force and the requirement that national constitutional procedures be followed before providing assistance in the event of a renewed attack.

No Italian troops will be deployed on Ukrainian soil, Meloni reiterated during the meeting.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 19:21:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7UQVRPYO7VPFNB6KBF63XFXVHE.jpg?auth=470b2a94a518fe8ebdc31b3aa99274364aeed98637d73a1bf25bfbf7eadcfca6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump administration says there are ways US can lift Venezuelan oil output quickly</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/trump-administration-says-there-are-ways-us-can-lift-venezuelan-oil-output-2026-01-06/</link><description>WASHINGTON/MIAMI, Jan 6 (Reuters) - The Trump administration on Tuesday dismissed analysts' estimates that it would take years to ramp up Venezuela's crude production, saying there were ways to quickly boost the country’s oil sector.

Raising crude output from the South American nation, which sits on the world’s largest oil reserves, is a top objective for President Donald Trump after U.S. forces seized Venezuela's leader , Nicolas Maduro, in a raid on its capital Caracas on Saturday.

The country’s exports have fallen to below 1 million barrels per day from over 3 million bpd two decades ago amid a prolonged lack of investment that has left its infrastructure in shambles.

U.S. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said one option was for Washington to lift sanctions on Venezuela that had prevented the country from accessing crucial oil field equipment and other technologies to maximize production.

"Some of these things could be done very quickly," he told Fox Business Network in an interview. "The opportunity on the business side here is really enormous."

The Trump administration plans to meet U.S. oil executives this week, a source told Reuters on Monday, but it is unclear when or who will participate. Energy Secretary Chris Wright is scheduled to speak at a Goldman Sachs conference in Miami on Wednesday morning, just before ConocoPhillips CEO Ryan Lance is scheduled to make closed-door comments.

Trump says the U.S. industry could expand operations in Venezuela in less than 18 months, possibly with the help of subsidies.

"I think we can do it in less time than that, but it’ll be a lot of money," Trump told NBC News on Monday. "A tremendous amount of money will have to be spent, and the oil companies will spend it, and then they’ll get reimbursed by us or through revenue."

Trump said on Tuesday in remarks to U.S. House Republicans that increasing Venezuelan production could also reduce energy costs for Americans.

“We got a lot of oil to drill, which is going to bring down oil prices even further," Trump said.

Oil analysts and executives have been skeptical about a quick revival of Venezuela’s oil sector, pointing out that its degraded infrastructure would require billions of dollars and years to overcome.

Venezuela’s oil reserves are among the world’s costliest to develop because the oil is so thick and heavy it requires specialized equipment to extract, transport and refine into usable fuels.

With global oil prices low at around $60 a barrel, producers have been focusing on reserves that are cheaper and easier to develop.

"It’s hard to imagine increases beyond 300,000-400,000 barrels a day in the next year, just given the degraded state of the infrastructure, especially the upgraders," Daan Struyven, co-head of global commodities research at Goldman Sachs, said at the Goldman Sachs Energy, CleanTech &amp; Utilities Conference.

He said it would take until the end of the decade for Venezuela to reach 1.5 million to 2 million bpd, and likely only with significant support from the U.S. government.

"I wouldn't rule it out, but it will require time, significant institutional changes," he said.

Chevron (CVX.N) , opens new tab is the only U.S. major operating in Venezuela's oil fields. Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) , opens new tab and ConocoPhillips (COP.N) , opens new tab had storied histories in the country before their projects were nationalized by former President Hugo Chavez nearly two decades ago.

But in a statement to Reuters, a Syrian official said it would not be possible to move forward on "strategic files" in talks with Israel without a binding, clear timeline for Israeli troop withdrawal from Syrian territory seized after the late 2024 toppling of Bashar al-Assad.

The Syrian official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the latest round of talks with Israel in Paris, which took place on Monday and Tuesday, concluded with an initiative to suspend all Israeli military activities against Syria.

There was no immediate from Israel on whether it had agreed to suspend military activities in Syria. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said Israel had focused on security issues as well as Israel-Syria economic cooperation during the talks.

Syrian state media reported that the discussions in Paris were focused on reviving a 1974 disengagement agreement that established a U.N.-monitored buffer zone between Israel and Syria after the 1973 Middle East war.

Israeli troops advanced deeper across the border after Assad was toppled on December 8, 2024 by rebel fighters who assumed Syria's leadership. Israel has also intervened in what it calls missions to protect the Druze religious minority in southwestern Syria.

Syria is seeking an Israeli withdrawal to positions held before Assad was toppled, and wants a reciprocal security framework guaranteeing its sovereignty and preventing interference in its internal affairs.

The State Department statement said that the two countries would use the communication mechanism "to facilitate immediate and ongoing coordination on their intelligence sharing, military de-escalation, diplomatic engagement, and commercial opportunities" under U.S. supervision.

The Syrian official accused Israel of stalling by using technicalities in the talks, and said it should abandon its "expansionist mentality" so that the talks could proceed.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 19:40:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Exclusive: Venezuela, US in talks to export Venezuelan oil to US, sources say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/venezuela-us-talks-export-venezuelan-oil-us-sources-say-2026-01-06/</link><description>HOUSTON/WASHINGTON, Jan 6 (Reuters) - Venezuelan and U.S. officials are discussing exporting Venezuelan crude to refiners in the United States, five government, industry and shipping sources told Reuters on Tuesday.

Venezuela has millions of barrels of oil loaded on tankers and in storage tanks that it has been unable to ship due to a blockade on exports imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump since mid-December. The blockade was part of rising U.S. pressure on the government of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro that culminated in U.S. forces capturing him at the weekend.

A deal to sell the stuck crude to refiners in the United States would redirect them from China, which has been Venezuela's top buyer in the last decade and especially since the United States imposed sanctions on companies involved in oil trade with Venezuela in 2020. State oil firm PDVSA has already had to cut production due to the embargo, because it is running out of storage for the oil. If PDVSA does not find a way to export oil soon, it would have to cut production more, one of the sources said.

The White House, Venezuelan government officials and PDVSA did not immediately comment.

U.S. refineries on the Gulf Coast can process Venezuela's heavy crude grades and were importing some 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) before Washington first imposed energy sanctions on Venezuela.

It was not immediately clear how sanctioned PDVSA would obtain proceeds from the oil sales.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 20:25:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ZP6C6S4FFBMOXKVSC7IVQILVDE.jpg?auth=b3a976ba807359458a62f550fce51993da5b1e8256147bc9c53c9d37d853d471&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US, Ukraine discussed 'some ideas' on issue of territory, Zelenskiy says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us-ukraine-discussed-some-ideas-issue-territory-zelenskiy-says-2026-01-06/</link><description>KYIV, Jan 6 (Reuters) - U.S. and Ukrainian officials discussed "some ideas" to address the issue of territory during peace talks to end Russia's war on Ukraine , President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Tuesday, describing the matter as the biggest remaining obstacle in the process.

Ukraine is under U.S. pressure to quickly secure a peace deal that could include painful concessions, but has refused to accept Russian demands that it cede land it still controls in eastern Donbas.

"The biggest issue that needs to be worked on is the territorial issue. We discussed some ideas that might help," Zelenskiy said in Paris after a meeting with European allies to hash out security guarantees for Kyiv.

"If the teams are unable to resolve certain issues, the matter can be brought to the leaders' level."

Separately, White House special envoy Steve Witkoff told reporters that land options were discussed during the Paris talks, and that discussions would continue.

The Ukrainian delegation would remain in Paris for further consultations, Zelenskiy added.

Ukraine had said earlier that the U.S. offered the idea of a free economic zone if Kyiv withdraws from parts of the Donetsk region that Ukrainian forces still control.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 20:25:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/AQO6HUXFAZK7FPWJWX7XT2CGF4.jpg?auth=5ca538c25525dbe61c80245023778ee77729a87f1d56322b7ae6c87daa8875d8&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Czech-led ammunition programme for Ukraine can continue, PM says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/czech-led-ammunition-programme-ukraine-can-continue-pm-says-2026-01-06/</link><description>PRAGUE, Jan 6 (Reuters) - The Czech Republic can keep running an initiative sourcing ammunition for Ukraine, but will act as a coordinator and no longer put its own money into it, Prime Minister Andrej Babis said on Tuesday.

Babis' government, in power since December, has been discussing the fate of the ammunition drive after Babis criticised the programme for being non-transparent. He has pledged to scale back aid, saying money was needed at home.

The programme brings together foreign donors, including Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands, with Czech defence officials and arms traders and producers who purchase large-calibre ammunition around the world, delivering it to Ukraine to reduce its disadvantage on the battlefield against Russia.

"The project will continue and the Czech Republic will act as coordinator," Babis said on X after attending a meeting of Ukraine's allies in Paris. "No money from Czech citizens will be invested in the ammunition initiative."

A senior NATO military official voiced cautious optimism in December that the initiative would continue and said it would deliver 1.8 million rounds of artillery ammunition in 2025 - 43% of the total ammunition supplied to Kyiv.

The Czech state security council is due to debate the programme on Wednesday. It was put in place by the previous centre-right government and President Petr Pavel, a former NATO official, has sought to keep it active.

Babis has criticised the programme's lack of transparency, while his pro-Russian coalition allies oppose it.

Babis told reporters in Paris the programme could continue if others finance it, according to CTK news agency. "Of course, it must be transparent and without corruption," he said.

Donors have given around $4.8 billion to pay for ammunition supplies under the programme, former Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky said in December. The Czech contribution has been up to 3 billion crowns ($145.15 million).

Here are key comments made after a meeting in Paris:

"The president strongly stands behind security protocols. Those security protocols are meant to a) deter any attacks, any further attacks in Ukraine, and b) if there are any attacks, they're meant to defend, and they will do both.

"They are as strong as anyone has ever seen. Everyone on this panel on this stage up here has acknowledged that."

"We think we're largely finished with security protocols, which are important so that the people of Ukraine know that when this ends, it ends forever.

"But we also think, critically, that we are very, very close to finishing up as robust a prosperity agreement as any country has ever seen coming out of conflicts like this."

"I think today was a very, very big milestone.”

"This does not mean that we will make peace, but peace would not be possible without the progress that was made here today...

"If Ukraine is going to make a final deal, they have to know that after a deal they are secure, they have, obviously, a robust deterrence, and there's real backstops to make sure that this will not happen again."

The signing of the declaration "paves the way for the legal framework under which British, French and partner forces could operate on Ukrainian soil, securing Ukraine's skies and seas and regenerating Ukraine's armed forces for the future.

"I can say that following the ceasefire, the UK and France will establish military hubs across Ukraine and build protected facilities for weapons and military equipment to support Ukraine's defensive needs.

"These security guarantees are key to ensuring that a peace agreement can never amount to a Ukrainian surrender, and that a peace agreement can never result in a new threat to Ukraine."

"We all want ... peace (in Ukraine) to be fair, lasting and clear-eyed ... we want this peace to have its guarantees."

He later told France 2 TV:

"We’ve expressed our availability to be deployed in this multinational force. These are not combat forces, I want to clarify that for our fellow countrymen. It’s for the day after there’s peace, offering a guarantee of peace and security.

"That’s potentially thousands of men. But it’s not, first of all, for right now. Second of all, it will be part of a plan. And finally it will be part of our existing foreign operations.”

VOLODYMYR ZELENSKIY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT

"It has been determined which countries are ready to take the lead in ensuring security on land, in the air, at sea, and in reconstruction. It has been determined what kind of forces are necessary. It has been determined how the forces will be managed and at what levels of command.

"We had very substantive discussions with the American team regarding monitoring to ensure that there are no violations of the peace. America is ready to work on this.

"We believe that documents on security guarantees are ready – bilateral, Ukraine-US, as well as trilateral documents. We expect that they may be signed in the near future."

"Every partner in the coalition must, under its own domestic procedures, decide in due course what contribution it will make... Germany will continue to contribute politically, financially, and militarily."

"On the type and scope of a German contribution, the government and the German Bundestag must and will decide once the conditions (of the ceasefire) are clarified.”

That could include, for example, after a ceasefire, deploying forces for Ukraine on neighboring NATO territory.

"We basically rule nothing out.”

DONALD TUSK, POLISH PRIME MINISTER

"We all want to take advantage of this moment when Ukraine and all the countries that participated in this meeting today are demonstrating some good will.

"Let's face it, Ukraine is ready for compromise, or at least is seriously and earnestly discussing compromise."

"We must... force or persuade Russia to finally sit down at the table seriously and discuss the terms of peace."</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 20:47:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/YE5METSTRNJABNULKEWK6Y3AZ4.jpg?auth=59c8b2ca5f030528573f9674cf70b1c6a0ff32a74c0a1b74f65b42552030286a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump 'sees that there's money to be made' out of a Ukraine ceasefire, analyst says</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/trump-sees-that-there-s-money-to-be-made-out-of-a-ukraine-ceasefire-analyst-says</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 20:48:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/686c5032-eb3e-11f0-8a12-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260106-211212-211901-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran security forces use tear gas on protesters in Tehran bazaar as death toll rises</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260106-iran-security-forces-use-tear-gas-on-protesters-in-tehran-bazaar-as-death-toll-rises</link><description>Iranian security forces fired tear gas to disperse demonstrators at the Tehran bazaar on Tuesday, as an NGO said more than two dozen people had been killed in a crackdown on the most significant protests to hit the Islamic republic in three years.

The protests were triggered by anger over the rising cost of living, with the Iranian rial losing value again on Tuesday to reach another record low against foreign currencies.

Security forces have now killed at least 27 protesters, including five minors under the age of 18 , the Norway-based NGO Iran Human Rights (IHR) said. Iranian authorities say members of security forces have also been killed, including a policeman who was shot dead on Tuesday.

The protest wave began on December 28 with a shutdown by merchants in the Tehran bazaar, a national economic hub. They have since spread to other areas, especially the west, which is home to Kurdish and Lor minority groups.

It is the most serious protest movement in Islamic republic since the 2022-2023 nationwide rallies sparked by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini , who had been arrested for allegedly violating the strict dress code for women.

Iran's Fars news agency said "sporadic gatherings" took place around the bazaar during an afternoon shutdown, with police dispersing the protest and demonstrators scattering into the alleyways nearby.

In social media footage verified by AFP, protesters at the scene could also be heard shouting slogans including "Pahlavi will return" and "Seyyed Ali will be overthrown" – references to the monarchy ousted by the 1979 Islamic revolution and to supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .

Dozens of people are seen shouting "freedom" and "shameless" in footage posted by IHR and the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRNA).

Security forces then fire tear gas at the protesters, who rush to disperse as acrid smoke rises from the ground.

The official IRNA news agency said "some" people were arrested, without giving numbers.

With protests continuing in other areas for a tenth day, HRNA posted footage of large crowds of people marching in protests through Abdanan in western Iran shouting slogans including "this is the last message, the entire regime is the target".

The demonstrations have yet to reach the scale of the 2022-2023 movement, let alone that of the mass 2009 street protests that followed disputed elections.

But against the background of an economic crisis and on the heels of the 12-day war against Israel in June, they present a new challenge for the leadership under 86-year-old Khamenei, in power since 1989.

The government of President Masoud Pezeshkian has announced modest monthly payments for people to alleviate the economic pain, but the head of the judiciary warned Monday that there would be no leniency for "rioters".

According to official announcements in Iranian media, at least 13 people have been killed since the protests began, including members of the security forces.

But IHR said: "At least 27 protesters have been killed by gunfire or other forms of violence carried out by security forces in eight provinces. Five of those killed have been verified to have been children."

It added that more than 1,000 people had been arrested nationwide.

IHR said security forces killed at least six people in a single incident alone on Saturday when they opened fire on protesters in the Malekshahi district of the western Ilam province.

It also accused authorities of raiding the main hospital in Ilam the day after to detain injured protesters.

Amnesty International said on Tuesday that the "attack" on the hospital "exposes yet again how far the Iranian authorities are willing to go to crush dissent".

Pezeshkian has ordered his interior minister to investigate "thoroughly, comprehensively and expertly" what happened in Ilam province, according to the presidential website.

With tensions continuing in the area, a policeman was shot dead Tuesday after being "directly hit by rioters' bullet" in Malekshahi, the Fars news agency said.

IHR said Iranian authorities also raided a hospital in the Hasanabad district of Tehran Tuesday, firing tear gas.

The Iranian currency meanwhile fell in value to approximately 1.47 million rials to the dollar, according to the informal black market rate and several currency monitoring websites.

On December 28, a previous low in the rial – then at 1.43 million to the dollar – had driven traders into the streets and sparked the protest movement.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 20:48:22 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/f62bec32-eb1d-11f0-b7d0-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/f6ac7cbadb34583479d554d2cad827ebc263e250.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump, advisers discussing options for acquiring Greenland and US military is always an option, White House says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-advisers-discussing-options-acquiring-greenland-us-military-is-always-an-2026-01-06/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 6 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump and his team are discussing options for acquiring Greenland and utilizing the U.S. military in furtherance of the goal is "always an option," the White House said on Tuesday.

The Israeli police said they detained the driver and are investigating. Video of the scene shows a bus driving straight into a crowd of ultra-Orthodox men at the demonstration, attended by thousands. Reuters could not immediately contact the driver while in police custody and police have not released his name.

Israel's Magen David Adom emergency services said the 18-year-old, who had been trapped under the bus, was pronounced dead on the scene.

The debate over mandatory military service, and those who are exempt from it, has long caused tensions within Israel's deeply divided society and has placed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu under increasing political strain over the past year.

Ultra-Orthodox seminary students have long been exempt from mandatory military service. Many Israelis criticize what they see as an unfair burden carried by the majority who serve. The ultra-Orthodox resistance to joining the military is based on their strong sense of religious identity, which religious leaders say they fear risks being weakened by army service.

The issue of military service has been a central point of tension against a backdrop of heightened military activity. Over the past two years, Israel has seen its highest military death toll in decades from conflicts connected to the Gaza Strip, Lebanon, Syria, Yemen and Iran.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 21:22:07 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/IVILOXRKGNODPAYCTGPBP7T7II.jpg?auth=76550f3b20dc664337517e915d9f2bbd151d125f1164495e689d019fef7c9fbb&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Maduro's legal team includes seasoned lawyer who defended WikiLeaks' Assange</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260106-maduro-s-legal-team-includes-seasoned-lawyer-who-defended-wikileaks-assange</link><description>The lawyer defending deposed Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro is a veteran trial attorney who previously represented WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange .

Barry Pollack, 61, appeared beside Maduro during his arraignment in a New York courtroom on Monday on drug trafficking and other charges.

Maduro pleaded not guilty and it will be up to Pollack to try to convince a federal jury to render that verdict when the case eventually goes to trial.

The next hearing has been set for March 17.

A graduate of Georgetown University law school, Pollack is a partner in Harris St. Laurent &amp; Wechsler LLP, a boutique New York law firm, and a former president of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers.

Law firm research guide Chambers USA describes him as a "thorough and deep-thinking lawyer" who "lives, breathes and sleeps trials, and has such a natural way in front of juries."

In 2024, Pollack secured the release of Assange from a British prison after negotiating a plea deal with the US Justice Department that saw the Australian plead guilty to violating the Espionage Act by unlawfully disclosing national defense material.

In another high-profile case, Pollack obtained the acquittal of a former Enron accountant who was facing criminal fraud charges stemming from the collapse of the energy giant.

Another prominent case involved a New York man who was wrongfully convicted of murdering his parents when he was a teenager and spent 17 years in prison.

Pollack managed to get the charges dismissed and secured his freedom.

The pledge came at a summit in Paris of the "coalition of the willing" of mainly European nations to firm up guarantees to reassure Kyiv in the event of a ceasefire with Russia, which invaded its neighbour in 2014 and again at full scale in 2022.

Unlike previous coalition meetings, the summit was also attended by U.S. envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner - President Donald Trump's son-in-law - as well as America's top general in Europe, Alexus Grynkewich, who a day earlier fleshed out details of security guarantees with European army chiefs.

Witkoff, who has led talks with Russia, said after the summit that Trump "strongly stands behind security protocols".

"Those security protocols are meant to ... deter any attacks, any further attacks in Ukraine, and ... if there are any attacks, they're meant to defend, and they will do both. They are as strong as anyone has ever seen," he said at a joint news conference with the French, German, British and Ukrainian leaders.

Kushner said that if Ukrainians were to make a final deal "they have to know that after a deal they are secure, they have, obviously, a robust deterrence, and there's real backstops to make sure that this will not happen again."

A statement by coalition leaders also said that allies will participate in a proposed U.S.-led ceasefire monitoring and verification mechanism. Officials have said this would likely involve drones, sensors and satellites, not U.S. troops.

The statement was not explicitly endorsed by the United States and details of a U.S. role were watered down from an earlier draft, notably removing language that outlined the use of U.S. capabilities to support a multinational force in Ukraine.

But European officials hailed the involvement of the U.S. envoys and their strong comments as evidence Washington stood behind the security framework.

Talks to bring the almost four-year war to an end have accelerated since November. However, Moscow has yet to signal willingness to make concessions after Kyiv pushed for changes to a U.S. proposal that initially backed Russia's main demands.

Moscow has also given no public sign that it would accept a peace deal with the security guarantees envisaged by Ukraine's allies. Russia has previously rejected any NATO members having troops inside Ukraine.

Until recently, much of the allies' focus was on pledges of military aid for Ukraine's forces and possible contributions to an international reassurance force.

But attention has now shifted to legally binding guarantees to come to Kyiv's aid in the event of another attack by Moscow. The possibility of a military response is likely to trigger debate in many European countries, diplomats say.

"These commitments may include the use of military capabilities, intelligence and logistical support, diplomatic initiatives, adoption of additional sanctions," the leaders' statement said, adding that they would now "finalise binding commitments."

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the discussions had been substantive with the U.S. delegation, but suggested more still needed to be done.

European leaders present at the meeting, including French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk and Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni stressed that the statement showed renewed unity between Europe and the United States on helping Ukraine.

Macron and Starmer brushed aside questions about whether they could rely on commitments by Trump, particularly given his renewed claims that the U.S. should take over Greenland, an autonomous part of NATO ally Denmark.

The leaders' statement also pledged a European-led "Multinational Force for Ukraine ... to support the rebuilding of Ukraine's armed forces and support deterrence" with "the proposed support of the US".

France and Britain signed a declaration of intent on the future deployment of multinational forces once a ceasefire is reached.

Macron said that could involve sending thousands of French troops.

"It paves the way for the legal framework under which British, French and partner forces could operate on Ukrainian soil, securing Ukraine's skies and seas and regenerating Ukraine's armed forces for the future," Starmer said.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 21:43:31 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/TAWKSNYWUBPURKFBEVZFYBAMV4.jpg?auth=2b68a410336cd2dace40d9487b7395ad9ace4ef124b574530987ece464d78d65&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Maduro’s immunity claim tests US power to prosecute foreign leaders</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/maduros-immunity-claim-tests-us-power-prosecute-foreign-leaders-2026-01-06/</link><description>Jan 6 (Reuters) - Nicolás Maduro’s first appearance in a U.S. courtroom offered a glimpse of the legal battle ahead over rarely tested questions — chief among them whether he can claim immunity from prosecution.

Maduro, who pleaded not guilty to narco-terrorism and cocaine charges on Monday, defiantly claimed that he remained the president of Venezuela -- setting up a showdown over the legal protections customarily given to heads of state.

His lawyer, Barry Pollack , signaled a second line of attack at the arraignment, promising voluminous litigation challenging what he called Saturday’s "abduction" by the U.S. military of Maduro and his wife.

At the heart of the case is whether Maduro, 63, is entitled to head-of-state immunity under international law -- a doctrine that would protect him from being prosecuted for his alleged role in what the Justice Department calls a decades-long narco-terrorist conspiracy.

The U.S. argues that Maduro has not been Venezuela’s president following a disputed 2018 election — a position that would weigh against granting him head-of-state immunity.

But Venezuela’s attorney general counters that the United States lacks jurisdiction and that Maduro remains immune as the country’s leader.

Caren Morrison, a law professor at Georgia State College of Law and a former federal prosecutor, said immunity could pose a challenge for prosecutors, who claim Maduro was corrupt and used his office in the conspiracy.

Legal experts say the issue may hinge on whether Maduro’s alleged actions were part of his official duties as president. Most believe prosecutors are likely to prevail in the end.

Head-of-state immunity is rarely litigated in criminal cases. Former Panamanian strongman Manuel Noriega unsuccessfully invoked it against charges of drug trafficking and money laundering after his 1989 capture by U.S. forces during the Panama invasion. Unlike Maduro, Noriega never held the formal title of president.

U.S. courts have dismissed civil lawsuits against heads of state recognized by the State Department, including one against Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos in 1975 and another in 2022 against Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman over the killing of U.S.-based journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

But courts can also throw out cases against former leaders and other government officials who can show their actions were part of their official duties. They can, however, be found liable for certain illegal acts.

A civil case involving a former prime minister of Somalia ultimately went to the U.S. Supreme Court, which kicked it back to a lower court that held he was not immune from being held accountable for torture and extrajudicial killings.

In addition to challenging the prosecution on immunity grounds, Maduro's lawyer told the court on Monday his client would challenge what he called the leader's "military abduction," which scholars said may have violated international law.

Noriega made a similar argument after his capture, but a federal appeals court rejected it, citing Supreme Court rulings that forcible abduction does not violate due process or a court’s jurisdiction over a defendant.

Noriega was convicted by a U.S. jury in 1992 and later served sentences in the United States, France and Panama, where he died in 2017.

If Maduro cannot get the indictment dismissed, legal experts say he may still contest the government’s case.

The indictment describes a decades-long drug operation, but few events directly tie Maduro to the alleged narcotics and terrorism conspiracy described by U.S. prosecutors.

"When you look closely at that indictment, there's really not a lot of Maduro in there," said Zachary Margulis-Ohnuma, a defense attorney who represented Hugo Armando Carvajal Barrios, a former Venezuelan official who pleaded guilty to narco-terrorism charges.

To prove conspiracy, prosecutors must show Maduro agreed with others to commit a crime. The indictment is thin on links to terrorist groups, said Richard Broughton, a professor at the University of Detroit Mercy School of Law.

He said the Justice Department may be holding back evidence to protect witnesses.

"Was a particular terrorist organization paid by Maduro and his associates for any kind of protection, for assisting with any kind of shipment?" Broughton said. "That's the kind of stuff that I would want to know."</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 22:22:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5ABW5SM5KNK3NKAL2LRMCWTL7I.jpg?auth=0237006a5b58b72ece503ad88d7db50d7d3cfd1e63d7ddbce928013be935384d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israel, Syria agree to share intelligence, seek military de-escalation after Paris talks</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260106-israel-syria-intelligence-military-de-escalation-paris</link><description>Syria 's new government and Israel will set up a joint group under US supervision to share intelligence and seek military de-escalation on the ground, they announced Tuesday after talks.

The Syrian foreign minister traveled to Paris in his country's first known meeting in months with Israel, which has pounded its historic adversary despite US unease over the pressure on the fragile government.

A joint statement issued by the US State Department after the talks in the French capital said that Syria and Israel were committed to "achieving lasting security and stability arrangements for both countries."

"Both sides have decided to establish a joint fusion mechanism -- a dedicated communication cell -- to facilitate immediate and ongoing coordination on their intelligence sharing, military de-escalation, diplomatic engagement and commercial opportunities under the supervision of the United States," the statement said.

"This mechanism will serve as a platform to address any disputes promptly and work to prevent misunderstandings."

The statement did not say Israel would refrain from further strikes or restore an agreement that was previously in place.

Israel has no diplomatic relations with Syria, which during the half-century of rule by the Assad family publicly championed the Palestinian cause and was the Arab world's key ally of Iran's clerical state, Israel's arch-enemy.

Bashar al-Assad was ousted in a lightning offensive in December 2024 by Ahmed al-Sharaa, a former jihadist, after more than a decade of brutal civil war.

President Donald Trump has met and praised Sharaa , now the interim president and an ally of Saudi Arabia and Turkey, brushing aside Israeli skepticism.

The talks in Paris were mediated by Tom Barrack, a Trump business friend who is ambassador to Turkey and an outspoken advocate of supporting Sharaa.

The United States recently fully removed remaining sanctions on Syria, hoping to give the country a chance to integrate into the global economy.

Since Assad's fall, Israel sent troops into a UN-patrolled buffer zone that had separated Israeli and Syrian forces on the Golan Heights , which Israel captured in the 1967 Six-Day War.

Israel, saying there was a power vacuum, also unilaterally declared void a 1974 disengagement agreement with Syria that had kept in effect a ceasefire.

Sharaa has sought to restore the agreement and avoid wider conflict with Israel, but he has also opposed Israel's insistence on maintaining a demilitarized zone in southern Syria.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office called for economic cooperation with Syria and "regional stability and security."

"It was agreed to continue the dialogue to advance shared objectives and safeguard the security of the Druze minority in Syria," it said.

Israel has cited violence against the Druze, who also have a presence inside Israel, as a reason to intervene in Syria.

Israel in July launched massive air strikes, including hitting the defense ministry in Damascus, leading some analysts to believe it was hoping to degrade military capacities of Syria while it was at a weak point.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 22:50:03 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/8dfb65ac-946a-11f0-a88c-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25232343473198.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump considering military options to acquire Greenland</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/trump-considering-military-options-to-acquire-greenland</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 22:50:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/2ef5839c-eb4c-11f0-aaa6-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260106-230105-230407-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ramaphosa opposes US military operation against deposed Venezuelan leader Nicholas Maduro</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/ramaphosa-opposes-us-military-operation-against-deposed-venezuelan-leader-nicholas-maduro</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 22:50:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/631daef6-eb47-11f0-8290-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/DN191641-A-01-20251230-01.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>What would be the consequences of a Greenland invasion?</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/what-would-be-the-consequences-of-a-greenland-invasion</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 22:50:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/75396050-eb45-11f0-832c-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260106-220814-221001-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Armed police patrol streets of Caracas as CIA reportedly advises to keep Maduro loyalists in power</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/armed-police-patrol-streets-of-caracas-as-cia-reportedly-advises-to-keep-maduro-loyalists-in-power</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 22:50:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/1769be16-eb45-11f0-a505-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260106-220357-220651-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Donald Trump says using US military to secure Greenland is ‘always an option’</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260106-trump-military-options-greenland</link><description>President Donald Trump is exploring how to take control of Greenland and using the US military is "always an option," the White House said Tuesday, further upping tensions with NATO ally Denmark.

Washington's stark warning came despite Greenland and Denmark both calling for a speedy meeting with the United States to clear up "misunderstandings."

The US military intervention in Venezuela has reignited Trump's designs on the autonomous Danish territory in the Arctic, which has untapped rare earth deposits and could be a vital player as melting polar ice opens up new shipping routes.

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said that "acquiring Greenland is a national security priority of the United States," to deter adversaries like Russia and China.

"The president and his team are discussing a range of options to pursue this important foreign policy goal, and of course, utilising the US military is always an option at the commander in chief's disposal," she said in a statement to AFP.

Trump's renewed claims over self-governing Greenland have stoked concerns in Europe that the transatlantic alliance with the United States could be about to fracture.

Earlier, Greenland and Denmark said they had asked to meet US Secretary of State Marco Rubio quickly to discuss the issue.

"It has so far not been possible," Greenland's Foreign Minister Vivian Motzfeldt wrote on social media, "despite the fact that the Greenlandic and Danish governments have requested a meeting at the ministerial level throughout 2025."

Denmark's Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said meeting Rubio should resolve "certain misunderstandings."

Greenland Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen again insisted that the island was not for sale and only Greenlanders should decide its future.

His comments came after Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Poland and Spain joined Denmark in saying that they would defend the "universal principles" of "sovereignty, territorial integrity and the inviolability of borders."

"For this support, I wish to express my deepest gratitude," Nielsen wrote on social media.

Washington already has a military base in Greenland, which is home to some 57,000 people.

Trump hinted on Sunday that a decision on Greenland may come "in about two months," once the situation in Venezuela, where US forces seized President Nicolas Maduro on Saturday, has stabilised.

The European leaders' joint statement called Arctic security "critical" for international and transatlantic security.

Denmark, including Greenland, was part of NATO, it added, urging a collective approach to security in the polar region.

The statement was signed by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk and Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez.

"Greenland belongs to its people. It is for Denmark and Greenland, and them only, to decide on matters concerning Denmark and Greenland," the statement said.

But Macron and Starmer both sought to play down the issue as they attended Ukraine peace talks in Paris alongside Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner.

"I cannot imagine a scenario in which the United States of America would be placed in a position to violate Danish sovereignty," Macron said.

Starmer said he had made his position "clear" in the joint statement -- although he did not restate that position in front of the cameras.

Trump has been floating the idea of annexing Greenland since his first term.

"It's like a broken record," Marc Jacobsen, a specialist in security, politics and diplomacy in the Arctic at the Royal Danish Defence College, told AFP.

Trump has claimed that Denmark cannot ensure the security of Greenland, saying it had bought just one dog sled recently.

But Copenhagen has invested heavily in security, allocating some 90 billion kroner ($14 billion) in the last year.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 23:23:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/432a6f0a-eb2c-11f0-87f5-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-06T131202Z-431987562-RC2U9DA7NHYT-RTRMADP-3-USA-TRUMP-GREENLAND-EUROPE.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Putin hails 'holy mission' of Russian troops at Orthodox Christmas service</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/putin-hails-holy-mission-russian-troops-orthodox-christmas-service-2026-01-06/</link><description>Jan 7 (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin attended an early Wednesday Russian Orthodox Christmas service and hailed his troops' “holy mission” to defend Russia, pairing the ceremony with a holiday address on unity, charity and support for the armed forces.

His appearance came as the war Russia launched with its full scale invasion of Ukraine nears the end of its fourth year, with the Kremlin casting the conflict as a national mission and leaning heavily on patriotic and religious symbolism.

Russian Orthodox Christmas services are held around midnight, drawing congregations for liturgies, though Putin has often attended smaller ceremonies, including inside a Kremlin cathedral.

Video footage showed Putin in a dark suit without a tie among uniformed servicemen, alongside wives and children, as clerics conducted the service at the St George Victory Bearer church near Moscow.

“Russia’s warriors have always, as if at the Lord’s behest, carried out this mission of defending the Fatherland and its people, saving the Motherland and its people,” Putin said at the church after the service.

“At all times in Russia, this is how people have regarded their warriors, as those who, as if at the Lord’s behest, carry out this holy mission."

In a Christmas greeting published earlier on the Kremlin website, Putin praised the Russian Orthodox Church and other Christian denominations for strengthening social unity and safeguarding Russia’s historical and cultural heritage.

He said religious organisations focus on mercy and charity, care for those in need, and support participants and veterans of the war, which Moscow calls a special military operation.

“Such important and in demand work deserves the most sincere recognition,” Putin said.

Putin has attended Christmas services since 2000, often outside Moscow, but since the war began he has more often marked the holiday near the capital, including at his Novo Ogaryovo state residence.</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 23:41:43 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5KDMLWJAQRN2HLKJLMJ376G464.jpg?auth=6f9b1a5ea8977dd9ac36cb41002c16da86939549399e1e32b17cc3e775728e75&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Exclusive: In post-Maduro Venezuela, US eyes security chief as potential target, sources say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/post-maduro-venezuela-us-eyes-security-chief-potential-target-sources-say-2026-01-06/</link><description>WASHINGTON/MEXICO CITY, Jan 6 (Reuters) - The Trump administration has put Venezuela's hardline interior minister on notice that he could be at the top of its target list unless he helps Interim President Delcy Rodriguez meet U.S. demands and keep order following the toppling of Nicolas Maduro, according to three people familiar with the matter.

Diosdado Cabello, who controls security forces accused of widespread human rights abuses, is one of a handful of Maduro loyalists that President Donald Trump has decided to rely on as temporary rulers to maintain stability during a transition period, said one source briefed on the administration’s thinking.

U.S. officials are especially concerned that Cabello, given his record of repression and history of rivalry with Rodriguez, could play the spoiler and are seeking to force his cooperation even as they look for ways to eventually push him out of power and into exile, said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

In the meantime, they have communicated to Cabello via intermediaries that if he is defiant, he could face a similar fate to Maduro, the authoritarian leader captured in a U.S. raid on Saturday and whisked away to New York to face prosecution on “narco-terrorism” charges, or could see his life in danger, the source said.

But taking out Cabello could be risky, possibly motivating pro-government motorcycle groups, known as colectivos, to take to the streets, unleashing the chaos Washington wants to avoid. Their reaction may depend on whether they feel protected by other officials, however.

Also on the list of potential targets is Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino, who, like Cabello, is under a U.S. drug trafficking indictment and has a multimillion-dollar bounty on his head, according to two sources.

“This remains a law enforcement operation, and we are not done yet,” said a U.S. Justice Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity.

U.S. officials see Padrino’s collaboration as crucial for avoiding a power vacuum due to his command of the armed forces. They believe he is less dogmatic than Cabello and more likely to toe the U.S. line while seeking his own safe exit, the source briefed on administration thinking said.

A senior Trump administration official declined to answer Reuters' specific questions but said in a statement: “The President is speaking about exerting maximum leverage with the remaining elements in Venezuela and ensuring they cooperate with the United States by halting illegal migration, stopping drug flows, revitalizing oil infrastructure, and doing what is right for the Venezuelan people.”

Venezuela's communications ministry, which handles all press requests for the government, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

ADMINISTRATION DOUBTS OPPOSITION COULD KEEP PEACE: SOURCE

The administration has decided Venezuela's opposition, led by Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Corina Machado, would be unable to keep the peace at a time when Trump wants enough calm on the ground to jump-start access for U.S. oil companies to Venezuela’s vast oil reserves and to avoid having to put U.S. forces on the ground, the source said.

Trump instead has embraced a classified CIA assessment that concluded Maduro’s top aides would be best situated to run the country on an interim basis, according to sources briefed on the matter.

U.S. officials also decided to work with Maduro’s allies for now out of concern that the country could descend into chaos if they tried to force a democratic handover, and that an excluded member of the inner circle might foment a coup, according to one of the sources.

But the administration wants to eventually see a move toward new elections, U.S. officials have said, though the timeframe remains uncertain.

Trump has offered no clear explanation of how Washington would oversee Venezuela after the biggest U.S. intervention in Latin America since the 1989 invasion of Panama. Critics have condemned it as neocolonialism and a violation of international law.

For now, Washington sees Rodriguez as its best bet to temporarily hold power while it continues developing plans for governing post-Maduro Venezuela, a strategy one source described as “very much still a work in progress.”

Among the U.S. demands for Venezuela's leaders are a demonstration of willingness to open up Venezuela’s oil industry on terms favorable to U.S. companies, a crackdown on the narcotics trade, the expulsion of Cuban security personnel and an end to Venezuelan cooperation with Iran, the source briefed on administration thinking said.

The U.S. wants to see progress toward meeting U.S. objectives in a matter of weeks, the source said.

Beyond threats of further military action, the U.S. could use Rodriguez's finances as leverage. The U.S. has identified those assets, sheltered in Qatar, and could seize them, the source said.

U.S. authorities and their intermediaries are also seeking to co-opt other senior Venezuelan officials and those at levels below them to open the way for a government that will acquiesce to Washington’s interests, the source said.

Trump’s vow to “run” Venezuela appears for now to be more an aspiration to exert outside control - or at least heavy influence - over the OPEC nation without deploying U.S. ground forces, a move that would be unpopular at home.

Trump’s advisers see Rodriguez as the linchpin: a technocrat who they believe is amenable to working with the U.S. on a transition and oil-related issues, according to people briefed on the U.S. strategy.

Though she and Maduro’s other top loyalists have projected a mostly united front, it is unclear whether that will last.

Rodriguez and Cabello have both operated at the heart of the government, legislature and ruling socialist party for years, but have never been considered close allies.

A former military officer, Cabello, seen as the main enforcer of repression within Maduro’s government, exerts influence over the country's military and civilian counterintelligence agencies, which conduct widespread domestic espionage.

“Maduro brought him in to crack heads together in the aftermath of the stolen election,” said Geoff Ramsey, non-resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council think-tank.

The United Nations found both SEBIN, the civilian agency, and DGCIM, the military intelligence service, had committed crimes against humanity as part of a state plan to crush dissent.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 01:46:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7IEG32MJ3JO6XJQUORBFJQAJN4.jpg?auth=373d8e91b20c817c895ba8b8bfa6448d45aaf76e046ee626b0f8861d8181c79e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Brigitte Bardot to be buried on the French Riviera</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/brigitte-bardot-be-buried-french-riviera-2026-01-07/</link><description>SAINT-TROPEZ, France, Jan 7 (Reuters) - Brigitte Bardot, an icon of French cinema who died last month aged 91, will be buried on Wednesday by the sea in the French Riviera resort of Saint-Tropez.

Bardot's funeral will take place at 1000 GMT at Notre-Dame-de-l'Assomption church before she is buried in strict privacy in a cemetery in the glitzy town where she lived for much of her later life behind high walls, surrounded by a menagerie of cats, dogs and horses.

A tribute open to locals and fans will take place at the Pre des Pecheurs area in the old town quarter called La Ponche, the historic centre of the former fishing village.

Bardot shot to international fame in her early 20s in the film "And God Created Woman", her tousled hair and fierce energy radiating a sexual magnetism that defined liberated femininity in 1950s France.

Known affectionately as B.B. by many in France, Bardot's roles made her not just a sex symbol, but a pop culture icon and a touchstone for changing social attitudes. She became the first celebrity to model for a bust of Marianne, the traditional symbol of the French Republic that adorns French town halls.

However, Bardot found celebrity life isolating and a distraction from life's simple pleasures. She made the last of her films in 1973 and left public life, devoting herself to animal welfare.

A tireless crusader for animal rights, Bardot's political sympathies shifted to the far-right National Front. Incendiary remarks on immigration, Islam and homosexuality saw her convicted multiple times for inciting racial hatred.

She publicly endorsed the party's successive leaders, Jean-Marie Le Pen and his daughter Marine Le Pen, whom she once referred to as "the Joan of Arc of the 21st century". Marine Le Pen is expected to attend the funeral.

Aurore Berge, Macron's minister for equality and a defender of animal rights, has been invited and will represent the government.

Bardot told Le Monde in 2018 that she wished to be buried in a quiet corner of her garden. But the Var Prefecture said it never received any request for a private burial, which would have been needed to bury her in her garden.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 01:46:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/FWHVU4YZG5PBBBH5OD6Y7BZPSU.jpg?auth=04c4788cc89ce6bc1073b01fe6d7e17e82f275814b08922186fb7f4296489b68&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia sends submarine to escort tanker the US tried to seize off Venezuela, WSJ reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/russia-sends-submarine-escort-tanker-us-tried-seize-off-venezuela-wsj-reports-2026-01-07/</link><description>Jan 6 (Reuters) - Russia has deployed a submarine and other naval vessels to escort an aging oil tanker, Bella 1, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday , citing a U.S. official.

A short time later, the world watched as the seat of US power descended into chaos, and democracy hung in the balance.

On the fifth anniversary of Jan. 6, 2021 , there is no official event to memorialise what happened that day, when the mob made its way down Pennsylvania Avenue, battled police at the Capitol barricades and stormed inside, as lawmakers fled. The political parties refuse to agree on a shared history of the events, which were broadcast around the globe. And the official plaque honoring the police who defended the Capitol has never been hung.

Instead, the day displayed the divisions that still define Washington, and the country, and the White House itself issued a glossy new report with its own revised history of what happened.

Trump, during a lengthy morning speech to House Republicans away from the Capitol at the rebranded Kennedy Center now carrying his own name, shifted blame for Jan. 6 onto the rioters themselves.

The president said he had intended only for his supporters to go “peacefully and patriotically” to confront Congress as it certified Biden's win. He blamed the media for focusing on other parts of his speech that day.

At the same time, Democrats held their own morning meeting at the Capitol, reconvening members of the House committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, attack for a panel discussion. Recalling the history of the day is important, they said, in order to prevent what Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., warned was the GOP's “Orwellian project of forgetting.”

And the former leader of the militant Proud Boys, Enrique Tarrio, summoned people for a midday march retracing the rioters' steps from the White House to the Capitol, this time to honor Trump supporter Ashli Babbitt and those who died in the Jan. 6 siege and its aftermath. More than 100 people gathered, including Babbitt's mother.

Tarrio and others are putting pressure on the Trump administration to punish officials who investigated and prosecuted the Jan. 6 rioters. He was sentenced to 22 years in prison for seditious conspiracy for orchestrating the Jan. 6 attack, and he is among more than 1,500 defendants who saw their charges dropped when Trump issued a sweeping pardon on his return to the White House last year.

“They should be fired and prosecuted,” Tarrio told the crowd before they arrived at the Capitol, confronted along the way by counter-protesters, and sang the National Anthem.

The White House, in its new report, highlighted the work the president has already done to free those charged and turned the blame on Democrats for certifying Biden’s election victory.

This milestone anniversary carried echoes of the deep differences that erupted that day.

But it unfolds while attention is focused elsewhere, particularly after the US military's stunning capture of Venezuela's president, Nicolás Maduro, and Trump's plans to take over the country and prop up its vast oil industry, a striking new era of American expansionism.

“These people in the administration, they want to lecture the world about democracy when they're undermining the rule of law at home, as we all will be powerfully reminded,” House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York said on the eve of the anniversary.

Jeffries and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer held a candlelight vigil outside the Capitol with lawmakers and family members of police officers to mark the anniversary.

Few Republicans joined in the day’s remembrances, and the Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana, responding to requests for comment about the delay in hanging the plaque honoring the police at the Capitol, as required by law, said in a statement on the eve of the anniversary that the statute “is not implementable," and proposed alternatives “also do not comply with the statute.”

At the morning hearing at the Capitol, lawmakers heard from a range of witnesses and others — including former US Capitol Police officer Winston Pingeon, who said as a kid he always dreamed of being a cop. But on that day, he thought he was going to die in the mayhem on the steps of the Capitol.

"I implore America to not forget what happened," he said, urging the country to find common ground. “I believe the vast majority of Americans have so much more in common than what separates us.”

Also testifying was Pamela Hemphill, a rioter who refused Trump’s pardon, blamed the president for the violence and silenced the room as she apologized to the officer sitting alongside her at the witness table, stifling tears.

“I can’t allow them not be recognized, to be lied about,” Hemphill said about the police who she said also saved her life as she fell and was trampled on by the mob. “Until I can see that plaque get up there, I'm not done.”

Among those testifying was former Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, who was one of two Republicans on the panel that investigated Trump's efforts to overturn Biden's win. The other, Liz Cheney, who lost her own reelection bid to a Trump-backed challenger, did not appear. Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi urged the country to turn away from persistent lies and violence that she said sends the wrong message about democracy.

Republican Rep. Barry Loudermilk of Georgia, who has been tapped by Johnson to lead a new committee to probe other theories about what happened on Jan. 6, rejected Tuesday's session as a “partisan exercise” designed to hurt Trump and his allies.

Many Republicans reject the narrative that Trump sparked the Jan. 6 attack, and Johnson, before he became the House speaker, had led challenges to the 2020 election. He was among some 130 GOP lawmakers voting that day to reject the presidential results from some states.

Instead, they have focused on security lapses at the Capitol — from the time it took for the National Guard to arrive on the scene to the failure of the police canine units to discover the pipe bombs found that day outside Republican and Democratic party headquarters. The FBI arrested a Virginia man suspected of placing the pipe bombs, and he told investigators last month he believed someone needed to speak up for those who believed the 2020 election was stolen, authorities say.

“The Capitol Complex is no more secure today than it was on January 6,” Loudermilk said in a social media post. “My Select Subcommittee remains committed to transparency and accountability and ensuring the security failures that occurred on January 6 and the partisan investigation that followed never happens again.”

In the Senate, one Republican Sen. Thom Tillis displayed a replica plaque behind him and said he would try later this week to push a vote ensuring it complies with the law so it can be displayed as intended. Another Republican, Sen. Tommy Tuberville, objected to a separate resolution condemning the Capitol attack.

At least five people died in the Capitol siege and its aftermath, including Babbitt, who was shot and killed by police while trying to climb through the window of a door near the House chamber, and Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick died later after battling the mob. Several law enforcement personnel died later, some by suicide.

The Justice Department indicted Trump on four counts in a conspiracy to defraud voters with his claims of a rigged election in the run-up to the Jan. 6 attack.

Former Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith told lawmakers last month that the riot at the Capitol “does not happen” without Trump. He ended up abandoning the case once Trump was reelected president, adhering to department guidelines against prosecuting a sitting president.

Trump, who never made it to the Capitol that day as he hunkered down at the White House, was impeached by the House on the sole charge of having incited the insurrection. The Senate acquitted him after top GOP senators said they believed the matter was best left to the courts.

Ahead of the 2024 election, the Supreme Court ruled ex-presidents have broad immunity from prosecution.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 01:47:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/f422f732-eb1d-11f0-9022-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/832ff31832c1592f4ff83972efcb85ffb4bee183.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Magnitude 6.7 earthquake strikes near Baculin, Philippines, USGS says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/magnitude-67-earthquake-strikes-near-baculin-philippines-usgs-says-2026-01-07/</link><description>Jan 7 (Reuters) - A 6.7 magnitude earthquake struck 68 km (42 miles) east of Baculin in the Philippines, at a depth of 10 km (6 miles) on Wednesday, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) said.

There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries from the earthquake.

The list mostly included countries from Africa, Latin America and South Asia. It had a total of 38 countries as of Tuesday. The policy for the newly added nations will go into effect on January 21, the State Department website said.

Venezuela, whose toppled leader Nicolas Maduro was seized by U.S. forces over the weekend and brought to New York, was also included in the list.

"Any citizen or national traveling on a passport issued by one of these countries, who is found otherwise eligible for a B1/B2 visa, must post a bond for $5,000, $10,000, or $15,000," the State Department website said, adding the amount was determined at the time of the visa interview.

Applicants must agree to the terms of the bond through the U.S. Treasury Department's online payment platform, Pay.gov, the State Department said.

A State Department pilot program was launched in August with an initial list of nations.

The U.S. government has said the bonds seek to deter visitors from overstaying their visas intended for tourism or business purposes.

Since taking office last January, Trump, a Republican, has pursued a hard-line immigration policy, involving an aggressive deportation drive , revocations of visas and green cards and screening of social media posts and past speeches of immigrants.

Human rights groups have widely condemned Trump's immigration and travel-related policies, saying they curb due process guarantees and free speech. Trump and his allies say the policies seek to improve domestic security.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 03:39:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/S5UMFJJICNONHEB7B42HMMW5XM.jpg?auth=c6e3d87a45403522d0ef038ce71001a0ed5757da7e3aff2c37dd934a5d17a8a4&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Japan says China's dual-use export ban 'unacceptable', rare earths in crosshairs</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/japan-says-chinas-dual-use-export-ban-unacceptable-rare-earths-crosshairs-2026-01-07/</link><description>TOKYO, Jan 7 (Reuters) - Japan's top government spokesperson said on Wednesday that China's ban on exports of dual-use items to the country was "absolutely unacceptable and deeply regrettable", as a diplomatic dispute between Asia's top two economies ramped up.

Dual-use items are goods, software or technologies that have both civilian and military applications, including certain rare earth elements that are essential for making drones and chips.

Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi touched off the dispute with Beijing late last year by saying a Chinese attack on democratically-governed Taiwan could be deemed an existential threat to Japan. China regards Taiwan as part of its territory, a claim the island rejects.

Beijing has demanded she retract the remarks, which she has not done, prompting a series of countermeasures, the latest of which was Tuesday's ban on exports of dual-use items for military use.

"A measure such as this, targeting only our country, differs significantly from international practice, is absolutely unacceptable and deeply regrettable," Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Minoru Kihara told a daily press conference on Wednesday.

He declined to comment on the possible impact on Japanese industry, saying it remained unclear exactly what items would be targeted.

The reaction from markets to the news was relatively muted though Japanese shares were lower on Wednesday, bucking a global trend that carried U.S. and European benchmarks to record highs.

Japan's broad Topix (.TOPX) , opens new tab gauge of equities slid 0.55%, with a subindex of mining shares leading declines, down 3.2%.

China Daily, a newspaper owned by the ruling Chinese Communist Party, reported on Tuesday that Beijing was considering tightening the license review of rare earth exports to Japan more broadly, citing sources with knowledge of the matter.

Such a move could have sweeping implications for the manufacturing powerhouse, including its key automotives sector, analysts say.

While Japan has sought to diversify its supply of rare earths since China last throttled exports of the minerals in 2010, around 60% of its imports still come from China.

A three-month curb on Chinese exports of rare earths, like that seen during the 2010, could cost Japanese businesses 660 billion yen ($4.21 billion) and shave 0.11% of annual gross domestic product, Nomura Research Institute economist Takahide Kiuchi said in a note on Wednesday.

A year-long ban would knock 0.43% off GDP, he added.

So far, China Customs data has shown no sign of a decline in rare earth exports to Japan, though the data is released with some delay. In November, the latest month for which there was data, exports grew 35% to 305 metric tons, the highest tally last year.

The four videos recorded by the suspect, Claudio Neves Valente, were discovered during a search of the storage locker in Salem, New Hampshire, where he was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot on December 18, ending a six-day manhunt, the prosecutors said.

Valente, 48, a Portuguese national who had attended Brown two decades ago as a doctoral student in physics, slipped into an engineering building on the Ivy League campus on December 13 and opened fire with a handgun, killing two students and injuring nine others, according to police.

Authorities later determined that after fleeing the Providence, Rhode Island, scene of the Brown attack, Valente killed a physics professor from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in a separate shooting at his home outside Boston.

Valente and the slain MIT professor Nuno Loureiro had once been classmates in Lisbon, authorities said after linking the two shooting incidents. But investigators have yet to offer a motive for either case.

The newly released transcripts of the videos, recovered by the FBI from an electronic device and translated from Portuguese to English, mark the first statements attributed to Valente since his death but shed little new light on the Brown tragedy.

According to the U.S. Attorney's Office in Boston, which has overseen the federal investigation of the shootings, Valente "admitted that he had been planning the Brown University shooting for a long time."

In the rambling, disjointed recordings prosecutors say he made while holed up in the storage unit after the shootings, Valente refers to a shell casing injuring one of his eyes and adds that he had "already planned this for a little more" than "six semesters."

Except for repeated mentions of his eye injury, however, Valente speaks elliptically of what has happened, never explicitly talks about firing a gun or killing anyone, and offers no insights into what precipitated the violence ascribed to him.

"I don't know if there are any kind of implications of what I wanted to do or not," he said. "It was all incompetent, but at least something was done. ... The only objective was to [pause] leave more or less on my own terms and -- and it's -- it's already long overdue."

He alludes to vague, unspecified grievances, while expressing no remorse.

"To say that I was extraordinarily satisfied, no, but I also don't regret what I did," he said in one video. "I am not going to apologize, because during my lifetime no one sincerely apologized to me."

Federal prosecutors said that the evidence collected to date continues to rule out any basis for concerns about ongoing public safety threats associated with the shootings, but that investigators' search for a motive would continue.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 03:39:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/2ZVPEDFTJNM2JCB3BXZ3UTN77U.jpg?auth=3a3fb3bbdcb2b029f3c768899fc77982c8e1744270e4b7543b5fc2d5a6c55839&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China takes punitive actions on three Taiwanese for 'independence activities'</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-takes-punitive-actions-three-taiwanese-independence-activities-2026-01-07/</link><description>BEIJING, Jan 7 (Reuters) - China will take punitive actions against three Taiwanese for their involvement in separatist activities related to "Taiwan independence", its Taiwan Affairs Office said on Wednesday.

One of the people was named as an accomplice in separatist activities and will be held accountable for life.

Two of the others, as well as their relatives, will be banned from entering the mainland, Hong Kong and Macau, the office's spokesperson Chen Binhua told reporters at a weekly news briefing.

Chen said the purpose of the actions against a small number of "Taiwan independence diehards" is to "fundamentally safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity", and that it was not aimed at Taiwanese in general.

Many eyes will be on the guests at the service at Notre-Dame de l'Assomption church, burial at a seaside cemetery and a public event in the Riviera resort.

Far-right leader Marine Le Pen has confirmed she will attend, while President Emmanuel Macron will not.

Some showbiz stars can be expected, but her animal rights foundation has stressed it will be a "no frills" event.

"The ceremony will reflect who she was, with the people who knew and loved her. There will no doubt be some surprises, but it will be simple, just as Brigitte wanted," Bruno Jacquelin, spokesman for the Brigitte Bardot Foundation, told AFP.

The funeral will be shown on public screens in Saint-Tropez for well-wishers and fans who are expected to shrug off brisk winter temperatures to pay a final tribute.

The star of "And God Created Woman" died aged 91 on December 28 at her home in Saint-Tropez, where she retreated after giving up her film career in the early 1970s. No cause of death has been given.

Bardot was a divisive figure who alienated many fans with her anti-immigration and racist political views in later life.

Her death sparked mixed reactions. Observers agreed that she was a cinema legend who came to embody the sexual revolution of the 1960s through her acting and daring, unconventional persona.

But having been convicted five times for hate speech, particularly about Muslims, left-wing figures have offered only muted tributes -- and sometimes none at all.

"To be moved by the fate of dolphins but remain indifferent to the deaths of migrants in the Mediterranean -- what level of cynicism is that?" commented Greens lawmaker Sandrine Rousseau about Bardot's views.

Macron's office offered to organise a national homage similar to one staged for fellow New Wave hero Jean-Paul Belmondo in 2021, but the president was snubbed by Bardot's family.

She is survived by her fourth husband, Bernard d'Ormale, a former advisor to Le Pen's late father Jean-Marie, an outspoken far-right leader.

No information has been given about whether Bardot's only child, Nicolas-Jacques Charrier, will attend the funeral.

Charrier, 65, was brought up by his father, film director Jacques Charrier, and lives in Oslo.

Bardot wrote in her memoirs that she had wanted an abortion but was prevented from doing so by her then-husband.

She compared pregnancy to carrying a "tumour that fed on me" and called parenthood a "misery", living most of her life estranged from her son, although they drew closer in the final years of her life.

Bardot's sister Mijanou, 87, who had a brief film career, is not expected to make the trip from her home in Los Angeles.

"My Brigitte, the one I loved more than anything... now knows the greatest of mysteries. She also knows whether our beloved pets are waiting for us on the other side," she wrote on Facebook.

"My God, please let that be the case so she doesn't feel alone, but is with them."

In 2018, Brigitte Bardot had said she wished to be buried in the garden of her home along with her pets to avoid a "crowd of idiots" trampling on the tombs of her parents and grandparents who are in the same cemetery where she will be interred.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 03:40:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/e6c122bc-e3d4-11f0-8d29-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/000-ARP2274742.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Yemen's STC leader al-Zubaidi flees, Saudi-backed coalition says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/yemens-stc-leader-al-zubaidi-flees-saudi-backed-coalition-says-2026-01-07/</link><description>Jan 7 (Reuters) - The leader of Yemen's Southern Transitional Council (STC), Aidarous al-Zubaidi, failed to board a plane set to take him to Riyadh, and fled instead to an unknown destination, the Saudi-backed coalition in the country said on Wednesday.

The remarks came amid efforts to end fighting that erupted last month between the STC, backed by the United Arab Emirates, and Yemen's Saudi-backed internationally recognised government, which has triggered a major feud between the Gulf allies.

Zubaidi was set to travel to Saudi Arabia days after Yemen's government said it had asked Riyadh to host a forum on the southern issue.

In a statement, coalition spokesperson Turki al-Maliki said a flight carrying a large number of senior leaders of the separatist group departed after a delay of more than three hours without Zubaidi, and with no information on his whereabouts.

During the delay "information became available indicating that he had moved large forces," Maliki added, citing "calls for mobilisation and the movement and arming of factions with light and medium weapons".

The feud between the UAE and Saudi Arabia has fractured a coalition originally created to fight the Iran-aligned Houthis, who are still the dominant military force in Yemen.

The Houthis seized the Yemeni capital of Sanaa in 2014 and Gulf countries intervened the following year in support of the internationally recognised government, splitting Yemen into rival zones of control.

The coalition also said it carried out limited pre-emptive airstrikes in Yemen's southern province of al-Dhalea after monitoring the movements of armed forces that had left their camps.

Domestic sources and sources within the STC reported more than 15 strikes in the province, the birthplace of Zubaidi.

Following the developments, the Saudi-backed presidential council stripped Zubaidi of his membership and referred him to the public prosecutor on charges including high treason, state news agency SABA said.

The decision, issued by council chairman Rashad al-Alimi, accused Zubaidi of inciting armed rebellion, attacking constitutional authorities and committing abuses against civilians in southern Yemen.

For years, the STC has been part of Yemen's internationally- recognised government.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 04:41:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/OIYRVKIEZZJX5KG4PJOW4C4XP4.jpg?auth=23ceedb591e6b1bd8591393539af8ed48d58aff3c59083f7e8d7ccd0f2b19eb0&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Taiwan says China's war games sought to undermine global support for the island</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/taiwan-says-chinas-war-games-sought-undermine-global-support-island-2026-01-07/</link><description>TAIPEI, Jan 7 (Reuters) - China's war game exercises around Taiwan last week were part of a campaign to counter growing international support for the island and an attempt to divert attention away from Beijing's economic troubles, Taiwan's top security agency said on Wednesday.

As part of its exercises, called "Justice Mission 2025," China fired dozens of rockets towards Taiwan and deployed a large number of warships and aircraft near the island. That caused dozens of domestic flights in Taiwan to be cancelled and drew concern from allies in the region and the West.

"The Taiwan-focused drills carried clear political intent: to push back in the international arena against democratic partners' support for Taiwan," the National Security Bureau said in a report to Parliament. A copy of the report was reviewed by Reuters.

The drills, China's most extensive war games to date by coverage area, were also meant to "redirect public anger over economic setbacks and social disorder at home into nationalist sentiment framed as 'resisting external interference,'" the report said.

The report said China has been ramping up a "hybrid" campaign to pressure Taiwan militarily and economically, drawing resistance from democratic partners in the U.S. and Europe.

The report also pointed to a comment from Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi late last year. She said a Chinese attack on democratically governed Taiwan could be deemed an existential threat to Japan. The report said the comment underscored how security in the Taiwan Strait was viewed as directly linked to stability in the Indo-Pacific and international order.

China's Taiwan Affairs Office did not respond to a request for comment on the report.

Speaking at a regular press conference on Wednesday, the office said recent military drills around Taiwan, including those held last week, were intended to "staunchly defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity."

The exercises were also aimed at "upholding the shared interests of compatriots on both sides of the strait and the fundamental interests of the Chinese nation," it said.

Beijing claims Taiwan as its own territory and has not ruled out the use of force to bring the island under its control. Taipei strongly objects to China's sovereignty claims and says only Taiwan's people can decide their future.

The report said that during the drills, China used state media, artificial intelligence-generated content and online "troll armies" to amplify its narratives, cast doubt on the Taiwanese military's capabilities and undermine trust in President Lai Ching-te and the U.S.

Some 19,000 "controversial messages" were pushed out across several social media platforms by 799 accounts in the span of five days, the report said.

On the first and second day of the drills, Taiwan's government received more than two million cyberattacks, the report said. It named the People's Liberation Army‑linked hacking groups APT24 and BlackTech as being among the most active participants.

China's armed forces have been synchronising hacking campaigns with military drills around Taiwan to "disrupt the island's cybersecurity environment and unsettle public morale," the report said.

China has routinely denied being involved in hacking attacks.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 04:41:19 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BRTD6MDNLVI5VFIPHLBMPXWU2I.jpg?auth=9f9e8adca0e29457de1c2ec487f4c26731b66ba5c30ee3516cc85b4629247074&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China's top diplomat heads to key strategic points in Africa</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-top-diplomat-heads-key-strategic-points-africa-2026-01-07/</link><description>BEIJING, Jan 7 (Reuters) - China's top diplomat began his annual New Year tour of Africa on Wednesday, with a focus on the strategically important east, as the world's No.2 economy seeks to reinforce its influence on the continent.

Foreign Minister Wang Yi will travel to Ethiopia, Somalia, Tanzania and Lesotho on this year's trip.

Wang's visit to Somalia - the first by a Chinese foreign minister since the 1980s - is likely to provide Mogadishu with a diplomatic boost after Israel last month became the first country to formally recognise the breakaway Republic of Somaliland , a northern region that declared itself independent in 1991.

Beijing, which reiterated its support for Somalia after the Israeli announcement, is keen to buttress its influence around the Gulf of Aden, the entry to the Red Sea and a crucial corridor for Chinese trade heading through the Suez Canal to European markets.

Further south, Tanzania is central to Beijing's push to secure access to Africa's vast copper deposits. Chinese firms are refurbishing the Tazara Railway that runs through the country into Zambia. Li Qiang made a landmark trip to Zambia in November, the first visit by a Chinese premier in 28 years.

The railway is widely seen as a counterweight to the U.S. and European Union-backed Lobito Corridor, which connects Zambia to Atlantic ports via Angola and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

By visiting the southern African kingdom of Lesotho, Wang aims to highlight Beijing's push to position itself as a champion of free trade. Last year, China offered tariff-free market access to its $19 trillion economy for the world's poorest nations, fulfilling a pledge by Chinese President Xi Jinping at the 2024 China-Africa Cooperation summit in Beijing.

Lesotho, one of the world's poorest nations with a gross domestic product of just over $2 billion, was among the countries hardest hit by U.S. President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs last year, facing duties of up to 50% on its exports to the United States.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 04:41:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/UVWYBCCHN5POZG7A7ITFVPFJC4.jpg?auth=501708b890a4731f88739f846a3a51cf6a57839364163c905a44a03fa37132b8&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Live: Trump announces plan to refine, sell up to 50 million barrels of Venezuelan oil</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260107-live-trump-announces-plan-to-refine-sell-up-to-50-million-barrels-of-venezuelan-oil</link><description>The names, ranks and ages of the 32 Cuban military personnel killed during the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro by US forces were published Tuesday by the Cuban government, which announced two days of mourning.

Among the deceased are colonels, lieutenants, majors and captains, as well as some reserve soldiers, ranging in age from 26 to 60.

The uniformed personnel belonged to the Revolutionary Armed Forces and the Ministry of the Interior, Cuba's two main security agencies. The publication did not specify their missions or exactly how they died.

Venezuela 's interim leader Delcy Rodriguez insisted Tuesday no foreign power was governing her country, even as US President Donald Trump announced Caracas will be swiftly turning over millions of barrels of oil to the United States.

Speaking three days after US special forces snatched Maduro and his wife in a stunning raid in Caracas, Rodriguez said: "The government of Venezuela is in charge in our country, and no-one else."

"There is no foreign agent governing Venezuela ."

Oil extended losses Wednesday after Donald Trump said Venezuela would turn over millions of barrels to the United States, while equities wobbled after a record-breaking start to the year.

Crude has seen wild swings since the US president ordered the toppling Saturday of Nicolas Maduro, his counterpart in Caracas, and said Washington would run the country while demanding "total access" to its key resource.

But it sank as much as two percent Tuesday and around one percent Wednesday after Trump announced the latest development.

President Donald Trump on Tuesday unveiled a plan to refine and sell up to 50 million barrels of Venezuelan oil that had been stuck ⁠in Venezuela under US blockade, in a further sign that Washington is coordinating with the Venezuelan government since capturing President Nicolas Maduro.

Trump on social media announced that Venezuela would sell 30 million to 50 million barrels of sanctioned oil that would be shipped directly to the United States under a plan to be executed immediately by Energy Secretary Chris Wright.

"This Oil will be sold at its Market Price, and that money will be controlled by me, as President of the United States of America, to ensure it is used to benefit the people of Venezuela and the United States!" Trump said. Based on recent prices for Venezuelan oil, the deal could be worth up to $1.9 billion.

US officials have yet to outline a legal framework for seizing Venezuelan oil, though the US ‍has accused Venezuelan tankers of breaking US sanctions to ship Iranian and Venezuelan oil.

US officials have yet to outline a legal framework for seizing Venezuelan oil, though the U.S. ‍has accused Venezuelan tankers of breaking US sanctions to ship Iranian and Venezuelan oil.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 04:42:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/34b96fc0-eb13-11f0-9a56-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/063-2254924612.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'Donroe Doctrine': Latin American resources 'belong to US, to hell with anyone who gets in our way'</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/donroe-doctrine-latin-american-resources-belong-to-us-to-hell-with-anyone-who-gets-in-our-way</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 04:42:32 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/165fa822-eb55-11f0-b389-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260106-151100-151947-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran executes man accused of spying for Israel</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-executes-man-accused-spying-israel-snn-says-2026-01-07/</link><description>DUBAI, Jan 7 (Reuters) - Iran executed a man accused of spying for Israel, the Iranian judiciary's media outlet Mizan reported on Wednesday, naming the defendant as Ali Ardestani.

Entangled in a decades-long shadow war with Israel, Iran has executed many people it has accused of having links with Israel's intelligence service and facilitating its operations in the country.

"The death sentence of Ali Ardestani for the crime of espionage in favour of the Mossad intelligence service by providing the country's sensitive information was carried out after approval by the Supreme Court and through legal procedures," Mizan said.

Executions of Iranians convicted of spying for Israel have significantly increased this year, following a direct confrontation between the two regional enemies in June, when Israeli and U.S. forces struck Iran's nuclear facilities.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 05:26:19 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>South Korea's Lee says he asked Xi to play a mediating role on North Korea</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/south-koreas-lee-says-he-asked-xi-play-mediating-role-north-korea-2026-01-07/</link><description>SEOUL, Jan 7 (Reuters) - South Korean President Lee Jae Myung said on Wednesday that much progress had been made in restoring trust with Beijing, and that he had asked Chinese President Xi Jinping to play a role in mediating Seoul's efforts to engage North Korea.

Lee, who held talks with Xi this week, said the Chinese leader had noted patience was needed when they discussed nuclear-armed North Korea. Lee was speaking to South Korean media in Shanghai with his remarks relayed live on television.

The South Korean president said he laid out the efforts - so far without success - that Seoul had been making to engage North Korea in dialogue and improve relations, and asked Xi to play a role to mediate for peace on the Korean peninsula.

"President Xi acknowledged our efforts so far and said patience is needed," Lee said.

Lee has been on a state visit to China and his meeting with Xi was their second in less than three months.

Lee has sought to open a "new phase" in ties with China, after several frosty years and with South Korea's popular cultural exports being shut out of the Chinese market due to a dispute over a U.S. missile defence system deployment in South Korea in 2017.

"President Xi said 'talk is easy, but action is not so easy,'" Lee said, as he talked about how building trust and respect between countries takes work.

Diplomatic relations are inherently complex in balancing each other's key national interests, Lee said he had told Xi, adding he hoped recent tension between Tokyo and Beijing could be resolved.

Lee said South Korea considered its ties with Japan as important as its relations with China.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 05:50:27 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/L6SOYRLHJBN77N2G6CZ6OIAHIE.jpg?auth=795a8a20b2788bac9ee45ff15d22f4158bb8b66c24e1b94f584a66e60e85cef2&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Yemen's separatist leader al-Zubaidi flees ahead of talks, Saudi-led coalition says</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260107-yemen-separatist-leader-al-zubaidi-flees-ahead-talks-saudi-led-coalition</link><description>Saudi Arabia on Wednesday said the leader of a separatist movement in Yemen “fled” to an unknown location after saying he would travel to the kingdom for negotiations over the future of southern Yemen .

A statement from Maj. Gen, Turki al-Malki, a spokesperson for a Saudi-led coalition in Yemen, represents the latest twist in tensions between it and the Southern Transitional Council, backed by the United Arab Emirates .

Al-Malik said the council's leader, Aidarous al-Zubaidi, had been due to take a flight to Saudi Arabia. But while other council officials took the flight, he said al-Zubaidi did not.

“The legitimate government and the coalition received intelligence indicating that al-Zubaidi had moved a large force – including armored vehicles, combat vehicles, heavy and light weapons, and ammunition,” al-Malki said. Al-Zubaidi “fled to an unknown location".

There was no immediate comment from the council, known by the acronym STC.

Saudi Arabia in recent weeks has bombed STC positions and struck what is said was a shipment of Emirati weapons. After Saudi pressure and an ultimatum from anti-Houthi forces to withdraw from Yemen, the UAE said Saturday it had withdrawn its forces .

The tensions in Yemen have further strained ties between Saudi Arabia and the UAE, neighbors on the Arabian Peninsula that have competed over economic issues and regional politics, particularly in the Red Sea area.

Ostensibly, Saudi Arabia and the UAE have shared the coalition’s professed goal of fighting against the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels, who have held Yemen's capital, Sanaa, since 2014.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 06:35:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/4398ede4-eb8c-11f0-9869-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/000-34FP9U6.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Europe braces for further travel chaos as deadly cold snap brings more snow</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260107-europe-braces-for-further-travel-chaos-as-deadly-cold-snap-brings-more-snow</link><description>More flights will be cancelled, trains will run late and roads will be blocked by snow across Europe in coming days as a cold snap is forecast to worsen , bringing even more heavy snowfall after several days of travel disruption .

Authorities in the Netherlands told people to plan to stay at home if at all possible on Wednesday, with a fresh blizzard expected overnight.

French Transportation Minister Philippe Tabarot said on Tuesday that airlines had already been ordered to cancel at least 40% of flights at Paris 's main Charles de Gaulle airport, and a quarter of flights at smaller Orly.

Public transportation in the Paris region will also be disrupted by the snow, he warned.

As snowfalls are expected again, Dutch airline KLM said it had protectively cancelled 600 flights on Wednesday to avoid last-minute cancellations that could leave travellers stranded at Schiphol airport, one of Europe's main hubs.

KLM had already cancelled 400 flights at Schiphol on Tuesday and told travellers whose flights had been called off to stay away from the airport to prevent overcrowding.

"We haven't experienced such extreme weather conditions in years," spokesperson Anoesjka Aspeslagh said.

Stranded at Schiphol, Simiao Sun said she feared she would spend her 40th birthday in transit. She had been told she would have to wait three days for a rescheduled flight to Britain where she lives.

"My child would miss school and we would both miss work, so I'm queuing here ... hoping to get a slightly earlier flight."

KLM said it was offering alternative flights where possible and doing everything to help travellers, but was "overwhelmed with inquiries".

On top of that, all domestic rail services in the Netherlands were suspended early on Tuesday after an IT outage hit the rail network.

Trains began running in parts of the country after 0900 GMT, but problems persisted around Amsterdam, with high-speed Eurostar services from Amsterdam to Paris either cancelled or late.

Roads in France were gradually clearing on Tuesday after snow caused severe accidents all over the country, killing at least five people, according to BFMTV news station.

Traffic in the Paris area hit a record 1,000 kilometres of jams on Monday evening.

In Germany, temperatures fell well below minus 10 degrees Celsius (14 degrees Fahrenheit) in the south and east early on Tuesday. Much of the country was covered in snow.

In Britain, the Meteorological Office said winter weather hazards could continue throughout the week for most of the country. Temperatures overnight to Tuesday had fallen as low as -12.5 degrees Celsius in Marham, Norfolk, in eastern England, marking the coldest night of the winter so far.

Heavy snow and rain have also caused havoc across the Western Balkans, closing roads, cutting power and causing rivers to flood. A woman died in the Bosnian capital Sarajevo on Monday after a tree overburdened with wet snow fell on her.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 07:27:07 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/b7e9a240-eb93-11f0-a08b-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26006382410239.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Pakistan eyes defence pact with Bangladesh, sale of JF-17 jets</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/pakistan-eyes-defence-pact-with-bangladesh-sale-jf-17-jets-2026-01-07/</link><description>ISLAMABAD, Jan 7 (Reuters) - The air force chiefs of Pakistan and Bangladesh held talks on a potential pact covering the sale of JF-17 Thunder fighter jets to Dhaka, Pakistan's military said, as Islamabad widens its arms supply ambitions and beefs up ties with Bangladesh.

The talks in Islamabad come as Pakistan looks to capitalise on the success of its air force in the conflict with arch-foe India in May last year, the worst fighting in nearly three decades between the nuclear-armed neighbours.

Pakistan's Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu and Bangladesh counterpart Hasan Mahmood Khan had detailed talks on procurement of the JF-17 Thunder, a multi-role combat aircraft jointly developed with China, the military's press wing said.

Pakistan has also assured Bangladesh of the "fast-tracked delivery of Super Mushshak trainer aircraft, along with a complete training and long-term support ecosystem," it added in Tuesday's statement.

The talks signal improving ties as the South Asian nations have grown closer since massive protests in August 2024 drove then-Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to flee to India, shattering Dhaka's relationship with New Delhi.

"The visit underscored the strong historical ties between Pakistan and Bangladesh and reflected a shared resolve to deepen defence cooperation and build a long-term strategic partnership," the military said.

In the wake of Hasina's ouster, Islamabad and Dhaka have resumed direct trade for the first time since the 1971 war that brought independence for Bangladesh, while their military officials have held several meetings.

Under an interim administration led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, Bangladesh is set for general elections on February 12 that could lead to a significant government role for a once-banned Bangladeshi Islamist party with links to Pakistan.

The JF-17s have become the cornerstone of the Pakistani military's weapons development program, figuring in a deal with Azerbaijan and a $4-billion weapons pact with the Libyan National Army .

On Tuesday, Pakistan's defence minister said the success of its weapons industry could transform the country's economic outlook.

"Our aircraft have been tested, and we are receiving so many orders that Pakistan may not need the International Monetary Fund in six months," Khawaja Asif told broadcaster Geo News.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 07:49:07 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/2EVF6DDCVZMDFFRPFXX67V7EMM.jpg?auth=46051937a6db77d02eedb4d6dd985a0c353ef66cc02ed8bcfdae094df99b3eb7&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Intense heatwave grips Australia's southern states, fans bushfires</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/intense-heatwave-grips-australias-southern-states-fans-bushfires-2026-01-07/</link><description>SYDNEY, Jan 7 (Reuters) - Australia’s south sweltered through a brutal heatwave on Wednesday that delivered temperatures above 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) in some cities, triggering health warnings, straining power grids and causing bushfires to flare.

Meteorologists said the conditions were at their worst in six years, when catastrophic bushfires destroyed wide swathes of southeastern Australia, killing 33 people, in what became known as the Black Summer.

The nation's weather bureau issued severe or extreme heat warnings for the states of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania. It also warned of extreme fire danger across Victoria and South Australia.

"These elevated fire dangers are being driven by a very hot air mass that extends all the way from Western Australia with maximum temperatures in excess of 45 degrees," said Senior Meteorologist Sarah Scully.

In Victoria, where temperatures reached up to 44 C, and 41 C in the state capital Melbourne, authorities advised residents to stay indoors and keep hydrated.

Victoria's Emergency Management Commissioner Tim Wiebusch said firefighters were battling several fires across the state and conditions would worsen on Friday.

"We already have a statewide advice warning message out for severe to extreme intensity heatwave, and are now seeing those conditions kick in across the state," he said.

"We are particularly wanting Victorians to make sure they are alert to their conditions, make sure you are staying in cool places."

Temperatures also soared to 31 C in Sydney, 32 C in Perth and 43 C in Adelaide.

Some public spaces like libraries extended their opening hours to help residents stay cool, while others like the Monarto Safari Park were forced to shut for the day. More than 2,000 homes lost power in Adelaide.

"I think psychologically you have to keep calm in the heat and not panic. It’s only two or three days. And then it goes down again," Adelaide resident Valdine Tuckwell told national broadcaster ABC.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 08:32:02 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>France: working with allies on plan should US make move on Greenland</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/france-working-with-allies-plan-should-us-make-move-greenland-2026-01-07/</link><description>PARIS, Jan 7 (Reuters) - France is working with partners on a plan over how to respond should the United States act on its threat to take over Greenland, Foreign Affairs Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said on Wednesday.

Italy and France last month dashed hopes for a December deal , saying they were not ready to support it until farmers' fears of an influx of cheap commodities from Mercosur , including beef and sugar, were resolved.

However, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni welcomed a letter sent by the Commission on Tuesday proposing to accelerate 45 billion euros of support for farmers, describing it as a "positive and significant step forward".

Italian Agriculture Minister Francesco Lollobrigida said the European Union was now proposing to increase spending on Italian agriculture in 2028-2034 rather than to cut it.

An EU source subsequently said Italy would now vote in favour of the Mercosur trade deal at a meeting on Friday.

The executive Commission, backed by countries such as Germany and Spain, is seeking to garner the broad majority of 15 EU members representing 65% of the EU population required to authorise the EU signature, possibly as early as January 12.

They say the accord, which has been 25 years in the making and would be the EU's largest in terms of tariff reductions, is vital to boosting exports hit by US import taxes and to reduce reliance on China by securing access to critical minerals.

With Poland and Hungary opposed to the deal and France still critical, Italy's stance is a key determinant of whether the deal can be signed.

The Commission has held discussions with member states over the past two weeks and the bloc is on track to sign the agreement soon, a spokesperson for the executive said.

The EU executive has invited all 27 EU agriculture ministers to a meeting in Brussels on Wednesday.

European commissioners for agriculture, trade and health are expected to give reassurances on future funding for farmers under the bloc's Common Agricultural Policy , including a 6.3 billion euro ($7.4 billion) crisis fund in the next EU budget.

The Commission's move to merge regional cohesion funds and CAP money in the next seven-year budget has alarmed farming nations.

The Commission will also review import controls, including permissible maximum levels of pesticide residues, two EU diplomats said.

"It is a critical moment to discuss demands from farmers," one of the diplomats said.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 08:32:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/20ed695a-eb9b-11f0-bcf3-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25352512604845-1.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Following US military operation in Venezuela, will 190 countries 'respect any of these rules now'?</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/following-us-military-operation-in-venezuela-will-190-countries-respect-any-of-these-rules-now</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 08:32:31 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/7e202682-eb85-11f0-9411-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260105-130110-130848-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>France working with allies on plan should US move on Greenland</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/france-working-with-allies-plan-should-us-move-greenland-2026-01-07/</link><description>PARIS, Jan 7 (Reuters) - France is working with partners on a plan over how to respond should the United States act on its threat to take over Greenland , a minister said on Wednesday, as Europe sought to address U.S. President Donald Trump's ambitions in the region.

A U.S. military seizure of Greenland from a longtime ally, Denmark, would send shock waves through the NATO alliance and deepen the divide between Trump and European leaders.

Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said the subject would be raised at a meeting with the foreign ministers of Germany and Poland later in the day.

"We want to take action, but we want to do so together with our European partners," he said on France Inter radio.

Leaders from major European powers and Canada have rallied behind Greenland this week, saying the Arctic island belongs to its people, following a renewed threat by Trump to take over the territory.

Trump has in recent days repeated that he wants to gain control of Greenland, an idea first voiced in 2019 during his first presidency. He has argued it is key for the U.S. military and that Denmark has not done enough to protect it.

The White House said on Tuesday that Trump was discussing options for acquiring Greenland, including potential use of the U.S. military, in a revival of his ambition to control the strategic island, despite European objections.

Barrot suggested a U.S. military operation had been ruled out by a top U.S. official.

"I myself was on the phone yesterday with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio (...) who confirmed that this was not the approach taken ... he ruled out the possibility of an invasion (of Greenland)," he said.

A U.S. military operation over the weekend that seized the leader of Venezuela had already rekindled concerns that Greenland might face a similar scenario. It has repeatedly said it does not want to be part of the United States.

The world's largest island but with a population of just 57,000 people, Greenland is not an independent member of NATO but is covered by Denmark's membership of the Western alliance.

The island is strategically located between Europe and North America, making it a critical site for the U.S. ballistic missile defence system for decades. Its mineral wealth also aligns with Washington's ambition to reduce reliance on China.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 09:28:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/X6L53PGKUFJKLJJ6W4SUG5UXHM.jpg?auth=1c1461893a2157d0dbec37a4e3e59a11b7b2b9aefaab4b599e5cbbcbd28c46dc&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Re-elected president of Central African Republic invites Russia's Putin to visit, TASS says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/re-elected-president-central-african-republic-invites-russias-putin-visit-tass-2026-01-07/</link><description>MOSCOW, Jan 7 (Reuters) - The newly re-elected president of the Central African Republic, Faustin-Archange Touadera, has invited Russian President Vladimir Putin to visit his country, Russian state news agency TASS reported on Wednesday.

Moscow has become a key ally of Touadera in recent years, with CAR in 2018 becoming the first West and Central African nation to bring in Russia's Wagner mercenaries as the chronically unstable nation sought to fend off several rebel groups.

Touadera, in power since 2016, won a third term in office, provisional results showed this week, securing an outright majority in the presidential election held on December 28.

In a video interview with TASS, Touadera called Putin a "great leader" and said the Kremlin chief was "very attentive" to relations with Bangui.

Commenting on preliminary election results showing Touadera in the lead, the Wagner Group wrote on its Telegram channel: "We have no doubt that the chosen course of maintaining order and peace will prevail."

Touadera's victory is likely to further Russia's interests in the country, including in gold and diamond mining.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 09:28:58 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/RDEGJAP6RZPQDPYDKQTSQ3LQLI.jpg?auth=2a81803ebbe4c111a915bf42ce1a8f114040f6eaa72ed9611a1d505c1ae4d10a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Cyprus assumes EU presidency with Ukraine's Zelenskiy attending</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/cyprus-assumes-eu-presidency-with-ukraines-zelenskiy-attending-2026-01-07/</link><description>NICOSIA, Jan 7 - Cyprus assumed the rotating presidency of the European Union on Wednesday, marking the start of its six-month term with a meeting in Nicosia attended by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Antonio Costa.

It is the second time the east Mediterranean island has held the EU presidency mantle. A ceremony in Nicosia later Wednesday would include representatives of countries from the Middle East, including Lebanese President Joseph Aoun, underscoring Cyprus's aspiration of being a bridge between Europe and the region.

Noting "constantly numerous" challenges, Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides said: "As the Cyprus Presidency we will respond to this institutional obligation to the European Union, with a single goal: To strengthen, because this is the need shown by international developments, the autonomy of the European Union, to push European integration even further."

Christodoulides was due to meet Zelenskiy in private on Wednesday, and later hold expanded talks with Zelenskiy, Von der Leyen and Costa. Zelenskiy's presence was seen as a political sign of the continued EU backing for Kyiv as its war with Russia enters a fourth year.

The disruption had been predicted late Tuesday, with Transport Minister Philippe Tabarot telling CNews television he was "hoping the situation returns to normal this afternoon".

All public bus services in Paris and the surrounding suburbs were also suspended due to icy roads, though the vast majority of metro and suburban rail systems were working, transport officials said.

The Météo France weather service said 38 of the country's 96 mainland departments were on alert for heavy snow and black ice, with three to seven centimetres (around one to three inches) of snow already accumulated.

It said the cold snap was of "rare intensity for the season", and authorities had already warned people in the Paris region to avoid unnecessary travel and work at home if possible on Wednesday.

"The Islamic Republic of Iran considers the escalation of hostile rhetoric against the Iranian nation a threat and will not tolerate its continuation without responding," General Amir Hatami said, according to the Fars news agency.

Hatami, commander of the Iranian army but not Iran's most senior officer, warned that "if the enemy makes a mistake" Iran's response would be more robust than during last June's 12-day war with Israel.

In recent days, US President Donald Trump has threatened to intervene in Iran if demonstrators were killed, while Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu has expressed support for the protests.

On December 28 merchants in Tehran staged a protest against soaring prices and the collapse of the rial, triggering a wave of similar actions in several cities, some of them deadly.

The demonstrations have yet to reach the scale of a 2022 to 2023 movement, let alone that of the mass 2009 street protests that followed disputed elections.

But the economic protests have attracted international attention, including from the leaders of the Islamic republic's international foes.

"We're watching it very closely. If they start killing people like they have in the past, I think they're going to get hit very hard by the United States," Trump told reporters on Sunday.

Netanyahu, meanwhile, told Israel's cabinet: "We stand in solidarity with the struggle of the Iranian people and with their aspirations for freedom, liberty and justice."

On Monday, the Iranian foreign ministry accused Trump and Netanyahu of inciting violence and trying to undermine Iran's national unity.

The war in June began with an unprecedented Israeli attack on Iranian military and nuclear facilities.

The United States briefly took part in the strikes, hitting three major Iranian nuclear sites.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 09:52:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/a51911a8-eba4-11f0-b7b9-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26004478007275.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Fire put out at oil depot in Russia's Belgorod after Ukrainian drone attack, state TV says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/fire-put-out-oil-depot-russias-belgorod-after-ukrainian-drone-attack-state-tv-2026-01-07/</link><description>MOSCOW, Jan 7 (Reuters) - Firefighters have put out a blaze that broke out at an oil depot in Russia's southern Belgorod region following an overnight Ukrainian drone attack, the Vesti state TV channel reported on Wednesday, citing the regional governor.

Belgorod Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said late on Tuesday that several oil storage tanks were on fire at the oil depot in the Starooskolsky district, about 44 miles (70 km) from the border with Ukraine.

The raid follows waves of large-scale detentions of unregistered Christians in recent months, as Beijing steps up scrutiny of churches that operate outside the control of the ruling Communist Party.

Beijing has long required religious groups to be registered. Under President Xi Jinping, the government has tightened control of all religions and in recent years increased crackdowns and regulations targeting unregistered organisations, making it even harder for them to raise funds, preach online and hold in-person meetings.

The detentions of the members of the Early Rain Covenant Church, a large unofficial "house church" based in the southwestern city of Chengdu, took place on Tuesday, according to the church statement and a separate statement on the detentions from advocacy group Human Rights Watch.

Those detained included current church leader Li Yingqiang, whose home was raided by police, according to the church and NGO statements.

Reuters could not determine on what grounds the Early Rain Covenant Church members were detained or whether they had been charged. Efforts to contact the church through social media were unsuccessful.

Chengdu public security bureau did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

"The government should immediately free those detained and let them freely practice their religion," said Yalkun Uluyol, Human Rights Watch China researcher.

China has more than 44 million Christians registered with state-approved churches, the majority Protestant, data shows. But tens of millions more are estimated to be part of illegal "house churches" whose congregations meet in secret.

More than 100 Christians belonging to such churches were detained in a sweeping police raid near the eastern city of Wenzhou in December, according to Human Rights in China, a New York-based NGO.

Nearly 30 pastors and staff of Zion Church, another major underground church, were detained by police in a nationwide operation in October, the biggest such crackdown since 2018.

Established in 2008, the Early Rain Covenant Church was raided by police in 2018, when founder Wang Yi and more than 100 pastors were detained. Wang was later sentenced to nine years in prison on subversion charges. NGOs estimate Early Rain has more than 500 members, making it one of China's larger "house churches".</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 10:27:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China detains six underground church members in latest crackdown, church tells members</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-detains-six-underground-church-members-latest-crackdown-church-tells-2026-01-07/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 10:27:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>US-Venezuela oil deal angers China, pushes prices down</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/us-venezuela-oil-deal-angers-china-pushes-prices-down-2026-01-07/</link><description>HOUSTON/BEIJING, Jan 7 (Reuters) - Global oil prices fell on Wednesday and China denounced the U.S. as a bully after President Donald Trump's administration said it had persuaded Venezuela to divert supplies from Beijing and import up to $2 billion worth of embargoed crude.

The deal was in line with Trump's stated aim of controlling the South American OPEC member's vast oil reserves after deposing its leader Nicolas Maduro whom it had long cast as a drug-trafficking dictator in league with Washington's foes.

Maduro's Socialist Party allies remain in power in Venezuela, where interim President Delcy Rodriguez is treading a fine line between denouncing his "kidnapping" and kick-starting cooperation with the U.S. under explicit threats from Trump.

TRUMP: OIL MONEY 'WILL BE CONTROLLED BY ME'

He said the U.S. would refine and sell up to 50 million barrels of crude stuck in Venezuela under a U.S. blockade as a first step in his plan to revive a sector long in decline despite sitting on the largest reserves in the world.

"This Oil will be sold at its Market Price, and that money will be controlled by me, as President of the United States of America, to ensure it is used to benefit the people of Venezuela and the United States!" Trump posted on Tuesday.

Venezuela has not confirmed the deal.

Crude prices fell around 1.0% on world markets due to anticipated increased supplies.

The deal could initially require cargoes bound for Venezuela's top buyer China to be rerouted as Caracas seeks to unload millions of barrels stranded in tankers and storage.

"The United States' brazen use of force against Venezuela and its demand for 'America First' when Venezuela disposes of its own oil resources are typical acts of bullying," Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning told a press conference.

"These actions seriously violate international law, gravely infringe upon Venezuela's sovereignty, and severely damage the rights of the Venezuelan people."

China, Russia and leftist allies of Venezuela have all denounced the U.S. raid to capture Maduro at the weekend, which was Washington's biggest such intervention in Latin America since the 1989 invasion of Panama to topple Manuel Noriega.

Washington's allies are also deeply uneasy at the extraordinary precedent of seizing a foreign head-of-state , with Trump making a slew of threats of more action - from Mexico to Greenland - to further U.S. interests.

Some details are still sketchy on just how U.S. Special Forces swooped into Caracas by helicopter under darkness on Saturday, smashing Maduro's security cordon and seizing him at the door of a safe room, with no loss of U.S. lives.

Venezuela has not confirmed its total losses, though the army posted a list of 23 of its dead and ally Cuba said 32 members of its military and intelligence services died. The U.S. estimates about 75 fatalities, the Washington Post reported.

Maduro, 63, who had ruled Venezuela since the 2013 death of his predecessor and mentor Hugo Chavez, pleaded not guilty on Monday to narcotics charges in a Manhattan court where he was shackled at the ankles and wore orange and beige prison garb .

Trump appears to be calculating that it is better for stability in Venezuela to work with Maduro's senior allies for now. He is stressing revival of the oil sector with the help of U.S. firms as the priority, not the freeing of political prisoners or a new vote for a democratic transition.

Venezuela's main anti-Maduro figure Maria Corina Machado , who left in disguise to pick up the Nobel Peace Prize in October, wants to return home where she says the opposition would easily win a free vote.

But she is also taking care not to antagonise Trump, saying she would like to personally give him the Nobel prize which he had coveted and which she dedicated to him at the time. She says she is fully on board with his aspirations to make Venezuela a major ally of the U.S. and the energy hub of the Americas.

Banned from running in a 2024 election, Machado's ally Edmundo Gonzalez won overwhelmingly, according to the opposition, the U.S. and various election observers.

While working with Rodriguez and other top Venezuelan officials, the U.S. has warned they must cooperate or risk sharing Maduro's fate.

Hardline Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello , who controls security forces accused of widespread rights abuses, is under particular scrutiny, sources told Reuters.

The U.S. is also closely watching Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino, who like Cabello is under a U.S. drug trafficking indictment and has a multi-million-dollar bounty on his head.

Rodriguez herself is under U.S. sanctions, with her foreign financial assets identified as potential leverage, one source briefed on U.S. administration thinking said.

The U.S. is also pressuring the interim Venezuelan government to expel official advisers from China, Russia, Cuba and Iran, the New York Times reported.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 10:50:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/XGK6ZLCLLRNHPHJFQZXM744NVM.jpg?auth=3925306fc5240333df6d5bc330749f0831891dd8b0a4853813c9a062d514d0d2&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Zelenskiy's chief of staff hails 'concrete results' on second day of Paris talks</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/zelenskiys-chief-staff-hails-concrete-results-second-day-paris-talks-2026-01-07/</link><description>KYIV, Jan 7 (Reuters) - President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's top adviser hailed "concrete results" on Wednesday as talks in Paris on peace and security guarantees for Ukraine entered their second day, vowing Kyiv's national interests would be protected.

Ukraine is seeking strong backing from allies in the event of a ceasefire with Russia while also pushing back on a Kremlin demand that it give up its eastern Donbas region in exchange for peace.

"Not all information can be public, but there are already concrete results, (and) our work continues," Kyrylo Budanov, who was appointed head of Zelenskiy's office last week, said on the Telegram app.

"Ukrainian national interests will be defended."

Budanov's statement follows comments by Zelenskiy late on Tuesday that U.S. and Ukrainian officials had discussed "some ideas" to address the issue of territory, which he said remains the biggest obstacle in the peace process.

Kyiv has refused to pull out of the industrialised Donbas and said the U.S. has offered the idea of a free economic zone in parts of the region from which it withdraws.

White House special envoy Steve Witkoff said separately on Tuesday that land options had been discussed during the Paris talks and would continue.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 10:51:04 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/AQO6HUXFAZK7FPWJWX7XT2CGF4.jpg?auth=5ca538c25525dbe61c80245023778ee77729a87f1d56322b7ae6c87daa8875d8&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Malaysia seizes 2.4 million ringgit in cash tied to army procurement graft probe</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/malaysia-seizes-24-million-ringgit-cash-tied-army-procurement-graft-probe-2026-01-07/</link><description>KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 7 (Reuters) - Malaysia's anti-graft agency on Wednesday seized 2.4 million ringgit ($591,716) in cash linked to an investigation into alleged bribery involving army procurement contracts, state media reported, citing the agency's chief commissioner.

The cash was seized when an individual connected to the case was caught trying to transfer it to another location, the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) chief commissioner Azam Baki told Bernama.

Late last year, the agency raided several firms suspected of involvement in the bribery scheme and froze six bank accounts belonging to a suspect and their family members.

Former army chief Muhammad Hafizuddeain Jantan is believed to have recorded a statement at the MACC headquarters on Wednesday in connection with the investigation, Bernama also reported.

Muhammad Hafizuddeain was placed on leave in late December pending an investigation into the matter.

The Chief of Staff of the Malaysian Armed Forces Headquarters Azhan Md Othman, has been appointed as the Chief of the Malaysian Army effective January 1, Bernama reported.

Caracas and Washington agreed to export up to $2 billion worth of Venezuelan crude to the United States, President Donald Trump said on Tuesday, after U.S. forces captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro over the weekend.

That arrangement is likely to curtail Venezuelan supply to China, analysts say, reducing a source of cheap oil for independent refiners known as teapots. The world's biggest crude importer is a major buyer of discounted sanctioned oil from Russia, Iran and Venezuela.

"The Venezuela drama hits China's independent refineries the hardest, as they may lose access to the discounted heavy barrels," said Sparta Commodities analyst June Goh.

"However as there are ample Russian and Iranian feedstocks available and Venezuelan barrels on water, we do not foresee the teapots needing to bid up for unsanctioned barrels as the economics would likely not make sense for them," she said.

China imported 389,000 barrels per day of Venezuelan oil in 2025, about 4% of its total seaborne crude imports, Kpler data showed.

At least a dozen sanctioned vessels that loaded in December departed Venezuelan waters in early January carrying some 12 million barrels of crude and fuel, Reuters has reported. However, loadings for Asia at Venezuela's main ports have stopped since January 1, shipping data showed.

With supply tightening, sellers of Venezuelan Merey crude for prompt delivery offered cargoes at discounts of about $10 per barrel to ICE Brent versus $15 last month, said one trader, although trade has come to a standstill.

Another trader said offers were at minus $11 per barrel.

Venezuelan crude aboard ships in Asia remains sufficient to cover roughly 75 days of Chinese demand, limiting any immediate upside for alternatives, said Kpler senior analyst Xu Muyu.

Teapots using Venezuelan oil are likely to switch to Russian and Iranian supply in March and April, and China can also tap non-sanctioned sources such as Canada, Brazil, Iraq, and Colombia, she said.

Buyers have yet to start sourcing alternatives, trade sources said, with Iranian Heavy crude priced at a discount of about $10 per barrel to ICE Brent in ample supply, the cheapest alternative.

Teapots may also consider Middle Eastern grades such as Iraqi Basrah, a Singapore-based trader said.

Meanwhile, discounts for Canadian crude such as Cold Lake and Access Western Blend exported from the Trans Mountain pipeline have widened more than $2 this week to $4-$5 a barrel to ICE Brent for April delivery to China on expectations of lower U.S. demand, traders said.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 11:21:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LCAFV7CLDNOWPKRKZ4VJCQHT3Q.jpg?auth=f4bdae23743b8255c01dba7370f6e1161f0a8aac3bc0afca19d4e1c32347fd42&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran's rial reaches new low amid protests and economic crisis</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/iran-s-rial-reaches-new-low-amid-protests-and-economic-crisis</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 11:21:49 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/ea8796d2-ebb9-11f0-a257-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/capture-1401328451695e3fe1c87a37-85447388.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Death toll rises as Iran's security forces clash with protesters</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/death-toll-rises-as-iran-s-security-forces-clash-with-protesters</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 11:21:52 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/64616a3c-ebba-11f0-ac7b-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/capture-1537197220695e40ae948674-46773869.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israel-backed militia kill two Hamas operatives in Gaza, militia says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-backed-militia-kill-two-hamas-operatives-gaza-militia-says-2026-01-07/</link><description>CAIRO, Jan 7 (Reuters) - An Israeli-backed Palestinian militia said on Wednesday it had killed two Hamas operatives in southern Gaza, marking a renewed challenge to Hamas after Israel empowered its rivals in areas under Israeli military control.

The armed group, known as the Popular Forces, said in a statement it had carried out a raid in Rafah, killing two Hamas members who refused to surrender and detaining a third. It shared a photo that it said depicted one of the slain men.

Hamas, which brands such groups as "collaborators", declined to comment on the claim, which Reuters couldn't independently authenticate. Rafah sits in territory under Israeli control under the terms of an October Israel-Hamas deal .

The Popular Forces, founded by an anti-Hamas armed Bedouin leader, Yasser Abu Shabab, is believed to be the largest group operating in Israel-controlled areas.

Abu Shabab was killed in December in what the group described as a family feud. He was replaced by his deputy Ghassan Duhine, who vowed no let up in the fight against Hamas. The Popular Forces and others have reported more recruits since the October deal took effect.

The emergence of the groups, though they remain small and localised, has added to pressures on Islamist Hamas and could complicate efforts to stabilise and unify a divided Gaza, shattered by two years of war. The groups remain unpopular among the local population, as they operate under Israeli control.

Nearly all of Gaza's two million people live in Hamas-held areas, where the group has been reestablishing its grip and where four Hamas sources said it continues to command thousands of men despite suffering heavy blows during the war.

But Israel still holds well over half of Gaza - areas where Hamas' foes operate beyond its reach. With President Donald Trump's plan for Gaza moving slowly, there is no immediate prospect of further Israeli withdrawals.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged Israeli backing for anti-Hamas groups in June, saying Israel had "activated" clans. Israel has given little detail since then.

The Popular Forces deny receiving support from Israel.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 11:42:32 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Nigerian court grants bail to ex-justice minister Malami, trial to start in February</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/nigerian-court-grants-bail-ex-justice-minister-malami-trial-start-february-2026-01-07/</link><description>ABUJA, Jan 7 (Reuters) - A Nigerian court on Wednesday granted bail to former attorney-general and minister of justice Abubakar Malami, held for a month on money laundering and abuse of office charges, and adjourned his trial to February 17.

Malami, who served as the country's top law officer under former President Muhammadu Buhari, was arrested by Nigeria's anti-graft agency in December and charged with 16 counts of money laundering .

Prosecutors say Malami siphoned public funds between 2015 and 2023 and laundered the cash through associates - including his son and wife Hajia Asabe Bashir - and property deals.

All three accused have pleaded not guilty to the charges.

Judge Emeka Nwite of the federal high court in the capital Abuja set bail at 500 million naira ($351,835.17), requiring one surety with property in Abuja’s upscale Asokoro, Maitama or Gwarimpa districts.
Title papers must be verified and lodged with the court, and Malami must surrender his travel documents. The same terms apply to his son and Bashir, Nwite ruled.

The seizure, which could stoke tensions with Russia, came after the tanker, originally known as the Bella-1, slipped through a U.S. maritime "blockade" of sanctioned tankers and rebuffed U.S. Coast Guard efforts to board it.

The officials, who were speaking on condition of anonymity, said the operation is being carried out by the Coast Guard and U.S. military.

They added that Russian military vessels were in the general vicinity when the operation took place, including a Russian submarine.

The tanker, now known as the Marinera and registered under a Russian flag, is the latest tanker targeted by the U.S. Coast Guard since the start of U.S. President Donald Trump's pressure campaign against Venezuela.

Separately, the U.S. Coast Guard has also intercepted another Venezuela-linked tanker in Latin American waters, U.S. officials told Reuters, as the U.S. continues enforcing a maritime "blockade" of sanctioned vessels from Venezuela.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 12:46:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/GACZ47AZZBJOHK4KIZIO3VG3WA.jpg?auth=98a59dc7f2e4cc91d693410e7cdde4abb6be207ce873437c2278f851029654cd&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukraine, US to revisit land, nuclear plant issues in talks</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-us-revisit-land-nuclear-plant-issues-wednesday-talks-2026-01-07/</link><description>KYIV, Jan 7 (Reuters) - U.S. and Ukrainian negotiators will revisit the thorny issues of territory and the fate of the occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Wednesday, the most problematic points in peace talks to end Russia's war.

Kyiv is under U.S. pressure to secure peace in the nearly four-year-old conflict but is pushing back on Russian demands to cede its eastern Donetsk region and give up control of Europe's largest nuclear facility .

The delegations are in Paris for a third day of talks among Kyiv's allies on peace and security guarantees for Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire with Russia, which has been cool on the U.S.-backed process.

"We expect, in particular, that the most difficult issues from the basic framework for ending the war will be discussed – namely, issues related to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant and territories," Zelenskiy wrote on X, announcing a third session with the U.S. team in two days.

He added that he had ordered his team to discuss new leader-level talks involving the U.S. and European allies.

Earlier on Wednesday, Zelenskiy's top adviser hailed "concrete results" in the Paris talks and vowed Kyiv's national interests would be protected.

Zelenskiy said on Tuesday after the "coalition of the willing" talks that U.S. and Ukrainian officials had discussed "some ideas" to address the issue of territory.

White House special envoy Steve Witkoff said "land options" had been discussed on Tuesday and that he hoped for compromise to be reached.

Kyiv has refused to pull out of the industrialised Donetsk region, which Russia has taken swathes of but has failed to seize entirely. Zelenskiy has also said the U.S. has floated the idea of a free economic zone there if Ukraine withdraws from the parts of the region that it still controls.

Any compromises on land should be put to a referendum for Ukrainians, Zelenskiy has previously said. According to an opinion poll last month , around three-quarters of Ukrainians are prepared for a deal that would freeze the current front line, but oppose ceding territory.

The U.S. has also proposed trilateral operation of the Zaporizhzhia plant, which Moscow captured in 2022 and connected to its own power grid, with an American chief manager, Zelenskiy said last month.

Kyiv has instead proposed joint Ukrainian-American use of the plant, according to Zelenskiy, with the U.S. itself determining how to use 50% of the energy produced.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 12:47:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/N6STJIM3GBLHRPTG2DJWOXLJRU.jpg?auth=6a3bfebccf1e2807863cddf1926f0e2315d9f04985b18965c75b9d4b6399c53d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran's top judge warns protesters of 'no leniency' as unrest persists</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/irans-top-judge-warns-protesters-no-leniency-unrest-persists-2026-01-07/</link><description>DUBAI, Jan 7 (Reuters) - Iran's top judge warned protesters on Wednesday there would be "no leniency for those who help the enemy against the Islamic Republic", while accusing Israel and the U.S. of pursuing hybrid methods to disrupt the country.

Tehran is under international pressure with U.S. President Donald Trump threatening to come to the aid of protesters if security forces fired on them, seven months after Israeli and U.S. forces bombed Iranian nuclear sites in a 12-day war.

Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has vowed not to "yield to the enemy" .

The current protests, the biggest wave of dissent in three years, began last month in Tehran's Grand Bazaar by shopkeepers condemning the currency's free fall. Unrest has since spread nationwide amid deepening distress over economic hardships, including rocketing inflation driven by mismanagement and Western sanctions, and curbs on political and social freedoms.

"Following announcements by Israel and the U.S. president, there is no excuse for those coming to the streets for riots and unrest, Chief Justice Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei, the head of Iran's judiciary, was quoted as saying by state media.

"From now on, there will be no leniency for whoever helps the enemy against the Islamic Republic and the calm of the people," Ejei said.

At least 27 people have been killed and more than 1,500 arrested in Iran in the first 10 days of protests, with the west of the country seeing the highest number of casualties according to Kurdish-Iranian rights group Hengaw.

HRANA, a network of human rights activists, has reported a higher death toll of at least 36 people as well as the arrest of at least 2,076 people.

Reuters has not been able to independently verify the numbers of casualties or details of disturbances reported by Iranian media and rights groups.

Iranian authorities have not given a death toll for protesters, but have said at least two members of the security services have died and more than a dozen have been injured.

Iran's western provinces - which are economically marginalised and are heavily policed due to past outbreaks of unrest and their strategic location for national defence - have witnessed the most violent protests and repression lately.

Demonstrators took to the streets again overnight in the western province of Ilam and disturbances erupted, Hengaw said.

It has counted at least 20 demonstrators killed since late December in the provinces of Ilam, Lorestan, Kermanshah, Fars, Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari, and Hamadan.

"During the funeral of two people in Malekshahi on Tuesday, a number of attendees began chanting harsh, anti-system slogans," said Fars, a news agency affiliated with Iran's Revolutionary Guards.

After the funeral, Fars said, "about 100 mourners went into the city and trashed three banks ... Some started shooting at the police trying to disperse them".

In Abdanan, a city in southwestern Ilam province, a large crowd gathered late on Tuesday and chanted slogans against Khamenei that could be heard in a video shared on a Telegram channel called Nistemanijoan with over 180,000 followers.

The semi-official news agency Tasnim said a crowd of 300 gathered peacefully in Abdanan to make economic demands and some started shouting "anti-establishment" slogans, after which many demonstrators fled while security forces tackled "rioters".

Another Iranian outlet, Mehr News, said protesters had stormed a food store and emptied bags of rice, which has been affected by galloping inflation that has made ordinary staples increasingly unaffordable for many Iranians.

Social media footage shared by Iranian media outlets showed young men flinging grains of rice into the air, with the crowd cheering them on. Reuters was not able to verify the videos.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 12:47:31 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/YAVMM557GNKPLBI5TM2RNW2JFU.jpg?auth=b3b3b8cb3a0d8acd0862762b1c3853f49e76112cb73bfebb23937e50a7f8d76b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UK's Starmer says deployment of troops to Ukraine would be voted by parliament</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uks-starmer-says-deployment-troops-ukraine-would-be-voted-by-parliament-2026-01-07/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 7 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on Wednesday that any deployment of UK forces under a declaration signed with France and Ukraine would be subject to a parliamentary vote.

Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy signed on Tuesday a declaration of intent outlining the deployment of forces in the event a peace deal is reached.

"I will keep the house updated as the situation develops, and were troops to be deployed under the declaration signed, I would put that matter to the house for a vote," Starmer told parliament.

He said the number of troops would be determined under UK military plans which are currently being drawn.

Starmer also said he had spoken to U.S. President Donald Trump about security guarantees for Ukraine twice over Christmas and assured lawmakers there was "no question of acting on this without full discussion with the Americans".

The British premier's remarks come a day after the United States backed a broad coalition of Ukraine's allies, which includes Britain, in vowing to provide security guarantees to support the country if Russia attacks again.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 12:47:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/3CQ2EJ5MEZN2LOTH2QXPRWUELM.jpg?auth=49abe5d103563bf02ac875a93ac19f19590ceb4a80d41f621e6151e1955d691f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>French doctors striking over 'authoritarian drift' in universal healthcare system</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/french-doctors-striking-over-authoritarian-drift-in-universal-healthcare-system</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 12:49:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/dc1b888e-ebbd-11f0-88e5-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260107-081036-081729-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Kherson lives under anti-drone nets and in fear of Russian attacks</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/kherson-lives-under-anti-drone-nets-and-in-fear-of-russian-attacks</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 12:49:08 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/e1ac8652-ebbf-11f0-adc2-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260107-120513-120806-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US, Ukraine teams meet in Paris to tackle 'most difficult issues' in Russia war talks</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260107-us-ukraine-teams-meet-in-paris-to-tackle-most-difficult-issues-in-russia-war-talks</link><description>Washington and Kyiv teams in Paris were on Wednesday expected to tackle Ukraine talks' "most difficult issues" including territory following a breakthrough in European-led negotiations , Ukraine's leader said.

On Tuesday, European leaders and US envoys announced they had agreed key security guarantees for Kyiv as they sought to present a united front for Ukraine despite raging tensions over Venezuela and President Donald Trump 's designs on Greenland.

US envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner represented Washington in the talks amid efforts to end nearly four years of war in Ukraine sparked by Russia's invasion.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the Kyiv and Washington teams would dedicate the second day of the Paris talks to the fate of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and control of territory in eastern Ukraine.

"Another session of talks with envoys of the president of the United States will take place, and this will already be the third such session in two days," he said on Facebook.

"The most difficult issues from the basic framework for ending the war will be discussed – namely, issues related to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant and territories."

Zelensky also stressed it was important for Kyiv's Western allies to put pressure on Moscow.

"Peace must be dignified. And this depends on the partners – on whether they ensure Russia's real readiness to end the war," he said.

Kyrylo Budanov, Zelensky's new chief of staff and former top spy, on Wednesday said "there are already concrete results" but added that "not all information can be made public".

A European diplomatic source said that representatives of France, Germany, and the United Kingdom were involved in fresh Paris talks on Wednesday, as well as some from Italy and Turkey.

On Tuesday, Ukraine's Western allies agreed key security guarantees for Kyiv including a US-led monitoring mechanism and a European multinational force that would be deployed after a ceasefire in Russia's war against its neighbour.

But there has been no let-up in fighting in what has been Europe's deadliest conflict since World War II and Moscow's current negotiating position is far from clear.

Russian leader Vladimir Putin has repeatedly said he does not want to see NATO troops on the ground in Ukraine.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 12:49:10 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/005c0ea6-ebc0-11f0-95ff-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/69e76a2af945b41c0fee45190ead3d8c02c911f4.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Heavy snowfall in France causes widespread transport disruption</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/heavy-snowfall-in-france-causes-widespread-transport-disruption</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 12:49:12 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/21ec9c06-ebb7-11f0-8bfd-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-07T085103Z-1505152388-RC27WIAI7AVT-RTRMADP-3-EUROPE-WEATHER-FRANCE-SNOW.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukraine allies agree on security guarantees in case of a ceasefire</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/ukraine-allies-agree-on-security-guarantees-in-case-of-a-ceasefire</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 12:49:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/bce953ac-ebb2-11f0-bde2-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260107-104046-104243-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Yemeni separatist leader charged with 'high treason' by Yemen's anti-Houthi council</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/yemeni-separatist-leader-charged-with-high-treason-by-yemen-s-anti-houti-council</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 12:49:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/4d766d44-ebb1-11f0-a018-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260107-103349-103502-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Snow clogs transport in Europe as Parisians turn to skis</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/western-europe-braces-another-wave-snow-ice-2026-01-07/</link><description>PARIS/BRUSSELS, Jan 7 (Reuters) - Snow and ice brought misery to travellers in northwest Europe on Wednesday but delight to others who set out to explore a snow-blanketed Paris on sledges and skis.

Storm Goretti blew in from the Atlantic coast and hit Paris as daylight broke, dumping heavy snowfall on the city that led to further flight cancellations, traffic snarls and transport disruption.

The city's bus services were suspended as shops geared up for the first day of the New Year sales. But tourists and residents enjoyed the rare sight of snow-covered Paris, with a few taking the opportunity to ski down the slopes of Montmartre and along the Champs de Mars gardens below the Eiffel Tower.

"It's exceptional, it's incredible. It's magnificent and we're enjoying it. We also came across a lot of tourists and they look so happy," said Pierre, a Parisian out admiring the snowy scenery.

People grabbed sledges or even just plastic bags to slide down any slopes they could find.

France's Weather Office warned of snowfall across the northern half of the country on Wednesday.

Dutch airline KLM (AIRF.PA) , opens new tab cancelled 600 flights scheduled for Wednesday at Amsterdam's Schiphol airport, in the sixth consecutive day of disruption at one of Europe's busiest hubs.

KLM has warned it is running out of de-icing fluid for its jets and delays to supplies had made it difficult to replenish stock. No shortages were reported in France.

France's civil aviation authority asked airlines to cut 40% of flights at Paris' main international airport Charles de Gaulle and 25% of flights at the smaller Orly.

Brussels' international airport also faced some cancellations and delays, while train operator Eurostar flagged major delays and cancellations.

Dutch authorities urged people to work from home and French officials banned trucks and school buses from the roads in a third of all administrative departments, most in the northern half of the country.

Carrefour (CARR.PA) , opens new tab CEO Alexandre Bompard said the truck ban would bring some disruption to supermarket supply chains, in particular for fresh produce.

Further east, in Germany, temperatures were below minus 10 degrees Celsius (14 degrees Fahrenheit) again on Wednesday. Traffic disruption has been limited though.

Spain too is facing snow and unusual cold, prompting the suspension of one commuter rail line near Madrid and disrupting more than 40 roads across the country.

Heavy snow and rain overnight caused travel disruptions across the Western Balkans.

Passengers were trapped in a train for more than 12 hours in the town of Knin in northwestern Croatia after trees fell onto the tracks.

Some towns in eastern Bosnia and western Serbia declared emergency situations after power and water cuts.

In Poland, schools in many regions were closed due to snow, with some switching to remote learning. In Hungary, heavy snowfall hit highways and delayed trains and buses on Wednesday morning.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 13:41:07 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/U22IYZKJVZM5HJEXJLK6J4Z3OU.jpg?auth=797df0b3857af6a15f0abe1baee12365bb0e7f4b48f470f80ac1b12b153e6a35&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Brazil’s Bolsonaro authorized to go to hospital for tests after fall</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/brazils-bolsonaro-authorized-go-hospital-tests-after-fall-2026-01-07/</link><description>BRASILIA, Jan 7 (Reuters) - Brazil's Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes authorized former President Jair Bolsonaro to leave prison and be taken to a hospital for tests after he fell and hit his head, a court decision showed on Wednesday.

The military had declared the city's Kurdish-controlled districts "closed military zones" from 3pm (1200 GMT), while creating "two safe humanitarian crossings" through which thousands of civilians had fled before the deadline, according to AFP correspondents.

The deadly clashes , which started on Tuesday, are the worst between the two sides, who have so far failed to implement a March deal to merge the Kurds ' semi-autonomous administration and military into Syria's new Islamist government.

AFP correspondents in Aleppo saw large groups families with children leaving the neighbourhoods, carrying their belongings with them, some in tears.

"All Syrian Democratic Forces military positions within the Sheikh Maqsud and Ashrafieh neighbourhoods of Aleppo are legitimate military targets," the army said referring to the Kurdish-led force.

Senior Kurdish official Ilham Ahmed accused Damascus of launching a "genocidal war" against the Kurds, calling on the Syrian government to "pursue a path of reason to resolve problems through dialogue".

The violence caused the suspension of flights to and from Aleppo's airport, with schools, universities and government offices in the city shut down.

Tuesday's clashes killed nine people, mostly civilians, with both sides trading blame over who started the fighting.

Joud Serjian, a 53-year-old housewife and resident of the Syriac Quarter, said the violence "reminded us of the war".

Living in the Syriac Quarter near Ashrafieh, Serjian said "we have nowhere else to go, so we'll stay in our home".

During the Syrian civil war, Aleppo was the scene of fierce fighting between rebels and forces of ousted President Bashar al-Assad before he regained control of the city in 2016.

Assad was ousted in a lightning Islamist-led offensive in 2024.

Abdul Karim Omar, representative of the Kurds' autonomous administration in Damascus, told AFP Aleppo's Kurdish-majority neighbourhoods were "completely besieged".

He denied that any shells had been fired from these areas, arguing that they are controlled by the Kurds' Asayish domestic security forces "who only have light weapons".

Sheikh Maqsud and Ashrafiyeh have remained under the control of Kurdish units linked to the SDF, despite Kurdish fighters agreeing to withdraw from the areas in April.

The SDF controls swathes of Syria's oil-rich north and northeast, with the backing of a US-led international coalition, and was key to the territorial defeat of the Islamic State group in Syria in 2019.

The March agreement on the Kurdish authority's integration into the state was supposed to be implemented by the end of 2025.

The Kurds are pushing for decentralised rule, an idea which Syria's new authorities have rejected.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 13:42:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/ab97cfaa-ebc8-11f0-a756-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-07T120527Z-204888481-RC28WIAKNDWN-RTRMADP-3-SYRIA-SECURITY-ALEPPO.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>In pictures: Rare heavy snowfall blankets Paris streets and monuments</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260107-in-pictures-rare-heavy-snowfall-blankets-paris-streets-and-monuments</link><description>Snow and ice are falling on northern and western France in a phenomenon of "rare magnitude", according to the Metéo-France weather agency. More than 100 flights at Charles de Gaulle airport and another 40 at Orly were cancelled on Wednesday , with the French capital halting bus services starting from around 7am.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 13:42:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/bf4d311e-ebc0-11f0-80d8-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/Snow-2-ski.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UN accuses Israel of 'severe segregation and discrimination' in West Bank 'apartheid'</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260107-un-accuses-israel-of-severe-segregation-and-discrimination-in-west-bank-apartheid</link><description>The United Nations on Wednesday said decades-long discrimination and segregation of Palestinians by Israel in the West Bank were intensifying, and called on the country to end its "apartheid system".

In a new report, slammed by Israel , the UN rights office said "systematic discrimination " against Palestinians across the occupied Palestinian territories had "drastically deteriorated" in recent years.

"There is a systematic asphyxiation of the rights of Palestinians in the West Bank ," UN rights chief Volker Turk said in a statement.

"Whether accessing water , school, rushing to hospital , visiting family or friends, or harvesting olives – every aspect of life for Palestinians in the West Bank is controlled and curtailed by Israel's discriminatory laws, policies and practices," he added.

"This is a particularly severe form of racial discrimination and segregation, that resembles the kind of apartheid system we have seen before."

A number of independent experts affiliated with the UN have described the situation in the occupied Palestinian territories as "apartheid" but this marks the first time a UN rights chief has applied the term.

Israel's diplomatic mission to the UN in Geneva slammed the report's "absurd and distorted accusations of racial discrimination" against Israel, charging it exemplified the UN rights office's "inherently politically driven fixation ... on vilifying Israel".

The report said the Israeli authorities "treat Israeli settlers and Palestinians residing in the West Bank under two distinct bodies of law and policies, resulting in unequal treatment on a range of critical issues".

"Palestinians continue to be subjected to large-scale confiscation of land and deprivation of access to resources," it added.

This had led to "dispossessing them of their lands and homes, alongside other forms of systemic discrimination, including criminal prosecution in military courts during which their due process and fair trial rights are systematically violated".

Turk demanded Wednesday that Israel "repeal all laws, policies and practices that perpetuate systemic discrimination against Palestinians based on race, religion or ethnic origin".

The discrimination was compounded by continuing and escalating settler violence, in many cases "with the acquiescence, support and participation of Israel's security forces", the rights office said.

More than 500,000 Israelis currently live in settlements in the West Bank, occupied since 1967 and home to around three million Palestinians.

Violence has risen in recent years, surging especially since Hamas 's October 7, 2023 attack, which triggered the Gaza war.

Since the start of the war, Israeli troops and settlers have killed more than 1,000 Palestinians in the West Bank, including many militants as well as dozens of civilians, according to an AFP tally based on figures from the Palestinian health ministry.

According to official Israeli figures, at least 44 Israelis, both soldiers and civilians, have been killed in Palestinian attacks or Israeli military operations in the same period.

Since the Gaza war began, Israeli authorities had also "further expanded the use of unlawful force, arbitrary detention and torture ", the report said.

Increased "repression of civil society and undue restrictions on media freedoms (and) severe movement restrictions" had also characterised "an unprecedented deterioration of the human rights situation" in the West Bank, it said.

There had also been rapid expansions of settlements, considered illegal under international law, even as unlawful killings of Palestinians were taking place "with almost complete impunity", the report warned.

Of the more than 1,500 killings of Palestinians that took place between the start of 2017 and September 30 last year, Israeli authorities had opened just 112 investigations, resulting in only one conviction, it pointed out.

The report said it had found "reasonable grounds to believe that this separation, segregation, and subordination is intended to be permanent... to maintain oppression and domination of Palestinians".

This, it stressed, amounts to a violation of an international anti-racism convention, "which prohibits racial segregation and apartheid".

The UN rights office on Wednesday urged Israel to end its "unlawful presence in the occupied Palestinian territory, including by dismantling all settlements and evacuating all settlers, and to respect the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination".</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 13:42:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/0228e666-ebcd-11f0-9def-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/2025-12-23T111107Z-38182078-RC2AMIAJJ3WT-RTRMADP-3-ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS-WEST-BANK-RAID.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Why does Donald Trump want to take over Greenland?</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/why-does-donald-trump-want-to-take-over-greenland</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 14:25:04 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/432a6f0a-eb2c-11f0-87f5-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-06T131202Z-431987562-RC2U9DA7NHYT-RTRMADP-3-USA-TRUMP-GREENLAND-EUROPE.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US takeover of Greenland would 'simply mean the end of NATO', says Denmark</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/us-takeover-of-greenland-would-simply-mean-the-end-of-nato-says-denmark</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 14:25:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/141c4052-ebcd-11f0-b244-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260107-140348-140941-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Deadly clashes resume in Syria's Aleppo between government, Kurdish forces</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/deadly-clashes-resume-syrias-aleppo-between-government-kurdish-forces-2026-01-07/</link><description>ALEPPO, Syria, Jan 7 - Fierce fighting resumed in Syria's northern city of Aleppo between government forces and Kurdish fighters for a second day on Wednesday, sending thousands of civilians fleeing and leaving at least four people dead.

The violence, and statements trading blame over who started it, signaled that a stalemate between Damascus and Kurdish authorities that have resisted integrating into the central government was deepening and growing deadlier.

It began on Tuesday, when at least six people were killed , including two women and a child, in an exchange of shelling between Syrian government troops and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF).

After relative calm overnight, shelling resumed on Wednesday and intensified in the afternoon, Reuters reporters in the city said. Aleppo's health directorate said a further four people were killed and 18 wounded.

The Syrian army announced that military positions in the SDF-held neighbourhoods of Sheikh Maqsoud and Ashrafiyah were "legitimate military targets." Two Syrian security officials told Reuters that they expected a significant military operation in the city.

The government opened humanitarian corridors for civilians to flee flashpoint neighbourhoods, ferrying them out on city buses. A source from the government's civil defence rescue force said an estimated 10,000 people had fled.

"We move them safely to the places they want to go to according to their desire or to displaced shelters," said Faisal Mohammad Ali, operations chief of the civil defence force in Aleppo.

The latest fighting has disrupted civilian life in a leading Syrian city, closing the airport and a highway to Turkey, halting operations at factories in an industrial zone and paralysing major roads into the city centre.

The Damascus government said its forces were responding to rocket fire, drone attacks and shelling from SDF-held neighbourhoods, but Kurdish forces said they held Damascus "fully and directly responsible for ... the dangerous escalation that threatens the lives of thousands of civilians and undermines stability in the city."

During Syria's 14-year civil war , Kurdish authorities began running a semi-autonomous zone in northeast Syria, as well as in parts of Aleppo city.

They have been reluctant to give up those zones and integrate fully into the Islamist-led government that took over after ex-President Bashar al-Assad's ousting in late 2024.

Last year, the Damascus government reached a deal with the SDF that planned for a full integration by the end of 2025 , but the two sides have made little progress, each accusing the other of stalling or acting in bad faith.

Failure to integrate the SDF into Syria's army risks further violence and could potentially draw in Turkey, which has threatened an incursion against Kurdish fighters it views as terrorists.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 14:51:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4B7KK2ZJ7VNCRKIYHGPTQKN3HU.jpg?auth=8fe1f3ac4c3712d210dd9ccc8d9ffe5ccd0b213bc64bc4180eeb9f495512a1f4&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Soundproofing foam in Swiss bar fire should have been checked by law, official says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/soundproofing-foam-swiss-bar-fire-should-have-been-checked-by-law-official-says-2026-01-07/</link><description>GENEVA, Jan 7 (Reuters) - Soundproofing foam that caught fire in a bar in the Swiss ski resort of Crans-Montana at New Year, killing 40 people, should have been subject to regular safety checks by law, a senior official said, contradicting the town's mayor.

Investigators suspect the blaze at "Le Constellation" bar broke out when revellers held up sparkling candles too close to soundproofing foam on the basement ceiling.

On Tuesday, Crans-Montana Mayor Nicolas Feraud said the bar had not been subjected to any annual safety inspections since 2019, even though it should have been every year.

But Feraud said the law did not mandate safety checks of the soundproofing material itself. Courts will determine if this should have been done regardless, he said.

Stephane Ganzer, head of security in the canton (county) of Valais where Crans-Montana is located, told Swiss media RTS that existing regulations clearly required a list of checks, including materials such as soundproofing foam.

"The checklists are very clear, and obviously, checking materials - especially foam like this - is part of the basic inspection carried out in an establishment," he said.

He cited an ordinance supplementing the law, as well as standards of the Swiss Society of Engineers and Architects.

His remarks add to the debate over who was responsible for the condition of the bar when the fire broke out.

Ganzer said such failings should not happen in Switzerland, long renowned for its image of affluent law and order, stability and precision.

"The standards are precise, the legal basis is strict," he said, "and if everything had been properly respected, we would not have 40 deaths at the end."</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 14:52:02 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/27DU54MISVKG7LYFVPXQ5XK3HQ.jpg?auth=fb46478577aca0ef9e43da5f777e58713f8ec3f07b78dbc8ac01c8321da8a44e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Canada prime minister to visit China next week, spokesperson says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/canada-prime-minister-visit-china-next-week-spokesperson-says-2026-01-07/</link><description>OTTAWA, Jan 7 (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney will visit China January 13-17, his office said on Wednesday, in what will be the first visit by a Canadian prime minister since 2017.

Carney is trying to diversify Canada's exports away from its main market, the United States, as Canada faces uncertain trade policy from U.S. President Donald Trump.

The visit aims to increase engagement on trade, energy, agriculture and international security, Carney's office said. China is Canada's second biggest trading partner.

China announced preliminary anti-dumping duties on Canadian canola imports in August, a year after Canada a 100% tariff on imports of Chinese electric vehicles.

Carney had agreed to visit China after meeting with President Xi Jinping in South Korea in October .

Carney has previously stressed the need to restart broad after years of worsening ties.

Canada's agriculture minister said in November his weeklong trip to China was evidence of bilateral relations beginning to thaw, something desperately needed by Canada's farmers and canola exporters.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 14:52:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HIBPNZS3XJOQ5FUFZBCBQK75MU.jpg?auth=4f4488514bd3b87486174378f3a31cee65cc586d4a8388a2c8c9886632b4762f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Leader of Yemen's southern separatist group never gave up hopes for independence</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/leader-yemens-southern-separatist-group-never-gave-up-hopes-independence-2026-01-07/</link><description>DUBAI, Jan 7 (Reuters) - Yemeni separatist leader Aidarous al-Zubaidi, who took up arms early in life and never shied away from joining conflicts, shows no signs of abandoning his dream of creating an independent state in the south.

Zubaidi, the leader of Yemen's Southern Transitional Council, failed to board a flight to Saudi Arabia on Wednesday for talks on ending a military escalation that saw his forces sweep towards the Saudi border last month.

His no-show added to deep uncertainty in Yemen, ravaged by more than 10 years of civil war and now caught in a deepening feud between Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, the most powerful countries in the region and both close allies of the United States.

Yemen's Saudi-backed presidential council expelled Zubaidi and accused him of treason.

The crisis erupted last month, when STC forces suddenly seized swathes of territory, shifting the delicate balance of power and putting Saudi Arabia and the UAE on opposite sides of the conflict .

Born in 1967 in Al Dhalea province, in southern Yemen, a region known for agriculture and widely-used narcotic leaf qat, he became an officer in the military forces of South Yemen, which was unified with the North in 1990 after 23 years as separate states.

Known for his hardline stance on the independence of the south, Zubaidi often returned to his native region to regroup after setbacks. Now, he appears ready to take on Saudi Arabia to achieve his goals even as Saudi-backed Yemeni government forces advance towards Aden.

Zubaidi fought in the civil war in the summer of 1994 that ended with the defeat of southern forces, an outcome that led him to set up his own armed group in Dhalea calling for self-determination.

After civil war erupted again 20 years later, when the Houthis ousted the Saudi-backed, internationally recognised government of then-president Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi and took the capital Sanaa, Zubaidi led efforts to oust the Iran-aligned group from Dhalea.

He was appointed governor of the restive southern port city of Aden in 2016, surviving an assassination attempt claimed by the Islamic State before being fired from the post in April 2017 after tensions emerged with Hadi's government.

A month later, the STC was founded with backing from the UAE, initially part of the Sunni Muslim Saudi-led alliance against the Houthis.

While joining the fight against the Houthis, whom he labelled "the biggest threat" in an interview with Reuters at Davos in 2025, he never lost focus on the separatist fight for the south.

Zubaidi last week called for a referendum on independence from the north in two years, the clearest indication yet of the STC's intention to secede and a further escalation in the unfolding crisis, which has added to Yemen's woes after more than 10 years of civil war that created one of the world's worst humanitarian crises.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 14:52:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/6XY2MQAKDBLSLBC54YWQ6B2XI4.jpg?auth=32afacc8daa23a90d9fe3a697ef1f3cb199d978789429e0fa2350e7934b5ca67&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>TikTok removes videos by Polish far-right politician after hate speech complaint</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/tiktok-removes-videos-by-polish-far-right-politician-after-hate-speech-complaint-2026-01-07/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 14:53:04 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>US wants Venezuelan oil flowing again with revenues in US accounts, Wright says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/us-wants-venezuelan-oil-flowing-again-with-revenues-us-accounts-wright-says-2026-01-07/</link><description>Jan 7 (Reuters) - The United States needs to control Venezuela's oil sales and revenue to drive the changes it wants to see in the country, Energy Secretary Chris Wright said on Wednesday.

Wright said he was speaking to U.S. oil companies to learn what conditions would enable them to enter the South American country and added that he wanted to sell Venezuelan oil to U.S. refineries.

Over the weekend, President Donald Trump said the U.S. would " take control " of Venezuela after U.S. forces ousted Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, a step that could give U.S. energy companies access to the country's vast oil reserves.

"Instead of the oil being blockaded as it is right now, we're going to let the oil flow," Wright said, adding that the government would sell it to buyers in the U.S. and around the world.

The sales would be controlled by the U.S. government, Wright added, with revenues collected from them "deposited into accounts controlled by the U.S."

"If we control the flow of oil, the sales of that oil, and the flow of the cash that comes from those sales, we have large leverage. But without large leverage ... you don't get change.

Wright was speaking at the Goldman Sachs Energy, CleanTech &amp; Utilities Conference in Miami.

Raising crude output from Venezuela is a top objective for Trump. Venezuela was producing as much as 3.5 million bpd in the 1970s. But mismanagement and limited foreign investment led to a huge drop in annual production, which averaged about 1.1 million bpd last year.

"We could get several hundred thousand barrels a day of additional production in short to medium term if the conditions are there for just small capital deployments," Wright said.

Lawmakers passed emergency legislation before the holidays to keep the state running after failing to approve the budget. But as they reconvene on Thursday to make a fresh stab at the bill, their positions remain too far apart for it to pass by vote, many of them said.

Finance Minister Roland Lescure and Budget Minister Amelie de Montchalin, who want the budget passed by the end of January, met with key Socialist and conservative lawmakers for four hours on Tuesday to seek common ground before the lower house resumes its review Thursday.

If they cannot narrow differences, Lecornu's only hope of passing the budget would be to invoke article 49.3 of the constitution, breaking his promise not to ram it through without a vote. Such a move would inevitably trigger a no-confidence vote that could bring down his minority government unless the Socialists abstain.

"The government is hoping to avoid being toppled by throwing the Socialists some crumbs," said Eric Coquerel, the hard-left chair of the finance commission in the lower house.

Investors and ratings agencies are scrutinising France's finances as Lecornu struggles to chart a path to a fiscal deficit of under 3% of GDP by 2029. He has little room for manoeuvre in the fractious parliament, where budget battles have already toppled three governments since President Emmanuel Macron lost his majority in 2024.

The government wants to cut the deficit to 5.0% of GDP from an estimated 5.4% last year - the euro zone's highest. The Senate sent back a revised text with a 5.3% deficit, but Lescure warned the shortfall could reach 5.4% or more without restraint.

Socialists accuse conservatives who dominate the Senate of worsening the deficit by scrapping proposed tax hikes on big companies. They want those tax hikes reinstated and a freeze on welfare payments to be lifted.

"If they try to pass the budget in its current form, then the government will fall, that's for sure," said Socialist lawmaker Romain Eskenazi.

The Socialists face a delicate calculation to extract maximum concessions for abstaining on a no-confidence vote, but must also avoid looking reckless to voters ahead of March's municipal elections.

Conservative Republicains leader Bruno Retailleau said the Socialists' position makes it increasingly likely that the government would have to try to pass the budget by force.

"I don't think there is a version of the budget that could pass a vote in parliament," he told journalists.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 16:32:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CF442UIFWVNF5KZJAUUGJWQLZU.jpg?auth=21cf10a533604236acc4322573e89f649c0bfc5f006a3389eff461e1fbac81b4&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UK supported US mission to seize Russian-flagged oil tanker, MoD says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/uk-supported-us-mission-seize-russian-oil-tanker-mod-says-2026-01-07/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 7 (Reuters) - Britain provided support to the United States in its operation to seize a Russian-flagged oil tanker in the North Atlantic, the Ministry of Defence said on Wednesday.

The U.S. seized the tanker - which was being shadowed by a Russian submarine - on Wednesday, after pursuing it for more than two weeks across the Atlantic as part of Washington's efforts to block Venezuelan oil exports.

Britain said its armed forces gave "pre-planned operational support, including basing" following a U.S. request for assistance.

It said a military vessel provided support for the U.S. forces pursuing the tanker, and the Royal Air Force provided surveillance support from the air.

Defence Secretary John Healey said the operation targeted a vessel "with a nefarious history" linked to Russian and Iranian sanctions evasion networks.

“This action formed part of global efforts to crack down on sanctions busting,” he said in a statement.

He added that the U.S. was Britain's closest defence and security partner: "The depth of our defence relationship with the U.S. is an essential part of our security, and today's seamlessly executed operation shows just how well this works in practice."

The Bella-1 tanker, now renamed Marinera, is sanctioned by the U.S. under its counter-Iran sanctions, the British government said.

The MoD statement said the support was provided "in full compliance with international law".</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 16:33:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LV57VTHUNZM45K43XQMAHPRISQ.jpg?auth=9fc2558e5c3caf0565ef16e8e9139f83a4aa3687d923f6ba3a55d6fcd27e3651&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Dozens of Italian tourists evacuated from Yemeni island</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/dozens-italian-tourists-evacuated-yemeni-island-2026-01-07/</link><description>ROME, Jan 7 (Reuters) - Italy has begun repatriating dozens of its citizens stranded on the Yemeni island of Socotra, with a first flight carrying 46 tourists due to land in Jeddah on Wednesday, the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.

Another 59 Italians remain on the island and are expected to return on additional flights in the coming days, as authorities work with Yemen and Saudi Arabia. Saudi authorities will grant the Italians a four-day transit visa to help facilitate their return home.

The United Arab Emirates last week its troops from Yemen under a deadline from Saudi Arabia, also leaving behind the remote Yemeni island of Socotra and roughly 600 tourists who had flown in but could no longer fly out.

Air traffic at the island's main airport came to a halt as a deepening crisis between the UAE and Saudi Arabia translated into fresh conflict on Yemen's mainland, where the two Gulf powers back opposing groups in the country's civil war.

Socotra - which lies more than 300 km (185 miles) south of Yemen's coast, and until recently was mainly accessible by air via the UAE - has been a haven of tranquillity through the years of conflict on the mainland.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 16:33:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/PYPWIHAYSNMEZPMBGE7LPSYZE4.jpg?auth=720a167653141bf8859234df27cb77999e64f268d74d71043ed16e838bb4764f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Meloni condemns political hatred after party activists attacked in Italy</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/meloni-condemns-political-hatred-after-party-activists-attacked-italy-2026-01-07/</link><description>ROME, Jan 7 (Reuters) - Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni on Wednesday urged Italians to reject political violence after four activists from her party's youth wing were beaten up on the 48th anniversary of the killings of three neofascist militants in Rome.

Witnesses said the four activists were attacked as they were putting up posters to commemorate the deaths on January 7, 1978 of the three teenagers in Via Acca Larentia -- a long-standing rallying point for Italy's far-right.

In a statement, Meloni called the 1978 deaths "a painful page in the history of our nation", adding: "Those were dark years of terrorism and political hatred, in which too much innocent blood was shed, from multiple sides."

The three slain teenagers were members of the youth wing of the now defunct Italian Social Movement (MSI), a neofascist party founded after World War Two. Two of the teens were allegedly killed by leftwing militants, while the third was shot dead later the same day by a policeman after a riot broke out.

No one was convicted of the killings.

"We have the duty to preserve memory and to clearly reaffirm that political violence, in all its forms, is always a defeat. It is never justifiable. It must never return," Meloni said.

The four activists attacked on Wednesday were members of Gioventu Nazionale (National Youth), the youth wing of Brothers of Italy. None of them were believed to have been seriously hurt but their car had its windscreen smashed in.

Meloni said Italy had "to choose respect, dialogue, and civil coexistence", adding: "When an idea is silenced by force, democracy loses. Always."

The Via Acca Larentia commemoration has traditionally been marked by hundreds of men making the stiff-armed Roman salute and shouting "present" -- a rallying cry of neofascists.

Meloni's own Brothers of Italy party traces its roots back to the MSI, however the prime minister has denied accusations that her party has close ties with the far right, saying in 2023 that her government had no "nostalgia for fascism".

A year later she said anyone who idolised Italy's fascist past should be expelled from the Brothers of Italy after an undercover media investigation released a video of party members making fascist salutes and chanting "Sieg Heil".</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 16:33:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/XKYZXPMDWZMZZEEOJTMVWDEUSE.jpg?auth=bac3e15f3d9cd023c2d5719c20c6292f7ef113dc27e469636091b77830b4a0b6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Cambodia says Chen Zhi among 3 extradited to China after transnational crime probe</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/cambodia-says-chen-zhi-among-3-extradited-china-after-transnational-crime-probe-2026-01-07/</link><description>Jan 7 (Reuters) - Cambodia said on Wednesday it had extradited three people to China at the request of Beijing following a months-long joint investigation into transnational crime, among them an individual named Chen Zhi.

In a statement, the interior ministry said those extradited on Tuesday were all Chinese nationals. It did not provide further details on Chen Zhi or the alleged crimes, but said his Cambodian citizenship had been revoked.

The United States and Britain in October sanctioned the Prince Group of businesses headed by a Cambodian-Chinese tycoon named Chen Zhi, accusing it of operating large-scale online "scam centres" that used trafficked workers to defraud victims globally.

It was not immediately clear if the Prince Group chair was among the individuals extradited. China's foreign ministry and its public security did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.

Cambodia's interior ministry said in a statement it had arrested Chen Zhi and two other Chinese nationals, Xu Ji Liang and Shao Ji Hui, and had extradited them to China "within the scope of cooperation in combatting transnational crime and pursuant to a request from the relevant authorities of the People's Republic of China".

Parts of Southeast Asia, including the border areas between Thailand, Myanmar and Cambodia, have become hubs for massive online fraud, with criminal networks earning billions of dollars from illegal compounds where trafficking victims are often forced to work.

British sanctions targeted six entities and six individuals, including Chen Zhi, whom the U.S. and Britain accused of having overseen the construction of compounds used for online scams.

The U.S. Treasury Department said it had taken what it described as the largest action ever in Southeast Asia, targeting 146 people within the Prince Group.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 16:34:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Cambodia says Chen Zhi among 3 extradited to China after transnational crime probe</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/cambodia-says-chen-zhi-among-3-extradited-china-after-transnational-crime-probe-2026-01-07/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 16:34:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Taking over Greenland, a long-standing US obsession</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260107-taking-over-greenland-a-long-standing-us-obsession</link><description>US President Donald Trump is considering "several options" to acquire Greenland , including "using the military ", his spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said on Tuesday, stoking further concern in Europe over the future of the Arctic island.

In a joint statement , France , Germany , Italy , Poland , Spain and the UK voiced support for Denmark against Trump’s claims over the semi-autonomous territory. "Greenland belongs to its people. It is for Denmark and Greenland, and them only, to decide on matters concerning Denmark and Greenland," the European leaders said, stressing that Denmark is a NATO member like the United States and is bound to Washington by a defence agreement.

The statement followed new threats from Trump. Speaking to The Atlantic last week, the US president said it was up to observers to judge what the special forces operation in Venezuela – which led to the ouster of Nicolas Maduro and his wife – might mean for Greenland. “They are going to view it themselves. I really don’t know,” he added.

“We need Greenland from the standpoint of national security, and Denmark is not going to be able to do it,” Trump insisted, speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday evening. “We’ll take care of Greenland in about two months … let’s talk about Greenland in 20 days,” he added.

Trump’s renewed focus on the Arctic has sparked debate in Washington and abroad. Senior US officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio , told lawmakers that the administration would prefer to negotiate a purchase with Denmark rather than resort to force, though the option of military involvement has not been ruled out.

Trump had already expressed a desire to annex Greenland, a vast Arctic island home to some 57,000 people, during his first term. In August 2019, he told reporters he wanted to buy the territory from Denmark, calling it "essentially a real estate deal", following reports by The Wall Street Journal on his interest in the island.

The Danish province has been coveted for centuries. From the 10th century, Scandinavians began colonising the land, discovered in 982 by the Viking Erik the Red and previously inhabited by Indigenous peoples . Until the early 18th century, Norway and Denmark contested its sovereignty. In 1814, when the two kingdoms separated, Greenland remained under Danish control under the Treaty of Kiel.

Meanwhile, the United States claimed Greenland as part of its sphere of influence. Under President James Monroe’s 1824 doctrine, Washington warned European powers against interfering in the affairs of the "Americas". “From a US perspective, Greenland is North American,” Mikaa Blugeon-Mered, a geopolitics researcher specialising in Arctic regions, told FRANCE 24.

A few decades later, the United States sought to annex Greenland. In 1867, it tried to acquire the island as part of a purchase including Iceland, but Denmark rejected the offer. The US instead acquired Alaska from Russia for $7 million.

During World War I , Copenhagen and Washington resumed talks. In 1917, the United States purchased the Virgin Islands (formerly known as the Danish West Indies) from Denmark for $25 million to secure the Panama Canal, while recognising Danish sovereignty over Greenland.

During Denmark’s occupation by Nazi Germany, the United States invoked the Monroe Doctrine after losing contact with Greenland, which opposed any European expansion in the Americas. In April 1941, Washington signed a defence agreement with Denmark’s ambassador in the US, despite instructions from his government-in-exile. The deal allowed American troops to be stationed on Greenland, effectively turning the island into a US protectorate. Several bases were established, including Thule Air Base, now known as Pituffik.

The scramble for Greenland: Can Danish dependency resist Trump pressure?

After World War II , President Harry Truman proposed buying the island in 1946 for $100 million, but Denmark refused.

During the Cold War , Greenland proved strategically vital once again. The two countries signed a new agreement allowing the United States to strengthen its Thule base, which became a genuine US military enclave. "If there had been an exchange of intercontinental ballistic missiles aimed at the United States, they would have passed over the Arctic. That’s why they created this base, which still exists today. It is their first line of defence," said Blugeon-Mered, author of Les mondes polaires.

With this long history in mind, Blugeon-Mered said he was not surprised by the US president’s recent remarks. "Trump's 2019 proposal to buy Greenland attracted a lot of attention. Journalists called me, dismissing it as absurd, though it really isn’t. The issue involves political, strategic and resource stakes," he said.

With climate change and melting ice, Greenland now sits along newly accessible shipping routes that could shorten global trade routes. In January 2025, Trump expressed concern about Chinese and Russian activity in the Arctic region.

“You don’t even need binoculars. You look outside, you have Chinese ships all over the place. You have Russian ships all over the place. We’re not letting that happen,” Trump said.

The territory, covering two million square kilometres and 85 percent ice, also contains vast mineral reserves, including rare earths – essential for smartphones, computers and electric vehicles – as well as untapped oil.

"According to the US Geological Survey, Greenland could hold hydrocarbon reserves equivalent to around 31 billion barrels of oil, roughly 15 percent of Saudi Arabia’s reserves," Blugeon-Mered said.

Accessing these resources, however, is expected to be difficult. "All foreign companies that have attempted to locate commercially viable or exploitable deposits have come up empty," the researcher added.

For Blugeon-Mered, "this geo-economic battle is becoming a geopolitical one". He added: “When China takes an interest in Greenland, it is mainly for resources; when Russia does, it is primarily about strategic chokepoints. And when the Americans or Europeans are involved, all of these factors come into play.”

Faced with such ambitions, Greenland has consistently insisted it is not for sale and wants to determine its own future. In January 2025, a poll published in the Danish and Greenlandic press found that 85 percent of Greenlanders opposed annexation by the United States, while only 6 percent were in favour.

US officials say the tanker is part of a so-called shadow fleet that carries oil for countries such as Venezuela, Russia and Iran in violation of US sanctions .

The ship had thwarted an earlier attempt to board it last month near Venezuela, where a US raid on Saturday toppled the country's authoritarian president, Nicolas Maduro .

"The vessel was seized in the North Atlantic pursuant to a warrant issued by a US federal court," US European Command, which oversees American forces in the region, said in a statement on X.

After the operation, Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth posted that the US blockade on Venezuelan oil was in full effect "anywhere in the world".

Shortly after confirming the successful North Atlantic seizure, the US military announced a second sanctioned tanker ship had been seized in the Caribbean Sea.

US special forces at the weekend snatched Maduro and his wife from Caracas and flew them to New York to face trial on drug charges .

Since then, Trump has said that the United States will "run" Venezuela and US companies will control its critical oil industry.

The North Atlantic operation came despite Russia sending a submarine to escort the empty tanker, saying the vessel was sailing under the Russian flag and was far from the US coast.

"For reasons unclear to us, the Russian vessel is receiving heightened attention from the US and NATO militaries – attention that is clearly disproportionate to its peaceful status," Russia's foreign ministry said, prior to the seizure.

The vessel, formerly known as the Bella-1, switched its registration to Russia, changed its name to the Marinera and the tanker's crew reportedly painted a Russian flag on the tanker.

The tanker had been en route to the South American country but was not carrying cargo before it evaded the US blockade. It has been under US sanctions since 2024 over alleged ties to Iran and Hezbollah .

Trump said Tuesday that Venezuela will hand over tens of millions of barrels of oil to the United States after Maduro was seized.

Trump said 30–50 million barrels of "high‑quality, sanctioned" Venezuelan crude will be shipped to US ports, with the revenue – perhaps more than $2 billion at current market prices – placed under his personal control.

It was not clear whether Venezuela's new ruler – interim president Delcy Rodriguez – had agreed to hand over the oil, how the plan would work, or what its legal basis would be.

Rodriguez – a long-time member of Maduro's inner circle as vice president and energy minister – has vowed cooperation with the United States amid fears that Trump could pursue wider regime change.

Trump has said Washington is now "in charge" of the South American nation and has vowed a new doctrine of US dominance in the western hemisphere.</description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 16:35:07 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/94580246-ebd8-11f0-b088-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/50b4150bdcc087b35e1f7c058c0ed3363d449c0b.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item></channel></rss>
