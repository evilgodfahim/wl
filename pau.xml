Since its resurgence in 2021, the M23 armed group has seized vast tracts of the DRC's resource-rich east, capturing the Rubaya mine in North Kivu province in April 2024 with Rwanda 's help.

Scavengers said part of a hillside in the mining zone collapsed on Wednesday afternoon. A second landslide struck on Thursday morning.

The M23-appointed governor, Eraston Bahati Musanga, told AFP there were "at least 200 deaths".

AFP was unable to independently verify a toll.

The phone network has been down for several days there, and Congolese authorities and civil society groups fled the area when the M23 arrived.

Information is arriving "in dribs and drabs from motorbike couriers circulating the region", making it difficult to establish an accurate toll, a humanitarian source said.

The Rubaya mine produces 15 to 30 percent of the world's supply of coltan, a key component in the production of electronics such as laptops and mobile phones.

Experts estimate that the M23 makes around $800,000 a month from the mine thanks to a seven-dollars-a-kilo tax on the production and sale of coltan.

UN experts also accuse Rwanda – which denies providing the M23 with military support – of using the militia to syphon off the DRC's mineral riches.

Kinshasa on Sunday urged "the international community to fully grasp the scale of this tragedy" which is blamed on "armed occupation and an organised system of looting" by the Rwanda-backed militia.

Besides containing at least 60 percent of the world's coltan, the wider eastern DRC is also home to vast reserves of gold and tin.</description><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2026 15:52:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/d1d747f8-ff79-11f0-b1ca-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-30T213800Z-120793558-RC2PJDAOVU5I-RTRMADP-3-CONGO-MINING-COLLAPSE.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russian drone strike kills 15 miners in Ukraine's Dnipropetrovsk, officials say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-drone-strike-kills-12-wounds-7-ukraines-dnipropetrovsk-governor-says-2026-02-01/</link><description>KYIV, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Fifteen people were killed and seven wounded after a Russian drone struck a bus carrying miners in Ukraine's southeastern Dnipropetrovsk region, energy firm DTEK and government officials said on Sunday.

The attack came hours after President Volodymyr Zelenskiy announced that a second round of U.S.-brokered trilateral talks between Ukraine and Russia would take place next week.

DTEK said in a statement that Russian forces had carried out a "massive terrorist attack" on a company mine in the region, and that all the dead and wounded were its employees returning from a shift.

"Today, the enemy carried out a cynical and targeted attack on energy sector workers in the Dnipropetrovsk region," energy minister Denys Shmyhal wrote on the Telegram app.

Police said the attack took place in the city of Terenivka. Footage posted by the State Emergencies Service showed a charred bus with shattered windows that had veered off the road.

Earlier on Sunday, regional officials said at least nine had been wounded in Russian strikes on a maternity hospital and a residential building in the southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia.

Sunday's strikes also follow remarks by Zelenskiy earlier in the day that Russia - which said it had agreed to stop attacking Ukrainian energy infrastructure until February 1 - was still targeting logistics in Ukraine.</description><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2026 16:30:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Portugal launches $3 billion package to help rebuild after storm Kristin</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/portugal-launches-3-billion-package-help-rebuild-after-storm-kristin-2026-02-01/</link><description>LISBON, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Portugal's government approved a 2.5 billion euro ($3.0 billion) package of loans and incentives on Sunday to help people and businesses rebuild after the devastation caused by Storm Kristin, Prime Minister Luis Montenegro said.

Storm Kristin swept across central mainland Portugal early on Wednesday, with wind gusts topping 200 km/h (124 mph) and heavy rain that killed at least six people, damaged homes, factories and infrastructure, and cut power to hundreds of thousands, authorities said.

Montenegro said the public bank Banco de Fomento will launch a 1  billion euro loan programme to rebuild uninsured storm-damaged factories and a 500  million euro financing scheme to help them with their immediate cash-flow needs.

The remaining 1 billion euros in aid includes a financing line to help people rebuild uninsured primary homes, covering up to 10,000 euros per house, as well as social security subsidies for individuals facing hardship or income loss, worth up to 537 euros monthly per person or 1,075 euros per family.

He said that, given the "current exceptional circumstances", all reconstruction work will be exempt from licensing and prior urban planning, environmental and administrative approvals.

"We are mobilising all our resources to manage the emergency responsibly, but also with hope...once again, we will rebuild Portugal," he said at a press conference.

Montenegro said the government also extended the "state of calamity" declared in about 60 hard-hit municipalities until February 8, amid forecasts of more heavy rain and flooding, even though winds are expected to ease compared with last week.

A state of calamity - Portugal's highest civil protection alert used for major disasters - allows authorities to mobilise emergency and armed forces, fast-track procurement and limit access to affected areas without curbing constitutional rights.

Nearly 180,000 households were still without electricity on Sunday, as grid operator REN and distributor E-Redes scrambled to restore power, the companies said.

In December, Israel announced it would prevent 37 aid organisations, including MSF, from working in Gaza from March 1 for failing to submit detailed information about their Palestinian employees, drawing widespread condemnation from NGOs and the United Nations.

"The Ministry of Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism is moving to terminate the activities of Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) in the Gaza Strip ," the ministry said on Sunday.

The decision follows "MSF's failure to submit lists of local employees, a requirement applicable to all humanitarian organisations operating in the region", it added.

The ministry had earlier alleged that two MSF employees had links with Palestinian militant groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad , which the charity has vehemently denied.

On Sunday, the ministry said MSF had committed in early January to sharing the staff list, but ultimately refrained.

"Subsequently, MSF announced it does not intend to proceed with the registration process at all, contradicting its previous statements and the binding protocol," the ministry added, saying "MSF will cease its operations and depart the Gaza Strip by February 28".

MSF said it had tried for months to engage with Israeli authorities over the issue, but its attempts were unsuccessful.

MSF charged that the ministry's move was a "pretext to obstruct humanitarian assistance" to Gaza.

"Israeli authorities are forcing humanitarian organisations into an impossible choice between exposing staff to risk or interrupting critical medical care for people in desperate need," it said in a statement issued on Sunday.

"MSF did not hand over staff names because Israeli authorities failed to provide the concrete assurances required to guarantee our staff's safety, protect their personal data, and uphold the independence of our medical operation," it said.

Such demands by Israel will force aid organisations to pull out when "needs are overwhelming and health services are collapsing" in Gaza, it said.

"At a moment when more humanitarian assistance is urgently needed, it is being restricted rather than facilitated," the charity said, adding that it remained open for dialogue with Israeli authorities to maintain its services in Gaza and the occupied West Bank .

MSF says 15 of its employees have been killed over the course of the Gaza war.

Minister of Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism Amichai Chikli said the organisation had "abruptly changed" its position.

"It appears the organisation's employees do not meet the established criteria," Chikli said.

MSF has long been a key provider of medical and humanitarian aid in Gaza, particularly since the war broke out in October 2023 after Hamas's attack on Israel.

The charity says it currently provides at least 20 percent of hospital beds in the territory and operates around 20 health centres.

In 2025 alone, it carried out more than 800,000 medical consultations and more than 10,000 infant deliveries, and it also provides drinking water.

Aid groups warn that without international support provided by organisations such as MSF, critical services such as emergency care, maternal health and paediatric treatment could collapse entirely in Gaza, leaving hundreds of thousands of residents without basic medical care.

As they did with MSF, the Israeli authorities have repeatedly accused the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA , of providing cover for Hamas militants, claiming that some of its employees even took part in the October 7, 2023 attack.

A series of investigations, including one led by France's former foreign minister Catherine Colonna, found some "neutrality-related issues" at UNRWA but stressed Israel had not provided conclusive evidence for its headline allegation.

Last month, Israeli authorities began demolishing buildings at UNRWA's headquarters in east Jerusalem, which the organisation described as an "unprecedented attack".

UNRWA has now been banned from operating in east Jerusalem, but it continues to operate in Gaza and the Israeli-occupied West Bank.</description><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2026 17:34:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/9e685032-ff8e-11f0-892f-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/000-92C28KB.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russian drone strike on bus transporting Ukrainian energy sector workers kills 15</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260201-russian-drone-strike-bus-transporting-ukrainian-energy-sector-workers-kills-15</link><description>Fifteen people were killed ​and seven wounded after a Russian drone struck a ‍bus carrying miners in Ukraine 's southeastern Dnipropetrovsk region, energy firm DTEK and government officials said ​on Sunday.

Earlier on Sunday, regional officials said at least nine had been wounded in Russian strikes on a maternity hospital and a residential building in the southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia.

In a Telegram post, Ukraine's emergency service said the strike wounded three women in the hospital in Zaporizhzhia, and also sparked a fire in the gynecology reception area that was later extinguished. Regional administration head Ivan Fedorov later said the number of injured had risen to six.

Sunday's strikes also follow remarks by ‍Zelensky earlier in the day that Russia – which said it had agreed to ‌ stop attacking Ukrainian ​energy infrastructure until February 1 – was still targeting logistics in Ukraine.

In the past week, Russia has struck energy assets in the southern Ukrainian city of Odesa and in Kharkiv in the northeast. It also hit the Kyiv region on Wednesday, killing two people and injuring four.

Overnight into Sunday, Russia launched 90 attack drones , with 14 striking nine locations, Ukraine’s air force said in a Telegram post. A woman and a man were killed in an overnight drone strike in Dnipro, according to local administration head Oleksandr Hanzha.

Russian shelling also hit central Kherson, a city in southern Ukraine, soon after 7am, seriously wounding a 59-year-old woman, according to a Facebook post by the municipal military administration.

Russia's defence ministry on Sunday morning said its forces had used operational-tactical aviation, attack drones, missile forces and artillery to strike transport infrastructure used by Ukrainian forces.

In a separate post Sunday, it said that Russian air defences shot down 21 Ukrainian drones flying over southwestern and western Russia. It did not mention any casualties or damage.</description><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2026 17:34:17 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/980587ba-ff88-11f0-82c2-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/000-437N49E.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Czechs rally to support president in his growing rift with government</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/czechs-rally-support-president-his-growing-rift-with-government-2026-02-01/</link><description>PRAGUE, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of Czechs rallied on Sunday in support of President Peter Pavel after he refused to approve the nomination of a minister to the new eurosceptic coalition government who performed a Nazi salute and posted Nazi memorabilia.

In an escalating rift with the government, the pro-EU and pro-Ukraine Pavel last week accused Foreign Minister Petr Macinka of sending text messages via his adviser that threatened the president with "consequences" if he continued to oppose Filip Turek's nomination as Czech environment minister.

Turek, a member of Macinka's right-wing Motorists party, has faced criticism for making a Nazi salute and posting Nazi memorabilia. Turek has put his behaviour down to bad taste rather than any affinity for Nazism or racism.

Supporters of the president filled Prague's Old Town Square and nearby Wenceslas Square, while police closed off a number of streets in the area.

Many protesters waved EU and Czech flags and carried signs saying "We stand with the president". Some voiced support for Ukraine and opposition to Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis' coalition government.

Police gave no official estimate of the size of the protest but organizers put the number at 80,000 to 90,000 people, and said they planned to hold further demonstrations in other towns across the Czech Republic on February 15.

After winning an October election, Babis' populist ANO party cobbled together a coalition with the Motorists and the far-right, pro-Russian SPD.

Pavel appointed Babis in December but objected to Turek's inclusion in the list of cabinet nominees and then made public the messages Macinka sent last week, describing them as blackmail. He has referred the messages for review by the National Organized Crime Agency.

Macinka has rejected the president's accusation of blackmail over the text messages, saying they were all part of a typical political negotiation.

Commenting on the matter on Czech television on Sunday, Macinka said: "Politics is not a discipline for princesses... it is a very demanding discipline. Everyone who is in top politics should show greater resilience."</description><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2026 17:54:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/C4GHLDOYDZLVHD3YLYVR4WYPLE.jpg?auth=56913fbf0c744b5b79ef7a71229b452ecdc20344fa337dfa763881ac5028ba57&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Top US, Israeli generals meet at Pentagon amid soaring Iran tensions</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/top-us-israeli-generals-meet-pentagon-amid-soaring-iran-tensions-2026-02-01/</link><description>Feb 1 (Reuters) - The top U.S. and Israeli generals held talks at the Pentagon on Friday amid soaring tensions with Iran, two U.S. officials told Reuters on Sunday, speaking on condition of anonymity.

The officials did not offer details about the closed-door discussions between U.S. General Dan Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Eyal Zamir, the Israeli armed forces chief of staff. The meeting has not been previously reported.

The United States has ramped up its naval presence and hiked its air defenses in the Middle East after President Donald Trump repeatedly threatened Iran, trying to pressure it to the negotiating table.

The interior ministry said security units arrested all members of the group, which it said had carried out several strikes on the airport in recent months, after surveillance of suspected launch sites in several areas of the capital.

The weapons used in the attacks originated from Lebanon’s Hezbollah, an ally of former President Bashar al-Assad that once had a large military presence across Syria supporting Assad’s army, the ministry said.

Hezbollah denied the allegations and said it had no activity or ties with any group inside Syria.

Authorities said they also seized a number of drones the group was preparing to use in further operations.

The ministry said only that the detainees had links to unidentified "foreign entities," without mentioning Hezbollah or Iran.

Reuters reported in November that Washington was planning to establish a military presence at an airbase in Damascus to help enable a security pact that Washington is brokering between Syria and Israel. The government denied the report.

Security sources say Hezbollah left behind weapons stockpiles, including drones, in parts of Syria after withdrawing its forces following the collapse of Assad’s rule.</description><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2026 19:28:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Texas Democrat's win a 'wake-up call' for Republicans ahead of 2026 elections</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/texas-democrats-win-wake-up-call-republicans-ahead-2026-elections-2026-02-01/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Feb 1 (Reuters) - A Democratic candidate won a special election for the Texas state senate by a double-digit margin, taking control from Republicans for the first time in decades in a result the losing candidate on Sunday called "a wake-up call" for the midterm elections.

The victory for a seat vacated by a four-term Republican followed a string of wins in recent months for the Democratic Party in local and state elections across the country, offering hope for national Democrats looking to claw back power in midterm elections later this year.

Taylor Rehmet, a union machinist and U.S. Air Force veteran, won on Saturday in the conservative area near Dallas by more than 14 percentage points over Republican activist Leigh Wambsganss, whom President Donald Trump had urged voters to rally behind.

In a Sunday statement, Wambsganss said she congratulated Rehmet on his victory and called the Democratic win a "wake-up call" for local and national Republicans.

"The Democrats were energized," Wambsganss said. "Too many Republicans stayed home."

Trump on Saturday touted Wambsganss as a "true MAGA Warrior" and tried to rally voters to the polls on her behalf.

But on Sunday he distanced himself from the loss, saying he was not involved as it was a “local Texas race.”

“I’m not on the ballot, so you don’t know whether or not it’s transferable,” Trump said.

The district is more Republican than overall Tarrant County, which Trump won by 5 percentage points in the 2024 presidential election but Joe Biden won in 2020 by fewer than 2,000 votes.

Wambsganss said she expects to defeat Rehmet when they face off again in the November election for the seat's full four-year term.

But Democrats cited rising momentum heading into the midterm elections in November, when control of Congress is at stake. "Democrats are building on our historic overperformance, and we’re not slowing down," Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin wrote in a social media post.

Saturday's outcome wasn't entirely unexpected. In the November election that led to the runoff, Rehmet had the top result with 48%, while Wambsganss and John Huffman split the Republican vote.

Rehmet's election follows a series of victories for the party nationwide since Trump started his second term last year.

In November, Democrats won governors' races in Democratic-friendly New Jersey and flipped back the gubernatorial control in Virginia.

In December, Democrats won special elections in more conservative Kentucky and Iowa, but Republicans held off a Democratic upset in a special election victory for a Tennessee congressional seat after U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, concerned about his slim Republican majority, rallied national Republicans.

The November 2026 midterm election includes races for Congress and is often seen as a referendum on the White House, as well as some gubernatorial elections across the country.

Democrats, currently the minority party in both chambers of Congress, hope to flip Republicans' majorities.

With a handful of open seats, Republicans currently hold a slim 218-213 edge in the U.S. House, but that will narrow further after the swearing-in of Representative-elect Christian Menefee , a Texas Democrat who also won on Saturday to fill a vacancy in a longtime Democratic district whose previous representative died in March.

The 53-47 Republican-controlled U.S. Senate will pose a bigger challenge for Democrats, but party leaders are encouraged by their candidates who have won before in competitive states like North Carolina, Maine, Ohio and even Alaska.

Trump has encouraged primary challengers to some incumbent Republican senators, such as Louisiana’s Bill Cassidy , and suggested on Sunday he will make an endorsement in the three-way Republican contest in Texas that includes another incumbent, Senator John Cornyn, state Attorney General Ken Paxton and Representative Wesley Hunt.

“I like all of them,” Trump said.

Democratic strategists urged their party to continue emphasizing affordability and pocketbook issues.

"This win is another rejection of the chaos that Trump is creating, and people don't want chaos in their communities," Meghan Hays, a former Biden campaign and White House official, said in a Sunday interview with Reuters.

"Ahead of November, Democrats need to focus on kitchen-table issues and they need to have real solutions. That's what you're seeing in these local races."</description><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2026 19:45:39 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/XG4HHS7IYROX3PPHSGPA4JDIBU.jpg?auth=ffd74632b7b4f80dd999716fb0d97862b41ec0f4ced1b432ef1a860fc086788a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran declares European armies 'terrorist groups' in retaliation for IRGC designation</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260201-iran-declares-european-armies-terrorist-groups-in-retaliation-for-irgc-designation</link><description>Iran has declared European countries' armies "terrorist groups", its parliament speaker said Sunday, following the EU's decision to apply the same designation to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.

Lawmakers wore the green uniform of the Guards in a display of solidarity at the legislative session, where they chanted "Death to America", "Death to Israel" and "Shame on you, Europe", state television footage showed.

Slamming the bloc's "irresponsible action", speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf said that under "Article 7 of the Law on Countermeasures Against the Declaration of the IRGC as a Terrorist Organisation, the armies of European countries are considered terrorist groups".

It remained unclear what immediate impact the decision would have.

The law was first passed in 2019, when the United States classified the Guards as a terrorist organisation.

Sunday's session was held on the 47th anniversary of the return from exile of the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who founded the Islamic republic in 1979.

The Guards are the ideological arm of Iran's military, tasked with safeguarding the Islamic revolution from external and internal threats.

They have been accused by Western governments of orchestrating a crackdown on a recent protest movement that left thousands dead.

Tehran has attributed the violence to "terrorist acts" fomented by the United States and Israel.

The European Union agreed on Thursday to list the body as a "terrorist organisation" over the response to the protests.

The step matched similar classifications enacted by the United States, Canada and Australia.

Ghalibaf said the decision, "which was carried out in compliance with the orders of the American president and the leaders of the Zionist regime, accelerated Europe's path to becoming irrelevant in the future world order".

The move, he added, had only increased domestic support for the Guards.

The legislative session came as Iran and the United States have traded warnings and threats of potential military action.

Tehran's response to the protests prompted US President Donald Trump to threaten to intervene, dispatching an aircraft carrier group to the region.

In recent days, however, both sides have insisted they remain willing to talk.

"Contrary to the hype of the contrived media war, structural arrangements for negotiations are progressing," Ali Larijani, head of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, said on Saturday.

Trump later confirmed that dialogue was taking place, but without withdrawing his earlier threats. He told Fox News that Iran was "talking to us, and we'll see if we can do something, otherwise we'll see what happens... we have a big fleet heading out there".

Trump has previously said he believes Iran will make a deal over its nuclear and missile programmes rather than face US military action.

Tehran, meanwhile, has said it is ready for nuclear talks if its missile and defence capabilities are not on the agenda.

Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said Saturday that "a war would be in the interest of neither Iran, nor the United States, nor the region", during a call with his Egyptian counterpart Abdel Fattah al-Sisi , according to Pezeshkian's office.

Qatari premier Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al, who also serves as foreign minister, held talks in Iran Saturday to try to "de-escalate tensions", the kingdom's foreign ministry said.

Firouzeh, a 43-year-old homemaker who declined to give her full name, said the recent tensions have left her "very worried and scared".

They have returned to Minnesota, according to Texas Rep. Joaquin Castro.

The boy and his dad, Adrian Conejo Arias, who is originally from Ecuador, were detained in a Minneapolis suburb on January 20. They were taken to a detention facility in Dilley, Texas.

Katherine Schneider, a spokesperson for the Democratic congressman, confirmed the two had arrived home. She said Castro picked them up from Dilley on Saturday night and escorted them home on Sunday to Minnesota.

In a statement, US Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said Immigration and Customs Enforcement did not target or arrest Liam Conejo Ramos, and that his mother refused to take him after his father’s apprehension. His father told officers he wanted Liam to be with him, she said.

“The Trump administration is committed to restoring the rule of law and common sense to our immigration system, and will continue to fight for the arrest, detention, and removal of aliens who have no right to be in this country,” McLaughlin said.

The government said the boy's father entered the U.S. illegally from Ecuador in December 2024. The family’s lawyer said he has an asylum claim pending that allows him to stay in the U.S.

Images of the young boy wearing a blue bunny hat and Spider-Man backpack and surrounded by immigration officers drew outrage about the Trump administration's crackdown in Minneapolis.

In his order granting the release, US District Judge Fred Biery blasted the administration, writing, “The case has its genesis in the ill-conceived and incompetently-implemented government pursuit of daily deportation quotas, apparently even if it requires traumatizing children.”

Neighbors and school officials say that federal immigration officers used the preschooler as “bait” by telling him to knock on the door to his house so that his mother would answer. The Department of Homeland Security has called that description of events an “abject lie.” It said the father fled on foot and left the boy in a running vehicle in their driveway.

Castro wrote a letter to Liam while they were on the plane to Minnesota, in which he told the young boy he has “moved the world.”

“Your family, school and many strangers said prayers for you and offered whatever they could do to see you back home,” Castro wrote. A photo of the letter was posted on social media. “Don’t let anyone tell you this isn’t your home. America became the most powerful, prosperous nation on earth because of immigrants not in spite of them.”

Photos on Castro’s social media showed Liam wearing his blue bunny hat and with a Pikachu backpack.

US Sen. Amy Klobuchar , a Democrat from Minnesota, welcomed the boy back to Minnesota, saying in a social media post that he “should be in school and with family — not in detention.” The senator added: “Now ICE needs to leave.”

US Rep. Ilhan Omar, also a Democrat from Minnesota, posted a photo to social media of her with Liam, his father and Castro in which she is holding Liam’s Spider-Man backpack. “Welcome home Liam,” she posted with two hearts.</description><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2026 21:47:21 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/3cee23ce-ffb4-11f0-aee6-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26032616849393.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Washington scolds Cuba after crowds heckle US diplomat</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/washington-scolds-cuba-after-crowds-heckle-us-diplomat-2026-02-01/</link><description>HAVANA, Feb 1 (Reuters) - The United States on Sunday accused Cuba of interfering with the work of its top diplomat in Havana after small groups of Cubans jeered at him during meetings with residents and church representatives outside the capital.

Amid rising tensions between the two countries, the State Department on social media accused the Cuban government of "failed intimidation tactics," and it demanded that Havana stop "sending individuals to interfere with the diplomatic work" of U.S. Charge d'Affaires Mike Hammer.

Friction has increased between the long-time foes after U.S. President Donald Trump last week declared Cuba "an unusual and extraordinary threat" to U.S. national security and said he would slap tariffs on any country that delivered oil to the communist-run Caribbean island.

Trump on Sunday said Cuba was "a failing nation" but added: "I think we're going to make a deal with Cuba."

Hammer, a career diplomat who arrived in Cuba in late 2024, has traveled the island widely to meet with political dissidents, Catholic Church representatives and others. The Cuban government accuses him of seeking to foment unrest.

On Saturday, he posted a video describing alleged harassment following a meeting with local church leaders.

"When I left the parish, a few communists, surely frustrated by how bad the revolution is going, shouted obscenities at me," Hammer said in the video on social media.

Subsequently, several more videos surfaced showing small groups of people in two locations during nighttime blackouts, taunting Hammer with cries of "Assassin!" and "Imperialist!"

Reuters could not identify the individuals in the videos, and Cuba's government has not commented on them.

Cuba's foreign ministry last year complained to Hammer about behavior it said was "interventionist" and alleged he incited Cubans to commit crimes and attack the state.

The U.S. Embassy, which produces the videos, has denied those charges and says Hammer is simply doing his job.

The two neighboring countries have been at odds since Fidel Castro's 1959 revolution, but a crippling economic crisis on the island and stepped up pressure from the Trump administration have recently brought the conflict to a head.</description><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2026 22:51:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7TJIOFZRDFJGRJIBSHZQ4WMSRE.jpg?auth=214eb15d155fd0cbc8af578ebd253268ab5ebf03eb45e6870462cf54ca9d572f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Syrian Kurdish forces announce curfew in northeast cities ahead of deal with Damascus</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260201-syrian-kurdish-forces-announce-curfew-northeast-cities-deal-damascus</link><description>Syrian Kurdish security forces on Sunday announced a curfew early next week in two cities in the country's northeast, ahead of the implementation of a recent deal struck with the Islamist-led government in Damascus.

Damascus and Kurdish forces reached a comprehensive agreement on Friday to gradually integrate the Kurds' military and civilian institutions into the state, after the Kurds ceded territory to advancing government forces in recent weeks.

Mazloum Abdi, head of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, has said the deal would be implemented on the ground from Monday, with both sides to pull forces back from frontline positions in parts of the northeast, and from the town of Kobane in the north.

He said a "limited internal security force" would enter parts of Hasakeh and Qamishli but that "no military forces will enter any Kurdish city or town".

Kurdish security forces announced a curfew in the northeastern city of Hasakeh from 6:00 am (0300 GMT) to 6:00 pm on Monday, and in the northeast's main Kurdish city of Qamishli on Tuesday, during the same hours.

It said the move was "to maintain security, stability and the safety of residents".

A source from the Kurds' security forces said a government security delegation visited its headquarters in Qamishli on Sunday.

The text of Friday's deal maintains an ongoing ceasefire and introduces a "gradual integration" of the Kurdish forces and administrative institutions.

It appeared to include some of the Kurds' demands, such as establishing brigades of fighters from the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in Kurdish-majority areas.

The government's push to extend its authority across the country was a blow to the Kurds.

They had sought to preserve the de facto autonomy they exercised after seizing swathes of north and northeast Syria in battles against the Islamic State (IS) jihadist group during Syria's civil war, backed by a US-led coalition.

In Qamishli on Sunday, thousands of Kurdish men, women and children filled the streets in a show of solidarity, waving Kurdish flags and holding up pictures of fighters who were killed, an AFP correspondent said.

Student Barine Hamza, 18, said "we have come out for Kurdish unity".

"We are afraid of being betrayed because we do not trust this government," she said.

Housewife Nourshana Mohammed, 40, said that "the presence of the SDF is important for us. It protects us Kurds and saved us" from IS.

Information Minister Hamza Mustafa told state media on Friday that the agreement included the handover of some oil fields, the Qamishli airport and border crossings to the government within 10 days.

He said SDF fighters would be integrated on an individual basis into several brigades being formed under the army's command.

The United States, which has drawn close to Syria's new Islamist authorities, recently said the purpose of its alliance with the Kurdish forces was largely over.

Also on Sunday, the head of internal security in Aleppo province, Mohammed Abdul Ghani, told reporters he met with Kurdish forces in Kobane to discuss security matters there "and begin the deployment of interior ministry forces", without announcing a timeframe.

He said technical details still needed to be settled, but that the response from the Kurdish side was "positive".

Located in Aleppo province more than 200 kilometres (125 miles) from other Kurdish-held areas in Syria's northeast, Kobane is hemmed in by the Turkish border to the north and Syrian government forces on other sides.

Kurdish forces liberated Kobane from a lengthy siege by IS in 2015 and it took on symbolic value as their first major victory against the jihadists.

On Saturday, NGOs and a Turkish MP said Turkish authorities had blocked a convoy carrying aid to Kobane from across the border.</description><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2026 22:52:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/c02ce11c-fdc0-11f0-8134-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/000-93TV363-1.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Japan PM Takaichi's party poised for landslide victory, Asahi poll shows</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/japan-pm-takaichis-party-poised-landslide-victory-asahi-poll-shows-2026-02-01/</link><description>TOKYO, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's party is likely to score a landslide victory in next week's lower house election, a survey by the Asahi newspaper showed.

A strong showing in Sunday's election would solidify Takaichi's grip on her party and give her a mandate for her expansionary fiscal policy, which could heighten concerns about Japan's finances and push bond yields higher.

Takaichi's Liberal Democratic Party is likely to well exceed a majority of 233 seats out of 465 seats up for grabs in the lower house, according to Asahi's poll released on Sunday. That would be an increase from 198 seats now.

Together with LDP's coalition partner, the Japan Innovation Party or Ishin, the ruling alliance will likely reach 300 seats, the poll showed.

The largest opposition party, the Centrist Reform Alliance, is struggling and could lose half its 167 seats, the Asahi said.

Takaichi's ruling coalition currently holds a slim majority in the powerful lower house but has a minority in the upper house.</description><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2026 23:27:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7H74KVJ4JNI7XHU252PTZSQ4CU.jpg?auth=4059b8db913208206302d8a1203a3c2a0ce45d416e46c1094dc8bb9d3ec73fb9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Former UK minister Mandelson quits Labour after new Epstein revelations, media say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/former-uk-minister-mandelson-quits-labour-after-new-epstein-revelations-media-2026-02-01/</link><description>LONDON, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Former British government minister Peter Mandelson has resigned as a member of Prime Minister Keir Starmer's Labour Party after new reports of his ties with disgraced U.S. financier Jeffrey Epstein, media reported on Sunday.

Mandelson, who was fired by Starmer as Britain's ambassador to the United States last year after previous revelations about his connections to Epstein, said he did not wish to cause "further embarrassment" to Labour, the reports said.

"I have been further linked this weekend to the understandable furore surrounding Jeffrey Epstein and I feel regretful and sorry about this," Mandelson said in a letter to the Labour Party reported by the BBC and other news organisations, which Reuters was not immediately able to obtain.

Mandelson said he believed allegations about financial payments to him by Epstein, which appeared in British media based on files released by the U.S. Justice Department, were false and he would investigate them.

"While doing this I do not wish to cause further embarrassment to the Labour Party and I am therefore stepping down from membership of the party," the letter said.

Mandelson was key to the Labour Party's electoral success when Tony Blair was prime minister starting in the 1990s.

He came under scrutiny last year after U.S. lawmakers released documents including a letter in which he called Epstein "my best pal", leading to his dismissal as Britain's envoy in Washington.

Mandelson also had a turbulent earlier career in domestic politics. In 1998, he quit as trade minister over a loan he received from a fellow minister to buy a house amid questions over conflict of interest.

A second stint in the cabinet also ended in a resignation in 2001 when he was forced out over his alleged involvement in a passport scandal involving an Indian billionaire. He was later cleared of acting improperly.

Mandelson, a former European Union trade commissioner, is on leave of absence as a member of the upper house of Britain's national parliament.

Separately, Starmer said on Saturday that Britain's former Prince Andrew should testify before a U.S. congressional committee, following new revelations about his links to Epstein.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 02:11:07 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WBBVOO4X2FLZ5HJCJCUVWMYMEI.jpg?auth=87a7e656f51a5e3e794fe8ba5e8cbc71a65ca6d7fd35f7ceecba9880432bcdcd&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UK foreign minister says Ethiopia visit to focus on migration</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-foreign-minister-says-ethiopia-visit-focus-migration-2026-02-02/</link><description>LONDON, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Britain's foreign minister said she would use a visit to Ethiopia on Monday to focus on measures to try to stem rising numbers of migrants from the Horn of Africa seeking to reach the United Kingdom.

Yvette Cooper said job creation partnerships would dissuade people from leaving Ethiopia while stronger law enforcement cooperation was essential to counter smuggler gangs and speed up returns of migrants with no right to stay in Britain.

"We are working together to tackle the economic drivers of illegal migration and the criminal gangs who operate globally, profiting from trading in people," Cooper said in a statement.

"That includes new partnerships to improve trade and create thousands of good jobs in Ethiopia so people can find a better life back home instead of making perilous journeys."

Successive British governments have tried to tackle illegal immigration, an issue which has helped to propel populist campaigner Nigel Farage's Reform UK party into a commanding opinion poll lead.

Around 30% of people crossing the English Channel on small boat over the past two years were nationals from Ethiopia, Eritrea, Somalia and Sudan, the British foreign ministry said.

To help boost job creation in Ethiopia, Cooper is due to sign an agreement with the country to take forward two energy-transmission projects led by Gridworks, a UK investment organisation.

She was also due to announce 17 million pounds worth of funding for tackling violence against women and girls, assistance for 68,000 children suffering malnutrition, and for projects working with displaced people.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 02:11:22 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ICH6HKJEOZPG3FJ7SFVIBAAZPQ.jpg?auth=1bd71781fe746fcd646c6ecea92fda31e1cd44384d76c40190a0821dd4c1cee5&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UK’s Peter Mandelson resigns from Labour party after Epstein ties resurface</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260202-uk-ex-ambassador-quits-labour-epstein-links</link><description>Former British ambassador to Washington Peter Mandelson quit the Labour Party Sunday, seeking to avoid causing it "further embarrassment" after newly released US documents revived scrutiny of his connection to late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

Mandelson, 72, who was sacked as Britain's ambassador to the United States last year over his ties to Epstein, allegedly received several payments from Epstein in the early 2000s, according to documents released on Friday by the US Department of Justice and reported in British media Sunday.

"Allegations which I believe to be false that he made financial payments to me 20 years ago, and of which I have no record or recollection, need investigating by me," Mandelson wrote in a letter to Labour general secretary Hollie Ridley.

"While doing this I do not wish to cause further embarrassment to the Labour Party and I am therefore stepping down from membership of the party," he added, saying he felt "regretful and sorry about this".

Bank records released by the US Justice Department suggest Epstein transferred a total of $75,000 (55,000 pounds) in three payments to bank accounts linked to Mandelson between 2003 and 2004.

Speaking earlier Sunday on the BBC, Mandelson said he had no memory of the transfers and did not know whether the documents were authentic.

Mandelson also appears in newly released, undated photographs, wearing a T?shirt and underwear beside a woman whose face has been redacted by US authorities.

He told the BBC he "cannot place the location or the woman and I cannot think what the circumstances were".

Other documents suggest Epstein sent 10,000 pounds in 2009 to Reinaldo Avila da Silva, Mandelson's partner, at a time when Mandelson was serving as a government minister.

The former ambassador was removed from his post in September after being appointed by Prime Minister Keir Starmer in late 2024.

Mandelson apologised in January for maintaining his friendship with Epstein, having initially refused to do so on the grounds that he was not complicit.

Former prince Andrew, stripped of his royal titles last year over his ties to Epstein, was also named in the files released on Friday.

A second woman alleged Sunday that Epstein sent her to Britain in 2010 for a sexual encounter with Andrew, her lawyer told the BBC.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 02:11:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/f44f5260-ffcb-11f0-be4c-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/1a137762bb4f48f5d63f4cf2319cc6c22a897434.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Olivia Dean named best new artist</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/grammys-poised-rewrite-musics-record-books-2026-02-01/</link><description>LOS ANGELES, Feb 1 (Reuters) - - British soul-pop singer Olivia Dean was named best new artist, and hip-hop megastar Kendrick Lamar claimed the prize for best rap album with "GNX," his chart-topping sixth studio set, as the 68th Grammy Awards got under way on Sunday.

The London-born Dean, 26, edged out fellow newcomers Leon Thomas, KATSEYE, The Marias, Addison Rae, sombr, Alex Warren and Lola Young in the Grammy race to crown the greatest performer among a field of rising new talents.

Accepting her award from the stage of the Crypto.com Arena in downtown Los Angeles, Dean paid tribute to her grandmother, who immigrated to Britain from Guyana as a teenager seeking a new life.

"I must say I'm up here as a granddaughter of an immigrant," she said, evoking cheers from the star-studded audience. "I am a product of bravery and I think those people deserve to be celebrated. We're nothing without each other."

Lamar, 38, the West Coast hip-hop sensation regarded as one of the greatest rap artists of all time, entered Sunday's Grammy Awards with nominations in nine categories and immediately clinched the award for best rap album with "GNX."

Lamar's "GNX" was also vying for the top award of the night, album of the year, facing stiff competition from Puerto Rican rapper Bad Bunny and pop chameleon Lady Gaga.

Bad Bunny was competing for best album with "Debí Tirar Más Fotos," which could make history as the first Spanish‑language winner in that category. The award went last year to Beyoncé’s "Cowboy Carter."

If Lamar wins for "GNX," he would be the first solo male rapper to win the top award. Only two hip-hop musicians have been honored in the category - female artist Lauryn Hill and the duo Outkast.

For Gaga, the best album prize would be the first of her celebrated career. She has never won any of the top four Grammy trophies despite more than two decades in the music business. This year, she is competing with the album "Mayhem," described by critics as a return to her dark dance-pop roots.

Trevor Noah returned to host the festivities for a sixth time, which he has said would be his last Grammys gig. The show aired live on the CBS network from the Crypto.com Arena in downtown Los Angeles.

Bad Bunny's Grammy night recognition carried strong political overtones.

The singer-producer skipped the continental United States on his recent concert tour, saying he feared federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents carrying out U.S. President Donald Trump's deportation drive would show up to arrest his fans.

"ICE out," he said from the stage, accepting the award for best album of Latin urban music for "Debí Tirar Más Fotos."

His selection to perform at the coming Super Bowl halftime show next Sunday drew objections from Trump and other critics who argued the National Football League championship game's entertainment should be performed in English.

The world of KPop also earned a Grammy for the first time.

"Golden," the smash hit from the Netflix (NFLX.O) , opens new tab animated movie "KPop Demon Hunters," won an early award for best song written for visual media. It also was competing for two of the top awards of the night - best record and best song. The song is performed by a fictional band named HUNTR/X. Its real-life members are EJAE, Audrey Nun and Rein Ami.

The best record and best song contests also include "APT.," a duet between Bruno Mars and KPop singer Rosé.

Legendary filmmaker Steven Spielberg, 79, achieved EGOT status — one of the rarest honors in the entertainment industry — after winning his first Grammy award for best music film for "Music by John Williams," which he produced. EGOT stands for Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony.

Grammy winners are chosen by the roughly 15,000 voting members of the Recording Academy — industry peers including artists, songwriters, producers and engineers — whose ranks have been revamped over the past seven years to increase diversity. About 1,000 Latin Grammys voters became eligible to vote this year, and 73% of members have joined since 2019.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 04:36:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/QOF57H2D3JMR5HJNAMQEOXAGZY.jpg?auth=dcfab9a922431256d56254903cdcf9c52a5e90ca1c3f4941e18fa23a1cd8a9e6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Bad Bunny, Billie Eilish call out ICE at the 2026 Grammy Awards</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/culture/20260202-bad-bunny-billie-eilish-call-out-ice-at-the-2026-grammy-awards</link><description>Rapper Kendrick Lamar on Sunday won four Grammys while Bad Bunny and Lady Gaga won two each -- but all three still were in the hunt for history on music's biggest night.

Bad Bunny meanwhile earned cheers as he delivered a powerful political message, ripping the nationwide immigration raids that have polarised America,  a pointed theme at the 68th annual Grammy Awards.

"Before I say thanks to God, I'm gonna say 'ICE out'," Bad Bunny said as he accepted the award for best musica urbana album for his "Debi Tirar Mas Fotos" ("I Should Have Taken More Photos").

"We're not savages, we're not animals, we're not aliens; we are humans and we are Americans," the 31-year-old Puerto Rican singer said, one week before he takes one of the world's biggest stages, headlining the Super Bowl halftime show.

Billie Eilish won song of the year for “Wildflower” at the 2026 Grammy Awards and used the moment to add her voice to the chorus of musicians criticising immigration authorities Sunday.

“No one is illegal on stolen land,” she said while accepting the award for the song from her 2024 album “Hit Me Hard and Soft.” "(Expletive) ICE is all I want to say.”

It was a big moment on a night of hard-hitting performances, poignant speeches and one-liners from six-time host Trevor Noah.

Lamar scooped up four awards in the rap categories including best rap album for "GNX," while Gaga won for best pop vocal album and best dance pop recording.

"I just want to say for women in music that I know sometimes when you're in the studio with a bunch of guys, it can be hard. So I urge you to always listen to yourself and always fight for your ideas," Lady Gaga said.

Britain's Olivia Dean was crowned Best New Artist.

"I'm not good at talking about myself, but I express it through the music. It's an honor to be here," said Lamar, a Pulitzer Prize winner.

The 38-year-old California native, who won five Grammys last year thanks to his smash diss track "Not Like Us," is also up for Record of the Year for "Luther" featuring R&amp;B artist SZA.

Standing in Lamar's way for Album of the Year is Bad Bunny, who is in the middle of a world tour, just months after a hugely successful residency in San Juan.

His "Un verano sin ti" (2022) was the first Spanish-language album nominated for Album of the Year honors. A win on Sunday would give Bad Bunny another mention in the history books.

Lady Gaga, 39, made a splashy comeback to touring with "Mayhem," her collection of pop bangers with a dark edge that embraces her dramatic side. She has seven nominations.

A win for Album of the Year would complete her hat trick of top awards.

She took Record and Song of the Year honors seven years ago for the soundtrack hit "Shallow," from "A Star is Born" -- which also earned her an Oscar.

Also nominated for Album of the Year are: pop princess Sabrina Carpenter; R&amp;B singer-songwriter Leon Thomas; Tyler, the Creator; hip-hop duo Clipse (Pusha T and Malice); and Bieber -- with his first studio effort in four years.

Noah repeatedly joked with the 31-year-old Latin megastar, born Benito Antonio Martinez Ocasio, about not performing due to Super Bowl contractual restrictions -- and even sang a few bars in Spanish himself before Bad Bunny indulged with a short verse.

K-pop singer Rose and Bruno Mars kicked off the proceedings with a high-octane performance of "APT.," before Noah took to the stage.

Lady Gaga offered an energetic version of "Abracadabra" and Justin Bieber stripped to his boxers for his turn on stage.

Reba McEntire and Lauryn Hill sang in honor of those who died over the last year in the world of music. Late rocker Ozzy Osbourne's wife Sharon and children Kelly and Jack looked on as Post Malone paid tribute.

"Golden," from the Netflix animated smash hit "KPop Demon Hunters," won the prize for best song written for visual media, and top Oscar nominee "Sinners" won two soundtrack awards.

The majority of the 95 awards were handed out at a pre-gala ceremony before the televised broadcast.

Joni Mitchell -- one of several attendees wearing an "ICE OUT" pin in protest of US President Donald Trump's sweeping immigration crackdown -- took a prize for best historical album.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 04:38:32 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/cd818b9e-ffe9-11f0-9e7e-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-02-02T022238Z-509359046-HP1EM2206LOKP-RTRMADP-3-AWARDS-GRAMMYS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Live: Trump hopes to reach a deal with Iran, keeps military option on table</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260202-live-trump-hopes-to-reach-a-deal-with-iran-keeps-military-option-on-table</link><description>Oil prices plunged Monday after Donald Trump said he was hopeful of reaching a deal with Iran , easing concerns about a conflict between the two in the crude-rich region.

The daughter of former President Rodrigo Duterte is widely seen as a frontrunner for the 2028 presidential election and prevailed after a similar impeachment bid last year, which the Supreme Court struck down for violating constitutional safeguards.

A lawyer for Duterte said the fresh challenge "comes as no surprise".

"We are prepared to confront these allegations squarely through the proper constitutional processes," her lawyer Michael Poa said in a statement.

The complaints are the latest twist in the Philippines' tumultuous politics, with the vice president still locked in a bitter battle , opens new tab with former ally President Ferdinand Marcos Jr ahead of the next election. Marcos cannot run again due to a single-term limit but is expected to back a successor to try to keep Duterte from power.

Civil society and leftist groups filed two separate complaints against Duterte on Monday based on similar grounds to those lodged last year.

Those included her alleged misuse of public funds, bribery for government contracts and threatening to kill Marcos, the first lady, and the former House speaker who is also the president's cousin. The complainants also accused Duterte of ignoring congressional inquiries.

"The constitution does not permit such cynical disregard for public trust. It does not allow the Vice President to treat public funds as a personal war chest while stonewalling all attempts at oversight," one of the complaints said.

Duterte has previously rejected the allegations.

Marcos too is facing a separate impeachment complaint at the House of Representatives. Asked for comment on the new complaints against Duterte, the president's communications office said it was a matter for Congress to decide.

"We respect the rule of law and we respect due process. The president wants to fight corruption as much as he can, and people deserve to know the truth," it said.

Unlike last year's complaints, the impeachment effort against Duterte will need to hurdle additional procedures imposed by the Supreme Court last year.

A midterm election last year also saw more Duterte allies join the Senate, members of which serve as jurors in impeachment cases.

"It's even more challenging now, I would say, given this Supreme Court final ruling," Senator Risa Hontiveros told foreign correspondents at a forum on Monday.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 06:03:43 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ZUUYJDMECZOGVNUATIMNMTLF3A.jpg?auth=1c0413ca5dc619676b87fd8f183c58b42a50a45bec20f802156096750e02836b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Medvedev says Western claims of a Russian or Chinese threat to Greenland are false 'horror stories'</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/medvedev-says-western-claims-russian-or-chinese-threat-greenland-are-false-2026-02-02/</link><description>MOSCOW, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of Russia's Security Council, said that Western claims of a Russian or Chinese threat to Greenland were false "horror stories" made up by Western leaders to justify their own behaviour.

Japan's election this coming weekend is among the most unpredictable in years , while polls across Latin America will ​test the region's rightward shift.

Here are some of the year's most significant elections for markets:

Japan's snap election on February 8 could loosen fiscal purse-strings in the developed world's most indebted ‌nation, on a debt-to-GDP basis. Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi wants to convert personal popularity into support for her expansionary fiscal policies and bolster her coalition government's position in parliament. Latest polls show her approval rating has slipped a touch.

Investors expect pressure on Japanese bonds to continue, and some analysts reckon 10-year yields will hit 3% this year, from just over 2% now.

Colombians will vote as many as three times, starting in March, to choose new legislators and a new president to replace Gustavo Petro , a leftist who has clashed with U.S. President Donald Trump .

Colombian stocks outperformed regional peers last year, but bond investors hope Latam's rightward shift will sweep up Colombia, too, restoring orthodox economic policies.

"If there is a change ‌to the right...there's potential for some fiscal adjustment," said Ninety One portfolio manager Nicolas Jaquier.

Jaquier said a victory for Ivan Cepeda of Petro's coalition could allow him ​to make structural changes at the central bank and supreme court - removing roadblocks that slowed some of Petro's policies.

Hungary's April vote is the opposition's best chance in years to end Prime Minister Viktor Orban's 16-year-long run.

Centre-right party Tisza has a polling lead over Orban's right-wing Fidesz, but the outcome remains uncertain.

Cost of living concerns are high, and Orban has used fiscal giveaways to assuage voter worries.

Fitch Ratings cut Hungary's credit rating outlook to ‍negative last year, citing "significantly worsened" public finance projections that reflected new measures in advance of the election.

Tisza has pledged to repair ties with the European Union and unblock funding. Citi's Luis E. Costa estimates that could mobilise 10 billion euros ($11.9 billion), which alongside other reforms could "enable higher investment spending, accompanied by a lower fiscal deficit and reduced risk premia".

Local elections usually don't attract the attention of foreign investors, but May's ballot might. Keir Starmer's ruling Labour Party is trailing in opinion polls ⁠to the populist Reform UK and has struggled to deliver on promises to strengthen the economy.

Markets are sensitive to signs that the fiscally restrained Starmer might be replaced, as seen by a recent bond selloff.

Societe Generale's UK ‍economist Sam Cartwright says a new British leader would not have scope to significantly lift government borrowing if Starmer is replaced, his base-case scenario. Britain's next parliamentary election must be held by August 2029.

Ethiopia and Zambia, both battling back ‌from debt ‌default, hold summer elections.

Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed 's Prosperity Party will almost certainly win a June vote, as key opposition groups plan a boycott.

In Zambia, President Hakainde Hichilema is currently expected to win in August, though Chatham House experts warn that citizens’ lives have yet to improve despite progress on debt restructuring and economic reform.

Investors are closely watching both countries as they seek opportunities in frontier markets . Zambia's economy has proved more resilient than expected, and Ethiopia's defaulted bond is trading above par despite the ongoing default .

Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva is leading polls for the October election against Flavio Bolsonaro - a right-wing senator and the son of previous President Jair Bolsonaro.

Leftist ⁠Lula, 80, managed a truce with U.S. President Donald Trump ⁠despite clashing over tariffs, Venezuela and the elder ​Bolsonaro's conviction for plotting a coup.

"A Lula victory...could be quite negative for prices," Tellimer's Geronimo Mansutti wrote, citing concerns of "four more years of wide deficits and a higher debt path".

A fourth term could also leave Lula - a progressive champion - facing more clashes with Trump.

But Ninety One's Jaquier pointed to Lula's value as a "known quantity", adding that he is pragmatic and likely to appoint a credible team to make fiscal adjustments.

The U.S. November mid-term elections will determine who controls ‍Congress and are an important test for Trump.

Affordability is a hot-button issue and the White ‍House has scrambled to offer proposals to ease cost-of-living concerns, including capping credit card interest rates .

Polls show that Americans ​are broadly unhappy with Trump's handling of the economy. The incumbent's party historically suffers during mid-terms and the president recently conceded that his Republican Party could struggle to retain its tenuous grip on Congress.

"Clearly the president would like to see economic growth booming and financial markets rallying, and this will play a big part in ​his narrative and policies in the coming months," said Zurich Insurance chief markets strategist Guy Miller. "The policies in to that election ‍will impact all of us."

Japan says the mission was the world's first bid to tap deep sea rare earths at such a depth.

"Details will be analysed, including exactly how much rare earth is contained" in the sample, government spokesman Kei Sato said, calling it "a meaningful achievement both in terms of economic security and comprehensive maritime development".

The sample was collected by a deep-sea scientific drilling boat called the Chikyu that set sail last month for the remote island of Minami Torishima in the Pacific, where surrounding waters are believed to contain a rich trove of valuable minerals.

It comes as China -- by far the world's biggest supplier of rare earths -- ramps up pressure on its neighbour after Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi suggested in November that Tokyo may react militarily to an attack on Taiwan, which Beijing has vowed to seize control of by force if necessary.

Beijing has blocked exports to Japan of "dual-use" items with potential military uses, fuelling worries in Japan that Beijing could choke supplies of rare earths, some of which are included in China's list of dual-use goods.

Rare earths -- 17 metals difficult to extract from the Earth's crust -- are used in everything from electric vehicles to hard drives, wind turbines and missiles.

The area around Minami Torishima, which is in Japan's economic waters, is estimated to contain more than 16 million tons of rare earths, which the Nikkei business daily says is the third-largest reserve globally.

These rich deposits contain an estimated 730 years' worth of dysprosium, used in high-strength magnets in phones and electric cars, and 780 years' worth of yttrium, used in lasers, the Nikkei said.

"If Japan could successfully extract rare earths around Minami Torishima constantly, it will secure domestic supply chain for key industries," Takahiro Kamisuna, research associate at The International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), told AFP.

"Likewise, it will be a key strategic asset for Takaichi's government to significantly reduce the supply chain dependence on China."

Beijing has long used its dominance in rare earths for geopolitical leverage, including in its trade war with US President Donald Trump's administration.

China accounts for almost two-thirds of rare earth mining production and 92 percent of global refined output, according to the International Energy Agency.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 06:04:31 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/281794c2-ffef-11f0-8007-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-12T022016Z-1129875432-RC2CZIAUB2FX-RTRMADP-3-JAPAN-RAREEARTHS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Germany closer to US than China despite recent tensions, foreign minister says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/germany-closer-us-than-china-despite-recent-tensions-foreign-minister-says-2026-02-02/</link><description>SINGAPORE, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Germany is "not in equidistance" from the United States and China, and will always be closer to Washington despite recent tensions, German foreign minister Johann Wadephul said in Singapore on Monday.

At a lecture hosted by the International Institute for Strategic Studies, Wadephul said the United States remains the most important partner for Europe and Germany and that Europe remains dependent on it for its security, despite issues that are currently "alienating" Washington from the region.

Trump administration officials have been critical of European countries for failing to meet NATO spending targets and for being too dependent on the United States for their own defence.

"Running with open arms to President Xi and saying all our problems vanished in this very moment and we are only heading to become your big partner, this would be the wrong answer," he said, referring to Chinese President Xi Jinping.

Western nations, such as Canada and the United Kingdom have been striking trade deals with China, defying U.S. criticism .

Trump's insistence that Washington should take control over Greenland has shaken transatlantic relations and accelerated European efforts to reduce its dependence on the United States, even as Trump last week withdrew his threat to impose additional tariffs and ruled out taking Greenland by force.

But Wadephul said Europe's united response to U.S. claims on Greenland shows that it can be successful at defending its interests as long as it defines its red lines clearly.

Wadephul also said that the European Union's network of free trade agreements is an "important building block for rules-based free trade in times of increased protectionism and fragmentation".

The European Union is working to "swiftly conclude" more free trade agreements in the Asia-Pacific region, including with Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines and Australia, he said.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 07:34:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/FOYPPONQ2FKSXPBY72AWJP2GNI.jpg?auth=5fa1cda9890a08ff6e6b71fcbf23e216df3a295f2eec5eee7314927a5e99206f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Rural Thai voters shift old loyalties, testing Pheu Thai's populist machine</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/rural-thai-voters-shift-old-loyalties-testing-pheu-thais-populist-machine-2026-02-02/</link><description>UBON RATCHATHANI, Thailand, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Rubber farmer Pinittaya Boonlieng sat with friends in a key political battleground in Thailand to discuss how to vote in the February 8 general election - a choice that once would have been simple in a region long loyal to former premier Thaksin Shinawatra.

Thaksin's populist Pheu Thai party has dominated agrarian Ubon Ratchathani and neighbouring provinces in northeastern Thailand for decades, but that grip is weakening and voters are switching allegiance to powerful individual candidates.

In this region, Pheu Thai is polling at 30.1%, slightly behind the national frontrunner, the reformist People's Party, according to a survey conducted by the University of Khon Kaen in January. The conservative Bhumjaithai Party of Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul is third at 27.2%.

In the last election in 2023, Pheu Thai won 73 of 133 direct constituency seats available across 20 provinces in Thailand's northeast, which houses 4 million of the country's 8.56 million registered farmers.

Many of its candidates from the 2023 election remain popular, reflecting the patronage politics they have followed, although some have switched parties , particularly after the removal of Thaksin's daughter - Paetongtarn Shinawatra - as premier last year for her botched handling of border tensions with Cambodia.

The row exploded into the worst fighting between the neighbours in decades, killing at least 149 people, and stoking public anger in Thailand over Thaksin's once-close ties with former Cambodian leader Hun Sen.

Thaksin is currently in prison because of an unrelated case, and a wave of nationalism washing over Thai politics has weakened Pheu Thai, which is also drawing flak for its inability to deliver on handouts promised when taking office in 2023.

Pinittaya, the rubber farmer, said she is considering backing the ruling Bhumjaithai Party, not because of its ideology or policies, but because she likes her local candidate, a former Pheu Thai lawmaker who defected.

"I am choosing the candidate," Pinittaya, 48, said. "The party is less important."

Six other farmers interviewed by Reuters in Ubon Ratchathani and a neighbouring province shared the same sentiment, showing how farm communities battered by falling crop prices, rising costs and mounting debt are shifting from party-based loyalty to backing candidates they believe can help them.

Manee Ruamtham, 62, a rice farmer in Sisaket province, said she was once a Pheu Thai voter but walked away from the party when it failed to deliver on its promise of a 10,000 baht ($317) cash handout after it took power following the 2023 polls.

"I was like their number one supporter but what they did isn't right," she said. "People lost faith in the party."

Paetongtarn blamed steep tariffs proposed by the United States for stalling her government's flagship handout programme, and her administration was eventually ousted due to the Cambodia crisis, leaving the handouts unfinished.

The local candidate Manee said she will vote for is Nuchanat Jaruwongsethian, a former Pheu Thai lawmaker who defected to the smaller Kla Tham party, an ally of the ruling Bhumjaithai.

"People voted for me to fight for farmers, to fight for decent wages," said Nuchanat, a former long-time Pheu Thai supporter. "But one day it wasn't about this anymore, so how can I answer the people?"

But not all rural voters are abandoning Pheu Thai. In Ubon Ratchathani, 53-year-old tapioca farmer Ubon Thanomsup said she may still back the party she has supported for many years - largely because of the local candidate.

"The candidate lives in our area, so he is nearer to help," she said.

Cherdsak Phokkunlanon, a Pheu Thai candidate in the province, said that his party could retain, and even expand, its rural support base with the help of populist policies, a playbook that Pheu Thai has successfully deployed before.

"Pheu Thai policy will guarantee the price of agricultural goods, so that people will gain 30% profit when they sell their products," Cherdsak said.

Political parties are responding to the swing in sentiment by aggressively recruiting well-known local figures, including defectors from rival camps, in a strategy aimed at capturing personal loyalty networks, rather than relying solely on national campaigns.

Among those is Sudarat Pitakpornpunlop, a former Pheu Thai lawmaker now running for Bhumjaithai in Ubon Ratchathani's District 7.

"Even if I change to another four or five parties, I will be the same old person who worked for all of you like before," she told voters at a rally last month.

Nationwide, at least 91 lawmakers elected in 2023 have changed their political affiliation ahead of February polls, according to multiple local media.

Of these, Bhumjaithai attracted 64 defectors, while Kla Tham took second place with 21 lawmakers joining its ranks. Only one has switched to Pheu Thai.

The trend reflects the enduring power of patronage politics in the Thai hinterland, rooted in gaps in state welfare schemes and public service delivery, said Titipol Phakdeewanich, a political scientist at Ubon Ratchathani University.

"When people help you, you feel you owe them something. These networks are long-term investments, and they can still help politicians win elections," he said.

Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine triggered the biggest confrontation between the West and Moscow since the depths of the Cold War, though U.S. President Donald Trump's envoys are trying to negotiate an end to the war with Russia and Ukraine.

Medvedev, who serves as deputy chairman of Russia's Security Council, a kind of modern-day politburo of Russia's most powerful officials, praised Trump and said it was encouraging that contacts had resumed with Washington.

But Medvedev, who has repeatedly hurled invective at Kyiv and Western powers while warning of the risks of an escalation of the war towards a nuclear "apocalypse", said the West had repeatedly ignored Russian interests.

"The situation is very dangerous," Medvedev told Reuters, TASS and the WarGonzo Russian war blogger in an interview at his residence outside Moscow.

"The pain threshold seems to be decreasing."

"We are not interested in a global conflict. We're not crazy," said Medvedev, who served as Russian president from 2008 to 2012. "A global conflict cannot be ruled out."

President Vladimir Putin remains the final voice on Russian policy, though Medvedev, now an arch-hawk, gives a sense of hardliners' thinking within the Russian elite, according to foreign diplomats.

A cartoon hanging in the room where the interview took place showed Medvedev, a former lawyer who hails from Putin's hometown of St Petersburg, pointing a submachine gun at European leaders.

Putin and Trump have both mentioned the risks of escalation over Ukraine, though European diplomats say that Moscow has skillfully played the escalation card to scare Ukraine's allies from getting too heavily involved in the war.

"They say 'No way - these Russians are making it all up - they are sowing horror stories and they will never do anything," Medvedev said, adding that what the Kremlin calls the "Special Military Operation" in Ukraine showed Russia would stand up for its interests.

Ukraine and its European allies cast the war, the deadliest in Europe since World War Two, as an imperial-style land grab, and say that if Russia wins in Ukraine then it will one day attack NATO. Russia dismisses such claims as nonsense.

Conflict first erupted in eastern Ukraine in 2014 after a pro-Russian president was toppled in Ukraine's Maidan Revolution. Russia annexed Crimea and Moscow-backed separatists battled Kyiv's armed forces in eastern Ukraine.

When asked about the flurry of global events of January in Venezuela, over Greenland and elsewhere, Medvedev said that it had all been simply "too much".

On Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, a Russian ally, Medvedev said that if Trump had been "stolen" by a foreign power, then the United States would have clearly seen it as an act of war.

He also said Western claims of a Russian or Chinese threat to Greenland were false "horror stories" made up by Western leaders to justify their own behaviour.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 07:35:42 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/FOLUZGS3Y5N7TBBDYRKOZVMAL4.jpg?auth=5480d241a308f666b63fcb01cd481da441f2ad164df69d8f63a5bd4f32b128a9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia's Medvedev says expiry of New START should alarm the world</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/russias-medvedev-says-expiry-new-start-should-alarm-world-2026-02-02/</link><description>MOSCOW, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of Russia's Security Council, said that if the New START treaty expired with no replacement then the world should be alarmed that the biggest nuclear powers had no limits for probably the first time since the early 1970s.

"I don't want to say that this immediately means a catastrophe and a nuclear war will begin, but it should still alarm everyone," Medvedev told Reuters, TASS and the WarGonzo Russian war blogger in an interview at his residence outside Moscow.

Arms control treaties, Medvedev said, played a crucial role not just in limiting the number of warheads but also as a way to verify intentions and to ensure some element of trust between major nuclear powers.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 07:35:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7MOCWNBHYRNFLIXZPZQQY3YSJY.jpg?auth=78b17eaaf6c889c0916d68f3da7c58119c8a1709bb000d2752ccf3e364d73e6a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israel reopens Gaza's Rafah border crossing to Egypt, with limits</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-expected-reopen-gazas-rafah-border-crossing-egypt-with-limits-2026-02-02/</link><description>GAZA, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Israel reopened the border between Gaza and Egypt on Monday for people on foot, a move that would allow Palestinians to leave the enclave and let back in those who want to return after fleeing Israel's war in the enclave.

The reopening of the Rafah border crossing will be limited, with Israel demanding security checks for Palestinians entering and exiting. Israel and Egypt were expected to impose caps on the number of travellers.

Israel seized the border crossing in May 2024, about nine months into the Gaza war that was brought to a tenuous halt by an October ceasefire brokered by U.S. President Donald Trump . Rafah's reopening was an important requirement under the first phase of Trump's broader plan to stop fighting between Israel and Hamas militants.

An Israeli security official said that European monitoring teams had arrived at the crossing, which "has now opened to the movement of residents, for both entry and exit."

In the first nine months of Israel's assault in Gaza, launched after the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack on southern Israel, Palestinians were generally able to flee to Egypt through the Rafah crossing.

Palestinian officials say about 100,000 Palestinians have fled Gaza since the war began, most of them during the first nine months. Some were sponsored by aid groups. Others paid bribes to parties in Egypt to secure permission to leave.

Israel closed the Rafah crossing after its forces swept into the area and has also closed the Philadelphi corridor that runs the length of Gaza's border with Egypt.

The closure cut off an important route for wounded and sick Palestinians to seek medical care outside Gaza. A few thousand have been allowed out to seek medical treatment in third countries via Israel over the past year, though thousands more are in need of care abroad, according to the United Nations.

Despite the reopening of Rafah, Israel is still refusing to allow the entry of foreign journalists, who have been banned from Gaza since the start of the war, which has caused widespread destruction and laid waste to swathes of territory.

Gaza's about 2 million Palestinians mostly live in makeshift tents and damaged homes, surrounded by the ruins of their destroyed cities.

Israel's Supreme Court is considering a petition by the Foreign Press Association that demands foreign journalists be allowed to enter Gaza from Israel. Government lawyers have said that letting journalists into Gaza could pose risks to Israeli soldiers, while also highlighting potential risks to reporters.

The FPA rejects this, saying the public is being deprived of a vital source of independent information. It also points to the fact that many aid and United Nations workers have been allowed to enter the enclave since the war started.

Trump's plan for Gaza, now in its second phase, foresees governance being handed to Palestinian technocrats, Hamas laying down its weapons and Israeli troops withdrawing from the territory while it is rebuilt.

Israel has cast doubt on the prospect of Hamas laying down its arms and some officials say the military is preparing for a return to war. Since the October deal was struck, Israeli attacks in Gaza have killed more than 500 Palestinians, health officials say, while militants have killed four Israeli troops.

On Saturday, Israel launched some of its most intense airstrikes since the ceasefire, killing at least 30 people, in what it said was a response to a Hamas violation of the truce on Friday.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 08:43:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/RBBPTNMFQNJ43B5ORNILZS2YJU.jpg?auth=e48441b3ef36878bfcb855a96b53b3611a7f240009d1cade5fe8bf23677606b4&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran examines diplomacy with US, hopes for results in coming days, official says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-examines-diplomacy-with-us-hopes-results-coming-days-official-says-2026-02-02/</link><description>DUBAI, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Details of various diplomatic processes to manage tensions with the U.S. are being examined by Iran, Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei said on Monday, adding that Tehran hoped for results in the coming days.

Verdi, which represents nearly 100,000 transport workers, called the strike after talks with municipal and state employers over working conditions stalled last week.

The union is demanding shorter shifts, longer rest breaks and higher pay for night and weekend work even as cities grapple with budget constraints.

The walkout affects about 150 municipal transport companies in all but one of Germany's 16 federal states, including Berlin, Hamburg and Bremen.

One of the largest coordinated actions in local transport sector in years, the strike began as planned, Serat Canyurt, the leading negotiator for Verdi, told rbb radio on Monday, adding that public transport operators were now expected to return to the negotiating table.

In Stuttgart, Karlsruhe and Freiburg, services will grind to a halt for the entire day, union officials said.

Temperatures fell below zero in much of the country, worsening the situation for commuters forced to seek alternative transportation.

Still, Deutsche Bahn said Friday its urban railway S-Bahn trains in cities including Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Stuttgart, along with long-distance services, would run as normal on Monday as staff were not represented by Verdi.

Talks between Verdi and employer associations have been tense, with union leaders accusing municipalities of seeking to cut benefits and lengthen shifts.

In Berlin, Verdi negotiators said operators wanted workers to fund improvements themselves by giving up sick pay and flexible hours.

The next round of negotiations is scheduled for February 9.

Union leaders warned that further industrial action could follow if employers do not offer significant concessions.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 08:44:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/QF2HG53KVJOFNJYKPJASOWWI4M.jpg?auth=04b8d8a0cb99e107f62d7d9c3b77805def9f31118e74a43214334c9c3bfd3346&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Gaza border reopening long awaited by stranded Palestinians</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/gaza-border-reopening-long-awaited-by-stranded-palestinians-2026-02-02/</link><description>CAIRO/GAZA, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Cut off from family or urgently requiring hospital care, Palestinians stranded on each side of Gaza's Rafah crossing waited with growing desperation for Monday's reopening of the border as a delayed part of October's ceasefire deal.

How fully crossings to and from Egypt will resume, and under what conditions, remains unclear with Israel retaining complete control of Gaza's frontier, but for those waiting to travel even a partial reopening feels long overdue.

While Rafah was partially open early in the Gaza war between Israel and Palestinian Hamas militants, it has been shut entirely since summer 2024 and only very small numbers have been able to travel to or from Gaza via Israel since then.

The people hoping to return to Gaza know it lies in ruins, their homes and neighbourhoods destroyed in Israel's two-year military campaign sparked by the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack. Those seeking to leave know that new restrictions could maroon them abroad.

Yet, a mother cut off from family and grieving the death of her newborn son, a trader yearning to reunite with his fiancee for a long-delayed wedding, and two people needing medical treatment abroad were all hopeful for the reopening.

Faten Hamed Abu Watfa, 43, has not seen her three children since she left Gaza nearly 10 months ago. Sitting in Egypt, she scrolls through photographs on her mobile phone, pictures of her two sons, aged 21 and 18, and her 15‑year‑old daughter, trying to bridge the distance that has kept her separated from them.

Abu Watfa left Gaza City’s al‑Karama neighbourhood on April 5, 2024, hoping to stay away for no more than six to eight weeks while her mother‑in‑law received medical treatment. Instead, she became stranded in Egypt after the Rafah crossing closed.

"It's an indescribable feeling, that one will go back to be reunited with his children and family, to the country, to the place where he lived and grew up."

Her return, however, will not be to the home she left behind. Abu Watfa said her house was torched by Israeli forces, leaving only the concrete pillars standing.

“When it rains, they put something like tar on the roof to keep the water from dripping on them, because the situation would be really difficult," she said.

"I am ready to enter Gaza, be searched and get tired, not for a day, but for a whole week... to be dragged around during the journey back, until I reach Gaza and see my children and my father safe and sound."

Many families who arrived in Cairo early in the war never expected to remain for so long. Some depleted their savings, while others found themselves divided, with relatives trapped on opposite sides of the Rafah border.

“I love Gaza, and I don’t see any other place that feels like home,” said Mohammad Talal al‑Burai, 28, a currency trader whose house in Jabalia in north Gaza was destroyed.

Despite fears of a relapse into fighting and concerns that poor internet and communications could disrupt his work, Burai registered with the Palestinian embassy in Cairo as soon as the Rafah crossing reopened.

“Going back to live in a tent? I don’t care,” he said. “I can’t wait to take my father into my arms and place a kiss on his forehead,” Burai told Reuters.

Burai postponed his wedding after the war erupted in October 2023. His mother remains in the United Arab Emirates, receiving medical treatment.

“I will go ahead with my marriage, but I may not hold a party since my mother might not be able to join us,” he said.

For others, the chance to cross is a matter of life and death.

Tamer Al-Burai, 50, who is a cousin of Mohammad Al-Burai's father, suffers from obstructive sleep apnea and relies on Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) machine, to help him breathe normally during sleep by keeping the airway open.

“My health has become much worse because there is no power and no fuel,” he said. His family left for Egypt two years ago, but he was unable to follow because the crossing remained shut.

“I have appealed to humanitarian groups, to the WHO, to the Palestinian Authority - to anyone - so that I can leave, save my life, and reunite with my family,” Al-Burai said.

Thousands of Gaza Palestinians have registered with the World Health Organization to travel for treatment. Gaza’s health ministry said at least 20,000 patients, including children and cancer patients, are awaiting evacuation.

Among them is Noor Daher, 31, a graphic designer from Gaza City with a chronic heart defect. “My heart beats even harder now,” he said. “I am hopeful my problem will finally end.”

For many, the reopening came too late.

Dalia Abu Kashef, 28, died last week while waiting for her name to appear on the Rafah crossing list for a liver transplant.

"We found a volunteer - her brother - who was ready to donate part of his liver," said her husband Muatasem El-Rass.

"We were waiting for the crossing to open so we could travel and do the surgery, hoping for a happy ending. But she deteriorated badly and died."</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 08:44:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4GFHYRCDVVOQVFT3IKZPGWHX4M.jpg?auth=3721508a09102e9df71955e55e4bc984b71b53bec4f7540decc530211c3485c6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>What's next for Trump's Gaza plan after Rafah reopening?</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/whats-next-trumps-gaza-plan-after-rafah-reopening-2026-02-02/</link><description>Feb 2 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's plan to end the Gaza war was given a boost on Monday with the reopening of the enclave's Rafah crossing with Egypt. But difficult questions remain unaddressed, including whether Hamas will disarm.

Trump's plan, now in its second phase, has been shaken by repeated Israeli attacks that have killed hundreds in Gaza, as well as resistance by Hamas militants to lay down their weapons. Israeli officials say they are preparing for a return to war if Hamas refuses to disarm.

Below is background on Trump's plan as well as key issues left to be resolved.

In September, Trump outlined a 20-point plan for an initial truce, followed by steps towards a broader resolution.

It ultimately calls for Hamas to disarm and have no governing role in Gaza, for Israel to pull out its forces, and for broad reconstruction of the territory under international supervision.

The plan was widely endorsed internationally, although the sides have not yet fully agreed to everything in it.On October 9, Israel and Hamas signed a ceasefire deal covering the first phase of the plan. That included a halt to fighting, the release of all remaining hostages held in Gaza in exchange for thousands of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, a partial Israeli withdrawal, a surge in aid and the reopening of the Rafah crossing.

The Trump plan was also endorsed by a United Nations Security Council resolution that authorised a transitional governing body and international stabilisation force in Gaza.

WHAT IS THE SITUATION NOW?The ceasefire came into effect on October 10 and ended large-scale combat, though fighting did not completely stop.Gaza health authorities say at least 488 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire since October 10, and Israel's military says four soldiers have been killed by militants in that time.

Israeli forces pulled back and suspended ground assaults, but still control over 53% of Gaza, including ruined cities along the Israeli and Egyptian borders where they have demolished remaining buildings and ordered residents out.

That means nearly all of Gaza's more than 2 million people are now confined to a sliver of territory on the coast, where Hamas has reasserted control. Most residents live in damaged buildings or makeshift tents.

Palestinian groups and aid agencies say Israel is still not allowing supplies into Gaza at the rate agreed under the first phase of the deal. Israel says it is meeting those commitments.

Armed anti-Hamas Palestinian groups have set up bases in Israeli-held parts of Gaza; Hamas dismisses them as collaborators with no popular support.

Both sides have shown little sign of narrowing their disputes over steps to be taken in the next phase, which foresees the disarmament of Hamas, further withdrawal of Israeli forces and deployment of peacekeepers.

WHAT'S EXPECTED IN THE SECOND PHASE?Despite wide gaps between Israel and Hamas, Washington launched the plan's second phase after the New Year, announcing the establishment of a committee of Palestinian technocrats to run Gaza.

They will be overseen by a "Board of Peace" of foreign dignitaries led by Trump, which he initially proposed to address the Gaza war and has since said will also tackle other conflicts.

The plan's second phase also includes Hamas giving up its weapons and Gaza being demilitarised, in exchange for Israel fully withdrawing its troops.

The militant group is still believed to possess rockets, which several diplomats estimated to number in the hundreds. It is also estimated to possess thousands of light weapons, including rifles.

Hamas recently agreed to discuss disarmament with other Palestinian factions and with mediators, sources said. However, two Hamas officials told Reuters that neither Washington nor the mediators had presented the group with any detailed or concrete disarmament proposal.

Two senior Israeli officials told Reuters that the military was preparing to return to war if Hamas does not give up its weapons and that it did not expect the militants to disarm without the use of force.

Hamas is also seeking to incorporate its 10,000 police officers into the new technocrat-led government in Gaza, sources said, a demand opposed by Israel.

An international stabilisation force is intended to ensure security and peace inside Gaza. But its composition, role and mandate are all up in the air.

The Palestinian Authority, which is internationally recognised and exercises limited self-rule in parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, is supposed to carry out unspecified reforms before ultimately taking a role in Gaza. But details have not been outlined.

Plans have yet to be hammered out to fund and oversee Gaza's reconstruction. Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, laid out plans this month for a "New Gaza" to be rebuilt from scratch, with computer-generated photos of gleaming residential towers, data centres and industrial zones.

The plan did not address property rights or compensation for Palestinians who lost their homes, businesses and livelihoods during the war, nor did it spell out where displaced Palestinians might live during the rebuilding.

Many Israelis and Palestinians suspect the Trump plan will never be fully realised and a frozen conflict will continue indefinitely.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 08:45:56 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/TI4AQSRZ6ZMDPIMZVRFZGH55L4.jpg?auth=0b2955e38416e03764b6a784d8a7a67a4082432fc3e5e15e554ef5837d198446&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Gaza's Rafah crossing with Egypt reopens for limited number of Palestinians</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260202-gaza-s-rafah-crossing-with-egypt-reopens-for-limited-number-of-palestinians</link><description>Israel reopened the border between Gaza and Egypt on Monday for people on foot, a move that would allow a limited number of Palestinians to leave the enclave and let back in those who want to return after fleeing Israel's war in the enclave.

The reopening of the Rafah border crossing will be limited, with Israel ​demanding security checks for Palestinians entering and exiting.

An Egyptian official said 50 Palestinians would cross in each direction in the first day of the crossing’s operation. The official, involved in talks related the implementation of ceasefire deal, spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss the issue.

About 20,000 Palestinian children and adults needing medical care hope to leave devastated Gaza via the crossing, according to Gaza health officials. Thousands of other Palestinians outside the territory hope to enter and return home.

Israel seized the ‍border crossing in May 2024, about nine months into the Gaza war that was brought to a tenuous halt by an October ceasefire brokered by US President Donald Trump .

Rafah's reopening was an important requirement ​under the first phase of Trump's broader plan to stop fighting between Israel and the Palestinian group Hamas .

An Israeli security official said ​that European monitoring teams had arrived at the crossing, which "has now opened to the movement of residents, for both entry and exit".

In the first nine months of Israel's assault in Gaza, launched after the October 7, 2023 Hamas-led attack on southern Israel, Palestinians were generally able to flee to Egypt through the Rafah crossing.

Palestinian officials say about 100,000 Palestinians have fled Gaza since the war began, most of them during the first nine months. Some were sponsored by aid groups. Others paid bribes to parties in Egypt to secure permission to leave.

Israel closed the Rafah crossing after its forces swept into the area and has also closed the so-called Philadelphi corridor, an Israeli name for a strip of land that runs the ‍length of Gaza's border with Egypt.

The closure cut off an important route for wounded and sick Palestinians to seek medical care outside Gaza. A few thousand have been allowed out to seek medical treatment in ​third countries via Israel over the past year, though thousands more are in need of care abroad, according to the United Nations.

Despite the reopening of Rafah, Israel is still refusing to allow the entry of foreign journalists, who have been banned from Gaza since the start of the ‌war, which has caused widespread destruction and laid waste to swathes of territory.

Gaza's about 2 million Palestinians mostly live in makeshift tents and damaged homes, surrounded by the ruins of their destroyed cities.

Israel's Supreme Court is considering a petition by the Foreign ‍Press Association that demands foreign journalists be allowed to enter Gaza from Israel. Government lawyers have claimed that letting journalists into Gaza could pose risks to Israeli soldiers, while also highlighting potential risks to reporters.

The FPA rejects this, saying the public is being deprived of a vital source of independent information. It also points to the fact that many aid and United Nations workers have been allowed to enter the enclave since the war started.

Nearly 220 media workers have died since the start of the Gaza war, making Israel the biggest killer of journalists worldwide for three years running, RSF data shows.

Trump's plan for Gaza, now in its second phase, foresees governance being handed to Palestinian technocrats, Hamas laying down its weapons and Israeli troops withdrawing from the territory while it is rebuilt.

Since the October deal was struck, Israeli attacks in Gaza have killed more than ‌500 Palestinians, health officials say, ​while militants have killed four Israeli troops.

On Saturday, Israel launched some of its most intense airstrikes since the ceasefire, killing at least 30 people , in what it said was a response to an alleged Hamas violation of the truce on Friday.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 08:46:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/972c3cf6-ff71-11f0-bca7-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26032256758307.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Germany arrests five for supplying Russian defence firms</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/germany-arrests-five-supplying-russian-defence-firms-2026-02-02/</link><description>BERLIN, Feb 2 (Reuters) - German authorities on Monday arrested five people suspected of forming a criminal organisation to circumvent European Union sanctions by exporting goods to at least 24 listed Russian defence companies, the federal prosecutor's office said.

The attacks at the weekend brought Pakistan's largest province to a near standstill as the separatist Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) struck nearly a dozen targets in one of their largest ever operations, killing 17 security officials and 31 civilians.

Pakistan's military has killed 177 BLA fighters in three days of fighting, the interior ministry said on Monday.

Pakistan's government and military have said the group has received support from India, threatening to escalate hostilities between the nuclear-powered neighbours who engaged in their worst armed conflict in decades in May.

Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said 22 more militants had been killed overnight in different areas of Balochistan, taking the total to 177.

"Security forces, police and intelligence agencies thwarted the nefarious intentions of terrorists by taking timely and effective action," Naqvi said in a statement.

"The Indian agents and their facilitators will be completely eliminated."

India's foreign office had rejected the allegations on Sunday, saying Islamabad should instead address the "long-standing demands of its people in the region".

Balochistan, Pakistan's largest and poorest province, has faced a decades-long insurgency led by ethnic Baloch separatists seeking greater autonomy and a larger share of its natural resources.

The group claimed it had killed 84 members of Pakistan's security forces and captured 18 others. Reuters could not independently verify the claim. The military did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Attackers dressed as ordinary civilians entered hospitals, schools, banks and markets on Saturday before opening fire, Pakistan's junior interior minister Talal Chaudhry said.

"In each case, the attackers came in dressed as civilians and indiscriminately targeted ordinary people working in shops," he said, adding militants had used civilians as human shields.

The banned BLA said the attacks were part of a coordinated operation dubbed Herof, or "black storm", targeting security forces across the province.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 10:45:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Hungary's Tisza party maintains lead over Orban's ruling Fidesz, poll shows</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/hungarys-tisza-party-maintains-lead-over-orbans-ruling-fidesz-poll-shows-2026-02-02/</link><description>BUDAPEST, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Hungary's centre-right opposition Tisza party kept an eight-point lead over Prime Minister Viktor Orban's governing nationalist Fidesz party in January, a poll showed on Monday, ahead of a parliamentary election set for April 12.

Orban is facing the biggest challenge to his grip on power since Fidesz swept to victory in 2010, although the outcome remains highly uncertain.

Tisza is led by former government insider Peter Magyar who has said his party will tackle corruption, unlock billions of euros in frozen European Union funds to boost the economy, and firmly anchor Hungary in the EU.

The April vote will have major implications for Europe and its far-right political forces.

Orban, an ally of U.S. President Donald Trump, has often clashed with the EU on a range of issues while maintaining cordial ties with Russia and criticising Ukraine. The EU accuses Orban of eroding democratic values in Hungary, which he denies.

The latest poll, conducted between January 21-24 by Publicus Institute and published by daily newspaper Nepszava, showed that 48% of decided voters supported Tisza while 40% backed Fidesz, unchanged from December.

Besides the two major parties, only the far-right Our Homeland (Mi Hazank) would surpass the 5% threshold required for entry into parliament, the survey found.

The poll also found that 63% of voters thought Hungary was on the wrong track. That figure rose to 71% among pensioners, a key demographic, which Orban has targeted with a pension top-up.

Most polls have shown Fidesz trailing Tisza despite voter-pleasing measures after three years of economic stagnation in Hungary, which has also endured the EU's worst inflationary surge following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

However, pro-government pollsters show a Fidesz lead.

A second survey published on Monday by the pro-government Nezopont Institute showed Orban had a 46% approval rating compared with 35% for Magyar.

Nezopont, which did not survey party preferences in the poll conducted between January 26-27, said support for Orban was especially high among elderly and rural voters.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 10:45:32 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/M6V7ORONRFPWNNOUUBVFOZHFO4.jpg?auth=c94e48fa00b3b8324da16042ac474a19a551fe34addb55150f73df46af5ddf08&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iraq starts investigations into IS group detainees moved from Syrian camps</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260202-iraq-starts-investigations-into-is-group-detainees-moved-from-syrian-camps</link><description>Iraq 's judiciary announced on Monday it has begun its investigations into more than 1,300 Islamic State (IS) group detainees who were transferred from Syria as part of a US operation .

"Investigation proceedings have started with 1,387 members of the Daesh terrorist organisation who were recently transferred from the Syrian territory," the judiciary's media office said in a statement, using the Arabic acronym for the IS group.

"Under the supervision of the head of Iraq's Supreme Judicial Council, several judges specialising in counter-terrorism started the investigation."

Those detainees are among 7,000 IS group suspects, previously held by Syrian Kurdish fighters, whom the US military said it would transfer to Iraq after Syrian government forces seized Kurdish-held territory .

They include Syrians, Iraqis and Europeans, among other nationalities, according to several Iraqi security sources.

In 2014, the IS group swept across Syria and Iraq, committing massacres and forcing women and girls into sexual slavery.

Backed by US-led forces, Iraq proclaimed the defeat of the IS group in the country in 2017, and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) ultimately beat the group back in Syria two years later.

The SDF went on to jail thousands of suspected jihadists and detain tens of thousands of their relatives in camps.

The al-Hol and ​al-Roj camps hold more than 28,000 people, mostly ‍Syrians and Iraqis, according to the UN. About 6,000 foreigners are housed ​in al-Hol and a further 2,000 in al-Roj.

Last month, the United States said the purpose of its alliance with Kurdish forces in Syria had largely expired, as Damascus pressed an offensive to take back territory long held by the SDF.

In Iraq, where many prisons are packed with IS group suspects, courts have handed down hundreds of death sentences and life terms to people convicted of terrorism offences, including many foreign fighters.

Iraq's judiciary said its investigation procedures "will comply with national laws and international standards".</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 10:47:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/effbe85a-001a-11f1-96ce-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26029591423496.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Drone incidents at UK military bases doubled last year</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/drone-incidents-uk-military-bases-doubled-last-year-2026-02-02/</link><description>LONDON, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Britain's military bases experienced a doubling of drone incidents last year, highlighting the changing nature of warfare and prompting the government to hand more powers to its forces to protect sites from aerial threats.

In 2025, there were 266 reported uncrewed aerial vehicle incidents near defence sites in Britain, up from 126 reported in 2024, part of a wider trend of European airspace being targeted by drones.

"The doubling of rogue drones near military sites in the UK in the last year underlines the increasing and changing nature of the threats we face," Defence minister John Healey said in a statement on Monday.

Drone incursions forced airports in Belgium and Denmark to close for hours at a time in the last few months of 2025, with experts saying the incidents had the hallmarks of Russian interference, a charge denied by Moscow.

In order to counter the threat from drones to British bases, Healey said military officers would be given new powers to destroy drones operating near them, an action that previously required the involvement of the police.

The new powers will also mean the military can destroy land drones and unmanned vehicles operating under water.

Healey said security at military sites had been stepped up. Last June, pro-Palestinian activists broke into a Royal Air Force base, damaging and spraying red paint over two planes used for refuelling and transport.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 11:36:27 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/NYKV7PMLCVMADPU2A5BWP6S7WU.jpg?auth=4a826946e1d5c91454d63f95c278e4d240eba6067d8394cfae046024f770f2a0&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>British serial killer 'Suffolk Strangler' pleads guilty to 1999 murder</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/british-serial-killer-suffolk-strangler-pleads-guilty-1999-murder-2026-02-02/</link><description>LONDON, Feb 2 (Reuters) - A British serial killer dubbed the "Suffolk Strangler" by the media after he killed five young women two decades ago pleaded guilty on Monday to another murder from 27 years ago.

Steve Wright, who is already serving a life sentence with no prospect of parole for killing the women in 2006, appeared at London's Old Bailey court and admitted kidnapping and murdering 17-year-old Victoria Hall in 1999.

Wright, 67, also pleaded guilty to the attempted kidnap of a 22-year-old woman the day before Hall's murder. He will be sentenced on Friday.

"Justice has finally been achieved for Victoria Hall after 26 years," Samantha Woolley from the Crown Prosecution Service said in a statement.

Wright was convicted in 2008 of the murder of five women who worked as prostitutes in the town of Ipswich, northeast of London in Suffolk. Wright left two of the bodies in a crucifix position with arms outstretched.

He was give a whole-life order, meaning he could never be released from prison, for what the sentencing judge described as "a targeted campaign of murder".

Wright had consistently denied the allegations even though his DNA was found on three of the victims and bloodstains from two of them were found on his jacket at his home. His victims' bodies were found in the space of just 10 days around Ipswich.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 11:36:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/OU2UWHZXQJP3HGNO6SDCN7K2OQ.jpg?auth=9b0e43f1fb7c2f8506c360b2d0d4af7d5a4a3bccaa21a295c989115ee24c72b5&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Snapchat blocks 415,000 underage accounts in Australia under social media ban</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260202-snapchat-blocks-415-000-underage-accounts-in-australia-under-social-media-ban</link><description>Snapchat has blocked 415,000 accounts under Australia 's social media ban for under-16s , the company said Monday, but warned some youngsters may be bypassing age verification technology.

The platform urged the Australian authorities to oblige app stores to check users' ages as an "additional safeguard" for the world-first crackdown.

Platforms including Snapchat, Meta , TikTok and YouTube must stop underage users from holding accounts under the legislation, which came into effect on December 10.

Companies face fines of Aus$49.5 million (US$34 million) if they fail to take "reasonable steps" to comply.

Australia's eSafety online regulator reported last month that tech giants had already blocked 4.7 million accounts, delivering "significant outcomes".

As of the end of January, Snapchat said it had blocked or disabled 415,000 Snapchat accounts in Australia belonging to under-16s.

"We continue to lock more accounts daily," it said in an online statement.

But the law leaves "significant gaps", Snapchat said, arguing that age estimation technology was only accurate to within two to three years.

"In practice, this means some young people under 16 may be able to bypass protections, potentially leaving them with reduced safeguards, while others over 16 may incorrectly lose access."

Snapchat joined billionaire Mark Zuckerberg 's Meta in calling on Australia to require app stores to check users' ages before allowing downloads.

"Creating a centralised verification system at the app-store level would allow for more consistent protection and higher barriers to circumventing the law," Snapchat said.

The platform said it did not believe an outright ban was the right approach.

Snapchat said it understood Australia's objectives and wanted to protect people online, but did not agree its platform should be covered by the social media ban.

"In the case of Snapchat – which is primarily a messaging app used by young people to stay connected with close friends and family – we do not believe that cutting teens off from these relationships makes them safer, happier, or otherwise better off," it said.

Australia's world-first ban is being closely watched by ⁠other countries considering similar age-based measures, with Britain and France being the latest to signal such plans.

France's National Assembly on January 26 approved legislation to ban children under 15 from social media amid growing concerns about online bullying and mental health risks. The bill still needs to pass through the Senate before a final vote in the lower house.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 11:37:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/2649eca4-fffd-11f0-84b0-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/536b17d7a21bf1d09abe16827de3c3f7e0437990.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Syrian state forces deploy into Kurdish-run city under ceasefire deal</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/syrian-government-forces-deploy-towards-kurdish-run-city-after-ceasefire-deal-2026-02-02/</link><description>HASAKAH, Syria, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Syrian government security forces deployed into a Kurdish-controlled city in the northeast on Monday under a U.S.-backed ceasefire deal that foresees the Kurdish-run regions being merged with Damascus.

The deal, declared on Friday, has staved off further conflict between President Ahmed al-Sharaa's government and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, which lost swathes of eastern and northern Syria to government troops in January.

Reuters journalists saw a convoy of more than 30 interior ministry vehicles begin moving towards the city of Hasakah from a position outside the city in the early afternoon. Two local sources in the city said they entered shortly afterwards.

The government forces are expected to be stationed in Syrian state buildings in Hasakah's so-called "security zone", a Syrian official and a Kurdish security source told Reuters ahead of the deployment.

The accord declared on Friday foresees a phased integration of Kurdish fighters with government forces. The United States has hailed the agreement as a historic milestone towards unity and reconciliation in Syria after 14 years of civil war.

The SDF was once Washington's main Syrian ally, playing a vital part in the fight against Islamic State militants. But its status weakened as President Donald Trump built close ties with Sharaa, a former al Qaeda commander who has now brought almost all of Syria back under the authority of Damascus.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 14:12:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/XU2OL3P45VLKTPSPBHC7WSND6E.jpg?auth=6070df570816fcae4fdd18e4335a9d48662d9dbba6ba0adb2dd86cf13d5982db&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>No new targeted Russian strikes on Ukrainian energy infrastructure, Zelenskiy says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/no-new-targeted-russian-strikes-ukrainian-energy-infrastructure-zelenskiy-says-2026-02-02/</link><description>KYIV, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Russia has not carried out any targeted missile or drone strikes on Ukrainian energy infrastructure in the last 24 hours although energy facilities in frontline areas have come under fire, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Monday.

Zelenskiy's statement highlighted the limitations of a short-term energy truce that Russia agreed to last week at the request of U.S. President Donald Trump.

Zelenskiy said energy repair crews had managed to restore energy facilities damaged when high-voltage power lines malfunctioned over the weekend, on top of the damage caused by frequent Russian attacks.

"The (energy) system is operating stably. However, given the extremely cold weather and the impact of Russian strikes, all challenges remain serious," Zelenskiy said on the Telegram app.

Zelenskiy said Russian forces were focused on attacking transport logistics, especially railway infrastructure.

Russia and Ukraine said last week they halted strikes on each other's energy infrastructure, but disagreed on the timeframe for the truce.

The Kremlin said Trump had made a personal request to Russian President Vladimir Putin to refrain from striking Kyiv until February 1. Zelenskiy said the truce was supposed to last for a week, starting January 30.

A Russian drone strike on Sunday killed 12 miners at a coal mine in the Ukrainian Dnipropetrovsk region, officials said. DTEK said on Monday one of its coal mining enterprises in the Dnipropetrovsk region had been attacked for the second time in 24 hours.

Regional officials said that a Russian strike had killed a father and a son, and wounded two children and their mother in the frontline Donetsk region.

Kyiv and Moscow are preparing for talks in Abu Dhabi this week on how to end the war. The talks are expected to be on Wednesday and Thursday.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 14:12:42 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/JVCO6ZGT55OBZGUT5AQQZXLOVQ.jpg?auth=86a54ad5204733386094d81cfebafad47adcb0b8ca890fee56b65c3290ecbf57&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump still aims for Greenland control, its Prime Minister Nielsen warns</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-still-aims-greenland-control-its-prime-minister-warns-2026-02-02/</link><description>COPENHAGEN, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Greenland's Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen warned on Monday that while U.S. President Donald Trump has ruled out military force, Washington still fundamentally seeks to control the Arctic island.

The president intensified calls for U.S. control over Greenland at the beginning of the year, citing national security concerns related to Russia and China, which threatened to fracture the NATO alliance.

Trump has since backed away from threats of force and said he secured total U.S. access to Greenland in a NATO deal, though details remain unclear.

"The view upon Greenland and the population has not changed: Greenland is to be tied to the U.S. and governed from there," Nielsen said in a speech to parliament, speaking via a translator.

Nielsen said the U.S. continues seeking "paths to ownership and control over Greenland".</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 14:12:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/3XADLAUJNNKMXLKHDTZWOUKGU4.jpg?auth=1779162f6ee1b135ec4cc354d88f0ea536ebe3fcbf9f7a14796f24a86166a7d7&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Greek PM targets ministers' immunity, 'jobs for life' to restore voters' trust</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/greek-pm-targets-ministers-immunity-jobs-life-restore-voters-trust-2026-02-02/</link><description>ATHENS, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Greece's prime minister proposed on Monday reviewing ministers' legal immunity and guaranteed "jobs for life" for state-sector workers in a bid to restore voters' trust after a graft scandal and to build support ahead of a 2027 national election.

Kyriakos Mitsotakis' centre-right government remains ahead in opinion polls but it has been shaken by a corruption scandal in which some farmers, aided by state employees, faked land ownership to get subsidies. The affair was revealed by EU prosecutors in 2025 and parliament is looking into the case.

Greeks were also angered by the government's handling of a 2023 train crash which killed 57 people, the country's worst on record. It triggered the biggest mass protests in Greece since a debilitating decade-long debt crisis. A trial opens next month, with protesters demanding full political accountability.

In Greece, only parliament can investigate ministers or lift lawmakers' immunity, according to the four-times-revised 1975 constitution.

"The world of 2026 is different and poses new challenges," Mitsotakis said in a letter to his 156 deputies in the 300-seat parliament and in a televised address. "The time is ripe for a brave constitutional revision towards a functional democracy."

To make public administration more efficient, Mitsotakis suggested that the lifelong job security enjoyed by state employees for more than a century should be reviewed, too, to address underperformance.

The constitution also needs to address modern challenges including artificial intelligence, affordable housing, the climate crisis, fiscal stability and a slow judicial system, he said, without proposing any specific measures.

Mitsotakis and his party took power in 2019 and were re-elected in 2023 for another four-year term.

For the proposed changes to come into effect, two successive parliaments need to approve them and an enhanced majority of 180 deputies is required in at least one of the two votes.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 14:13:07 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7SMD7NHITNI3XJMRQUK3OFDMIM.jpg?auth=89421ec3b3389411277f5c443c0ffe8d1f95fc812e8b1255b842628b7ac6b6fc&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Former Peru foreign minister dies in prison hospital in Brazil</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/former-peru-foreign-minister-dies-prison-hospital-brazil-2026-02-02/</link><description>RIO DE JANEIRO, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Former Peruvian Foreign Minister Augusto Blacker Miller, who was arrested in Brazil in December, died in a prison hospital in Rio de Janeiro late last month, the state penitentiary authority said on Monday.

Russia's accusations were "baseless" and the expulsion was "unprovoked and unjustified", a spokesperson for Britain's Foreign Office (FCDO) said in a statement on Monday.

"Summoning the Russian Ambassador, a senior FCDO official made it clear that the UK will not stand for intimidation of British Embassy staff and so we are taking reciprocal action today, revoking the accreditation of a Russian diplomat," the spokesperson said.

Amid the war in Ukraine, Russia and the West have repeatedly accused each other of unfurling espionage campaigns of an intensity not seen since the depths of the Cold War, while western diplomats in Moscow say they are subject to intrusive surveillance and harassment.

Britain warned Russia against pursuing this course against its diplomats.

"Any further action taken by Russia will be considered an escalation and responded to accordingly," the spokesperson added.

The Russian embassy in London did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 14:13:48 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>EU: rejects Iran's categorisation of EU armies as 'terrorist groups'</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/eu-rejects-irans-categorisation-eu-armies-terrorist-groups-2026-02-02/</link><description>PARIS, Feb 2 (Reuters) - The European Union said it rejected Iran's decision to consider as " terrorist groups " the armies of EU countries after the EU listed the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps on the bloc's list of terrorist organisations.

Budget negotiations have consumed the French political class for nearly two years, after President Emmanuel Macron's 2024 snap election delivered a hung parliament just as a massive hole in public finances made belt-tightening more urgent.

The budget talks have cost two prime ministers their jobs, unsettled debt markets and alarmed France's European partners.

However, Lecornu - whose chaotic two-stage nomination in October drew derision around the world - managed to secure the support of Socialist lawmakers through costly but targeted concessions, boosting his stature in the process.

"It's a political success and an economic failure," said veteran political commentator Alain Duhamel on RTL radio.

Despite the still-elevated budget deficit of 5% of GDP seen by Lecornu, investors have taken heart in the new stability. The French government debt premium over the German benchmark has returned to levels last seen in June 2024, before Macron's snap-election announcement.

The Socialists have said they won't back the no-confidence motions, which means the 2026 budget - already more than a month overdue - will be adopted once the two votes are cleared.

The Socialists' main scalp was the suspension of an unpopular pension reform , delaying the planned increase in the retirement age to 64 until after next year's presidential election.

With just over a year to go before the next presidential election in the spring of 2027, the respite on the budget front is giving Macron some breathing space, as he nears the end of his second term with historically low approval ratings.

Having lost control of the domestic agenda, his push for supply-side economic reforms has largely stalled . Meaningful spending cuts are unlikely before he leaves office, with lawmakers showing little appetite for unpopular measures as election campaigning intensifies.

Macron's supporters say Lecornu, by showing flexibility and an ability to compromise, has prevented the return of wealth taxes and preserved Macron's legacy of making France more attractive to foreign investors.

The president is now focusing almost entirely on foreign policy, pushing Europe to be less dependent on foreign powers, and advocating a harder line in confronting U.S. President Donald Trump over tariffs or the Greenland crisis.

At home, however, he leaves his centrist bloc without a clear successor and significantly weakened against a resurgent far right.

Two of Macron's former prime ministers are gearing up for the presidential race, Edouard Philippe and Gabriel Attal, while Lecornu has also gained popularity over the past few months.

But should the centre remain fragmented, and with no primary planned, it remains uncertain whether a mainstream candidate will reach the election's second round to face the far right, whether led by Jordan Bardella or Marine Le Pen.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 14:14:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7UI7QENH5VKYLHR63VYSJYJ2VA.jpg?auth=05651e037eb03b06aa0f9d8bf55621860088e73aa1fd6f559dbb8e75144cd9f6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Nigeria charges nine with 2025 massacre that killed 150</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/nigeria-charges-nine-with-2025-massacre-that-killed-150-2026-02-02/</link><description>ABUJA, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Nigerian prosecutors filed 57 terrorism-related charges on Monday against nine men accused of carrying out a deadly attack on Yelwata community in Nigeria's central Benue state in June 2025 that killed about 150 people.

Benue sits in Nigeria's volatile Middle Belt, the fault line between the Muslim north and Christian south. Years of violence over land, religion, and ethnicity have proved hard for the authorities to rein in.

The charges, filed at the Federal High Court in Abuja, say the defendants held planning meetings, raised funds, procured weapons, and mobilised fighters across several states ahead of the June 13 attack, one of the deadliest rural assaults in years.

The filing says ringleader Ardo Lawal Mohammed Dono and others met in neighbouring Nasarawa state to raise cash, issue orders and recruit fighters. Several defendants are accused of supplying AK-47s, aiding the gunmen or providing safe sites for planning.

Prosecutors say the raid torched homes and caused heavy casualties in Yelwata in Benue's Guma district.

Plagued by Islamist attacks and mass kidnappings, Nigeria is under pressure to restore security since U.S. President Donald Trump accused it last year of failing to protect Christians. U.S. forces struck what they described as terrorist targets on December 25. The Nigerian authorities say they are cooperating with Washington to improve security.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 14:14:48 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/3KVSSAP6DFMCFMYBSGWAWKK6QA.jpg?auth=64b4633eae7cb47ddc6589cb7467c86ff2c06ed07dcea96acd6d857a1a6d3cd0&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Poland and Germany pledge to take lead on Europe's economic revival</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/poland-germany-must-take-responsibility-europes-economic-revival-finance-2026-02-02/</link><description>WARSAW, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Germany and Poland must take joint responsibility for an economic revival in Europe, the finance ministers of both countries said in Warsaw on Monday, as the continent's growth remains sluggish compared to rivals such as the U.S. and China.

A relatively weak economy has compounded Europe's challenges on multiple other fronts, with perceived security threats from Russia, trade and geopolitical disputes with the Trump administration and uncertainty over relations with Beijing.

"We need to make Europe more competitive," Polish Finance Minister Andrzej Domanski said during a joint press conference with German Vice Chancellor and Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil.

"Both Poland and Germany are ready to create this impetus and to develop economic policies that will return Europe to an economic, rather than regulatory, power," he said.

Klingbeil spoke about the transatlantic relationship and the marked changes it is undergoing.

"And we agree: precisely in this phase we must strengthen Europe and move Europe forward," he said, in his first visit to Poland since he took office.

Klingbeil said the EU must become "faster, smarter, and more capable of dealing with complexity."

Ministers from six leading European economies including Germany and Poland vowed on Wednesday to be the drivers of European progress, as they tackled how to advance projects stalled by the EU's complex decision-making process.

"We have set ourselves the goal of deepening European cooperation, picking up speed, and also demanding this from the Commission," Klingbeil said about last week's video conference.

He said this was a first meeting and another will follow soon in Brussels.

"It's less about adopting decisions now in a new format; it's about finding common positions so that we can then push our decisions forward in the Eurogroup," Klingbeil said, referring to the forum of euro zone finance ministers.

The idea of forging ad hoc coalitions allowing some EU countries to pursue projects without the need for agreement from all 27 member states has long tempted some and has already been applied to key projects including the euro currency.

"We must unwind the regulatory corset, simplify the law, reform our markets, and fully harness the power of the common European market and its nearly 500 million consumers," said Domanski.

The Polish minister said Europe is in a race.

"A race for competitiveness, for building true economic strength, and to achieve this, we need to accelerate," Domanski said.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 14:15:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ZPRJQZBQQVKDNGJCDKMMOH6MQM.jpg?auth=a287c7999193d44e9d4006da4d2e12a077d1b16bdc2bd807ad02d4fcc0b5ba53&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia stepping up strikes on Ukraine's railways, Zelensky says</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260202-russian-stepping-up-strikes-on-ukraine-s-railways-zelensky-says</link><description>President Volodymyr Zelensky said Monday he had ordered Ukrainian military leaders to respond to a growing spate of Russian attacks targeting the country's logistics routes, specifically railway infrastructure.

His comments come after Russian forces stepped up their attacks on train facilities, including one last week that left five people dead in a railway car in the eastern Kharkiv region.

Ukraine has managed to keep its nationwide rail network running despite almost four years of war. Russian forces have prioritised the capture of train hubs such as Kupiansk and Pokrovsk in eastern Ukraine.

"The Russian army remains focused on terror against our logistics – primarily railway infrastructure," Zelensky said in a post on social media.

"In particular, there were strikes in the Dnipro region and in Zaporizhzhia, specifically targeting railway facilities," he added.

State railway operator Ukrzaliznytsia warned earlier on Monday that several of its routes in eastern Ukraine were becoming increasingly "high risk," urging passengers to instead use buses.

In the eastern Sumy region, Ukrzaliznytsia said some of its services would monitor for drone threats and stop near bomb shelters if they emerge.

Zelensky said that while Russia has not carried out any targeted missile or drone ⁠strikes on Ukrainian energy infrastructure in the last 24 hours, energy facilities in frontline areas have come under fire.

The Ukrainian president's statement highlighted the limitations of a short-term energy truce ‍that Russia agreed to last week at the request of US President Donald Trump .

Zelensky said energy ​repair crews had managed to restore energy facilities damaged when high-voltage ​power lines malfunctioned over the weekend, on top of the damage caused by frequent Russian attacks.

"The (energy) system is operating stably. However, given the extremely cold weather and the impact of Russian strikes, all challenges remain serious," Zelensky said on the Telegram app.

Russia fired fewer drones and missiles at Ukraine last month, AFP analysis of data from Kyiv's air force published Monday showed, but still crippled Ukraine's energy infrastructure and pushed the country towards a humanitarian crisis.

The most serious electricity, heating and water outages of the nearly four-year war came in January as the Kremlin battered Ukraine with 4,452 long-range drones – a 13 percent decrease from December – and 135 missiles, a 23 percent decrease on the previous month.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 14:15:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/40bb45e2-0034-11f1-b4e3-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/000-72P24ZQ.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>As Sicily's Niscemi crumbles, families race to save what the Earth hasn’t taken</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/sicilys-niscemi-crumbles-families-race-save-what-earth-hasnt-taken-2026-02-02/</link><description>NISCEMI, Sicily, Feb 2 (Reuters) - After losing their home in the Sicilian town of Niscemi in a massive landslide last week, Benedetta Ragusa and Toni Rinnone raced to salvage their pizzeria, retrieving appliances and kitchenware from the site as the ground shifted beneath them.

Firefighters stood by, assessing cracks in the walls and monitoring earth movements before offering a helping hand, pushing a refrigerator up the street and to safety.

"Unfortunately our house was first to collapse in Niscemi, so we didn't even have the chance to recover our mementos from inside that little home," said Rinnone.

"We still had faith in the shop, in the premises we had, so we wouldn't completely fall apart. Instead, it seems that that, too, is collapsing, bit by bit. It's a bit tough to deal with," he said.

With a population of around 25,000, Niscemi sits on clay and sandstone cliffs, dominating a plain in southern Sicily that leads to the Mediterranean sea some 30 km (20 miles) away. It has experienced landslides since the 1790s, with the last major rupture recorded in 1997.

Despite warnings of instability, nothing was done to shore up the town's fragile foundations, and on January 25, following a ferocious storm that drenched the land, a four-kilometre-long (2.5-mile) stretch of hillside collapsed.

Buildings slipped into the void, others were lacerated by cracks spreading across their walls. Authorities hastily created a "red zone" down the eastern edge of the town, 150 metres (490 ft) deep, and ordered the evacuation of some 1,500 people.

Those who want to retrieve anything from inside the cordoned-off area have to be accompanied by emergency crews and must move quickly. No time for reminiscing.

"It feels like we're at war," said Ragusa as she rushed to gather glasses, plates and pans, piling them into a van.

Ariel views show a dramatic beige scar down one side of Niscemi, with mounds of earth lying on the plain below, the surrounding greenfields crisscrossed with cracks and crevices suggesting the whole landscape was being torn apart.

Buildings and severed roads hang over the edge of the land that remains intact. Below it, the broken stubs of drains and water pipes poke out from newly exposed earth.

"Unfortunately, the situation is truly critical. We have a city, its historic centre, seriously at risk," said Gianfranco Di Pietro, a geospatial data engineer.

"It is still too early to know what our future will look like. But we hope to secure this historic part of the city as soon as possible, to rebuild, to provide housing again to those who have lost it, and to stabilize the entire slope."

Locals could be forgiven for being sceptical.

After the 1997 landslide, experts said parts of the town had been built on unstable ground and urgent work was needed, including installing proper drainage to stop the ground from saturating during storms.

But plans for such work stalled amid a mix of legal disputes and local bureaucracy that regularly throttle public works projects across Italy.

Niscemi Mayor Massimiliano Conti told reporters his town had only in December received funding needed to pay for safety work tied to the 1997 disaster. But that plan had been washed away, like the cliffs it was meant to safeguard.

The public prosecutor's office in nearby Gela has opened an investigation into negligent disaster.

"It is right that those responsible for this should pay," Conti said.

With much of her pizzeria equipment secured, Benedetta Ragusa said she now faced a period of grief over her lost home and the dreams destroyed along with it.

Looking at drone footage, she can only make out her old bathroom wall with a mirror still attached. She was relieved she hadn't got back earlier and tried to save her belongings.

"Losing everything is terrible, losing your first home is terrible, but we were saved, because honestly I don't know what would have happened if we had been inside," she said.

Astonishingly, lives were not lost in the disaster.

While Sicilians have a reputation in Italy for riding roughshod over regulations, locals rejected accusations on social media last week that they had ignored building rules while developing Niscemi.

"We risk losing everything, and people still find the time to talk badly about us, and that's not right," said French teacher Daniela Ferraro, whose home lay within the red zone.

Recent renovation work was carried out with the required permits and the property had been earthquake-proofed, she said, refusing to face the prospect of moving away from Niscemi.

"We will go to work like every day, we will keep rolling up our sleeves because we don't give up. Our land must be saved."</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 15:09:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7I7NEY2ARNJXTNQF56TDVPE6QQ.jpg?auth=21dbbe2e97e811af60500393c2dc41833f7aa231f5ec7846d328b5fef6c1b808&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russian captain guilty over crew member's death in U.S. tanker crash</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/russian-captain-guilty-over-crew-members-death-us-tanker-crash-2026-02-02/</link><description>LONDON, Feb 2 (Reuters) - The captain of a container ship that crashed into a U.S. tanker off Britain's east coast last year was found guilty on Monday of causing the death of a crew member through gross negligence.

Russian national Vladimir Motin, 59, was captain of the Solong when it hit the Stena Immaculate tanker, which was anchored and carrying just over 220,000 barrels of high-grade aviation fuel, on March 10, 2025.

The collision started a blaze on both vessels and caused the death of Filipino national and Solong crew member Mark Pernia, 38, whose body has never been found and is presumed dead.

Prosecutor Tom Little told jurors at the start of Motin's trial last month that Motin did "absolutely nothing" to prevent the collision, having been on course to hit the Stena Immaculate for more than 30 minutes before the fatal crash.

Motin's lawyer James Leonard said Motin unsuccessfully tried to take the Solong off autopilot and change course, arguing that while Motin was at fault he was not grossly negligent.

After a trial at London's Old Bailey court, Motin – who had pleaded not guilty – was convicted of the gross negligence manslaughter of Pernia. He will be sentenced on Thursday.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 15:09:16 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/NDZ4K3APCBIABN23SSQTREKUGY.jpg?auth=0085a0033f177e5e90f49a779886760e5967fe24b00ff8f8b3f08a0c9ab54ac7&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Pakistan's India boycott splits fans as politics overshadows cricket</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sports/cricket/pakistans-india-boycott-splits-fans-politics-overshadows-cricket-2026-02-02/</link><description>KARACHI, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Pakistan's decision to boycott its Twenty20 World Cup match against India has drawn widespread support from fans and administrators who hailed the move as a long-overdue stand in a rivalry in which sport and geopolitics have collided.

The government on Sunday cleared Pakistan to take part in the tournament beginning February 7 but barred the team from playing India in a February 15 group match in Colombo, a decision the International Cricket Council (ICC) said was not in the interests of the global game.

The boycott deepened a long freeze in bilateral cricket between the nuclear-armed neighbours — who have not played a full series since 2012–13 and now meet largely at neutral venues — and dealt a blow to the ICC's marquee event, with India-Pakistan matches the biggest drivers of global viewership and revenue.

For many in Pakistan, however, the boycott was less about cricketing issues, with Pakistan forfeiting two points by skipping the match, and more about symbolism.

"Enough is enough," former Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Najam Sethi told Reuters, accusing India's board of politicising the ICC. "It's time to challenge this duplicitous approach by exercising PCB's options in alliance with Bangladesh."

The Indian government, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and the International Cricket Council did not respond to requests for comment.

The ICC said it was still awaiting an official communication from the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) conveying their "position of selective participation".

"While the ICC respects the roles of governments in matters of national policy, this decision is not in the interest of the global game or the welfare of fans worldwide, including millions in Pakistan," the Dubai-based body said in a statement on Sunday.

The government has not publicly detailed its reasoning, but Mosharraf Zaidi, a spokesperson for Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, linked the move to security tensions with India.

"Nothing is more important than the memory of Pakistani citizens and troops murdered by Indian proxy terrorists over the weekend," Zaidi said. "With funerals taking place today, this was the least that could be done."

The remarks followed coordinated attacks by Baloch separatist militants across Pakistan's southwestern Balochistan province over the weekend that killed nearly 50 people.

India's foreign ministry rejected Pakistan's accusations, calling them "baseless" and accusing Islamabad of deflecting attention from its own internal issues.

Pakistan's World Cup jersey has been branded the "Markhor Edition," after the national animal, a symbol of resilience also used in military iconography, Geo TV reported.

On the streets of Pakistan's major cities, many cricket fans backed the boycott as a response to what they see as India's growing influence over global cricket governance.

"This arrogance of India should be broken a little," said Mohammad Asghar, a fan in Karachi. "They should realise someone has come forward to challenge them."

Others drew parallels with Bangladesh's earlier withdrawal from the tournament over safety concerns, a move that led to Scotland replacing them, and questioned why Pakistan should be held to a different standard.

"If Bangladesh can boycott for one player's safety, why can't Pakistan take a stand?" said Ayaz Ahmed.

The decision also sparked heated debate on social media, with users divided between calls for "self-respect" and warnings that skipping the match could further isolate Pakistan in global cricket.

Former Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi agreed.

"Cricket can open doors when politics closes them," he wrote on X. "It's regrettable that Pakistan won't play India, but this is the moment for the ICC to prove it is impartial."</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 15:09:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/AE4ZRG36LZJ4NPXU2SIT4KWWUY.jpg?auth=b58c697d3561b8e6e2607524e6046b3106ba25bb7fc30fb2fa73544512d66bfe&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Norway police detain son of crown princess on fresh allegations ahead of trial</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/norway-police-detain-son-crown-princess-fresh-allegations-ahead-trial-2026-02-02/</link><description>OSLO, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Norwegian police said on Monday they have detained the eldest son of Norway's crown princess over fresh criminal allegations against him ahead of a separate trial this week in which he faces multiple charges of rape and other crimes.

Police in a statement said Marius Borg Hoiby, 29, son of Crown Princess Mette-Marit and stepson to Crown Prince Haakon, was apprehended on Sunday on suspicion of causing bodily harm, wielding a knife and violating a restraining order.

Following the latest accusations, police said they would seek permission from a judge to keep Hoiby in their custody for the next four weeks.

He has so far been at large awaiting the trial, which begins on Tuesday, on four counts of rape as well as domestic violence, assault and drug possession, among other crimes, one of several cases that have shaken the Norwegian monarchy .

He could face new charges from the latest allegations on top of the 38 counts he currently faces. His lawyer declined to comment on the new accusations presented on Monday.

Hoiby does not admit criminal guilt for the charges of rape and domestic violence, but has admitted to some lesser crimes and plans to give a detailed explanation of this in court, his lawyer has previously said. His trial is due to last until March 19.

The case against Hoiby began in 2024 when police named him as a suspect of physical assault against a woman with whom he had been in a relationship.

Hoiby, in a statement to the media at the time, admitted to causing bodily harm to the woman while he was under the influence of cocaine and alcohol and to damaging her apartment. Hoiby said he regretted his acts.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 15:09:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/QU2V3X2ZIJIGHCFSYQSALNJEJE.jpg?auth=6e4e7aeae997775979638bb8de1ee0e6b11fa9f6dc676759ca0ef7744c88e7e6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Colombia's Clan del Golfo commander dies in river accident</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/colombias-clan-del-golfo-commander-dies-river-accident-2026-02-02/</link><description>BOGOTA, Feb 2 (Reuters) - The second-in-command of Colombia's Clan del Golfo crime gang - the country's largest illegal armed group - Jose Gonzalo Sanchez died when the boat he was traveling in to promote the gang's peace process with the government capsized in a river in the northwest of the country, according to reports from the illegal armed group and the government.

The boat carrying Sanchez, more commonly known as 'Gonzalito' capsized on Friday on the Esmeralda River, in the department of Cordoba, the illegal armed group said in a statement on Sunday.

The Office of the High Commissioner for Peace said it hopes that Sanchez's death would not delay the government's peace process with the illegal armed group. The Clan del Golfo crime gang was designated a terrorist organization by the United States in December.

Talks between the group and the government of leftist President Gustavo Petro are part of the administration's embattled plan to bring peace to the country after six decades of armed conflict.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 15:09:47 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Rome introduces Trevi Fountain access fee to curb coin-tossing crowds</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/rome-introduces-trevi-fountain-access-fee-curb-coin-tossing-crowds-2026-02-02/</link><description>ROME, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Tourists keen to follow tradition by tossing a coin into Rome's Trevi Fountain will need to dig a little deeper from Monday, as the city introduces a new 2-euro ($2.40) visitor fee.

The charge, aimed at easing overtourism and helping fund upkeep of the monument, applies only to visitors who walk down the stone steps to get close to the fountain's basin.

The surrounding square, which offers views of the landmark, will remain freely accessible.

The fee will be levied from 11:30 a.m. to 10 p.m. on weekdays and from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. at weekends. Under rules first announced in December, Rome residents are exempt, along with people with disabilities and their companions, and children under 6.

"I didn't know that we had to pay, but I have no problem with that," said Argentine tourist Valentina De Vicentis, one of those affected by the new fee. She said she expected it to ease overcrowding.

"There are less people in here, so I think that's good, because if not, there are a lot of people and you can't take pictures and you can't stay (for a long) time and enjoy."

The Trevi Fountain, where tradition dictates that visitors toss a coin into the water to guarantee their return to Rome, has long been one of the city's most popular attractions, even for visiting world leaders .

It is remembered for the famous film scene in Federico Fellini's "La Dolce Vita", in which Anita Ekberg wades into the fountain and beckons her co-star Marcello Mastroianni to join her: "Marcello! Come here!"

Authorities say more than 10 million people visited the fountain in the December 2024-December 2025 period, which largely coincided with a Catholic Holy Year, or Jubilee, which drew about 33.5 million pilgrims to Rome.

Fed by an ancient Roman aqueduct and completed in 1762, the monument is a late Baroque masterpiece depicting Oceanus, the god of all water, symbolising the varying moods of the world's seas and rivers.

With tourism booming in Rome and across Italy, visitor fees have been introduced at a growing number of cultural landmarks.

They include Rome's ancient Pantheon , the entire city of Venice during the peak travel season, and, on a temporary basis, the courtyard in Verona with the balcony associated with Shakespeare's "Romeo and Juliet".

Michelangelo's "Last Judgment", a Renaissance masterwork in the Vatican's Sistine Chapel that depicts the Second Coming of Jesus, is undergoing its first restoration in 30 years.

Experts will work over three months to remove decades of built-up particles that have obscured the colours of the artwork, the Vatican said in a press release.

"The new intervention... will allow the removal of these deposits and the consequent recovery of the chromatic and luministic quality desired by Michelangelo," it said.

The Sistine Chapel, famous as the site of the secret conclave where the world's Catholic cardinals vote to select new popes , sees millions of visitors each year as part of the Vatican Museums.

The chapel will remain open during the restoration. But the fresco itself, showing Jesus delivering his final judgment of humanity, will be covered by scaffolding.

Visitors will instead be able to see a high-definition reproduction of the artwork, the Vatican said.

The chapel is also home to many other frescoes, including Michelangelo's "The Creation of Adam" on its ceiling. Those will still be on display.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 16:01:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/X6F4SMTDPNOABOCNUYDXFVNLJE.jpg?auth=3dd80a56484bdb3802d69a59f5cb41732452141be642b11d213e6908ea7f4e3d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>U.S. hospitality space changes name from 'Ice House' to 'Winter House' following protests</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us-hospitality-space-changes-name-ice-house-winter-house-following-protests-2026-02-02/</link><description>MILAN, Feb 2 (Reuters) - U.S. Olympic officials have changed the name of an athlete hospitality space at the Milano Cortina Games from "Ice House" to "Winter House," a move that comes following protests in Minneapolis over the fatal shootings of two U.S. citizens by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers.

The venue has been billed by the United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC) as an "athlete-first space" where U.S. figure skaters, hockey players, speedskaters and their families can gather in what is normally a boutique-style hotel in the heart of Milan.

"Our hospitality concept was designed to be a private space free of distractions where athletes, their families, and friends can come together to celebrate the unique experience of the Winter Games," U.S. Figure Skating, USA Hockey and US Speedskating said in a joint statement.

"This name captures that vision and connects to the season and the event."

Winter House will host a variety of activities, including meet-and-greets with Olympic champions and legends, medal celebrations, watch parties and sponsored events, according to the USOPC. While not open to the public, NBC will showcase the venue during its coverage.

Thousands of protesters have taken to the streets in Minneapolis and students across the U.S. staged walkouts on Friday to demand the withdrawal of federal immigration agents from Minnesota following the shootings.

Under a national immigration crackdown, President Donald Trump has sent 3,000 federal officers to the Minneapolis area who are patrolling the streets in tactical gear, a force five times the size of the Minneapolis Police Department.

"I think it's wise," U.S. figure skater Amber Glenn told reporters after practice on Monday in Milan.

"It's unfortunate that the term ICE isn't something we can embrace because of what's happening and the implications of what some individuals are doing.

"Unfortunately, in my own country, it is very upsetting and very distressing to see. And I can't imagine how people who have been impacted by that directly feel. So I think it's wise that we change something as minute as a name if it is able to make anyone feel more comfortable."</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 16:01:43 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Truck traffic at Cargill facility in northern Brazil blocked by protesters</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/truck-traffic-cargill-facility-northern-brazil-blocked-by-protesters-2026-02-02/</link><description>SAO PAULO, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Protesters have been blocking truck traffic at Cargill's Santarem grain terminal in northern Brazil, according to a company statement in response to Reuters questions on Monday.

Cargill denied any occupation of its facilities by protesters, whom local media identified as Indigenous groups.

Cargill's Santarem terminal handles soybeans and corn. According to the company's website, most of the grain arrives there by barge before being hauled onto ships for export.

A smaller portion of the grain that passes through the terminal arrives by trucks, either directly from the state of Mato Grosso via the BR-163 highway or from local farms.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 16:01:56 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/SKFCNH6DENL5XINDEIL5PDLKSM.jpg?auth=d8cefc04a768e0e3fea3070b090dab2ee44171e29652bd2c2420904b3aabbf6a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Gun-wielding IS militants roamed freely on airport tarmac during Niger attack, footage shows</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/gun-wielding-is-militants-roamed-freely-airport-tarmac-during-niger-attack-2026-02-02/</link><description>DAKAR, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Islamic State militants set off explosions and roamed freely among passenger planes during an attack at Niger's main international airport, according to footage distributed by SITE Intelligence Group, which tracks jihadist activity worldwide.

The attack last week has renewed international concern about the security situation in Niger, with Washington ordering non-emergency government employees and their family members to leave the West African country because of safety risks.

It could also further strain regional ties after Niger's military leader Abdourahamane Tiani accused the presidents of Benin and Ivory Coast - as well as France - of sponsoring the attack, without offering evidence.

A Benin government spokesperson denied the allegation, while Ivory Coast summoned the Nigerien ambassador to condemn Tiani's comments.

During the attack at the capital Niamey's airport, claimed by Islamic State's West Africa affiliate on Friday , gunfire and loud explosions echoed around the airport beginning late Wednesday before calm returned on Thursday morning.

In the footage distributed by SITE on Sunday, militants on foot and motorbike fire weapons into the air near parked passenger planes and aircraft hangars, where they set off an explosion near an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and a helicopter that were later shown engulfed in flames.

The video "shows IS militants speaking Kanuri, a language more commonly used in the Lake Chad basin," said Ladd Serwat, senior analyst for Africa at U.S. crisis-monitoring group ACLED.

"While ISSP militants come from diverse areas, this may indicate that more experienced drone operators from Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) supported the attack."

Pan-African carrier ASKY Airlines said two of its aircraft sustained minor damage during the incident while parked on the tarmac. Ivory Coast's national airline Air Cote d'Ivoire said an Airbus A319 was hit, with damage to its fuselage and right wing.

Both companies said no passengers or crew were injured as the incident occurred outside operational hours.

Niger said it killed 20 attackers, including a French national, and injured 11. Islamic State has given no figures.

Niger, like its Sahel neighbours Mali and Burkina Faso, has struggled to contain attacks from jihadist groups linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State that have killed thousands and displaced millions in the three countries.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 16:02:39 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/IPUE5PAB4FM33CEPA4PDLZNANA.jpg?auth=f5dcc8e89d0afdfd2492dcd0c06a15a8c36a478eb0f34587a2fe58ee9ffc6538&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Spain performs pioneering face transplant from donor who requested assisted dying</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/spain-performs-pioneering-face-transplant-donor-who-requested-assisted-dying-2026-02-02/</link><description>MADRID, Feb 2 (Reuters) - A hospital in Barcelona said on Monday it had performed a pioneering facial transplant in which the donor, in a world first, had offered her face for donation before undergoing an assisted dying procedure.

The complex surgery involved transplanting composite tissue from the central part of the face and required the participation of around 100 professionals, including psychiatrists and immunologists, the prestigious Vall d'Hebron hospital said in a statement.

The hospital's transplant coordinator, Elisabeth Navas, said the donor had showed "a level of maturity that leaves one speechless".

"Someone who has decided to end their life dedicates one of their last wishes to a stranger and gives them a second chance of this magnitude," Navas said.

The recipient - identified only by her first name Carme - had suffered facial tissue necrosis from a bacterial infection caused by an insect bite, affecting her ability to speak, eat and see.

"When I'm looking in the mirror at home, I'm thinking that I'm starting to look more like myself," Carme told a press conference on Monday, adding her recovery was going very well.

For such cases requiring facial transplants, donor and recipient must share the same sex, blood group and have a similar head size.

With a population of 49.4 million, Spain has been a global leader in organ transplants for more than three decades. In 2021, it became the fourth European Union country to legalise euthanasia.

Half of the six facial transplants ever done in Spain have been performed by Vall d'Hebron staff. The Catalan hospital also carried out the world's first full face transplant back in 2010.

A spokesperson for the hospital declined to say the exact date of the procedure for privacy reasons, but told Reuters it took place during the autumn of 2025.

Some 6,300 organ transplants were performed last year in Spain, according to Health Ministry data, with kidney transplants being the most common.

The Games will be the last one to be held with the existing and fragmented regulations regarding the eligibility of transgender athletes in women's categories.

The International Olympic Committee is expected to shortly issue new and universal guidelines, which it says are designed to protect women's sport.

The issue of transgender athletes at the Olympics and other top sports events has become a controversial issue in recent years due to the lack of clear and universal rules governing sport.

Sporting bodies have had to balance the twin aims of protecting the women's category but also allowing the free participation for all in sports without any discrimination.

Transgender advocacy groups say excluding trans athletes amounts to discrimination.

Critics of transgender inclusion in women's sport say that the process of going through male puberty imbues athletes with a huge musculo-skeletal advantage that transition does not mitigate.

U.S. President Donald Trump last year banned transgender athletes in the country from competing in college and pro events in the female category.

Yes, under existing rules transgender athletes can participate in the summer and winter Olympics once they have been cleared to do so by their respective sports federations. Currently it is up to each sports federation to draw up participation rules for transgender athletes. There is no universal rule governing their participation or eligibility in pro sports.

ARE THERE TRANSGENDER ATHLETES SET TO COMPETE AT THE MILANO-CORTINA 2026 WINTER OLYMPICS.

Yes, transgender athletes are set to compete in Italy's Games, including Elis Lundholm, a Swedish mogul skier. Lundholm was born a female and identifies as a man. The 23-year-old will be competing in the women's category.

Lundholm would still be eligible to compete in the future no matter the restrictions for transgender athletes, as according to the IOC, the Swede's participation is "in accordance with (international skiing federation) FIS eligibility criteria."

"Elis Lundholm competes in the female category, which is aligned with the sex of this athlete," the IOC told Reuters.

No, there is currently no universal rule regarding the participation of transgender athletes in professional or elite sports. The International Olympic Committee long refused to apply any universal rule on transgender participation for the Games.

It instructed international federations in 2021 to come up with their own guidelines.

The IOC's 2021 guidelines on Fairness, Inclusion and Non-Discrimination suggested that federations prioritised the inclusion of gender non-conforming athletes in the category of their choice, while making no presumptions of unfair advantage.

Under new IOC president Kirsty Coventry, however, the Olympic body did a u-turn in 2025 and decided to take the lead in setting eligibility criteria with fairness of competition the foremost consideration.

The IOC has said it will issue its new rules on participation of transgender athletes in the first quarter of 2026. Under rules still in force, transgender athletes are eligible to take part in the Olympics.

Yes, there are several major sports federations that have restricted the participation of transgender athletes in women's competitions.

World Rugby banned transgender athletes from competing at elite level, while World Athletics does not allow transgender athletes who have undergone male puberty to compete.

World Aquatics allows transgender athletes who have transitioned before the age of 12 to compete, but not those who have done so after that age.

The situation remains somewhat murky in soccer, the world's most popular sport, with FIFA yet to announce a long-promised policy update.

Some individual associations, including the English FA, have unilaterally banned transgender players from competing in women's competitions.

In 2025, boxing and athletics introduced mandatory tests for athletes in the female category to detect the SRY gene, which is on the Y chromosome and triggers the development of male characteristics in mammals.

U.S. President Trump has banned transgender athletes from competing in women's sports in schools in the United States.

Trump, who signed the "Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports" order in February 2025, has said he would not allow transgender athletes to compete at the 2028 Los Angeles Summer Olympics.

Following Trump's decision, the United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee also changed its rules accordingly, banning transgender athletes from taking part in women's sports.

Yes, a small number of openly transgender athletes have taken part in past editions of the Olympic Games. New Zealand's Laurel Hubbard became the first openly transgender athlete to compete in a different gender category to that assigned at birth when the weightlifter took part in the women's weightlifting competition at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 16:56:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ZCUU26Z77RJPBKPZMNC7IWIYW4.jpg?auth=b0ce07719dce3ccdd85b54e43fa2030e44f370d971adc216f707cf083061a307&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Fire breaks out in Karachi building near site of recent blaze, provincial spokesperson says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/fire-breaks-out-karachi-building-near-site-recent-blaze-provincial-spokesperson-2026-02-02/</link><description>KARACHI, Feb 2 (Reuters) - A fire broke out in a commercial building in Pakistan's Karachi on Monday, close to the site where a deadly fire killed dozens of people last month, a provincial government spokesman said.

The claim by the group Boervolk of the Orange Free State to land in KwaZulu-Natal province near the border with Lesotho was published in the government gazette last week, invoking a U.N. resolution granting independence to colonial states.

The group said it was taking its cue from Trump questioning whether Denmark's colonisation of Greenland gives it the right to own the Arctic island.

A spokesperson for the group did not respond to several emailed requests for comment. A spokesperson for South Africa's land reform department did not respond to a request for comment.

The government has let one white separatist group, Orania , set up a small community on the Orange River, but it would be unlikely to accept the Boervolk of the Orange Free State's claim.

Boervolk of the Orange Free State is one of several small separatist groups representing Afrikaners - descendents of mostly Dutch settlers who arrived at the Cape of Good Hope in the 17th century and spread inland.

The land it claims was acquired by Afrikaners from the Zulu king they backed in an 1840 succession war against his brother, but Britain took it by force in the second Anglo-Boer war at the turn of the 20th century and incorporated it into South Africa.

Much of the land settled by Afrikaners was seized from Black Africans in skirmishes, and as a result Afrikaners still own most of South Africa's privately owned land. Very few Afrikaners and other white nationalists have sought to break away.

Boervolk of the Orange Free State said ownership of the land in Kwazulu-Natal came from "willing buyer and seller agreements" with Zulu kings Dingaan and Mpande.

"Britain never owned (the land) ... and couldn't legally give it to the Union of South Africa in 1910," it said.

Therefore, it said, the land did not legally belong to South Africa's Black majority government, which took power after ending Afrikaner nationalist apartheid in 1994.

Zulu king Dingaan granted land to Afrikaners in 1837, but historians say the Zulus did not have the same Western concept of land ownership.

Dingaan killed some Afrikaners during a feast the following year and the settlers responded by backing his brother Mpande's revolt, declaring Mpande king when the war ended.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 16:57:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukraine's Zelenskiy says dignified, lasting peace realistic, ahead of talks</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraines-zelenskiy-says-dignified-lasting-peace-realistic-ahead-talks-2026-02-02/</link><description>KYIV, Feb 2 (Reuters) - President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Monday that it was realistic to achieve a dignified and lasting peace, ahead of the next round of peace talks with Russian and U.S. officials due this week in Abu Dhabi.

"The president's been calling for them to make a deal. The meeting is to hear what they have to say," the official said.

An Iranian foreign ministry official earlier said Tehran was weighing the terms for resuming talks with the United States soon, after both sides signaled readiness to revive diplomacy over a long-running nuclear dispute and dispel fears of a new regional war.

Trump intensified calls for ‍US control over Greenland at the start of the year, citing national security concerns related to Russia and China . Some European ​NATO allies have defended Denmark’s sovereignty over Greenland and said Trump’s pressure threatened to ​fracture the NATO alliance.

The US president has since backed away from threats of force and said he had secured total US access to Greenland in a NATO deal, though details remain unclear.

“The view upon Greenland and the population has not changed: Greenland is to be tied to the US and governed from there,” Nielsen said in a speech to the island’s parliament in ‍Nuuk, speaking via a translator.

Nielsen said the US continues seeking “paths to ownership and control over Greenland”.

The island’s government said last week ​it had launched a survey of the population’s mental health situation at a time of extraordinary pressure.

“Some of our compatriots have severe sleep problems, children feel the worry and anxiety ‌of adults, and we all live with constant uncertainty about what may happen tomorrow,” Nielsen said. “We want to say it very clearly: This is completely unacceptable”.

Diplomatic talks between the US, Denmark and Greenland began last week with senior officials meeting to “discuss how we can address American concerns about security in the Arctic while respecting the Kingdom’s red lines”, Denmark’s foreign ministry said.

Nielsen also praised Denmark as a close partner throughout the crisis.

He has previously stated that if Greenlanders were forced to choose between the US and Denmark, they would choose Denmark. The ‍speech made no mention of independence for Greenland.

For Greenland’s Inuit native population, the debate over ownership clashes with cultural values. Under ‌Greenlandic law, people ​can own houses but not the land beneath them, reflecting the Inuit concept of collective land stewardship.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 16:58:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/2a638d52-f7ad-11f0-8a14-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26020618890978.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Norway’s royal crisis: Crown princess faces Epstein scrutiny ahead of son’s rape trail</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260202-norway-royal-crisis-crown-princess-faces-epstein-scrutiny-ahead-of-son-rape-trail</link><description>The scandals involving Norway’s royal household just keep on piling up.

On Sunday, Marius Borg Hoiby, the eldest son of Crown Princess Mette-Marit , was arrested, accused of assault, threats with a knife and violation of a restraining order, police said in a statement. Police requested four weeks’ detention on grounds of risk of reoffending. His lawyers could not immediately be reached for comment.

On Tuesday, Hoiby is due to go on trial at the Oslo district court. The indictment includes 38 counts, including rape, abuse in a close relationship against one former partner, acts of violence against another and transporting 3.5 kilograms of marijuana. Other charges include making death threats and traffic violations.

Hoiby has been under scrutiny since he was repeatedly arrested in 2024 on various allegations of wrongdoing. He was indicted in August, but had been free pending trial until Sunday.

Hoiby is the son of Crown Princess Mette-Marit from a previous relationship and stepson of the heir to the throne, Crown Prince Haakon . He has no royal title or official duties.

The indictment centres on four alleged rapes between 2018 and November 2024; alleged violence and threats against a former partner between the summer of 2022 and the fall of 2023; and two alleged acts of violence against a subsequent partner, along with violations of a restraining order.

Hoiby’s defence team has said that he “denies all charges of sexual abuse, as well as the majority of the charges regarding violence”.

Haakon said last week that he and Mette-Marit do not plan to attend court and that the royal house doesn’t intend to comment during the proceedings.

He emphasised that Hoiby is not part of the royal house and that, as a citizen of Norway, he has the same responsibilities and rights as all others. He said that he is confident that all concerned will make the trial as orderly, proper and fair as possible.

While the royals are generally popular in Norway, the Hoiby case has cast a shadow on their image. And the trial is opening just as his mother faces renewed scrutiny over her contacts with Jeffrey Epstein .

Friday’s release of the latest batch of documents from the Epstein files shone an unflattering spotlight on Mette-Marit. They contained several hundred mentions of the crown princess, who already said in 2019 that she regretted having had contact with Epstein, Norwegian media reported.

The newly released documents, which include email exchanges with Epstein, showed that Mette-Marit borrowed a property of Epstein’s in Palm Beach, Florida, for several days in early 2013, and the royal house confirmed that she did so through a mutual friend, broadcaster NRK reported.

In a statement emailed by the royal house, Mette-Marit said that she “must take responsibility for not having investigated Epstein’s background more thoroughly, and for not realising sooner what kind of person he was”.

“I deeply regret this, and it is a responsibility I must bear. I showed poor judgment and regret having had any contact with Epstein at all,” she said. “It is simply embarrassing.”

She expressed her “deep sympathy and solidarity” with the victims of Epstein’s abuse.

Over the weekend, Kjetil B Alstadheim, a political reporter for one of Norway’s biggest newspapers Aftenposten , described the scandal as “a direct threat against the [royal] institution itself”.

Depending on how she and the royal household handle the matter “could prove decisive for whether Mette-Marit ever becomes queen”, he wrote.

Mette-Marit’s contacts with Epstein and the Hoiby trial are not the only source of negative publicity for Norway’s royals. The business ventures of Haakon’s sister, Princess Martha Louise, have drawn repeated criticism. In 2024, around the same time Hoiby’s case was making news, she married an American self-professed shaman, Durek Verrett.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 16:58:26 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/d1333426-004e-11f1-98ab-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26033497287150.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Exclusive: Iran fears US strike may reignite protests, imperil rule, sources say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-fears-us-strike-may-reignite-protests-imperil-rule-sources-say-2026-02-02/</link><description>DUBAI, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Iran’s leadership is increasingly worried a U.S. strike could break its grip on power by driving an already enraged public back onto the streets, following a bloody crackdown on anti-government protests, according to six current and former officials.

In high-level meetings, officials told Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei that public anger over last month's crackdown -- the bloodiest since the 1979 Islamic Revolution-- has reached a point where fear is no longer a deterrent , four current officials briefed on the discussions said.

The officials said Khamenei was told that many Iranians were prepared to confront security forces again and that external pressure such as a limited U.S. strike could embolden them and inflict irreparable damage to the political establishment.

One of the officials told Reuters that Iran's enemies were seeking more protests so as to bring the Islamic Republic to an end, and "unfortunately" there would be more violence if an uprising took place.

"An attack combined with demonstrations by angry people could lead to a collapse (of the ruling system). That is the main concern among the top officials and that is what our enemies want," said the official, who like the other officials contacted for this story declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter.

The reported remarks are significant because they suggest private misgivings inside the leadership at odds with Tehran’s defiant public stance towards the protesters and the U.S.

The sources declined to say how Khamenei responded. Iran's Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on this account of the meetings.

Multiple sources told Reuters last week that U.S. President Donald Trump is weighing options against Iran that include targeted strikes on security forces and leaders to inspire protesters, even as Israeli and Arab officials said air power alone would not topple the clerical rulers.

Any such uprising in the wake of a U.S. strike would stand in contrast to Iranians' response to Israeli and U.S. bombing attacks on Iran's nuclear program back in June, which was not followed by anti-government demonstrations.

But a former senior moderate official said the situation had changed since the crackdown in early January.

"People are extremely angry," he said, adding a U.S. attack could lead Iranians to rise up again. "The wall of fear has collapsed. There is no fear left."

Tensions between Tehran and Washington are running high. The arrival of a U.S. aircraft carrier and supporting warships in the Middle East has expanded Trump's ability to take military action if he so wishes, after repeatedly threatening intervention over Iran's bloody crackdown.

Several opposition figures, who were part of the establishment before falling out with it, have warned the leadership that "boiling public anger" could result in a collapse of the Islamic system.

"The river of warm blood that was spilled on the cold month of January will not stop boiling until it changes the course of history," former prime minister Mirhossein Mousavi, who has been under house arrest without trial since 2011, said in a statement published by the pro-reform Kalameh website.

"In what language should people say they do not want this system and do not believe your lies? Enough is enough. The game is over'," Mousavi added in the statement.

During the early January protests, witnesses and rights groups said, security forces crushed demonstrations with lethal force, leaving thousands killed and many wounded. Tehran blamed the violence on "armed terrorists" linked to Israel and the U.S.

Trump stopped short of carrying out threats to intervene but he has since demanded Iran make nuclear concessions. Both Tehran and Washington have signalled readiness to revive diplomacy over a long-running nuclear dispute.

Analysts and insiders say that while the streets are quiet for now, deep-seated grievances have not gone away.

Public frustration has been simmering over economic decline, political repression, a widening gulf between rich and poor, and entrenched corruption that leaves many Iranians feeling trapped in a system offering neither relief nor a path forward.

"This may not be the end, but it is no longer just the beginning," said Hossein Rassam, a London-based analyst.

If protests resume during mounting foreign pressure and security forces respond with force, the six current and former officials said they fear demonstrators would be bolder than in previous unrest, emboldened by experience and driven by a sense that they have little left to lose.

One of the officials told Reuters that while people were angrier than before, the establishment would use harsher methods against protesters if it was under U.S. attack. He said the result would be a bloodbath.

Ordinary Iranians contacted by Reuters said they expected Iran's rulers to crack down hard on any further protests.

A Tehran resident whose 15-year-old son was killed in the protests on January 9 said the demonstrators had merely sought a normal life, and had been answered "with bullets.”

"If America attacks, I will go back to the streets to take revenge for my son and the children this regime killed.”</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 17:39:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/6TV3JFRN7VMPXKTFZPA2GBC5AQ.jpg?auth=ffd7fa1817e2aaefbef53210f3f379cac1c890045b369c14966d76a12cde7eb4&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Cambodian scam compound yields trove of fraud evidence, Thai military says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/cambodian-scam-compound-yields-trove-fraud-evidence-thai-military-says-2026-02-02/</link><description>CHONG CHOM, Thailand/ODDAR MEANCHEY, Cambodia, Feb 2 (Reuters) - The Thai military said on Monday it had recovered a trove of evidence of transnational fraud from a Cambodian scam compound seized during clashes last year between the two countries along their disputed border .

Briefing reporters and foreign delegates in Surin province, senior Thai military officials said the O’Smach complex had housed thousands of people, many of them victims of human trafficking who were forced to scam strangers or face punishment.

Soldiers later showed reporters around one of several buildings in the complex that were bombed and occupied by the Thai military late last year. The six‑storey building was strewn with documents, including long lists of what appeared to be potential targets and their contact details, as well as scripts for scam dialogues.

O'Smach has previously been named as a base for scam operations including by the United States, which cited trafficking and forced criminality.

“The reason we are showing this place today is that we want the world to see how it’s being used as a criminal base against humanity,” Lieutenant General Teeranan Nandhakwang, director‑general of the Royal Thai Army’s Directorate of Intelligence, told reporters.

Touch Sokhak, a spokesperson for Cambodia’s interior ministry, told Reuters Thailand had used scam centres as a pretext for military attacks. He said Cambodia was carrying out a crackdown on scams and had pledged to eradicate the illicit industry before April.

Thailand and Cambodia ended weeks of fierce border clashes in late December with a ceasefire — the second in recent months — that halted the worst fighting in years between the Southeast Asian neighbours.

During the clashes the Thai military struck several casino complexes it alleged were scam compounds, saying they were also used to store weapons and launch attacks.

Parts of Southeast Asia, including border areas between Thailand, Myanmar and Cambodia, have become hubs for online fraud in recent years, generating billions of dollars annually.

Among the items seized at O’Smach were 871 SIM cards enabling anonymous international communication, dozens of smartphones, counterfeit police insignia and police uniforms, the Thai military said.

Reporters visiting the complex also saw several rooms set up to resemble police offices from different countries, including Brazil, China and Australia.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 17:40:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/W6YXLYNGPZONRIUUIUOXGLPBZI.jpg?auth=666680b612d48c04e865b7aa116e49d7ceed20ae7b12f76d90b1a9a376cfe7d3&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Portugal counts multi‑billion‑euro damage after Storm Kristin tears off roofs</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/portugal-counts-multibillioneuro-damage-after-storm-kristin-tears-off-roofs-2026-02-02/</link><description>LISBON/LEIRIA, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Last week's Storm Kristin left hundreds of homes in central Portugal without roofs, tens of thousands without power and residents lining up for emergency building materials, as authorities warned damage could run into billions of euros.

The storm swept across the region early on Wednesday, with wind gusts topping 200 kph (124 mph) and heavy rain uprooting trees and ripping off roofs. It killed at least six people and cut power to hundreds of thousands of households.

"The roof blew off, all the windowpanes are broken, everything is chaos and misery," said Paula Franco as she queued in Leiria for donated tiles to repair her home.

Portugal's government on Sunday approved a 2.5 billion-euro ($2.95 billion) package of loans and incentives to help people and businesses rebuild after the storm.

The government could apply for grants from the European Solidarity Fund and unused EU recovery funds to finance reconstruction, Environment and Energy Minister Maria da Graca Carvalho said on Monday at a joint news conference with EU Energy Commissioner Dan Jorgensen.

Leiria, one of Portugal’s main industrial hubs known for its plastics and metalworking industries, was among the hardest-hit areas.

Hundreds of houses, several roads, schools, factories and railway lines have been affected. At the Monte Real air base near Leiria, the storm damaged several aircraft, including F16 fighter jets.

Nearly 170,000 households were still without electricity on Monday, Graca Carvalho said.

Damage in the region could total between 1.5 billion euros and 2 billion euros, Henrique Carvalho, president of the Leiria Business Association, told broadcaster NOW.

The government on Sunday extended a state of calamity in 69 municipalities until February 8, with more heavy rain and flooding expected.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 17:40:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/T62WBCAY4RLFLHA4YBIHL3NU74.jpg?auth=c20df4070a44739379df25ec77a532c590d8574522441d87d81e01c5f3fb30ad&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Nigeria police says 80 abducted congregants return home, Christian group disputes claim</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/nigeria-police-says-80-abducted-congregants-return-home-christian-group-disputes-2026-02-02/</link><description>MAIDUGURI, Nigeria, Feb 2 (Reuters) - At least 80 congregants earlier believed to have been abducted by gunmen from three churches in northern Nigeria last month have returned home, police said on Monday, a claim immediately disputed by the Christian Association of Nigeria.

Gunmen stormed the churches in Kaduna state on January 18 and seized 177 worshippers, disappearing with them into nearby forests, according to CAN. Eleven people later escaped, leaving 166 missing, the group said.

Kaduna police spokesperson Mansur Hassan said fresh inquiries showed 80 of those reported missing had fled to nearby villages during the attack and only returned to their homes in Kurmin Wali over the weekend when they felt safe.

“Currently, we have invited all of these individuals to the Kaduna State Police Headquarters for verification of their identities, screening and health assessments,” Hassan told Reuters by phone.

Police initially denied the kidnapping before acknowledging the incident and saying security forces were searching for the missing.

However, CAN’s Kaduna state chairman, Reverend Caleb Maaji, said he had no information about any returnees.

“Based on the information available to me, the number of those kidnapped remains 177, except for the 11 who escaped and are receiving care in the hospital,” he said.

The police and CAN often offer different figures and accounts on church kidnappings.

Kidnapping for ransom is widespread in northern Nigeria, where armed gangs frequently attack villages, schools and motorists.

The assault on the Kaduna churches is among the latest in a string of mass abductions that has intensified pressure on the Nigerian government. Nigeria has also faced scrutiny from U.S. President Donald Trump, who has accused the country of persecuting Christians — allegations the Nigerian government denies.

Authorities say they are working to curb Islamist insurgents and other armed groups who have targeted both Christian and Muslim civilians, often for ransom.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 17:40:39 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/MQLWRRXWVBLORAKUJMNK5EFSOA.jpg?auth=33bed03bd47566d40475d50ceb3a6656dd654fc1e23b06739dc89f5037747ed8&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Morocco evacuates 50,000 as flooding threatens city after weeks of heavy rain</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/morocco-evacuates-50000-flooding-threatens-city-after-weeks-heavy-rain-2026-02-02/</link><description>RABAT, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Morocco has evacuated more than 50,000 people, nearly half the population of the northwestern city of Ksar el-Kebir, as flooding driven by weeks of heavy rain threatened to inundate the city, state media said on Monday.

"The city has become a ghost town," local resident Hicham Ajttou told Reuters by phone. "All markets and shops are closed and most residents have either left voluntarily or been evacuated."

Authorities set up shelters and temporary camps and barred entry into Ksar el-Kebir as rising water levels in the Loukkos River spread across several neighbourhoods. Only departures from the city were permitted, while electricity was cut in parts of it and schools were ordered to remain closed until Saturday.

Officials said the floods were partly triggered by water released from the nearby Oued Makhazine dam, which had reached full capacity. Ksar el-Kebir lies about 190 km (120 miles) north of Rabat.

Ajttou said he moved his family to Tangier last week and returned to Ksar el-Kebir to volunteer in relief efforts.

"The question that worries us is what comes next. The dam is full and we don't know how long this situation will last," he said.

The army has deployed rescue units, trucks, equipment and medics to support evacuation and rescue operations and buses evacuated people from the city.

State TV Al Oula showed a helicopter rescuing four people trapped by rising waters in Oued Ouargha in the nearby province of Ouezzane.

Further south, rising levels of the Sebou River prompted authorities to evacuate several villagers in Sidi Kacem and reinforce riverbanks with sandbags and barriers.

The heavy rainfall has brought an end to a seven‑year drought that pushed Morocco to invest heavily in desalination plants. The national dam-filling rate is now close to 62%, with several major reservoirs reaching full capacity, according to official data.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 17:40:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Digital sovereignty (1/3): Have Trump’s threats spurred a European awakening?</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/technology/20260202-digital-sovereignty-have-trump-threats-spurred-european-awakening</link><description>Out go Teams, Zoom and Google Meet. In comes Visio.

The French administration is preparing to ditch popular US videoconferencing tools in favour of a homegrown equivalent starting in 2027, a move it says will ensure critical data and infrastructure remains in French hands .

The aim, says David Amiel, the junior minister for the civil service and state reform, is to “end the use of non-European solutions and guarantee the security and confidentiality of electronic communications by relying on a powerful and sovereign tool”.

Visio is part of a batch of French tech alternatives, called LaSuite, specifically developed for French officials and millions of public-sector workers.

News of its impending launch comes at a time of increasingly urgent debate about the continent’s reliance on US Big Tech , which dominated discussions at the European Digital Sovereignty Summit in Berlin last November.

The sudden sense of urgency is a direct consequence of US President Donald Trump’s aggressive rhetoric towards European allies and his open threats to seize the Danish territory of Greenland .

While talk of technological ‘decoupling’ from the US is hardly new , the prospect of Washington slapping sanctions on Europe or cutting access to key technologies has dramatically altered the equation, says Francesca Musiani, head of the Internet and Society Centre at France’s National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS).

“The urgency stems from the fact that geopolitical tensions, for instance over Greenland, can rapidly escalate and push the US to take advantage of Europe’s technological reliance, which has been built up over decades,” Musiani explains.

“US threats may have sounded like banter in the past, but Europeans have now realised, particularly with what happened in Venezuela, that Trump is entirely serious when he issues such warnings,” adds Christophe Grosbost, chief strategy officer at the Innovation Makers Alliance.

Should Trump follow through on his threats and ask the likes of Meta , Google and Amazon to “completely cut off European access to their services, our societies and economies would be completely disrupted,” Grosbost warns. “It would be disastrous.”

Such a step would be especially damaging to governments in Europe.

“Technological reliance is most critical for public institutions because they handle sensitive data, perform sovereign functions and have an obligation to maintain continuity of service,” says Musiani, whose research has focused on matters of digital sovereignty.

Given that most administrations process documents using Microsoft software and then store the data on servers hosted by US-based tech giants, any shift to homegrown systems must be undertaken with caution – barring which ordinary citizens will be the first affected.

In Germany’s Schleswig-Holstein, “the local government recently decided to switch from Microsoft to open software (to signal their distrust of the US) – and clearly it was a bloody mess”, notes Jochim Selzer, a “digital self-defence" spokesperson for the Chaos Computer Club, Europe's oldest and largest “hacktivist” group.

A month after severing all ties with the US behemoth, the authorities in the northern German state are still busy fixing the remaining bugs.

Such difficulties largely explain the prevailing “administrative and political inertia” when it comes to ditching American tech, says Frans Imbert-Vier, CEO of Swiss-based technology consulting firm UBCOM and an advocate of technological independence.

This inertia can have knock-on effects. “The problem with state institutions is that their reliance affects the entire ecosystem. Once the administration uses a tool, it indirectly imposes it on its partners, service providers and citizens,” says Musiani.

European governments thus play into the hands of American Big Tech companies, allowing them to cement their hold on the digital daily lives of all public and private actors. This in turn lends more credibility to Trump’s threats to pull the plug on Europe, adds Musiani, for whom “the example must come from above”.

But is banning Teams or Slack from French government agencies enough?

Musiani describes the move as “symbolic” but a “big step” nonetheless, noting that “the discourse on digital sovereignty has struggled to materialise until now”. She adds: “At the very least, it signals a desire to reduce exposure to the American ecosystem as soon as a European alternative, however imperfect, becomes available.”

Whether the shift to Visio reflects a long-term commitment to greater autonomy, or merely an opportunistic PR move, remains to be seen.

A key obstacle is “the enduring attachment to Atlanticist policies, both in France and at the European level”, says Imbert-Vier, who is sceptical of any long-term European desire to tackle the continent’s cushy digital reliance on US systems.

While the Trump administration once championed “alternative facts”, America's Big Tech firms are no fans of alternatives to their tools and platforms. Competitors are required to fend off accusations of monopoly, but they remain largely invisible, crushed by “the massive marketing budgets that tech giants have been showering on the public for decades”, says Martin Hullin, head of the European Network for Technological Resilience and Sovereignty at the Bertelsmann Foundation, a German think tank.

Yet there is a world beyond Gmail, Word, X, Chrome and Apple. Europe, in particular, is home to “many small companies with very interesting ideas and products that are sometimes of better quality than their American equivalents”, argues Frans Imbert-Vier, CEO of technology consulting firm UBCOM and a key advocate of European technological independence.

The hard part is often finding them. Who, for example, has ever heard of Olvid, a French alternative to WhatsApp and text messaging?

France’s Emmanuel Macron has sought to set an example with his “start-up nation” slogan. His government has developed a whole batch of homegrown digital tools to escape American control, aiming to replace Teams with “Visio”, Google Drive with “Files”, and WeTransfer with “FranceTransfer”.

With strained EU-US relations leading to renewed interest in technological sovereignty, some experts in the field have posted catalogues of alternative solutions online.

For each American software programme, Austrian IT developer Constantin Graf has compiled an almost exhaustive list of European alternatives. The ambitious German project Digital Independence Day is less exhaustive but more educational. Its website offers step-by-step instructions on how to switch, for instance, from PayPal to Wero, a European mobile payment system.

Ultimately, “it’s the money that speaks”, adds Martin Hullin, head of the European Network for Resilience and Technological Sovereignty at the Bertelsmann Foundation, highlighting the crucial role of public procurement in providing the basis for digital sovereignty.

“It’s public contracts that make the difference,” he explains. “Nobody ever got fired for procuring Microsoft solutions (...). But if we say this is about safeguarding European democracies, perhaps we’ll be willing to bear the short-term consequences (of shifting to homegrown solutions).”

Grasping the stakes is especially important for digital infrastructure and cloud services, which “needs to be considered a critical asset of society that must continue to function in a state of crisis, like roads, railways and energy grids”, says Johan Linaker, an expert on digital sovereignty at the Research Institutes of Sweden (RISE).

As Europe gradually awakes to the challenge, Big Tech firms across the Atlantic have sensed the tide turning – and started to offer so-called ‘sovereign’ solutions. Earlier this month, Amazon launched its European Sovereign Cloud, which it claims is “entirely located within the EU”.

Critics, however, have been quick to warn against a “Euro-washing” of American cloud services. As Hullin notes, the data would still belong to a US company, which is liable to comply with US government orders.

The FBI raided the facility outside Atlanta, pursuing Trump's false claims that his 2020 election defeat was the result of widespread voting fraud. Claims of voting fraud in the 2020 presidential election have been rejected by courts, state governments and members of Trump's own former administration.

Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard met some of the FBI agents of the bureau's field office in Atlanta a day after the search. During the meeting, she used her cellphone to call Trump, the newspaper reported.

Trump addressed the agents on speakerphone, asked them questions, and praised and thanked them for their work on the inquiry, it added.

Critics have denounced the Georgia investigation as politically motivated. They say the Justice Department requires an unusual amount of independence because it is responsible for administering justice in a non-partisan fashion.

The raid was the latest in a string of actions by Trump's administration to use the Justice Department against his perceived enemies or to intervene in cases where he believes he was treated unfairly.

"DNI Gabbard and FBI Director (Kash) Patel are working together to implement the president's election integrity priorities, and their work continues to serve him and the entire country well," White House spokesman Davis Ingle said in a statement.

The FBI declined to comment. The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 18:44:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ZHX5EFJMFZNKRAXP2GJPM5QDUM.jpg?auth=0ff84168b5b43f0dc4b8fc6449708abc058624086d26ca085a86e77dce9aa757&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Chile’s president officially backs predecessor Bachelet in race to become UN’s first female chief</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260202-chile-s-president-officially-backs-predecessor-bachelet-in-race-to-become-un-s-first-female-boss</link><description>Chile has officially backed the candidacy of its former president Michelle Bachelet to become the UN 's first female secretary-general, with backing from Mexico and Brazil.

Outgoing President Gabriel Boric made the announcement Monday following concerns that Bachelet's bid could be blocked by right-winger Jose Antonio Kast, due to take over the Chilean presidency next month.

Bachelet, 74, has been a trailblazer for Latin America : the first woman to serve as defense minister and the first female elected as the Chilean president, serving two terms from 2006 to 2010 and 2014-18.

She has also served as the UN high commissioner for Human Rights and the first head of the then-newly created UN Women agency.

Last year, she was nominated for the UN's top job by Boric, and later met Kast to seek his backing.

After that meeting, in December, Bachelet told AFP "the world is ready" for a woman to take over and make "a different contribution through a different kind of leadership".

The UN, which turns 81 years old this year, has never had a woman at the helm and only one Latin American – Peruvian diplomat Javier Perez de Cuellar who served as secretary-general from 1982 to 1991.

The post traditionally rotates between world regions, with Latin America next in line as Portuguese Antonio Guterres 's term comes to an end.

"President Bachelet's candidacy, which has already been registered with the United Nations, will be presented jointly with our sister countries Brazil and Mexico," Boric told reporters on Monday.

Three other women from Latin America and the Caribbean are in the running for the UN top job: Costa Rican Rebeca Grynspan, secretary-general of the UN Conference on Trade and Development; Mexican Environment Minister Alicia Barcena; and Barbados Prime Minister Mia Mottley.

The other candidate is International Atomic Energy Agency chief Rafael Grossi from Argentina.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 18:45:27 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/87146f3a-004a-11f1-83fc-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/6889262bb19d7904db5d8d7789e7167e9dc7a02c.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US to cut tariffs on India to 18%, India agrees to end Russian oil purchases</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/india/trump-says-agreed-trade-deal-with-india-2026-02-02/</link><description>WASHINGTON/NEW DELHI, Feb 2 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday announced a trade deal with India that slashes U.S. tariffs on Indian goods to 18% from 50% in exchange for India halting Russian oil purchases and lowering trade barriers.

Trump announced the deal on social media following a call with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, noting that India would now buy oil from the U.S. and potentially Venezuela.

A White House official told Reuters that the U.S. was rescinding a punitive 25% duty on all imports from India over its purchases of Russian oil that had stacked on top of a 25% "reciprocal" tariff rate.

U.S.-listed shares of major Indian companies rallied on the news. IT consulting firm Infosys closed 4.3% higher, consultancy Wipro rose 6.8%, HDFC Bank gained 4.4% and the iShares MSCI India exchange-traded fund rallied 3%.

Trump's announcement added to positive sentiment over semiconductor makers and artificial intelligence, lifting major indexes into positive territory on the day.

Modi also committed India to "BUY AMERICAN at a much higher level," in addition to buying more than $500 billion worth of U.S. energy, including coal, along with technology, agricultural and other products, Trump added.

"They will likewise move forward to reduce their Tariffs and Non Tariff Barriers against the United States, to ZERO," Trump said of India.

Until Trump returned to office and raised U.S. tariff rates to double-digit levels last year, India had some of the world's highest tariffs, with a simple applied rate of 15.6% and an effective applied tariff of 8.2%, according to World Trade Organization data.

Trump's Truth Social message provided few details, including on the start date for the lower tariff rates, the deadline for India to end Russian oil purchases, trade barrier reductions and which U.S. products India had committed to purchasing.

As of late Monday afternoon, the White House had not issued a presidential proclamation nor a Federal Register notice required to make the changes official.

A White House spokesperson offered no further details, while India's commerce and foreign ministries did not immediately respond to requests sent after working hours. Russia's embassy in Washington also did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Previous trade deals with other major Asian trading partners including Japan and South Korea have included commitments to invest hundreds of billions of dollars into U.S. industries, but the India announcement did not mention any specific investments.

The deal brings India "broadly in line with its Asian peers on tariff rates" of 15% to 19%, said Madhavi Arora, economist at Emkay Global, adding that it would eliminate a disproportionate drag on India's exports and its rupee currency.

Indian markets had been battered since the tariffs were levied by Washington, making it the worst-performing market among emerging nations in 2025, with record outflows of foreign investors.

U.S. business groups reacted with caution and criticism. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which has long advocated a market-opening trade deal with India, called Trump's announcement progress towards that goal.

"We are optimistic that this is the first step toward a comprehensive trade agreement that will unlock even more private sector collaboration, and we look forward to reviewing the details of the deal," Chamber CEO Suzanne Clark said in a statement.

A coalition of more than 800 small businesses called "We Pay the Tariffs" urged Americans not to celebrate the deal, which it called a "600% tax increase on American businesses compared to 2024." The group noted that U.S. tariffs on Indian imports were about 2% to 3% at that time but would now be 18% and could go higher if India does not fully wean itself off Russian oil.

"Wonderful to speak with my dear friend President Trump today. Delighted that Made in India products will now have a reduced tariff of 18%," Modi said in a social media post on X. "Big thanks to President Trump on behalf of the 1.4 billion people of India for this wonderful announcement."

India's Trade Minister Piyush Goyal said the deal would draw the U.S. and Indian economies closer together.

"This agreement unlocks unprecedented opportunities for farmers, MSMEs, entrepreneurs, and skilled workers to Make in India for the world, Design in India for the world, and Innovate in India for the world. It will help India get technology from the U.S.," Goyal said in a post on X.

The deal comes less than a week after India signed a long-awaited trade deal with the European Union that is expected to eliminate or reduce tariffs on 96.6% of traded goods by value. That deal excludes EU soybeans, beef, sugar, rice and dairy from tariff reductions.

The Trump administration has been racing to complete framework trade deals with major trading partners before the U.S. Supreme Court rules on whether to strike down Trump's "reciprocal" tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.

Trump administration officials reached a deal with Taiwan last month and say such agreements are expected to continue no matter what the court rules, as they will reimpose tariffs under other authorities.

On Saturday, Trump teased a potential deal for India to buy Venezuelan oil after the U.S. seized Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro in a military raid in early January.

The deal followed months of tense trade negotiations between the world's two largest democracies.

Last August, Trump doubled duties on imports from India to 50% to pressure New Delhi to stop buying Russian oil, and earlier this month said the rate could rise again if it did not curb its purchases.

Purchases of Venezuelan oil would help replace some of the Russian oil bought by India, the world's third-biggest oil importer.

India relies heavily on oil imports, covering around 90% of its needs, and importing cheaper Russian oil has helped lower its import costs since Moscow invaded Ukraine in 2022 and Western nations enacted sanctions on its energy exports.

Recently India has begun to slow its purchases from Russia. In January, they were around 1.2 million barrels per day, and are projected to decline to about 1 million bpd in February and 800,000 bpd in March, according to a Reuters report.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 23:05:12 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/XIVNT4NKZNJLRN7C7VY36JGZHA.jpg?auth=158928fdd06703dc1deeb106d1ab8673a04d9fe7af310f5b32b57f4e3cde7286&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Cuba in communication with US, Cuban diplomat says, as Trump tightens screws</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/cuba-communication-with-us-cuban-diplomat-says-trump-tightens-screws-2026-02-02/</link><description>HAVANA, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Cuba and the United States are in communication, a Cuban diplomat told Reuters on Monday, although he said the exchanges have not yet evolved into a formal "dialogue."

Carlos Fernandez de Cossio, Cuba's deputy foreign minister, told Reuters the U.S. government was aware that Cuba was "ready to have a serious, meaningful and responsible dialogue."

"We have had exchange of messages, we have embassies, we have had communications, but we can not say we have had a table of dialogue," de Cossio told Reuters in an interview at the Foreign Ministry building in Havana.

De Cossio's statements on Monday represent the first hint from Cuba that the two sides are in conversation, even if in a limited fashion, after tensions flared earlier this month between the two countries following the U.S. capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro, long a close ally of Cuba.

U.S. President Donald Trump on Sunday said the United States had begun talks with "the highest people in Cuba," days after declaring Cuba "an unusual and extraordinary threat" to U.S. national security and threatening tariffs on any nation that sends oil to the communist-run island.

"I think we're going to make a deal with Cuba," Trump told reporters at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida on Sunday.

Cuba had previously denied any talks with the United States.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 23:05:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/GNFEZOLAANOKZJ3RXWCXUOKHZQ.jpg?auth=4704c84a3386dd1207af0112c6f4f74eb86d8a8943e096189535ef0023e22eff&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuela says interim president met with U.S. envoy</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/venezuela-says-interim-president-met-with-us-envoy-2026-02-02/</link><description>Feb 2 (Reuters) - Venezuela's government said on Monday that interim President Delcy Rodriguez met with U.S. envoy Laura Dogu, as the two countries gradually resume bilateral relations

The government said in a statement that the meeting took place at the Miraflores presidential palace to discuss "the work agenda between the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and the United States."

Rodriguez's brother, head of the national assembly legislature Jorge Rodriguez, attended the meeting, it added, as did Foreign Minister Yvan Gil, with whom Dogu met over the weekend following her arrival in Caracas .

“The governments of Venezuela and the United States have set out to advance on a roadmap to address matters of bilateral interest, through diplomatic dialogue and on the basis of mutual respect and international law,” the statement added.

After months of heightened tensions, the U.S. captured Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro a month ago, setting off a chain of changes in the country, including the swearing in of Rodriguez, the passage of a reform to its flagship oil law and the release of some political prisoners. Rodriguez has said she is seeking with the U.S., while Trump has said the relationship with the interim government is going well.

The two countries have to export up to $2 billion worth of Venezuelan crude to the United States, and on Friday Rodriguez announced a proposed "amnesty law" for hundreds of prisoners in the country, a move long demanded by the opposition and human rights groups.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 23:05:21 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WKYX2WNB25OOLDDBVKNQ35R6L4.jpg?auth=e6d37dad87f7e87879d68f0ac9894c08444186c0e35ea68c31f593bb5598bf61&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump says talks with Iran ongoing</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/trump-says-talks-with-iran-ongoing-2026-02-02/</link><description>Feb 2 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said Monday that talks with Iran were ongoing amid high tensions.

The ministry's comment, one of many it said were in response to questions put to Lavrov, also praised U.S. President Donald Trump's efforts at working for a resolution of the war and said he understood the fundamental reasons behind the conflict.

"The deployment of military units, facilities, warehouses, and other infrastructure of Western countries in Ukraine is unacceptable to us and will be regarded as foreign intervention posing a direct threat to Russia's security," the ministry said on its website.

It said Western countries - which have discussed a possible deployment to Ukraine to help secure any peace deal - had to understand "that all foreign military contingents, including German ones, if deployed in Ukraine, will become legitimate targets for the Russian Armed Forces".

The United States has spearheaded efforts to hold talks aimed at ending the conflict in Ukraine and a second three-sided meeting with Russian and Ukrainian representatives is to take place this week in the United Arab Emirates.

The issue of ceding internationally recognised Ukrainian territory to Russia remains a major stumbling block. Kyiv rejects Russian calls for it to give up all of its Donbas region, including territory Moscow's forces have not captured.

Moscow has repeatedly said it will not tolerate the presence in Ukraine of troops from Western countries.

The ministry said Moscow valued the "purposeful efforts" of the Trump administration in working towards a resolution and understanding Russia's long-running concerns about NATO's eastward expansion and its overtures to Ukraine.

It described Trump as "one of the few Western politicians who not only immediately refused to advance meaningless and destructive preconditions for starting a substantive dialogue with Moscow on the Ukrainian crisis, but also publicly spoke about its root causes".</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 23:05:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CJXHROLQY5KC3DP23HPDIBCQIU.jpg?auth=be451f7b6dcdb5a6369c86b11e374ec90aa218db6702a35b56d695148ea2a59a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Costa Rican populists win commanding victory but fall short of legislative supermajority</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/costa-rican-populists-win-commanding-victory-fall-short-legislative-2026-02-02/</link><description>SAN JOSE, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Laura Fernandez’s decisive presidential victory in Costa Rica on Sunday also delivered her Sovereign People’s Party (PPSO) a majority in Congress — the first time since 1990 that one party has secured both the presidency and control of the legislature.

The PPSO won 31 of 57 seats, short of the 38-seat supermajority Fernandez sought to advance more sweeping reforms, including judicial and constitutional changes and the ability to declare states of emergency that could temporarily limit civil liberties to fight crime.

"Those big reforms that people feared the government could implement, we're not going to see them," said Maria Fernanda Bozmoski, the director for Central America at the Atlantic Council, a Washington-based international affairs think tank.

While the PPSO can pass laws, budgets and make appointments without needing to negotiate with other parties, it has few allies in the new Congress.

The National Renovation Party (PNR), an evangelical party that often aligned with the government in the previous Congress, was left with zero seats.

The National Liberation Party (PLN), the country's oldest political party and main contender against the PPSO in the election, won 17 seats while the Broad Front (FA), a leftist party that has mounted the strongest opposition to the government, is the third-largest force with 7 seats.

The progressive Citizen Action Coalition will have one seat, occupied by former first lady Claudia Dobles, who ran against Fernandez and has voiced strong opposition to her, leaving one seat for the traditional right-wing Social Christian Unity Party (PUSC).

"The (ruling party's) aspirations of reconfiguring the political system fell a bit short with these results," said Ronald Alfaro, a researcher at Costa Rica's Center for Investigations and Political Studies (CIEP).

"For things that require 38 votes they're going to have to negotiate and we'll have to see how that unfolds," Alfaro added.

During his concession speech, PLN candidate Alvaro Ramos said his party would work with Fernandez on issues they agree on, but oppose her when they disagree.

"We need to keep fighting, that's our job, that's our commitment," Ramos said.

President Rodrigo Chaves often blamed Congress for blocking progress through gridlock and obstruction.

"The opposition is going to have to redefine itself because it won't be as easy to obstruct or block things," Alfaro said, adding that the vast majority of the legislators are new to Congress.

"We'll have to see how that block manifests, if they go their own ways or form an opposition alliance."</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 23:05:33 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/OG67I6EDDVL6BBUWFO2A6I27BY.jpg?auth=9306a63a94e5c155ca0205ff8b1fd61910b134278f6b29d30e97d180c94bf754&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Egypt's drone deployment to border raises stakes in Sudan's civil war</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/egypts-drone-deployment-border-raises-stakes-sudans-civil-war-2026-02-02/</link><description>CAIRO, Feb 2 (Reuters) - The deployment of a powerful model of Turkish combat drone to a remote airstrip on Egypt’s southwestern border signals a sharp escalation in Sudan’s civil war, suggesting one of its largest neighbours is being drawn deeper into the fray, more than a dozen officials and regional experts say.

Egypt, which shares the Nile River and a more than 1,200-kilometre frontier with Sudan, has provided staunch political backing to the country’s military in its nearly three-year conflict with the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) paramilitary group.

But while Egyptian security officials have privately acknowledged sending logistical and technical support to the Sudanese Armed Forces, until last year Cairo mostly refrained from direct intervention in fighting that has killed tens of thousands of people, displaced millions and spread famine across the vast country.

Cairo’s position toward the conflict started to change when the RSF made a series of advances in Sudan’s western Darfur region, first capturing a strategic northwestern triangle between Egypt and Libya in June and then overrunning the Sudanese military’s last foothold in Darfur, the city of al-Fashir, in October, according to eight regional analysts and three diplomats briefed by Egyptian officials.

Egypt’s presidency warned in December that the country’s national security was directly linked to Sudan’s, and Cairo would not allow its “red lines” to be crossed. Those lines include preserving Sudan’s territorial integrity and rejecting any “parallel entities” that threaten the country’s unity, it said.

Two Egyptian security officials told Reuters two airports in the south have been supplied with military equipment over the past eight months or so to secure the border and carry out military strikes to protect “national security.” The officials, who like other sources spoke on condition of anonymity, declined to provide details.

Satellite images from Vantor, a U.S. space technology firm, show a large drone on the apron of one of the airports, in East Oweinat, on September 29, December 28 and January 9.

Two military experts who reviewed the images told Reuters the aircraft was identifiable as a Bayraktar Akinci based on its distinctive body and wing design. The New York Times has also published imagery of Akinci drones at the East Oweinat airstrip, which they reported were being used for strikes in Sudan.

The Akinci is one of the most advanced drones manufactured by Turkish defence firm Baykar, with the ability to travel at high altitudes, remain airborne for 24 hours and carry a wide range of munitions.

Egypt’s Foreign Ministry and State Information Service did not answer questions about operations at East Oweinat or in Sudan. Sudan’s military also did not respond to requests for comment.

Egypt – along with Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and United States – is part of the so-called "Quad" of countries seen as most influential in the conflict, which has been trying, without success, to broker a ceasefire.

Cairo’s toughening stance adds another potentially explosive element to a conflict that has drawn in a wide range of foreign actors since April 2023, when the country’s military and the RSF fell out over how to integrate their forces during a planned transition to civilian rule.

U.N. experts have accused the UAE of providing weapons to the RSF, which Abu Dhabi denies. Sudan’s military has deployed Turkish and Iranian drones , and it has received political and other backing from Qatar and Saudi Arabia .

RSF head Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo has accused Egypt of being involved in airstrikes against the group since at least October 2024, which Cairo denied at the time. Shortly before al-Fashir's fall, Dagalo said his forces were being attacked by aircraft taking off from "airports in neighboring countries”, warning they would be considered a “legitimate target” for his fighters.

The RSF did not respond to questions for this article.

The New Arab, a London-based pan-Arab news outlet, quoted an Egyptian military official as saying Egypt carried out an airstrike on an RSF convoy in the border triangle area on January 9. A diplomat in Cairo briefed by Egyptian officials said the strike was carried out from an airbase in southern Egypt. Reuters could not independently verify the accounts.

Samir Farag, a retired Egyptian military officer, said East Oweinat is one of the “main bases through which Egypt can secure its southern borders.”

The airstrip is located in a remote farming region, about 60 km (37 miles) from the Sudan border, and was primarily used to support a desert reclamation project before the war.

“Egypt doesn’t allow anyone to be present on its borders and threaten its national security,” Farag said. “It will intervene directly and manage the situation. This is the right of every country in the world.”

DRONE DEPLOYMENT AT THE BASE

While only one Akinci is clearly visible on any given day in the Vantor imagery, an image captured by U.S. satellite firm Planet Labs on December 28 almost certainly shows two outside one of the hangars, according to Jeremy Binnie, Middle East specialist at Jane’s, a defence intelligence company. Akincis can also be seen outside multiple hangars, suggesting more than one is being used to store drones when they are not flying, he added.

The presence of support equipment and loading material around the aircraft, and the fact that they appear in different locations, suggest they are being used, said Wim Zwijnenburg, a military technology expert at Dutch peace organisation PAX.

The images reviewed by Reuters also show renovations underway at the airport between early July and the end of January. The runway was being repaved and possibly widened slightly, and several smaller roads were added. There were also signs of digging and construction, with at least two small structures added.

The RSF says its territory has been attacked repeatedly with Akincis, claiming its fighters shot down at least seven since June. Reuters could not verify the claims.

Two videos posted on social media in mid-January showed what RSF fighters said was an Akinci shot down near Nyala, the group’s main stronghold in Darfur. The two military experts told Reuters the wreckage was consistent with a crashed Akinci, but the news agency could not determine when and where the videos were shot, or who was operating the drone.

In February 2024, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said Ankara would sell drones to Egypt as the two countries normalised ties following a decade-long rupture, but he did not specify what kind.

A Turkish Defence Ministry source said the countries reached an agreement on the sale of Akincis the same year. The source did not provide further details. A Western diplomat, who meets regularly with Turkish officials, said they had privately defended Egyptian airstrikes on the RSF as legitimate and had confirmed drones were recently delivered for use in the war effort but did not give further details.

Five of the six flights into East Oweinat that appear in flight tracking data from FlightRadar24 since September came from Turkey. Of these, three were Turkish Air Force-operated cargo planes from Tekirdag, the Turkish city where Akincis are tested, the data shows.

Reuters could not determine what was on the flights, which took place on December 25, December 26 and January 7.

The Turkish Defence Industries Presidency (SSB), which handles such agreements, the Akincis’ manufacturer, Baykar, and Egypt’s government did not respond to questions about the sale.

Justin Lynch, managing director of the Conflict Insights Group consultancy, which closely tracks the war in Sudan, said the drone deployment at East Oweinat was “an indication of Egypt’s recent policy to be more involved in Sudan”.

The airport is less than 400 kilometres from Sudan’s border triangle, a strategically sensitive region on Egypt’s doorstep through which the RSF can receive supplies from southeastern Libya destined for Darfur.

Supplies sent through that corridor proved instrumental to the fall of al-Fashir , during which the RSF was accused of widespread atrocities, including gunning down hundreds of civilians and holding residents hostage for ransoms.

The city’s fall was a turning point in Egypt’s previously “ambiguous” stance toward the conflict, said Jalel Harchaoui, a contributor to Britain’s Royal United Services Institute think tank.

“The Egyptian military harbors no affinity whatsoever for the Rapid Support Forces. Yet Egypt depends on the United Arab Emirates, a major backer of the RSF, for financial assistance,” he said. “When al-Fashir finally fell … Cairo’s equilibrium shifted toward taking tougher measures against the RSF.”

Egypt may also have been emboldened by Saudi Arabia’s moves to curb the UAE's influence in Yemen, according to the analysts and diplomats who spoke with Reuters, a rivalry that has since spilled over into the Horn of Africa .

An Emirati official said the UAE was working with regional partners – including Egypt and Saudi Arabia – to secure a ceasefire in Sudan and that its “decisions have consistently favoured restraint over escalation".

Saudi Arabia did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 23:05:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/UR32AH654NPD5NDGNQ7UTUXIQU.jpg?auth=870b6e7b4ef1b4724452b117a8e5908dd0221d412fe7f10ba6c69f860e3dc6d3&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Drone attack targets strategic northeast Congo city, authorities say, blaming M23</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/drone-attack-targets-strategic-northeast-congo-city-authorities-say-blaming-m23-2026-02-02/</link><description>KINSHASA, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Eight explosive‑laden drones targeted the airport serving the northeastern Congolese city of Kisangani over the weekend, local authorities said, blaming the AFC/M23 rebel group and neighbouring Rwanda.

If confirmed to be an AFC/M23 operation, it would be the furthest west the group has struck as part of its offensive against the government in Kinshasa.

AFC/M23 spokesperson Willy Ngoma said he had "no comment" on the claim from Congolese authorities. A government spokesperson for Rwanda, which United Nations experts and Western powers say backs AFC/M23, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The government of Tshopo province, where Kisangani is located, said in a statement on Sunday that the drones attempted to strike Bangoka International Airport between early Saturday and early Sunday but were shot down before reaching their target.

The statement described the aircraft as “kamikaze drones” carrying “non‑conventional munitions made up of several sub‑munitions.” No casualties or damage were reported.

Bangoka airport lies about 17 km from central Kisangani, hundreds of kilometres from the front lines in North and South Kivu provinces, where AFC/M23 has seized large swathes of territory since 2022, capturing the key cities of Goma and Bukavu in a lightning offensive last year.

The escalation spurred efforts by mediators including the U.S. and Qatar to end the fighting and facilitate Western investments in critical minerals in eastern Congo.

One diplomatic source and three security sources confirmed that a drone attack had taken place near the airport. It was not immediately clear what type of drones were used, but two of the security sources said they appeared to be relatively short range.

Since the fall of Goma to AFC/M23, Kisangani has become the main forward base for Congo’s military aircraft, including jets and drones used in operations in the east.

A local spokesperson for Congo's army declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 23:05:44 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump says Republicans should 'nationalize' voting in at least 15 places</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-says-republicans-should-nationalize-voting-least-15-places-2026-02-02/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Feb 2 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Monday that Republicans should "nationalize" and "take over" voting in at least 15 unspecified places, reiterating his false claims that U.S. elections are marred by widespread fraud.

In a podcast interview with his former FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino, Trump -- who continues to claim falsely that his 2020 election defeat was the result of fraud -- gave no details on what he intended.

Referring to immigrants, the president said on "The Dan Bongino Show": "These people were brought to our country to vote, and they vote illegally. And you know, amazing that the Republicans aren't tougher on it."

"The Republicans should say, we want to take over. We should take over the voting, the voting in at least many, 15 places. The Republicans ought to nationalize the voting," Trump said in the interview.

He did not specify the locations but said: "We have states that are so crooked and they're counting votes. We have states that I won that show I didn't win."

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for clarification of Trump's remarks.

Bongino returned to his podcast after leaving the Federal Bureau of Investigation last month.

Trump's comments came days after the FBI searched an election office in Georgia's Fulton County for 2020 records as the president continues to press false claims of fraud in his 2020 defeat, an accusation that has been rejected by courts, state governments and members of Trump's own former administration.

Trump, in a departure from law enforcement norms, spoke with some of the FBI agents by cellphone the day after the raid during a meeting they had with Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, the New York Times reported on Monday.

The U.S. will hold midterm elections in November that will determine control of Congress for the next two years.

"Following this release (of Epstein files) and subsequent media reporting, the Met has received a number of reports relating to alleged misconduct in a public office," Ella Marriott, commander of the Met police, said in a statement on Monday.

Lang, 86, knew Epstein for several years, requesting favours such as the use of his car or plane for himself or his family, French daily Le Monde reported.

French investigative website Mediapart also reported that Epstein in 2016 founded a company based in the US Virgin Islands, half of whose shares were owned by Lang’s eldest daughter Caroline.

But it said no files it reviewed suggested either father or daughter had been implicated in Epstein’s sexual crimes.

Lang said he first met Epstein through the US film director Woody Allen “about 15 years ago”.

“I was completely shocked when I discovered the crimes he had committed,” Lang, who has been president of the Paris-based Arab World Institute since 2013, said in a statement.

“I fully accept the ties I may have formed at a time when nothing suggested that Jeffrey Epstein could be at the heart of a criminal network,” he added.

“Had I known, I would have immediately cut off all contact with him.”

Epstein died by suicide in 2019 while in prison facing charges of sex trafficking underage girls.

Caroline Lang, a one-time actor and now a film producer, told Mediapart she met Epstein through Allen and his wife in 2012, and that one day the US financier told her he wanted to “invest in young French and international artists”.

She said his lawyers set up the company called Prytanee LLC, but that she did not invest any money in it. An email in the Epstein files suggests she instead contributed her knowledge of the art world, Mediapart reported.

She told the investigative website she had been “incredibly naive”.

Later Monday, Caroline Lang resigned as head of the Independent Production Union (SPI).

“I do not want this situation to in any way harm the union,” Lang said, who was only named as the SPI head three weeks ago.

A leading French conductor, Frédéric Chaslin, also named in the new batch of Epstein documents, meanwhile slammed reports of a 2013 email he sent to Epstein in which he said he had “found a formidable girl”.

“It is ... totally unacceptable and false to insinuate that I ‘found a girl’ for Jeffrey Epstein. The reality is simple and verifiable: he had asked me to recommend an interpreter to accompany him on visits to Parisian museums,” Chaslin wrote in a Facebook post in response to a report by the Diapason magazine on the email exchange.

In the 2013 email, Chaslin wrote: “I have found a formidable girl for your next stay in Paris. Philosophy student. 21. She looks a bit like the current wife of (Roman) Polanski.”

Epstein had at this time already been convicted of soliciting an underage person for prostitution.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 23:06:32 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/d6336572-0062-11f1-9017-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/f995f4712de941b40a1394c99426a444ea976788.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Syria security forces enter strategic al-Hassakeh as part of deal with Kurdish-led SDF</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260202-syria-security-forces-enter-strategic-al-hassakeh-as-part-of-deal-with-kurdish-led-sdf</link><description>A small contingent of security forces with Syria’s interior ministry entered the city of al-Hassakeh on Monday as part of a deal between Damascus and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces , or SDF, which control the city.

The SDF announced the new agreement with the central government on Friday, aiming to stabilise a ceasefire in the country that ended weeks of fighting, in which the Kurdish-led force lost most of the territory it previously held in northeastern Syria . It lays out steps toward integrating the force into the army and police forces, and integrating civilian institutions in SDF-controlled areas into the central government.

Under the deal, government military forces will not enter Kurdish-majority areas, but small contingents of security forces reporting to the interior ministry will enter the cities of al-Hassakeh and Qamishli to secure state-affiliated institutions such as the civil registry, passport offices and the airport, and to restart work at those institutions.

Local Kurdish police forces will continue to patrol both cities and will eventually be integrated into the interior ministry as well.

The entry of government forces into al-Hassakeh went forward as planned without any outbreaks of violence.

Later Monday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned the SDF against any attempts to “sabotage” the agreement reached with the Syrian government.

“With the latest agreements, a new page has now been opened before the Syrian people,” Erdogan said in a televised address. “Whoever attempts to sabotage this, I say clearly and openly, will be crushed under it.”

Turkey is a strong ally of the government in Damascus and regards the SDF as an extension of a Kurdish militant group that has led a decades-long insurgency in Turkey.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 23:06:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/a03389e2-0077-11f1-8b1e-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26033697269504.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Delayed French 2026 budget finally through, paves way for Macron’s military spending boost</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260202-delayed-french-budget-finally-through-paves-way-for-macron-military-spending-boost</link><description>France has adopted its delayed 2026 budget Monday, clearing the way for higher military spending promised by President Emmanuel Macron to confront threats linked to Russia’s war in Ukraine and Mideast conflicts.

The adoption of the budget marks the final step of a monthslong, chaotic process that exposed deep divisions in the fractured parliament, which proved unable to reach a compromise.

Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu ultimately opted to use his special constitutional power to pass the bill without a vote, surviving two no-confidence votes on Monday evening.

Macron has vowed to increase defence spending to counter what he describes as a widening range of threats, from Russia and nuclear proliferation to terrorism and cyberattacks .

France in December passed an emergency law to avoid a US-style government shutdown, but only the full 2026 budget provides the military with the needed funding to build up forces.

The defence ministry will get this year an additional €6.7 billion compared to 2025 — a notable exception as the state seeks to curb spending across most other sectors. This year, the armed forces are set to receive a new nuclear-powered attack submarine, 362 armoured vehicles to modernise the army, and new Aster surface-to-air missiles.

France is also launching its new voluntary military service this year aiming at training thousands of volunteers, mostly ages 18 and 19.

The government is targeting a budget deficit of 5 percent of gross domestic product, down from 5.4 percent in 2025. Public spending is expected to edge down slightly, from 56.8 percent to 56.6 percent of GDP as authorities try to rein in debt in the European Union’s second-largest economy.

France has come under pressure from the EU and credit rating agencies to reduce its debt, prompting the centre-right government to seek spending cuts.

However, with no majority in parliament, Lecornu also granted costly concessions to Socialists to keep them from backing efforts to topple his government. The most symbolic is the suspension of Macron’s unpopular pension changes to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64.

The state deficit is projected at €131.9 billion, almost stable compared with the previous year.

Businesses will bear several tax increases, including an extra tax on large companies’ profits that’s expected to raise €7.3 billion in 2026.

Macron, 48, is soon entering the last year of his presidency in spring 2027.

He has largely stepped back from domestic politics since his 2024 decision to call early legislative elections plunged parliament into turmoil and led to the collapse of successive governments over budget disputes.

Lecornu, the fourth prime minister in two years, has survived eight no-confidence votes initiated by the hard left and the far right . Macron, meanwhile, has focused on foreign policy, European affairs and defence.

In recent weeks, he has pushed for security guarantees for Ukraine in the event of a peace deal with Russia, joined European leaders in a show of solidarity with Greenland , and supported the inclusion of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard on the EU’s list of terrorist organisation.

As his sunglasses became a sensation at the Davos gathering of world leaders, Macron’s remarks that France prefers “respect to bullies”, seen as a rebuke to US President Donald Trump’s tariffs threats, drew worldwide attention.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 23:06:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/787049c2-0068-11f1-ad6d-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/000-94V77UX.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump says Mexico will stop sending oil to energy-starved Cuba</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/trump-says-mexico-will-stop-sending-oil-energy-starved-cuba-2026-02-02/</link><description>Feb 2 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday that Mexico would stop sending oil to Cuba as he ramped up a pressure campaign on the Caribbean nation.

"Mexico is gonna cease sending them oil," Trump told reporters in the White House Oval Office. He did not elaborate on why he believed this to be the case.

Mexican authorities did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Mexico is the single-largest supplier of oil to Cuba, which regularly suffers from energy shortages and mass blackouts. Cuba relies heavily on fuel imports of refined products to meet its demand for electricity generation, gasoline, and aviation fuel. U.S. sanctions and a deep economic crisis have prevented the Communist government from purchasing enough fuel for years, forcing it to depend on a small group of allies.

Reuters has reported that the Mexican government is reviewing whether to keep sending oil to Cuba, as it worries that Mexico could face reprisals from the United States over its policy to do so.

President Claudia Sheinbaum's administration said on Sunday it would seek to ship oil to Cuba for humanitarian reasons, “without seeking confrontation." But they also said aid would consist of "other" products for the coming week.

Tensions flared last month between Havana and Washington following the U.S. capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro, long a close ally of Cuba. Trump has labeled Cuba "an unusual and extraordinary threat" to U.S. national security and threatened tariffs on the U.S.-bound exports of any nation that sends oil to the communist-run island.

Cuba and the United States are in communication , a Cuban diplomat told Reuters on Monday, although he said the exchanges have not yet evolved into a formal "dialogue." Trump has also said the two sides are talking.

Mexico and many regional analysts think Cuba could face a humanitarian crisis if the country loses access to energy. Other countries might not make up for a shortfall from Mexico, given Washington's threats.

Trump has privately questioned Sheinbaum about crude and fuel shipments to Cuba, Reuters has previously reported. Sheinbaum responded that the shipments are "humanitarian aid," according to sources familiar with a call between the leaders.

Qatar said the team would be deployed to Uvira, a strategic city in eastern Congo that AFC/M23 fighters captured in December during a rapid offensive, and which Congolese forces and allied militias re‑entered last month, restoring government control after the rebels announced they would withdraw.

The announcement late Monday is a sign of progress in Doha-mediated direct talks between Congo and the AFC/M23 rebels, who last year seized more land than they had ever held before in eastern Congo. The United States is hosting separate talks between Congo and Rwanda, which the United Nations and Western powers say backs AFC/M23, an allegation Kigali denies.

The Qatari foreign ministry said on Monday that Congo and M23 had agreed on detailed terms of reference for the ceasefire monitoring mechanism created under an agreement reached in October , and reaffirmed their commitments under the broader peace deal framework signed in November .

The latest push to activate ceasefire monitoring comes amid persistent fighting in the east.

Over the weekend explosive‑laden drones targeted the airport serving the northeastern Congolese city of Kisangani, Congolese authorities said.

If confirmed to be an AFC/M23 operation, it would be the furthest west the group has struck as part of its offensive against the government in Kinshasa.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 23:32:08 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/JMY4N2XYVJL5DF4PBJNCP5AZQE.jpg?auth=86f8efa0b4096d8f5fae089b383b9d001d29344efc9fd6acce77e52cd6fd2cdd&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukrainian capital Kyiv, other cities, under Russian  attack, officials say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/ukrainian-capital-kyiv-under-missile-attack-official-says-2026-02-02/</link><description>Feb 3 (Reuters) - Russian forces attacked the Ukrainian capital Kyiv with missiles early on Tuesday, officials said, with initial reports saying apartment blocks and other buildings had suffered damage.

Officials reported Russian air attacks on other Ukrainian regions, including Kharkiv, the country's second largest city, where the regional governor said two people were injured.

In Kyiv, Reuters witnesses reported loud explosions in the city after midnight and said both missiles and drones were being deployed.

Tymur Tkachenko, head of the city's military administration, said on Telegram that several apartment buildings, an education establishment and a commercial building had been damaged in districts east of the Dnipro River.

Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said a building housing a kindergarten had been set on fire and a non-residential building hit in eastern districts.

An air raid alert remained in effect more than two hours after it had been announced.

Videos posted on social media showed an apartment on the upper floors of a Kyiv block ablaze.

Ihor Terekhov, the mayor of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, reported several strikes in succession by drones and missiles.

Public broadcaster Suspilne reported a series of explosions in the southeastern city of Dnipro and in Sumy, near the Russian border.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 02:09:22 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US judge halts Trump plan to end protections for 350,000 Haitians</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us-judge-halts-trump-plan-end-protections-350000-haitians-2026-02-03/</link><description>Feb 2 (Reuters) - A federal judge on Monday blocked the Trump administration from revoking legal protections for more than 350,000 Haitians in the U.S., preventing their potential deportation to a country that has been ravaged by gang violence.

U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes in Washington, D.C., halted , opens new tab the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's effort to terminate Haiti's Temporary Protected Status. The move would have taken effect on Wednesday despite spiraling violence there that has displaced more than 1.4 million people.

Reyes, who was appointed by Democratic former President Joe Biden, issued the ruling in a class-action lawsuit brought by Haitians seeking to stop the administration from exposing them to deportation by ending their legal status.

Reyes said in the ruling that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem likely violated the procedures required to terminate the protected status of Haitian immigrants in the U.S. as well as the U.S. Constitution's Fifth Amendment guarantee of equal protection under the law.

"Plaintiffs charge that Secretary Noem preordained her termination decision and did so because of hostility to nonwhite immigrants. This seems substantially likely," Reyes wrote.

The law firm representing the plaintiffs, Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner, praised the ruling, noting that Haiti remains extremely dangerous.

"This ruling recognizes the grave risks Haitian TPS holders would face if forced to return, and it ensures that they can remain here in the United States – as legislated by Congress - to continue their lives, contributing to their communities, and supporting their families," the firm said in a statement.

TPS is available to people whose home country has experienced a natural disaster, armed conflict or other extraordinary event. It provides eligible migrants with work authorization and temporary protection from deportation.

The Department of Homeland Security has moved to end the status for about a dozen countries as part of President Donald Trump's crackdown on immigration , saying TPS was always meant to be temporary and not a "de facto amnesty program."

Department spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin indicated in a social media post that the ruling would be appealed.

"Haiti's TPS was granted following an earthquake that took place over 15 years ago, it was never intended to be a de facto amnesty program, yet that’s how previous administrations have used it for decades. Temporary means temporary and the final word will not be from an activist judge legislating from the bench," McLaughlin said.

Haitians were first given TPS in 2010, after a devastating 7.0 magnitude earthquake struck their country. The U.S. has repeatedly extended the status, most recently under the Biden administration in July 2024.

The department at that time extended TPS for another 18 months through February 3, 2026, citing "simultaneous economic, security, political, and health crises" in Haiti, fueled by gangs and a lack of a functioning government.

Shortly after Trump took office, his administration tried to curtail those humanitarian protections for Haitians in February 2025, when Noem moved to truncate the Biden-era extension so it would expire in August.

After a federal judge in New York in July ruled Noem lacked statutory authority to do so, her department in November moved to terminate Haiti's TPS status, saying there were "no extraordinary and temporary conditions" in the country that would prevent migrants from returning.

UNICEF estimated in October that over 6 million people - more than half the population, including 3.3 million children - need humanitarian assistance.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 02:10:47 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/2EEFORPBYZIRDIXTYSYI4PVLT4.jpg?auth=a0ae32f9c49c72b5c1c3a05e8a480f081f7fe2869f22551f5b45a5f59a9cfc35&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Son of Norway's crown princess stands trial for rape and domestic violence</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/son-norways-crown-princess-stands-trial-rape-domestic-violence-2026-02-03/</link><description>OSLO, Feb 3 (Reuters) - The son of Norway's crown princess will stand trial on Tuesday on charges of rape, domestic violence, assault and drug possession, among other crimes, one of several cases that have shaken the Norwegian monarchy.

Marius Borg Hoiby, 29, son of Crown Princess Mette-Marit and stepson to Crown Prince Haakon, could face multiple years in prison if found guilty of the most serious of the 38 charges brought against him.

His lawyer Petar Sekulic told Reuters he did not admit criminal guilt for the charges of rape or domestic violence, but did admit guilt for some of the less serious matters.

"He will give a detailed explanation about this in court," Sekulic said.

The case is scheduled to run until March 19. Hoiby is scheduled to testify on Wednesday.

On Sunday Norwegian police detained him on suspicion of causing bodily harm, wielding a knife and violating a restraining order. A court ruled on Monday Hoiby could be held in custody for four weeks. His lawyer told Reuters he was considering an appeal.

The court case is the most serious crisis to hit the Norwegian royal family in peacetime, according to historian Trond Noren Isaksen, though Hoiby does not have a royal title and is outside the line of succession.

The start of the trial also comes days after his mother Mette-Marit apologised for her "poor judgment" for maintaining contacts with the late U.S. sex offender Jeffrey Epstein after he was convicted of child sex crimes in 2008.

Crown Prince Haakon and Crown Princess Mette-Marit are not planning to attend court proceedings, Haakon said in a statement, adding he trusted the justice system to be fair and proper.

About Marius, Haakon said: "We love him, he is an important part of our family. He is a Norwegian citizen, so he has the same responsibilities as everyone else, as well as the same rights," he said.

Haakon expressed sympathy for the alleged victims. "We think about them, we know many are going through a difficult time," he said.

The Nordic country is a constitutional monarchy in which the king is the formal head of state while political power rests with parliament and the government.

Among the charges against Hoiby are one count of rape with sexual intercourse and three counts of rape without intercourse, some of which he filmed on his telephone, the prosecution said.

In January, it added new charges, including of possession and transport of 3.5 kg (7.72 pounds) of marijuana.

In 2024 , police named Hoiby as a suspect of physical assault against a woman with whom he had been in a relationship.

Hoiby, in a statement to the media at the time, admitted to causing bodily harm to the woman while he was under the influence of cocaine and alcohol and of damaging her apartment. Hoiby said he regretted his acts.

The trial comes at a time of multiple challenges for the family, in addition to the ongoing scrutiny Mette-Marit is receiving for her ties to Epstein.

King Harald, 88, Europe's oldest living monarch, cut back activity in 2024 after being hospitalised to treat an infection and later receiving a pacemaker.

Mette-Marit is in need of a lung transplant after being diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis in 2018, a chronic disease that causes scarring in the lungs and leads to a reduced oxygen uptake.

Meanwhile, King Harald's daughter, Martha Louise, stepped down from official royal duties in 2022 to allow her to more freely pursue her own business ventures, and said both she and her husband, an American self-styled shaman, would refrain from using her title as princess in a commercial setting.

They both received criticism last year for starring in a Netflix documentary chronicling their daily lives, including their wedding, and for being critical of the king and queen.

"This must be seen in the context of all the controversies caused by Princess Martha Louise and her husband and that age and health issues have made it more difficult for the royal family to fulfil their duties, which has affected their visibility," said historian Isaksen.

Still, the monarchy remains popular. Some 70% of Norwegians support the monarchy as an institution, according to a Norstat poll for public broadcaster NRK conducted in January among 1,030 people and published on Friday. Only 19% want another form of government.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 02:11:10 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/TL4SU37LYBMKDEA25RRE4ED47I.jpg?auth=3dd4bb7fe10a7fd934b3b738ded0e3691573f96448aa9fc16ca9c94f554a94e4&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Bill and Hillary Clinton to testify before Congress in Epstein probe</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260203-bill-hillary-clinton-to-testify-congress-epstein-investigation</link><description>Bill and Hillary Clinton will testify in a US House investigation surrounding deceased sex offender Jeffrey Epstein , a spokesman for the ex-president said, heading off a potential vote to hold the couple in contempt.

They had originally refused to appear before lawmakers examining how authorities handled earlier investigations into the disgraced financier, who had connections and correspondence with the world's business and political elite.

"The former President and former Secretary of State will be there. They look forward to setting a precedent that applies to everyone," Angel Urena said on X.

The House Rules Committee had advanced resolutions accusing the Clintons of defying subpoenas to appear in person to explain their links to Epstein, who died in custody in 2019.

The Epstein affair continues to cast a long shadow over Washington, entangling some of the most prominent names in US politics and highlighting the sharp partisan battles that have shaped the scandal.

Democrats say the probe is being weaponised to attack political opponents of President Donald Trump -- himself a longtime Epstein associate who has not been called to testify -- rather than to conduct legitimate oversight.

Trump spent months trying to block the disclosure of investigative files linked to Epstein, who moved in elite circles for years, cultivating ties with billionaires, politicians, academics and celebrities.

Neither Trump nor the Clintons have been accused of criminal wrongdoing related to Epstein's activities.

In letters where they initially refused to appear in Washington, the Clintons had argued that the subpoenas were invalid because they lacked a clear legislative purpose.

Republicans say the Democratic couple's past links to the business tycoon, including Bill Clinton's use of his private jet in the early 2000s, justify in person questioning under oath.

Instead, the couple submitted sworn written statements describing their knowledge of Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex trafficking.

Bill Clinton acknowledged flying on Epstein's plane for Clinton Foundation-related humanitarian work, but said he never visited his private island.

Hillary Clinton said she had no meaningful interactions with Epstein, never flew on his plane and never visited his island.

The contempt vote and its targeting of the Clintons could have exposed divisions among congressional Democrats.

Some Democrats have privately acknowledged that their party has long argued no one should be beyond scrutiny in efforts to uncover the full scope of Epstein's crimes.

But others feared that advancing the contempt resolutions would have played into a partisan strategy to shift attention away from Trump's past contacts with Epstein.

The Justice Department released last week what it said would be the final batch of files related to the investigation into Epstein.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 02:12:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/019db34e-f09f-11f0-9c2f-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-13T163503Z-339867903-RC2NDCAR4CM1-RTRMADP-3-USA-TRUMP-EPSTEIN-CLINTONS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Britain unveils first national plan to curb 'forever chemicals' risks</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/environment/20260203-britain-national-plan-forever-chemicals-risks</link><description>Britain unveiled Tuesday its first-ever plan to tackle " forever chemicals " and reduce the risks they pose to health and the environment.

PFAs (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) are a group of some 10,000 human-manufactured chemicals used in everything from pizza boxes to cookware, to waterproof clothing.

They take an extremely long time to break down -- earning them their "forever" nickname -- and instead build up in the environment.

There is growing evidence their widespread use has created risks that "will likely remain for hundreds of years", according to the UK's Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs.

It said in a statement the new government plan aims to "understand where these chemicals are coming from, how they spread and how to reduce public and environmental exposure".

The full extent of PFAs in England's estuaries and coastal waters "will be assessed for the first time," it added.

PFAs are present in food and drinking water.

Chronic exposure to even low levels has been linked to liver damage, high cholesterol, reduced immune responses, low birth weights and several kinds of cancer.

Under the plan, "a consultation will be launched later this year on introducing a statutory limit for PFAS in England's public supply regulations."

Should permitted levels be exceeded, this would make it easier for regulators to "enforce against water companies breaking the rules".

"It's crucial that we protect public health and the environment for future generations," said Environment Minister Emma Hardy in the statement.

She noted the government would work with regulators, industry, and local communities "to ensure 'forever chemicals' are not a forever problem".

Safer alternatives to everyday items, such as period pads and waterproof clothing, could also be developed.

Traces of the chemicals have been found everywhere from Tibet to Antarctica and contamination scandals have gripped Belgium and the United States among other nations.

Their use is increasingly being restricted across the world due to adverse health effects.

A handful of US states, including California, implemented a ban on the intentional use of PFAS in cosmetics beginning in 2025, and several other states are slated to follow in 2026.

The European Union has also been studying a ban on the use of PFAs in consumer products.

A report last week said their continued use could cost Europe up to 1.7 trillion euros ($2 trillion) by 2050 because of their impact on people's health.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 02:12:07 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/5d39309e-ce4d-11f0-8f23-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2025-11-27T154534Z-1121068092-RC235IA3L2DK-RTRMADP-3-BRITAIN-BUDGET.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Epstein calls himself 'lowest level' offender in newly released interview</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260203-epstein-denied-he-was-devil-video</link><description>Jeffrey Epstein denied he was the "devil" and insisted he was only the lowest level of sexual predator in a video interview included in the latest release of files by US authorities.

The interview, which lasts around two hours, was conducted by President Donald Trump' s former advisor Steve Bannon. It appears to be filmed in the deceased financier's New York home on an unknown date.

Documents concerning Epstein and government investigations into him have been released in troves, highlighting his connections to political and business leaders worldwide.

"Do you think you're the devil himself?" Bannon asks Epstein, a convicted sex offender who died in prison in 2019 while awaiting trial for sex trafficking of underage girls.

"No, but I do have a good mirror," Epstein says smiling, wearing a black shirt and glasses. When questioned again, he adds, "I don't know. Why would you say that?"

Epstein, who pleaded guilty in 2008 to soliciting prostitution from an underage girl, also appears to downplay the seriousness of his conviction.

He opposes Bannon labeling him a "class three sexual predator" -- which indicates a most serious threat to public safety, according to a classification used in the United States.

"No, I'm the lowest," says Epstein.

"But a criminal," Bannon adds, to which Epstein responds: "Yes."

The confrontation followed Bannon asking Epstein if he considered his money "dirty" as he "earned it advising the worst people in the world."

Epstein insists he made his money legally but acknowledges that "ethics is always a complicated subject."

He argues that he gave cash to help eradicate polio in Pakistan and India in a bid to justify how he earned his money.

Documents show that Bannon had regular correspondence with Epstein, who offered to help the far-right political figure spread his conservative ideology in Europe.

Millions of pages on Epstein, along with photos and videos, have been published by US authorities since Trump took office in January 2025.

They have shed light on Epstein's ties to top business executives such as Microsoft's Bill Gates, celebrities such as filmmaker Woody Allen, and academics and politicians including Trump and former president Bill Clinton.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 02:12:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/35e1af82-fdfd-11f0-a704-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/EPSTEIN.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump cuts India tariffs after Modi agrees to stop Russia oil purchases</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/economy/20260202-trump-cuts-india-tariffs-after-modi-agrees-to-stop-russia-oil-purchases</link><description>US President Donald Trump announced a trade deal Monday to reduce tariffs on India , saying that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had promised to stop buying Russian oil over the war in Ukraine.

Trump said he was cutting levies on Indian goods to 18 percent. He had previously imposed 25 percent "reciprocal" tariffs on many products, plus an additional 25 percent for New Delhi's purchases of Moscow's oil.

The deal eases months of tensions over India's oil purchases -- which Washington says fund a conflict it is trying to end -- and restores the close ties between Trump and the man he describes as "one of my greatest friends."

But while Modi thanked Trump for the "wonderful" phone call and the easing of tariffs, he made no reference to Trump's assertion about halting Russian oil purchases.

"Out of friendship and respect for Prime Minister Modi and, as per his request, effective immediately, we agreed to a Trade Deal between the United States and India," Trump said in a post on Truth Social.

Trump said that the United States would lower the reciprocal duty imposed on India during his waves of global "Liberation Day" tariffs last year from 25 percent to 18 percent.

A White House official told AFP that an additional 25 percent tariff Trump had slapped on India in August for its purchase of Russian oil would also be dropped.

Trump added that Modi "agreed to stop buying Russian Oil, and to buy much more from the United States and, potentially, Venezuela. This will help END THE WAR in Ukraine."

The United States is effectively overseeing Venezuelan oil exports since toppling the South American country's leader, Nicolas Maduro, in a military operation in January.

India had further agreed to buy more than $500 billion in US energy, tech, agricultural, coal and other products, Trump said, without giving further details.

Modi was one of the first leaders to visit the White House after Trump's return to the presidency a year ago, but efforts to secure a trade deal had foundered over India's Russian oil purchases.

As recently as December, Russian President Vladimir Putin said during a visit to New Delhi that he was ready to continue "uninterrupted shipments" of fuel to India despite US pressure.

Trump also said in October that Modi had promised to stop buying Russian oil, but an agreement did not materialise at the time.

"Wonderful to speak with my dear friend President Trump today. Delighted that Made in India products will now have a reduced tariff of 18 percent," Modi said in a post on X on Monday.

The Indian leader however made no mention of oil sales.

A recent EU-India accord may have been may have been a catalyst for the sudden Trump announcement, said Tanvi Madan, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution's Center for Asia Policy Studies.

"It is possible that the Indian trade agreement with the EU... incentivized Washington to get to yes," Madan told AFP.

Madan added that the "devil will be in the details" in the sectors that will get relief under the deal.

For India "the Russia question remains," said Farwa Aamer, Director of South Asia Initiatives at the Asia Society Policy Institute.

"Even though it has and will change its oil import structure away from Russia, India would still want to keep relations steady," Aamer added.

India emerged as a major buyer of Russian oil after the start of the Ukraine war, providing Moscow with a crucial export market as Europe sharply reduced purchases.

In 2024, Russia supplied nearly 36 percent of India's total crude imports, around 1.8 million barrels of discounted oil per day.

Modi added however that "President Trump's leadership is vital for global peace, stability, and prosperity."

Trump has repeatedly claimed credit for ending the brief but intense armed conflict between nuclear-armed neighbors India and Pakistan in May.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 02:12:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/be84ea5a-0066-11f1-a74d-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/f4ddce0c3dd86c595d076023f4d6028b33a208e9.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Taiwan must look to democracies, not China, for trade cooperation, president says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/taiwan-must-look-democracies-not-china-trade-cooperation-president-says-2026-02-03/</link><description>TAIPEI, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Taiwan must look to fellow democracies, not China, for trade and economic cooperation, President Lai Ching-te said on Tuesday, as his government mapped out how the island plans to work with the United States on areas like AI and critical minerals.

Senior Taiwanese and U.S. officials last week discussed cooperation in artificial intelligence, tech and drones at a high-level forum launched during the first Trump administration, with the U.S. State Department praising Taipei as a "vital partner."

The two sides signed statements on cooperation on economic security and on the Pax Silica Declaration - a U.S.-led initiative aimed at securing AI and semiconductor supply chains amid intense competition from Beijing, Washington's main strategic rival and which claims Taiwan as its own territory.

Speaking at a news conference at the presidential office about the U.S.-Taiwan Economic Prosperity Partnership Dialogue, Lai lauded the outcome of those talks.

"Taiwan is on the right economic path and is striding confidently onto the world stage. Taiwan has both the capability and the confidence to work with its democratic partners to lead the next generation of prosperity," he said.

Lai was speaking as the deputy chairman of Taiwan's main opposition party the Kuomintang (KMT), Hsiao Hsu-tsen, was in Beijing for a think-tank exchange with China's Communist Party on ostensibly non-political issues like AI and tourism.

Lai said Taiwan's opposition "had their own positions", and pointed to the differences of Taiwan's slower economic growth under the previous KMT government, which signed a landmark trade deal with China, or the much faster growth since the Democratic Progressive Party took office in 2016.

"Do we want to continue collaborating with the U.S., Japan, Europe and other allied nations, or again lock ourselves into China?" he added.

There was no immediate response from the KMT to Lai's remarks, but Hsiao told the opening of the forum in Beijing that "peaceful development" serves the interests of both sides, according to a read out of his remarks provided by the party.

"We should cooperate across the Taiwan Strait to earn money from the world, rather than oppose each other across the strait and let foreign countries reap the benefits, exploiting Taiwan and hollowing it out," he said.

China refuses to speak to Lai, calling him a "separatist". He says only Taiwan's people can decide their future.

Speaking to reporters, Lai reiterated an offer to speak to Beijing, based on parity and equality.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 04:27:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5N45RQ44KBO6TJOQDBAFPG3L6I.jpg?auth=11faa96a7a27dd953bbca4ffdcc93d5c1819a873f1b8cdfe8b481c405e3768f0&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China's Xi calls for 'equal, multipolar world' as he meets Uruguay leader</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-xi-calls-equal-multipolar-world-he-meets-uruguay-leader-2026-02-03/</link><description>BEIJING, Feb 3 (Reuters) - China and Uruguay should should work together to advance an "equal and orderly multipolar world", President Xi Jinping told his counterpart Yamandu Orsi on Tuesday, according to a media pool report.

Orsi's visit is the first by a South American leader to the Chinese capital since the United States invaded Venezuela in January and captured then President Nicolas Maduro in a raid .

China and Uruguay should "work together to advance an equal and orderly multipolar world and an inclusive, universally beneficial economic globalisation," Xi said in his remarks, aiming to build a community with a shared future for mankind.

The meeting comes in the wake of a flurry of visits to China by Western leaders this year, from Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer to Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and Finland's Prime Minister Petteri Orpo.

Orsi said his visit aimed to "empower Uruguay in the world and generate opportunities, investment and development" in a Facebook comment on Sunday, following his arrival in Beijing.

He is leading a delegation of 150, including business leaders, on a visit that runs until February 7, which will also take in the commercial capital of Shanghai.

The timing is symbolically important for China, said Francisco Urdinez, a professor at the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile.

Marcos, who is midway through his six-year term and denies wrongdoing, faces two separate complaints filed by a lawyer and activists, which hurdled an initial step at the House justice committee on Monday when lawmakers said both were "sufficient in form".

The committee reconvened on Tuesday to determine whether there was "substance" to move the complaints forward. The committee's decision, regardless of which way it goes, would be put to a vote of the lower house of Congress, which is dominated by allies of the president.

If the complaints against Marcos succeed in a vote of the House, he would be the second Philippine head of state to be impeached after Joseph Estrada, whose 2001 trial was aborted when some prosecutors walked out.

The complaints include Marcos' decision to allow his predecessor Rodrigo Duterte to be arrested and taken to The Hague to face trial at the International Criminal Court over thousands of killings during his notorious "war on drugs".

Marcos is also accused of abusing his authority in spending public funds that led to a corruption scandal over flood-control projects. His alleged drug use , which he has denied, also made him unfit to run the country, according to one of the complaints.

The office of Marcos said he respects the process.

"Even before, the president already said he did not do anything wrong, did not violate the law and did not commit an impeachable offence," Presidential press officer Claire Castro told a briefing on Monday.

If the lower house decides to impeach Marcos, it would be sent to the Senate for trial, where its 24 members serve as jurors. Five top officials have been impeached in the Philippines and of those, only one, a former chief justice, was convicted and removed from office.

Among the five was Marcos' estranged Vice President Sara Duterte, whose impeachment was struck down by the Supreme Court last year. She is facing new impeachment complaints and denies wrongdoing.

Gerville Luistro, who heads the justice committee, said its members would decide whether the alleged offences Marcos was accused of were enough to impeach him.

"It's not enough that an impeachable official committed wrongdoing. That wrongdoing must constitute an impeachable offence," Luistro told broadcaster Teleradyo.

Luistro said if lawmakers vote in favour of advancing the complaint, Marcos would have the chance to respond to the allegations. The backing of one-third of the House is needed to impeach the president.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 04:27:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/DWHNUHMKVFMZ3IVLN6IPMG4J3Q.jpg?auth=6a83c9fac72aaffbfdfcf9874f13281cde33d6004f45b5c795610759e766bb91&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Tulsi Gabbard says Trump requested her presence at FBI raid in Fulton County</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/tulsi-gabbard-says-trump-requested-her-presence-fbi-raid-fulton-county-2026-02-03/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Feb 2 (Reuters) - U.S. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said on Monday she was present at last week's FBI raid on an election facility in Georgia at the request of President Donald Trump and that her attendance was within her authority.

Gabbard wrote in a letter to lawmakers dated Monday that she observed FBI personnel executing a search warrant in Fulton County and was present there for a "brief period of time."

Top Democrats on the Senate and House of Representatives intelligence committees had called for Gabbard to brief their panels on why she was present at the raid and raised concerns about her presence.

Gabbard also said that while visiting the FBI field office in Atlanta, she "facilitated a brief phone call" for Trump to thank FBI agents for their work on the probe, a departure from law enforcement norms.

She added in the letter that Trump did not ask any questions and that she and Trump did not issue any directives.

The FBI searched Fulton County Election Hub and Operation Center on Wednesday, pursuing Trump's false claims that his 2020 election defeat was the result of widespread voting fraud.

Claims of voting fraud in the 2020 presidential election have been rejected by courts, state governments and members of Trump's own former administration.

Gabbard's letter was addressed to Democratic U.S. Senator Mark Warner and Representative Jim Himes. Warner's office said Gabbard's letter "raises more questions than it answers."

It is unusual for America's top intelligence official to be included in a domestic law enforcement operation as the remit of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) is overseas spying and protecting national security.

"My presence was requested by the President and executed under my broad statutory authority to coordinate, integrate, and analyze intelligence related to election security, including counter-intelligence, foreign and other malign influence and cybersecurity," Gabbard wrote.

Experts had raised legal questions over Gabbard's presence.

"The DNI has authorities set out by statute and they don't include investigating past elections for potential fraud," Robert Litt, who served as the top ODNI lawyer from 2009 to 2017, told Reuters last week.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 04:28:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/VZ7XERIX5VL53EKGAGBB733WYM.jpg?auth=944e2cbb1e297b5ef933aca8f3544d51966d2b6a95fcff84845601bf4f595abe&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Washington presses Venezuela interim leader on post-Maduro 'transition'</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260203-washington-venezuela-interim-leader-post-maduro-transition</link><description>Venezuela 's interim president Delcy Rodriguez solidified her new government Monday, appointing several cabinet members and meeting with Washington's new top diplomat in Caracas to address the country's "transition" after the ouster of Nicolas Maduro.

Laura Dogu, Washington's charge d'affaires in Venezuela, said on X she spoke with Rodriguez about US plans for "stabilisation, economic recovery, reconciliation and transition."

It was not immediately clear what Dogu meant by a "transition." Maduro had been in power since 2013 until US forces raided the country and captured him, but much of his government remains in place.

Venezuela's Foreign Minister Yvan Gil said after the meeting the diplomatic focus going forward would involve "addressing the differences and historical controversies between the United States and Venezuela."

"We reviewed the common agenda, especially on energy, trade, and politics," he added.

In addition to meeting with Dogu, Rodriguez made several key appointments to her presidential cabinet, including tapping former foreign minister Felix Plasencia to lead Venezuela's diplomatic mission in the United States.

"Very soon we'll have our diplomatic representative, Felix Plasencia, in Washington to accelerate diplomatic work, political work, and the work of developing our common agenda," Gil said.

Plasencia's appointment marks a pivotal change in diplomatic relations between Caracas and Washington, which were severed in 2019 after the United States refused to recognise Maduro's reelection and instead supported a parallel government led by then-opposition leader Juan Guaido.

Rodriguez also appointed Daniella Cabello -- the daughter of Venezuela's powerful interior minister, Diosdado Cabello -- as her cabinet's tourism minister.

The elder Cabello was widely considered to be Venezuela's second-most powerful figure after Maduro, and his backing for Rodriguez's government is seen as critical.

Cabello pledged the police's support for Rodriguez when she became country's leader after Maduro was ousted in a deadly US military operation last month and whisked away to New York to stand trial on drug charges.

The appointments come weeks after Rodriguez, formerly the vice president, cleared ranks among the country's top military brass, appointing 12 senior officers to regional commands.

Among those she dismissed was businessman Alex Saab, the minister of industry under Maduro and a close ally of the former president.

Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado meanwhile told reporters during a video call Monday that she would be willing to meet with Rodriguez "if it's necessary" in order to establish a "transition timeline."

"If it's necessary to exchange ideas in a meeting to define a transition timeline, it will happen," she said according to a transcript.

However, she added that Rodriguez's interim government "is still the mafia. They may have another name, but they are the mafia."</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 04:30:12 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/b23c7174-00a1-11f1-96a9-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/81eb07c1b81016a111c6c03f6e71200b3cafeb22.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China's Xi calls for 'equal, multipolar world' as he meets Uruguay leader</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/chinas-xi-calls-equal-multipolar-world-he-meets-uruguay-leader-2026-02-03/</link><description>BEIJING, Feb 3 (Reuters) - China and Uruguay should should work together to advance an "equal and orderly multipolar world", President Xi Jinping told his counterpart Yamandu Orsi on Tuesday, according to a media pool report.

Orsi's visit is the first by a South American leader to the Chinese capital since the United States invaded Venezuela in January and captured then President Nicolas Maduro in a raid .

China and Uruguay should "work together to advance an equal and orderly multipolar world and an inclusive, universally beneficial economic globalisation," Xi said in his remarks, aiming to build a community with a shared future for mankind.

The meeting comes in the wake of a flurry of visits to China by Western leaders this year, from Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer to Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and Finland's Prime Minister Petteri Orpo.

Orsi said his visit aimed to "empower Uruguay in the world and generate opportunities, investment and development" in a Facebook comment on Sunday, following his arrival in Beijing.

He is leading a delegation of 150, including business leaders, on a visit that runs until February 7, which will also take in the commercial capital of Shanghai.

The timing is symbolically important for China, said Francisco Urdinez, a professor at the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile.

"For Beijing, hosting Orsi ... signals that South American countries remain eager to engage, despite the increasingly polarised geopolitical environment."

China was the top destination for Uruguayan exports in 2025, taking agricultural products from wood pulp to soybeans and beef. Uruguay ran a trade surplus of $187.1 million with China in the first half of 2025.

The South American nation imports machinery, electronics and chemicals from China.

China and Uruguay signed a joint declaration to deepen a strategic partnership on Tuesday as well as 12 cooperation documents covering science, technology, environmental cooperation, exports and imports of meat and intellectual property.

Orsi said Uruguay would like to intensify "trade in goods, especially through diversification, and to invest much more strongly in the area of ​​trade in services and investment," according to the pool report.

China and Uruguay's strategic partnership "is going through its best moment," he said, adding that it was the responsibility of both countries to "commit to raising it to a new level."

While traditional export sectors like meat and soy have played a central role in the relationship, others such as dairy present considerable potential, said Dr Diego Telias, a professor at the Universidad ORT Uruguay and an associate researcher at ICLAC, an institute that studies the impact of Chinese capital in Latin America.

A gap also remains in the area of service exports, he said, "an area in which Uruguay has successfully engaged with markets such as the United States, the United Kingdom and Europe, but not yet with China."</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:35:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/PGNWVOBW3NMRVLAZCIXD2OV32U.jpg?auth=1620ddb1e97a389e6926bc8cae4cb58f728122ca7bdc8964c67ca93335de48d9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran president gives go-ahead for talks with US</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/iran-president-gives-go-ahead-talks-with-us-2026-02-03/</link><description>DUBAI, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Talks with the U.S. should be pursued to secure national interests as long as "threats and unreasonable expectations" are avoided, President Masoud Pezeshkian posted on X on Tuesday.

Reuters could not immediately verify the report.

The plan was discussed on several occasions in December and January between Ukrainian, European and American officials and would involve a multi-tiered response to any breaches of an agreed armistice by Russia, the report said.

Envoys from Kyiv, Moscow and Washington will meet in Abu Dhabi on Wednesday and Thursday for talks aimed at ending the war, FT said.

As per the proposal, any Russian breach of a ceasefire would prompt a response within 24 hours, starting with a diplomatic warning and, if necessary, action by Ukrainian army to halt the infraction, the newspaper said.

If hostilities continued beyond that, the proposal would move to a second phase of intervention using forces from the so-called coalition of the willing, which includes many EU members and the UK, Norway, Iceland and Turkey, the report said.

The report added that in the case of an expanded attack, a coordinated response by a Western-backed force, incorporating the U.S. military would be triggered 72 hours after the initial breach.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:37:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia is ready for a new world with no nuclear limits, Ryabkov says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/russia-is-ready-new-world-with-no-nuclear-limits-ryabkov-says-2026-02-03/</link><description>MOSCOW, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Russia is ready for the new reality of a world with no nuclear arms control limits after the New START treaty expires later this week, Russia's point man for arms control said on Tuesday.

Unless Moscow and Washington reach a last-minute bilateral understanding of some kind, the New START treaty, signed in 2010 by U.S. President Barack Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, will expire on February 5.

"The lack of an answer is also an answer," Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov was quoted by state news agency TASS as saying in Beijing on the absence of a response from Washington on Russian proposals to extend the limits of New START.

Russia was ready for the new reality of the world's two largest nuclear powers having no limits for the first time in decades, Ryabkov said.

He also said Russia supported China's position on arms control.

On Iran, he said the United States' proposals to Iran were tantamount to ultimatums.

He said that if the U.S. pumped lots of missile defence systems onto Greenland then Russia would have to take compensatory measures in its military sphere.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 06:53:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/PYHLSES2URNMNGNRBTS7BSUEDI.jpg?auth=a9f8ca0e74868220157a9215d34b8075325d0cff95131d2dd05afa97dde55556&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Live: Iran’s president Pezeshkian seeks 'fair and equitable negotiations' with US</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260203-live-iran-s-president-pezeshkian-seeks-fair-and-equitable-negotiations-with-us</link><description>Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told CNN that he believed a nuclear deal with the US was achievable.

"So if that is the case, I am confident that we can achieve a deal," he added.

Tensions are running high amid a U.S. naval buildup near Iran, following a violent crackdown against anti-government demonstrations last month, the deadliest domestic unrest in Iran since its 1979 revolution.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 07:43:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ZMEMJHA3JJIXLDBP6RDGKGR7R4.jpg?auth=4200bc958035bba7004d82f84ff630e426fb4650e952faf66dca359ac3082ead&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Case against Ugandan man charged with "aggravated homosexuality" dropped, lawyer says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/case-against-ugandan-man-charged-with-aggravated-homosexuality-dropped-lawyer-2026-02-03/</link><description>KAMPALA, Feb 3 (Reuters) - A Ugandan court on Monday dropped a case against the first man in the country to be charged with "aggravated homosexuality", which carries the death penalty under an anti-gay law, his lawyer told Reuters.

The East African country enacted the Anti-Homosexuality Act in 2023, defying pressure from Western governments as well as local and international rights groups.

Described as one of the world's harshest laws targeting the LGBT community, it carries a sentence of life in prison for same-sex intercourse and imposes the death penalty in cases deemed "aggravated".

That categorisation includes repeat offences, gay sex that transmits terminal illness, or same-sex intercourse with a minor, an elderly person or a person with disabilities.

The then 20-year-old man from Soroti in northeastern Uganda spent nearly a year on remand after he was detained in August 2023 and charged with aggravated homosexuality , his lawyer Douglas Mawadri told Reuters on Tuesday.

The man was accused of "unlawful sexual intercourse" with a 41-year-old man.

During proceedings which lasted more than two years, prosecutors amended the indictment and charged the man with having "carnal knowledge against the order of nature," an offence under Uganda's penal code that carries life imprisonment, Mawadri said.

On Monday "the magistrate discontinued the case upon finding that the accused is of unsound mind after a long detention on remand", Mawadri told Reuters.

Mawadri said the ruling was delivered orally in court and a written version would be available at a later date.

A spokesperson for Uganda's judiciary had no immediate comment.

Uganda's Anti-Homosexuality Act in 2023 drew widespread condemnation an threats of sanctions, and led the World Bank to suspend new funding to Uganda for nearly two years. The U.S. imposed visa restrictions on some Ugandan officials.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 07:43:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics to showcase Italy's Alpine venues</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260203-milan-cortina-winter-olympics-to-showcase-italy-s-alpine-venues</link><description>The 2026 Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics open on Friday as the Games return to their traditional heartland of the European Alps for the first time in 20 years, while organisers are praying skiing great Lindsey Vonn is fit to compete.

These Games will use a host of existing venues, meaning they will stretch for 350 kilometres across northern Italy from Cortina – one of the world's iconic skiing locations – to Milan, with other "clusters" spread through the Alps.

Organisers say that avoiding new construction meets the sustainable brief for an event often accused of creating white elephants, but they admit it has added complexity too.

The first Olympics since the re-election of US President Donald Trump are set to be buffeted by global turbulence.

Italy has maintained that it will retain control of all security operations after it emerged that a branch of the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) will be sent to Italy in an "advisory" role, sparking anger in the host nation .

Olympic power Russia 's team of just 13 must compete as neutrals, a sanction imposed by the International Olympic Committee after Moscow invaded Ukraine weeks after the last Winter Games in Beijing in 2022.

The sports programme begins on Wednesday, but the Games officially start two days later with a spectacular opening ceremony at the San Siro stadium in Milan featuring performances from US singer Mariah Carey and Italian opera star Andrea Bocelli.

US Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio are expected to attend.

When the full programme of sport gets under way, all eyes will be on Vonn, whose comeback at 41 could be the storyline of this Olympics, provided she can recover from the hard fall she suffered in a World Cup race in Crans-Montana, Switzerland , on Friday.

Following the crash, Vonn said she had injured her left knee, the joint that was fortified with titanium in surgery which allowed her to return to the circuit last year after retiring in 2019.

Vonn insisted "my Olympic dream is not over" and she is due to give an update on Tuesday.

Also eagerly awaited is the men's ice hockey competition, with stars from the National Hockey League (NHL) in the US and Canada – the world's strongest – taking part for the first time since 2014.

Kirsty Coventry, the new IOC president, is also under scrutiny as she oversees her first Games since her election as the movement's first woman leader in March.

Coventry admitted that the approach of using existing venues, which are often long distances apart, has complicated the task for organisers.

"I think initially we all thought, 'oh, well, we'll just have it be a little bit more dispersed because that's more sustainable'. Yes, that is very true, but it has added additional complexities in the delivery of the Games," the Zimbabwean said.

Two of the new venues, the sliding centre in Cortina for the bobsleigh , skeleton and luge events and the main ice hockey arena in Milan have caused the most headaches.

The location of the sliding centre became a political hot potato after the IOC initially said those events would have to be held at existing sites in Switzerland or Austria .

But the insistence in late 2023 of Italy's Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini that the events be held in Italy led to a breakneck race to build a track in Cortina, where the 1956 Winter Olympics were held.

Construction didn't start until February 2024, sparking open opposition from the IOC, but it was completed just in time for pre-approval in March last year – a win for Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni 's hard-right government.

Meanwhile, repeated delays to the construction of the main ice hockey arena, located in the Santa Giulia district on the outskirts of Milan, led to uncertainty right up until last month over the participation of the NHL players.

Those doubts weren't removed until the successful hosting of a test event at the venue less than a month ago.

Organisers admitted on Sunday that some parts of the Santa Giulia venue are unfinished, but insisted all the scheduled games there would go ahead.

Milan-Cortina estimate the final bill for the Olympics will be 5.2 billion euros ($6 bn). Of that 3.5 bn euros is going on infrastructure and 1.7 bn euros on staging the Games.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 07:43:48 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/c98d7ace-00b7-11f1-ab95-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/cb249e23735e3970895f52c961aa8e42f635f3fc.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Malaysian court acquits French man facing possible death penalty on drug charges</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260203-malaysian-court-acquits-french-man-facing-possible-death-penalty-on-drug-charges</link><description>A French national facing a possible death penalty in Malaysia on eight drug-related charges was acquitted Tuesday, freeing him after nearly two and a half years in detention .

The High Court in the northern city of Alor Setar ruled that prosecutors failed to prove that Tom Félix, 34, had control, custody or possession of the drugs in the case.

"The accused is, therefore, released and acquitted," Alor Setar High Court judge Evawani Farisyta Mohammad said.

Félix, in court wearing a white shirt and trousers, his hands cuffed, looked visibly pleased as the judge delivered the decision.

The former Veolia executive appeared to have lost a considerable amount of weight since his arrest, his parents said.

Jean Luc and Sylvie Félix were seen embracing after the ruling.

Félix and his Malaysian business partner were detained in 2023 after police discovered 1.86 kilograms of cannabis in the common area of a home they shared.

Authorities later said Félix was also found in possession of 11.7 grams of the drug.

He denied all the charges.

If convicted, Félix faced the death penalty or a cumulative sentence of 104 years in prison, 54 strokes of the cane and a 27,000 euro ($31,000) fine, his mother previously told AFP.

Drug trafficking and possession are serious offences in Malaysia, which still allows capital punishment for cases involving large quantities of narcotics.

However, death sentences are no longer mandatory, and no executions have been carried out since 2018.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 08:41:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/565240f6-00d2-11f1-b344-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/000-47K42W9.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Paris prosecutor's cybercrime unit searches French office of Musk's X</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/paris-prosecutors-cybercrime-unit-searches-french-office-musks-x-2026-02-03/</link><description>PARIS, Feb 3 (Reuters) - The Paris prosecutor's office said a search was underway at the French offices of Elon Musk's social media network X on Tuesday as part of an investigation opened in January 2025 .

Although pro-government pollsters put Fidesz ahead, the 21 Institute poll published by news site 24.hu was the second this week to put Tisza ahead and show Our Homeland winning enough seats to enter parliament.

Nationalist Orban faces the biggest challenge to his rule since Fidesz swept to victory in 2010 although the outcome remains highly uncertain, with opinion polls showing that many voters are still undecided.

The 21 Institute poll, conducted between January 28 and February 2, put Tisza on 35% support among all voters, up from 34% in December. Fidesz was on 28% support, up from 26%.

The poll showed 53% of decided voters supported Tisza and 37% backed Fidesz, a similar level to December.

The poll showed that Our Homeland (Mi Hazank) would be the only other party to pass the 5% threshold required for entry into parliament.

A Publicus Institute poll published on Monday by Nepszava newspaper showed 48% of decided voters supporting Tisza and 40% backing Fidesz, with Our Homeland on more than 5% support. It also showed 27% of voters were undecided, after 31% in December.

Tisza is led by former government insider Peter Magyar who has said his party would curb corruption, unlock billions of euros in frozen European Union funds to boost the economy, and firmly anchor Hungary in the EU and NATO.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 09:43:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/DE5I3T2RVZPU5CPTE3Y7VIIPAQ.jpg?auth=7f1063af919eed20fc088f7564ad654e5e02101542d94535043751d1416ee011&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Poland detains Defence Ministry employee suspected of collaborating with Russia, Onet reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/poland-detains-defence-ministry-employee-suspected-collaborating-with-russia-2026-02-03/</link><description>WARSAW, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Poland's Military Counterintelligence Service has detained an employee of the Defence Ministry suspected of collaborating with Russian intelligence, news website Onet reported citing sources.

Trump said on Thursday that Russian President Vladimir Putin had agreed to stop striking Kyiv and "various towns" during cold weather.

The Kremlin said the truce would last until Sunday but did not link it to the subzero temperatures.

Russia hit Kyiv "in the bitter cold with another massive strike" overnight, Tymur Tkachenko, the head of the city's military administration, said Tuesday on Telegram.

The emergency services said in a later post that three people in Kyiv had been wounded.

Kyiv ​Mayor ⁠Vitali Klitschko said ‍that ​1,170 residential ​buildings in the capital were left without ‍heating following the strikes.

In the eastern city of Kharkiv, two people were wounded by Russian shelling, regional military chief Oleg Synegubov said.

The hours-long attack targeted energy infrastructure and aimed to "cause maximum destruction ... and leave the city without heat during severe frost", Synegubov wrote on Telegram.

Authorities had to cut heating to more than 800 homes to prevent the wider network from freezing, he said, urging people to go to round-the-clock "invincibility points" around the city if they needed to warm up.

Overnight temperatures plunged to minus 17C in Kyiv and sank as low as minus 23C in Kharkiv.

Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky on Tuesday said Russia was prioritising more attacks over peace talks , after Moscow fired dozens of missiles and hundreds of drones at Ukraine overnight.

"Taking advantage of the coldest days of winter to terrorise people is more important to Russia than turning to diplomacy," Zelensky wrote on social media, adding Russian forces had attacked with "more than 70 missiles in total, as well as 450 attack drones."

Russia's invasion of Ukraine will hit the four-year mark on February 24.

Washington has sought to craft a peace settlement between both sides, but the first round of trilateral talks held in Abu Dhabi last weekend failed to yield a breakthrough.

A second round is due to begin on Wednesday in the Emirati capital.

Zelensky said on Monday that recent "de-escalation" with Russia was helping build trust in negotiations, apparently referring to a break in attacks on energy facilities.

But territory remains a sticking point, and the warring sides have not yet shown willingness for compromise.

Russia wants full control of Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region, which Kyiv has ruled out, saying such a move would only embolden Moscow.

After failing in its aim of a lightning offensive to capture Kyiv and topple Ukraine's leadership in a matter of days in 2022, Russia has been bogged down in the face of Ukrainian defences and is now mounting a grinding advance that has come at huge human cost.

Moscow's troops accelerated their advance in Ukraine throughout January, capturing almost twice as much land as in the previous month, according to an AFP analysis.

Russia seized 481 square kilometres in January, analysis of data from the Institute for the Study of War, which works with the Critical Threats Project, showed.

The January gains were up from 244 square kilometres in December 2025 and one of the largest advances during a winter month since Russia invaded four years ago.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 09:45:08 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/498a3cb6-00cd-11f1-980d-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/1693e0e5307de4a5fd9cffaa89fd6f0505740d2e.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump's tariff cut spells relief in India despite scant details</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/india/trumps-tariff-cut-spells-relief-india-despite-scant-details-2026-02-03/</link><description>NEW DELHI, Feb 3 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's move to slash tariffs on Indian imports sparked a relief rally across the Asian country's markets on Tuesday, lifting sentiment among exporters and policymakers even as details of the agreement remained scant.

Trump announced a trade deal with India on Monday to cut tariffs to 18% from 50% in exchange for New Delhi halting Russian oil purchases and lowering trade barriers.

But Trump's social media post was not followed by any details of the deal from the White House or the Indian government.

An Indian government official said India has agreed to buy petroleum, defence goods and aircraft from the U.S., while partly opening up its guarded agriculture sector under the agreement .

New Delhi has also lowered tariffs on imported cars to address Washington's immediate demands, according to the official.

Trump said India will buy more American goods with purchases rising to over $500 billion, including energy, coal, technology, agricultural and other products. He did not specify any time-frame.

"India's tariff agreement with the U.S. removes its earlier disadvantage versus peers," said Neelkanth Mishra, chief economist at Axis Bank.

The deal helps affected Indian gems and jewellery, leather, plastics, ceramics and auto components and non-tech foreign investment, he added.

Among Asian peers, U.S. tariffs on goods from Indonesia stand at 19% while the rate for Vietnam and Bangladesh stands at 20%.

India's exports to the U.S. rose 15.88% year-on-year to $85.5 billion in January-November, while imports stood at $46.08 billion, Indian government data showed.

The announcement of the trade deal has reduced a great deal of global uncertainty, India's economic affairs secretary , Anuradha Thakur, said at an event in New Delhi on Tuesday.

It also lifted investor sentiment . India's benchmark stock index, the Nifty 50 (.NSEI) , opens new tab , was up nearly 3% and the rupee climbed over 1% to 90.40 per dollar in early trading.

"Lower tariffs will not only improve price competitiveness but also help Indian exporters integrate more deeply into U.S. supply chains,” said S.C. Ralhan, president of the Federation of Indian Export Organisations.

Reduction in U.S. tariffs on most Indian goods will reinvigorate India's exports to the U.S., Moody's Ratings said in a statement.

Despite the announcement by Trump and a post on X from Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, details of the deal remain scant.

Indian refiners will need a wind-down period to complete Russian oil deals before imports from that country can be halted, and they have so far not been ordered by the government to stop such imports, Reuters reported .

The Kremlin said it had heard no statements from India about halting purchases of Russian oil.

Moody's said immediately stopping Russian oil imports could be disruptive to India’s economic growth.

"A complete shift toward non-Russian oil could also tighten supply elsewhere, raise prices and pass through to higher inflation given that India is one of the world’s largest oil importers,” it said.

The India-U.S. trade deal will ensure more exports of American farm products to India's massive market, U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said in a post on social media, without giving any details.

In the past, India's trade deals have typically excluded some sensitive farm and dairy items, as New Delhi maintains the need to protect millions of subsistence farmers.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 10:40:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KEMCEHU52FM2NAD7TRLXKQDOBM.jpg?auth=3d740c864e9d6dd0b664e264955c281d154114f7be4e07c785529dd6f63103df&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iranian police say 139 foreigners arrested over unrest in Yazd province</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iranian-police-say-139-foreigners-arrested-over-unrest-yazd-province-2026-02-03/</link><description>DUBAI, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Iranian police said 139 foreign nationals have so far been arrested in the central province of Yazd for their participation in recent protests, the semi-official Tasnim news agency reported on Tuesday, without specifying their nationalities.

Yazd, a predominantly desert province with a relatively small population above 1 million, was one of many provinces affected by nationwide protests in January.

The protests, which started in December over economic hardships and quickly turned political, were repressed in the most violent crackdown since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. The official death toll stands at 3,117, although rights groups say many more people have been killed. U.S.-based rights group HRANA has said that nearly 50,000 people have so far been arrested.

Authorities blame Israel and the United States for fomenting the violence.

"These (foreign) individuals played an active role in organising, inciting, and directing riotous actions, and in some cases were in contact with networks abroad," Yazd's police commander Ahmad Negahban was quoted as saying by Tasnim.

Judicial authorities have warned of severe consequences for unrest-linked detainees who committed violent acts.

"Those who played a role in this American sedition and supported it will not be spared," Iran's judiciary spokesperson Asghar Jahangir said on Tuesday.

Iranian media reported on Monday the arrest of four foreigners in Tehran over last month's unrest, a shift from earlier reports announcing daily arrests of suspected protest ringleaders without pointing to foreign nationals.

Following a 12-day war in June in which Israel relied on agents within Iran for its early offensive, Tehran accelerated a campaign to deport mainly Afghan nationals, who represent the largest foreign community in the country.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 10:40:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Guinea president keeps mines minister in post-election government</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/guinea-president-keeps-mines-minister-post-election-government-2026-02-03/</link><description>CONAKRY, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Guinea President Mamady Doumbouya, who came to power in a coup and was sworn in for a seven-year term last month, has retained his mines minister but appointed new ministers of finance, justice and security as part of his government.

The former special forces commander, thought to be in his early 40s, has been leading the West African nation since seizing power in 2021.

Guinea holds the world's largest bauxite reserves and the richest untapped iron ore deposit at Simandou , where a massive mining project was launched in November.

The following month, Doumbouya won the presidential election that completed the return to civilian rule. Last week, Doumbouya announced that Amadou Oury Bah would stay on as prime minister.

According to a decree read on Monday night on state television, Mariama Cire Sylla, a former World Bank country representative who had been serving as agriculture minister, will now lead the Ministry of Economy, Finance and Budget.

Ibrahima Sory Tounkara, who acted as a judge during a trial for a 2009 stadium massacre that killed more than 150 people, was appointed justice minister.

General Ahmed Mohamed Diallo was named minister of security and civil protection.

The mines minister, Bouna Sylla, was first appointed to the role in 2024.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 10:41:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WFFOGPAH2FPODDL5ZDIDSQY2MI.jpg?auth=0300683d85ba1f984c9d6f5d5603676020330ce5131bd04705337c0060a8d11a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>NATO's Rutte says reaching deal to end war will require tough choices</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/natos-rutte-says-reaching-deal-end-war-will-require-tough-choices-2026-02-03/</link><description>KYIV, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Reaching a peace deal to end Russia's war in Ukraine will require tough choices, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said on Tuesday.

Iran and the United States will resume nuclear talks on Friday in Turkey, Iranian and U.S. officials told Reuters on Monday. U.S. President Donald Trump warned that with big U.S. warships heading to Iran, "bad things" would probably happen if a deal could not be reached.

The UAE, a highly influential Gulf Arab power and close U.S. ally, said a long-term solution was needed.

"I think that the region has gone through various calamitous confrontations. I don't think we need another one, but I would like to see direct Iranian-American negotiations leading to understandings so that we don't have these issues every other day," the UAE president's adviser Anwar Gargash told a panel at the World Governments Summit in Dubai.

U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi will meet in Istanbul in an effort to revive diplomacy over a long-running dispute about Iran's nuclear programme and dispel fears of a new regional war. A regional diplomat said representatives from countries such as Saudi Arabia and Egypt would also participate.

The U.S. naval buildup near Iran follows a violent crackdown against anti-government demonstrations last month.

Trump, who stopped short of carrying out threats to intervene, has since demanded Tehran make nuclear concessions and sent a flotilla to its coast. He said last week Iran was "seriously talking", while Tehran's top security official Ali Larijani said arrangements for negotiations were under way.

Iran’s leadership is increasingly worried a U.S. strike could break its grip on power by driving an already enraged public back onto the streets, according to six current and former officials.

In high-level meetings, officials told Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei that public anger over last month's crackdown - the bloodiest since the 1979 Islamic Revolution-- has reached a point where fear is no longer a deterrent , four current officials briefed on the discussions said.

Iranian sources told Reuters last week that Trump had demanded three conditions for resumption of talks: Zero enrichment of uranium in Iran, limits on Tehran's ballistic missile programme and ending its support for regional proxies.

Iran has long rejected all three demands as unacceptable infringements of its sovereignty, but two Iranian officials told Reuters its clerical rulers saw the ballistic missile programme, rather than uranium enrichment, as the bigger obstacle.

Tehran's regional sway has been weakened by Israel's attacks on its proxies - from Hamas in Gaza to Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen and militias in Iraq - as well as by the ousting of Iran's close ally, former Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

In June last year the United States struck Iranian nuclear targets , joining in at the close of a 12-day Israeli bombing campaign. Since then, Tehran has said its uranium enrichment work has stopped.

Recent satellite imagery of two of the targeted sites, Isfahan and Natanz, appears to show some repair work since December, with new roofing over two previously destroyed buildings. No other rebuilding was visible, according to the imagery provided by Planet Labs and reviewed by Reuters.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 10:41:17 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KQW4J4IZ4JPCFA4XU24M2GTG5M.jpg?auth=53de3ac8191085788961bd5a0f48c9f842113c79e46782fb50e3a5b17222ce65&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Tunisia upholds and increases jail terms for opponents and security officials</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/tunisia-upholds-increases-jail-terms-opponents-security-officials-2026-02-03/</link><description>TUNIS, Feb 3 (Reuters) - A Tunisian appeal court on Tuesday upheld and increased lengthy prison sentences on high-profile politicians, including opposition leader Rached Ghannouchi and former security officials, as part of a crackdown on dissent.

Among those sentenced on charges of conspiring against the state in the mass trial were Nadia Akacha, the former chief of staff to President Kais Saied.

Akacha, who was sentenced in absentia after fleeing abroad, received a 35-year jail term, TAP state news agency said.

Rached Ghannouchi, 84, veteran head of the Islamist-leaning Ennahda party, was handed an increased 20-year prison sentence, up from the previous 14-year term.

Ghannouchi, who was speaker of the elected parliament dissolved by Saied in 2021, has been in prison since 2023. With this new sentence, the total sentences against him on several charges rise to 50 years.

A total of 21 were charged in the conspiracy case, with 10 already in custody and 11 having fled the country.

The court upheld 35-year sentences against former intelligence chief Kamel Guizani, former foreign minister Rafik Abdessalem, and Mouadh Ghannouchi, the son of Rached Ghannouchi. All three are outside the country.

The accused deny the charges, arguing that the case has been politically fabricated to silence Saied's opponents.

Most opposition leaders, some journalists and critics of Saied, have been imprisoned since he seized control of most powers in 2021.

Saied dissolved parliament in 2021 and began ruling by decree, then dissolved the independent Supreme Judicial Council and sacked dozens of judges, a move that opposition figures called a coup which undermined the nascent democracy that in 2011 sparked the Arab Spring uprisings.

Russia and Ukraine said last week they halted strikes on each other's energy infrastructure, but disagreed on the timeframe for the truce.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 10:41:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KQROLULYARI75LBMQM4VMHUJWE.jpg?auth=1f11f51a7235622fcb7c5a3a5227a92919595f9831f106866492c7c165cad2ab&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>The Bright Side: 13-year-old boy swims four hours to save family swept out to sea</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260203-the-bright-side-13-year-old-boy-swims-four-hours-to-save-family-swept-out-to-sea</link><description>A 13-year-old boy is credited with saving the lives of his mother and two younger siblings by swimming four hours through choppy waters to get help for his family after they were swept out to sea off the Australian coast.

The boy, named in local media as Austin Appelbee , made it across four kilometres of ocean to raise the alarm.

He had gone out kayaking and paddle-boarding on the water Friday afternoon with his family.

But the waves soon grew, flipping their boards and filling their kayak with water as they were dragged further out into the ocean.

"I was really scared," the young teen told reporters.

"I was just thinking in my head, like thinking I was going to make it through. But I was also thinking about all my friends at school, and friends at my Christian youth," he said.

"I just said: 'Alright, not today, not today, not today. I have to keep on going'."

The youngster said he started heading for shore with just his life jacket but later abandoned it to swim unencumbered.

"I was very puffed out, but I couldn't feel how tired I was."

The boy said he was trying to think of happy things, at one point singing the "Thomas the Tank Engine" theme song.

"At this time, you know, the waves are massive, and I have no life jacket on. So anyway, I just keep swimming. I do breaststroke. I do freestyle. Survival backstroke."

When he reached the beach, the teen said he called emergency services and asked them to deploy boats, helicopters and planes.

"My family is out at sea," he told them.

Marine rescue volunteer Paul Bresland said the teen's four-hour swim saved his family.

A search helicopter found his mother and two children wearing life jackets and clinging to a paddleboard at 8:30pm, police said. They had drifted 14 kilometres from the tourist town of Quindalup after spending up to 10 hours in the water.

"He swam, he reckons, the first two hours with a life jacket on," Bresland told national broadcaster ABC.

"And the brave fella thought he's not going to make it with a life jacket on, so he ditched it, and he swam the next two hours without a life jacket.

"I thought, mate, that is incredible," said Bresland, describing the boy's efforts as "superhuman".

Police inspector James Bradley said the boy's actions "cannot be praised highly enough".

"His determination and courage ultimately saved the lives of his mother and siblings," he told the ABC.

The boy's mother, named in local media as Joanne, has also been praised for keeping her family alive during hours out at sea with her other son, 12-year-old Beau, and eight-year-old daughter Grace.

"It seemed nice and calm to begin with," the mother told reporters.

"One of the hardest decisions I've ever had to make was to say to Austin: 'Try and get to shore and get some help, this could get really serious really quickly'," the mother was quoted as saying.

"As the sun went down I thought: 'Something's gone terribly wrong here', and my fear was that Austin didn't make it," she said.

"Everything goes through your head."</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 10:41:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/a9f26f36-00e8-11f1-9acd-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26034352526728.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Paris prosecutor's cybercrime unit raids X’s French office</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260203-paris-prosecutor-s-cybercrime-unit-raids-x-s-french-office</link><description>The ⁠Paris prosecutor's office said a search was under way at the French offices of ​Elon Musk's social media network ‍X on Tuesday as part of an ​investigation opened in January 2025 .

Trump, who has voiced a desire for American dominance over all of Latin America, has in recent months had an up-and-down relationship with Petro, a former anti-imperialist guerrilla who was elected Colombia's president in 2022.

In October, Trump called Petro an " illegal drug leader " though he provided no evidence, and in January, he floated military action against the longtime ally, which he has accused of failing to control the narcotics trade.

Petro, for his part, has been harshly critical of the U.S. president. He has said the Trump administration's deadly strikes on alleged drug boats amount to war crimes, and he described the U.S. operation last month deposing Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro as a "kidnapping."

In January, the two leaders held a phone call that both described positively, a surprise thaw that resulted in Petro's invitation to Washington. Trump told reporters on Monday that Petro's tone had changed of late, implying that he had become more acquiescent after the Maduro raid.

"We're gonna have a good meeting," Trump said.

Still, if the two men have anything in common, it is that they behave unpredictably, speak elliptically and change opinions quickly. One Colombian source acknowledged that the meeting could be "tense" given the sometimes stubborn personalities of the two presidents.

At the Tuesday meeting, Colombian officials plan to deliver a detailed presentation on their main anti-drug achievements, including cocaine seizure figures, said three sources with knowledge of the matter.

Will Freeman, fellow for Latin America studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, said the meeting could go smoothly if Petro sticks to discussing counternarcotics matters, rather than broader philosophical disagreements.

"But everything we know about both presidents' personalities suggests that's not going to happen," he said.

If the two leaders fail to reach a more lasting rapprochement, it could have profound implications for regional security, analysts said.

Colombia is the world's top producer of coca, the main ingredient in cocaine, and hosts several U.S.-designated terrorist organizations. But it has also been one of Washington's staunchest allies in the region, working closely with successive administrations to suppress drug flows northward.

Under Petro, coca production in Colombia has climbed, though the exact figures are a matter of dispute. Bogota argues that while the government has shifted away from forced eradication - a policy that can harm subsistence farmers - it has ramped up seizures and more sophisticated interdiction efforts.

For foreign leaders, meetings with Trump can be fraught, and many have resorted to flattery to minimize tension with the president and his advisers.

It was far from clear, however, that Petro - who has positioned himself as a thorn in Washington's side for almost all of his career - will choose that route.

Last week, he urged Colombian migrants to return from Chile, Argentina and the United States so as not to be treated like "slaves." He also said it is better to live in Havana than in Miami, which he described as traffic-clogged and cultureless.

Colombia has requested the meeting be held in private, a Colombian official said. But Trump, who is famously media-hungry, often asks reporters to enter the Oval Office at the last minute.

Petro himself has struck an upbeat if lofty tone.

"I think we should fill ourselves with optimism," Petro told public television station RTVC before departing for Washington. "I'll be expecting you on Tuesday, when I am meeting with the president, to be in all the public squares, to build the chain of affection, the certainty of love."</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 11:35:52 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/N2V23VGRIZJSJJXKV4U2UYRRX4.jpg?auth=814e195bd49b35707e9f3a5587f06129c1434e6a84d25225f5e3903d342b3251&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China to ban 'hidden' car door handles to address safety fears</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/china-ban-hidden-car-door-handles-address-safety-fears-2026-02-03/</link><description>BEIJING, Feb 3 (Reuters) - China will ban 'hidden' car door handles from 2027, becoming the first country to phase out a design pioneered by Tesla (TSLA.O) , opens new tab and adopted by Chinese competitors including Xiaomi (1810.HK) , opens new tab .

The hidden handle design, which functions through a key fob or mobile phone or by manually pressing it, has drawn scrutiny in both the United States and China over potential safety risks.

Last year, the U.S. auto safety agency opened a defect probe into Tesla Model 3 sedan's emergency door release controls. Tesla, which did not comment on the investigation at the time, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.

China's industry ministry said on Monday that under its new safety technical requirements, every car door should be equipped with both exterior and interior handles.

Mechanical release designs will be mandatory, with innovations such as electrical handles optional.

China's new policy sets out rules for where handles must be located on the outside of a car and how they should function to ensure that they can be opened in the event of an accident. It also requires interior handles to be clearly visible.

New vehicle models must align their door handle design with the new regulation from January 1, 2027 while approved models will come under the rules by January 1, 2029, the ministry said.

Chinese state media reported in October that the driver of a Xiaomi SU7 Ultra sedan died in an accident after passers-by were unable to open the door to pull him out of the burning vehicle.

Xiaomi, which has not commented publicly on the incident, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 11:36:03 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LLUV7BCNUFPKXAXRNFUXQ6C4R4.jpg?auth=ad5747dd77d44ba679c1d292f5b5631b88a4f4b6c2940bb6d2715f44ee2549c3&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Greenland foreign minister hopeful to find common ground with US that will respect its red lines</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/greenland-foreign-minister-hopeful-find-common-ground-with-us-that-will-respect-2026-02-03/</link><description>COPENHAGEN, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Greenlandic Foreign Minister Vivian Motzfeldt said on Tuesday that she was hopeful and optimistic that the Arctic island would find common ground with the United States that respected its red lines .

"On the second of February, WHO and partners supported the medical evacuation of five patients and seven companions to Egypt via the Rafah crossing," said WHO spokesperson Christian Lindmeier.

"It was the first medical evacuation through this route since sometime in 2025," he said referring to a limited number of evacuations during an early 2025 ceasefire.

Over 18,500 patients are awaiting evacuations after the two-year war, he said, with trauma injuries from the war as well as chronic conditions such as cancer and diabetes.

A UNICEF spokesperson said that more than 3,000 of them were children. Gaza health authorities are choosing whom to prioritise among the sick and wounded, Lindmeier said.

"We know that patients have died basically waiting for evacuation, and that's something which is horrible when you know just a few miles or kilometers outside that border, help is available," he added.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 11:37:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/DOMDLH2QORM6TLRPTFSLASXBFA.jpg?auth=036104a8718a3589f5f14195f783b5da77f6cf5aa13b31289d3cd6c64535d1e1&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Norway parliament supports monarchy despite scandals</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/norway-parliament-supports-monarchy-despite-scandals-2026-02-03/</link><description>OSLO, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Norway's parliament on Tuesday voted overwhelmingly in favour of maintaining the country's monarchy, rejecting a proposed change to a republic, despite recent turmoil in the king's family and an opinion poll showing a dip in popular support for the royals.

In the long-planned vote, 141 of parliament's 169 members supported the continuation of the monarchy, while 26 members cast ballots in favour of ending the reign of King Harald and his descendants, according to the official tally.

Supporters of the monarchy say the institution brings stability by being above partisan politics and that it has served Norway well since independence from Sweden in 1905.

Republican proponents argue that political power already rests with Norway's elected parliament and the government, adding that the inherited privilege of the royals does not belong in a democratic society.

"The sponsors seek to amend the constitution so that Norway's head of state is elected by the people, that is, a president," read the now-failed proposal from a group of seven members of parliament representing parties from across the political spectrum.

Still, Crown Princess Mette-Marit was criticised by the prime minister on Monday who said she had displayed poor judgement in having contacts with Jeffrey Epstein , following fresh reports of her ties with the late U.S. sex offender.

On Saturday, Mette-Marit, the spouse of the heir to the throne, Haakon, apologised for the contact, which occurred in the years after Epstein was found guilty of child sex crimes in 2008.

An opinion poll conducted on Monday for Norwegian daily Verdens Gang found that 61% of Norwegians favour keeping their royals in place, down from 72% last year, while support for a republic rose 10 percentage points to 27%, the survey released on Tuesday showed.

Asked whether Mette-Marit should become Norway's next queen, 44% said no while only 33% said yes, while the rest did not express an opinion, the survey of 1,014 respondents by polling institute InFact showed.

Separately on Tuesday, Mette-Marit's son from a previous relationship, Marius Hoiby, 29, went on trial . He has been accused of rape, domestic violence, assault and drug possession. He was arrested again at the weekend on suspicion of further crimes.

Hoiby has denied the most serious accusations against him, including those of rape and domestic violence, while admitting to some lesser charges.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 11:37:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/AMXTCUICZVJP7OQ5ZFX6UOWXE4.jpg?auth=ce010ea1c09c43572075b39600019df4b2787ae3f8928b015bfe253595cdb512&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Why are French prosecutors investigating Elon Musk's X?</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/technology/why-are-french-prosecutors-investigating-elon-musks-x-2026-02-03/</link><description>PARIS, Feb 3 (Reuters) - French prosecutors said on Tuesday they were widening an investigation into Elon Musk's social media platform X and that they have summoned the tech billionaire for questioning in April.

The UKMTO said it is investigating the incident, which happened in the inbound Traffic Separation Scheme of the Strait of Hormuz.

Numerous small armed vessels attempted to contact the vessel via VHF radio, but it ignored requests to stop and continued on its planned route, the agency said.

The strait links the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea beyond.

OPEC members Saudi Arabia, Iran, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Iraq export most of their crude via the strait, mainly to Asia.

Three vessels, two in 2023 and one in 2024, were seized by Iran near or in the strait.

Here are some reactions from governments and regulators since the start of January as well as xAI's response:

The European Commission on January 26 opened an investigation into whether Grok disseminates illegal content such as manipulated sexualised images in the EU. The probe will examine whether X assesses and mitigates risks as required under the bloc's digital rules.

Britain's media regulator Ofcom has launched an investigation to determine whether sexually intimate deepfakes produced by Grok violated its duty to protect people in the UK from potentially illegal content, under the Online Safety Act.

The Information Commissioner's Office - Britain's privacy watchdog - launched its own investigation on February 3, saying the reported creation of the sexualised images, including of children, raised serious concerns under UK data protection law.

Paris prosecutor's cybercrime unit raided X's office in Paris on February 3 and ordered Musk to face questions in April regarding a widening investigation over alleged algorithmic bias, complicity in the detention and diffusion of images of child‑pornographic nature and the violation of a person’s image rights with sexually explicit deepfakes.

Germany's media minister said EU rules provided tools to tackle illegal content and alleged the problem risked turning into the "industrialisation of sexual harassment."

Italy's data protection authority warned that using AI tools to create "undressed" deepfake imagery of real people without consent could amount to serious privacy violations or criminal offences.

Swedish political leaders condemned Grok-generated sexualised content after reporting that imagery involving Sweden's deputy prime minister was produced from a user prompt.

India's IT ministry sent X a formal notice on January 2 over alleged Grok-enabled creation or sharing of obscene sexualised images, directing that the content be taken down and requiring a report on actions being taken within 72 hours.

Japan also probed X over Grok, stating that the government would consider every option to prevent the generation of inappropriate images.

Indonesia said it had blocked access to Grok, a move meant to protect women and children from AI-generated fake pornographic content, citing the country's strict anti‑pornography laws.

Malaysia restored access to Grok in January for its users after X implemented additional safety measures.

The Philippines will reinstate access to Grok after its developer pledged to remove image-manipulation tools that had sparked child-safety concerns, the country's cybercrime investigation unit said in January.

California's governor and attorney general said on January 14 they were demanding answers from xAI amid the spread of non-consensual sexual images on the platform.

Canada's privacy watchdog said it was widening an existing investigation into X after reports that Grok was generating non-consensual, sexually explicit deepfakes.

Brazil's government and federal prosecutors gave xAI 30 days to prevent the chatbot from spreading fake sexualised content.

Australia's regulator eSafety said in January it was investigating Grok-generated sexualised deepfake images, assessing adult material under its image‑based abuse scheme and noting that child-related examples it had reviewed did not meet the legal threshold for child sexual abuse material under Australian law.

HOW HAS xAI RESPONDED?

xAI said on January 14 it had restricted image editing for Grok AI users and blocked users, based on their location, from generating images of people in revealing clothing in "jurisdictions where it's illegal." It did not identify the countries.

It had earlier limited the use of Grok's image generation and editing features only to paying subscribers.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 13:04:17 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/YDM7ZFTLJJI5LHSR4QJR6TOHHY.jpg?auth=39c4516da4f7542d06b530b413e5dfb1bc77949b544c232b9c0c94ce5cd253de&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Top EU diplomat to visit Kyrgyzstan for talks on sanctions</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/top-eu-diplomat-visit-kyrgyzstan-talks-sanctions-2026-02-03/</link><description>BISHKEK, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Kyrgyzstan said on Tuesday the European Union's sanctions envoy would visit on February 26 after a report that the EU was planning to ban some exports to the Central Asian country for allegedly facilitating Russian sanctions evasion.

Bloomberg News reported last week that the EU was considering the first use of its "last resort" anti-sanctions evasion tool by banning exports of certain categories of goods to Kyrgyzstan.

In a statement, Kyrgyzstan's government said Deputy Prime Minister Daniyar Amangeldiev held a video call with EU envoy David O'Sullivan on Tuesday and they agreed on "constructive and substantive dialogue on sanctions-related issues".

It said further talks would take place during O'Sullivan's visit to Bishkek later this month.

A mountainous country of 7 million people, Kyrgyzstan has enjoyed rapid economic growth in recent years, partly by becoming a main clearinghouse for trade with Russia redirected by Western sanctions imposed on Moscow over its war in Ukraine.

Several Kyrgyz bank and cryptocurrency firms have come under U.S., EU and British sanctions for allegedly facilitating illicit trade with Russia.

The deal, declared on Friday , staved off the prospect of further confrontation between Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa's government and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, which lost swathes of eastern and northern Syria to government troops in January.

The government forces are expected to be stationed in several Syrian state buildings in Qamishli and also at the city's airport, a Syrian official and a Kurdish security source told Reuters ahead of the deployment.

Reuters witnesses said dozens of villagers obstructed a convoy of security forces as it approached the outskirts of the city, the de facto political centre of the Kurdish-led administration.

On Tuesday, interior ministry vehicles entered the ethnically-mixed city of Hasakah, about 80km (47 miles) south of Qamishli.

Friday's accord foresees a phased integration of Kurdish fighters with government forces. The United States has hailed the agreement as a historic milestone towards unity and reconciliation after 14 years of civil war in Syria.

The SDF was once Washington's main Syrian ally, playing a vital part in the fight against Islamic State militants.

But its status weakened as U.S. President Donald Trump built ties with Sharaa, a former al Qaeda commander who has now brought almost all of Syria back under the authority of Damascus.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 14:27:04 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/H3WRKXRT65NKHM5QCIJ5VY3SNE.jpg?auth=62421b72e45f827feb915ba81c10ea32be20c812d30694fee8b25ab0bcdcef1f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Greece to soon announce social media ban for children under 15, government source says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/society-equity/greece-soon-announce-social-media-ban-children-under-15-government-source-says-2026-02-03/</link><description>ATHENS, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Greece is "very close" to announcing a social media ban for children aged under 15, a senior government source told Reuters on Tuesday.

"Russian investment in their Northern Fleet, and in particular, in their subsurface capabilities, is undiminished," General Gwyn Jenkins, First Sea Lord of the Royal Navy, told French think tank IFRI's naval conference in Paris.

"Despite the horrendous cost in terms of national resource and blood to Russia, of their egregious invasion of Ukraine, they have continued to pump resource into their Northern Fleet and their subsurface capabilities," he said.

Jenkins, who was speaking alongside top navy chiefs from the United States, France, Italy and the Netherlands, said Russia's activity was testing Western capabilities, given how long it took to upgrade, build and develop new vessels in a fast-changing technological environment.

"It doesn't take many assets to fix us as allies, because we have a very low risk tolerance of allowing a aggressive actor operating in our backyard, and that does take a lot of resource to respond to," Jenkins said.

Vice-Admiral Harold Liebregs, commander of the Royal Netherlands Navy echoed Jenkins' comments saying Russia was being increasingly emboldened in the North Sea and loitering over vital infrastructure, possibly preparing further actions.

"We see ships operating drones that fly over our territory, and we see the shadow fleet, or Dark Fleet, that's fueling the Russian war economy, using ships that are ill maintained, not insured, and posing all kinds of liability issues in our precious North Sea," he said.

"I think the main point here is that we should not accept this as the new normal, because it pushes us back in a position where we have less freedom to manoeuvre, and that creates a less suitable strategic position."</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 14:30:08 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/M2JZHKKNCNI5ZIKYZ22YY74N2E.jpg?auth=19147dbe047f0d08df81c7f5de6f6956bde3e6044839d99d46742e0523495c5f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Snow causes delays, some cancellations at Frankfurt airport</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/snow-causes-delays-some-cancellations-frankfurt-airport-2026-02-03/</link><description>FRANKFURT, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Passengers at Frankfurt airport face delays and isolated flight cancellations on Tuesday due to heavy snowfall, operator Fraport (FRAG.DE) , opens new tab said.

Iran and the United States will discuss Iran's nuclear programme on Friday in Turkey, Iranian and U.S. officials told Reuters on Monday. U.S. President Donald Trump said that with big U.S. warships heading to Iran, "bad things" would probably happen if a deal could not be reached.

A source familiar with the situation said on Tuesday that Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner would take part in the talks, along with U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Kushner's plans. Ministers from other countries in the region are also expected to attend.

An Iranian diplomatic source said Tehran's view of the talks is neither optimistic nor pessimistic, adding that the Islamic Republic's defensive capabilities are non-negotiable and that it is ready for any scenario.

"It remains to be seen whether the United States also intends to conduct serious, result-oriented negotiations or not," the source said.

Iranian sources have said Trump is also seeking to limit Iran's ballistic missile programme, which Iranian officials say is an essential component of the country's defence.

Earlier the UAE, a highly influential Gulf Arab oil producer and close U.S. ally, said the region cannot afford another conflict.

"I think that the region has gone through various calamitous confrontations," the UAE president's adviser Anwar Gargash told a panel at the World Governments Summit in Dubai.

"I don't think we need another one, but I would like to see direct Iranian-American negotiations leading to understandings so that we don't have these issues every other day."

Iran should rebuild its relationship with Washington to reach a wider geo-strategic deal which could help Tehran repair its economy ravaged by U.S. sanctions, Gargash said.

Gulf Arab states are worried that Iran will carry out its threat to target U.S. bases on their territory should Trump attack the Islamic Republic again.

In June, the United States struck Iranian nuclear targets, joining in at the close of a 12-day Israeli bombing campaign. Since then, Tehran has said its uranium enrichment work - which it says is for peaceful, not military purposes - has stopped.

Recent satellite imagery of two of the targeted sites, Isfahan and Natanz, appears to show new roofing over two destroyed buildings but no other signs of rebuilding, according to the imagery provided by Planet Labs and reviewed by Reuters.

The meeting in Istanbul aims to revive diplomacy over the long-running dispute about Iran's nuclear programme and dispel fears of a new regional war.

The U.S. naval buildup near Iran follows a violent crackdown against anti-government demonstrations last month.

Trump, who stopped short of carrying out threats to intervene, has since demanded nuclear concessions from Iran and sent a flotilla to its coast. He said last week Iran was "seriously talking", while Tehran's top security official Ali Larijani said arrangements for negotiations were under way.

The priority of the Istanbul talks is to avoid conflict and de-escalate tension, a regional official told Reuters. Regional powers including Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Egypt, Oman, and the United Arab Emirates were also invited, he said.

Iran’s leadership is increasingly worried a U.S. strike could break its grip on power by driving an already enraged public back onto the streets, according to six current and former officials.

Officials told Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei that public anger over last month's crackdown - the bloodiest since the 1979 Islamic Revolution-- has reached a point where fear is no longer a deterrent , four current officials briefed on the discussions said.

Iranian sources told Reuters last week that Trump had demanded three conditions for resumption of talks: Zero enrichment of uranium in Iran, limits on Tehran's ballistic missile programme and ending its support for regional proxies.

Iran has long said all three demands are unacceptable infringements of its sovereignty, but two Iranian officials told Reuters its clerical rulers saw the ballistic missile programme, rather than uranium enrichment, as the bigger obstacle.

One Iranian official said: "Diplomacy is ongoing. For talks to resume, Iran says there should not be preconditions and that it is ready to show flexibility on uranium enrichment, including handing over 400 kg of highly enriched uranium (HEU), accepting zero enrichment under a consortium arrangement as a solution."

Tehran's regional sway has been weakened by Israel's attacks on its proxies - from Hamas in Gaza to Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen and militias in Iraq - as well as by the ousting of Iran's close ally, former Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 16:12:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KQW4J4IZ4JPCFA4XU24M2GTG5M.jpg?auth=53de3ac8191085788961bd5a0f48c9f842113c79e46782fb50e3a5b17222ce65&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>French prosecutors seek public office bans in Le Pen appeals trial</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/french-prosecutors-seek-public-office-bans-le-pen-appeals-trial-2026-02-03/</link><description>PARIS, Feb 3 (Reuters) - French prosecutors urged an appeals court on Tuesday to largely confirm a previous court's ruling against French far-right officials in an EU embezzlement trial, without saying yet how this will apply to longtime party chief Marine Le Pen .

The initial ruling, in March last year, was a major setback for Le Pen as it banned her from running for office for five years, effective immediately.

If that ruling is fully confirmed, Le Pen will not be able to run in next year's presidential election. If the ban is substantially shorter, or if there is no ban, she could still take part.

In last year's ruling the court said that Le Pen had been "at the heart" of a scheme to misappropriate more than 4 million euros of EU funds and use them to pay the far-right party's staff back home.

Le Pen told the court in her appeals trial that she had no sense of having done anything wrong, and had appealed against the ruling along with others from her party.

The prosecutor's office wants public office bans to be decided this time too, Thierry Ramonatxo, Advocate General at the Paris General Prosecutor’s Office told the appeals court.

"We will seek office bans," he said. "Parliamentary assistants worked for the party but were paid by Europe. That's the stark reality."

The prosecutors are expected to specify later in the day what sentences they will seek for each of the defendants, including Le Pen, with the ruling expected in the coming weeks or months.

In last year's ruling, Le Pen also received a four-year prison sentence - two years of which are suspended and two years of which are to be served under home detention, as well as a 100,000-euro fine. These were not enforced immediately.

The RN and two dozen party figures were also found guilty of diverting European Parliament funds.

Le Pen has run three times for president.

If she cannot run next year, party president Jordan Bardella looks set to become the RN's candidate.

Bardella, 30, has helped expand the RN's appeal among younger voters though some analysts question whether he has the experience to win over the broader electorate the RN needs to secure victory in 2027.

The appeals court ruling is also subject to appeal though France's highest court, the Cour de Cassation.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 16:12:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/TBAPSQV5B5NPNBYSLKGUAZSGTM.jpg?auth=f2763ce51c15d570763edba845197ebe0d6c59f1aee53dab798d4243b613b716&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Exclusive: Somaliland expects Israel trade deal, has minerals to offer, leader says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/somaliland-expects-israel-trade-deal-has-minerals-offer-leader-says-2026-02-03/</link><description>JERUSALEM, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Somaliland expects to reach a trade agreement soon with Israel, the first country to recognise its independence, and is willing to offer rights to valuable mineral deposits as part of a deal, its leader said in an interview with Reuters.

Israel in late December became the first country to recognise the Republic of Somaliland, a northeastern part of Somalia that has claimed independence for decades. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel would seek immediate cooperation in agriculture, health, technology and the economy.

Speaking to Reuters via video link from Dubai where he was attending the World Government Summit, Somaliland President Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi said no bilateral economic deal with Israel had yet been reached, but Somaliland expected to sign "a partnership agreement".

"At the moment, there is no trade, and there is no investment from Israel. But we are hoping 100% (for) their investment, their trade, and hopefully we will engage with the business people and the government of Israel soon," he said.

"Somaliland is a very rich country in resources - minerals, oil, gas, marine, in agriculture, energy and other sectors.... We have meat, we have fish, we have minerals and they (Israel) need them. So trade can start from these main sectors," he said. "The sky is the limit."

He said in return Somaliland would seek access to Israeli technology.

Somaliland says its mineral resources include vast reserves of lithium, critical for batteries and electric vehicles. In 2024 the Saudi Mining Company Kilomass secured an exploration deal there for lithium and other critical minerals.

Abdullahi said he was grateful to Israel for being first to recognise Somaliland. While Somaliland also hopes for future military cooperation with Israel, he said establishing Israeli military bases had not been discussed.

He said he had accepted an invitation from Netanyahu and would visit Israel soon, but no date had yet been set. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar visited Somaliland a month ago.

Abdullahi said he expects all United Nations countries eventually to follow Israel's lead, including the United Arab Emirates and the United States, though he said it was normal for recognition to take time.

He said he had a good working relationship with the U.S. and believes President Donald Trump will "someday" recognise Somaliland. Last month, he pitched investment deals at a dinner in Davos attended by Trump's son Eric .

Israel's decision to recognise Somaliland has drawn an angry response from Somalia, and has also been criticised by China, Turkey, Egypt and the African Union.

Somaliland also cooperates with the UAE, with DP World a big investor in the Berbera port. The UAE has "not decided officially yet but they are just one of the countries we expect to recognise Somaliland," Abdullahi said.

"We also expect that the Saudi government will make the same investment in Somaliland," he said.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 16:14:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/VLVBLYEF75M73AQ44G3RQUVMTQ.jpg?auth=8db4a2901a7c79ee52a206cffe3a49b5e594a88c32b065cc067e18fad60e9942&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>NATO has started military planning for an Arctic mission</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/nato-has-started-military-planning-an-arctic-mission-2026-02-03/</link><description>BERLIN, Feb 3 (Reuters) - NATO has started the military planning for an Arctic Sentry mission, a spokesperson for the alliance's military headquarters SHAPE said on Tuesday.

"An objective and thorough investigation of the circumstances of doubtful legality as well as international legal cooperation is only possible if a pre-trial investigation is launched," Lithuania's prosecutor general's office said in a statement, without naming any suspects or specific crimes.

Earlier on Tuesday, President Gitanas Nauseda called for a principled law enforcement investigation into the case.

Lithuanian media have reported that the names of several Lithuanian models and arts figures are reported in the files, published last week by the U.S. Justice Department.

Several performers have announced a boycott of an arts festival, Midsummer Vilnius, whose promoter, Valdas Petreikis, is mentioned in the files as having received payments from Epstein.

Petreikis has said he was unaware of Epstein's crimes at the time of their acquaintance, denies wrongdoing and is withdrawing from promoting arts events due to the public backlash.

Lithuanian police and prosecutors are currently assessing publicly released information, analysing the legal framework and exchanging information with partners, the prosecutor general's office said.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 17:29:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia's Putin and Saudi crown prince discuss work of OPEC+, Kremlin says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/russias-putin-saudi-crown-prince-discuss-work-opec-kremlin-says-2026-02-03/</link><description>MOSCOW, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin held a phone call with Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the Kremlin said on Tuesday, saying they had agreed to deepen cooperation in the political, economic, trade and humanitarian spheres.

The accused, a 37-year-old Romanian and a 54-year-old Greek, tampered with the vessels by pouring more than 20 kg of steel pellets into an engine block, puncturing freshwater lines, removing fuel tank caps and disabling fuses in the onboard electronics, according to the investigators.

The sabotage was discovered during pre-departure checks as one of the ships, the corvette "Emden", was preparing for its inaugural journey to the port city of Kiel.

The activities could have led to significant damage if left undetected, the prosecutor general's office said, adding that investigations were still ongoing.

The two men were arrested in Hamburg and a village in Greece, with their residences in Hamburg, Romania and Greece searched by authorities.

According to Greek police officials and security sources, the 54-year-old man was arrested in the early morning hours inside his home in northern Greece following a European arrest warrant issued on behalf of Germany.

Among the items confiscated from his home were six mobile phones, three USB sticks, a SIM card and a hard drive, and evidence of 19 bank accounts, officials said.

According to Greek court documents, the arrested men were tasked with painting work on the corvette "Koeln" in June 2025. During the work, they manually shut the control panel, cutting power off on the vessel and risking starting a fire.

Germany's defence ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

A spokesperson for the prosecutor's office in Hamburg declined to say whether authorities suspected Russia of being behind the sabotage.

Political leaders and military officials have accused Russia of engaging in acts of sabotage, espionage, and hybrid warfare since Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

The Kremlin has repeatedly denied such allegations, dismissing them as unsubstantiated.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 17:29:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China warns Panama of 'heavy prices' to pay after CK Hutchison contract quashed</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/china-calls-panama-court-ruling-ck-hutchison-port-contracts-shameful-pathetic-2026-02-03/</link><description>BEIJING, Feb 3 (Reuters) - China warned Panama on Tuesday there would be "heavy prices" to pay after a court ruling there annulled Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison's (0001.HK) , opens new tab contract to operate two ports at the Panama Canal.

China's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office called the ruling by Panama's Supreme Court "absurd," "shameful and pathetic," and vowed to defend the interests of Chinese firms.

Panamanian authorities did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Last week's court ruling annulled a key contract that Panama Ports Company, a CK Hutchison subsidiary, has held since the 1990s to operate container terminals at the canal's Pacific and Atlantic entrances.

The legal decision, which cited constitutional violations and concerns over public interest, was seen as a win for Washington amid intensifying U.S.-China rivalry over the control of global trade routes.

The ruling threatens to disrupt the Hong Kong conglomerate's proposed $23-billion sale of 43 ports in 23 countries, including the two at the Panama Canal, to a consortium led by BlackRock (BLK.N) , opens new tab and Mediterranean Shipping Company.

"The ruling ignored the facts, breached trust, and seriously damaged the legitimate rights and interests of enterprises in Hong Kong, China," the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office said on its social media account.

"China has sufficient means and tools, and sufficient strength and ability to defend a fair and just international economic and trade order," the office said.

If the Panamanian authorities "insist on having their own way ... heavy prices both politically and economically will surely be paid!" it added.

The court decision was welcomed by U.S. authorities. John Moolenaar, chair of the U.S. House Select Committee on China, called it a "win for America."

Without naming the U.S. in the statement, the Chinese office said "some country has ... used bullying tactics to force other countries to obey their will," and that Panama had "willingly succumbed" to hegemonic power.

U.S. President Donald Trump, who initially celebrated the proposed $23-billion ports sale, has called for the U.S. to " take back " the Panama Canal in the face of Chinese influence.

CK Hutchison's subsidiary last week said the ruling was inconsistent with the legal framework that had allowed it to operate the ports.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 17:29:17 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/25SD7DAJEJPL5KLMC5MZJDYYSI.jpg?auth=ccfe4b48180a49ad7c8c31a413e1e5bf6fe016edb0b0646953399fa703d88966&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Sudanese army says it has broken siege of famine-stricken Kadugli</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/sudanese-army-says-it-has-broken-siege-famine-stricken-kadugli-2026-02-03/</link><description>Feb 3 - The Sudanese army said it broke a years-long siege on the city of Kadugli on Tuesday, potentially providing tens of thousands of people a reprieve from famine and signaling a shift in the war's momentum.

The conflict between the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) has displaced millions, drawn in regional powers and caused a vast humanitarian crisis since it broke out in April 2023.

Its latest frontline is the greater Kordofan region , which the RSF began sweeping through after the rainy season ended late last year.

"With God's help and guidance, your Sudanese Armed Forces and supporting forces have succeeded in opening the Kadugli-Dalanj road, after a heroic battle," the army said in a statement.

The RSF did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Kadugli and nearby al-Dalanj had been under siege on and off since the start of the war. There was an escalation in fighting after the SPLM-N, which controls territory in the state and elsewhere, joined forces with the RSF last year.

The army broke the siege of al-Dalanj last week.

In Kadugli the siege caused famine conditions confirmed by a global hunger monitor last year, and in both cities civilians were subjected to devastating drone attacks that have continued since the sieges were broken, residents said.

Jan Egeland, head of Norwegian Refugee Council, said he witnessed "massive, unchecked suffering" among those who fled Kadugli to camps in SPLM-N territory.

"The mothers had one recurrent story," he said in an interview with Reuters on Tuesday. "The drones are hitting their homes that are torched, and the people flee for their lives after having been starved for months," Egeland said.

People fleeing the siege of al-Fashir, which fell to the RSF in October, gave similar accounts.

Few aid agencies remain active in Kadugli or elsewhere in South Kordofan. The siege has driven up prices, according to local aid workers, with a kilo of flour reaching 80,000 Sudanese pounds (about $22).

That has put food out of reach for many, forcing them to eat leaves, while medicine and doctors are scarce, the aid workers said.

According to the United Nations, more than 80% of Kadugli's population, or some 147,000 people, have fled.

The army's advance was aided by a breakdown in the RSF's supply lines from Libya into the Kordofan region, an army source and an SPLM-N source told Reuters.

Reuters reported on Monday that Egypt had deployed drones at an airstrip near its borders with Sudan and Libya, in what experts and officials said was a sign of its deepening involvement in Sudan. Libya's Kufrah airport , a major conduit for RSF supplies, announced on January 16 it would close for one month for renovations, though airport officials denied this was linked to Sudan's war.

Egypt has not acknowledged supporting the army militarily, but has said its national security is directly linked to Sudan's.

The army's advance was largely enabled by drone attacks and by allied armed groups recently recruited from local Nuba tribes, both sources said.

Egeland said that shifts in the war's frontlines had not alleviated civilian suffering, while efforts at a settlement, led by the United States, had failed.

"The peace diplomacy has failed to prevent that armed men, ruthless men, do whatever they want with the civilian population that they first starve and then attack," he said.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 17:29:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/EJ2XUVMQX5PNZIA43VPUKJEZFY.jpg?auth=67624ac3b5a533dc03ad7453d7471a10b11ad8c8691bf46905df64877900322a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UK ex-US ambassador Peter Mandelson quits House of Lords amid Epstein scandal</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260203-uk-ex-us-ambassador-peter-mandelson-quits-house-of-lords-amid-epstein-scandal</link><description>The UK 's former ambassador to the United States, Peter Mandelson , is stepping down as a member of the upper house of parliament, it was announced Tuesday, as a scandal deepened over his ties to late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein .

The veteran Labour politician, former UK government minister and EU trade commissioner had announced he was resigning from the House of Lords as of Wednesday, Speaker Michael Forsyth told members.

"The clerk of the parliaments has today (Tuesday) received notification from Lord Mandelson of his intention to retire from the House, effective from February 4 (Wednesday)," Forsyth said.

The move came shortly after Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Mandelson had "let his country down" after a slew of emails released by US authorities which detailed his cosy ties with the American financier.

Starmer told ministers he was "appalled" at revelations regarding Mandelson that emerged over the weekend, according to a Downing Street readout of a cabinet meeting.

"The alleged passing on of emails of highly sensitive government business was disgraceful," the prime minister said, adding he was not yet "reassured that the totality of information had yet emerged" regarding Mandelson's links with Epstein.

Starmer also said he had asked officials to draft legislation to strip Mandelson of his peerage "as quickly as possible" and made it clear the government "would cooperate" with any police inquiries into the matter.

London's Metropolitan Police said Monday that they were reviewing reports of a possible "misconduct in a public office... to determine if they meet the criminal threshold for investigation".

Starmer has faced mounting criticism of his initial decision to appoint Mandelson as Britain's ambassador to Washington, before sacking him last September, less than a year into his post, over his ties to Epstein.

The Epstein affair is casting a long shadow over Washington and Europe, entangling some of the most prominent names in politics.

The US Justice Department on Friday released what it said would be the final batch of pages, photos and videos from the Epstein files, adding fuel to a political drama that has put pressure on President Donald Trump .

Trump spent months trying to block the disclosure of investigative files linked to Epstein, who moved in elite circles for years, cultivating ties with billionaires, politicians, academics and celebrities.

On Monday, it emerged that former US president Bill Clinton and his wife, Hillary, will testify in a US House investigation into Epstein, heading off a potential vote to hold the couple in contempt.

Neither Trump nor the Clintons have been accused of criminal wrongdoing related to Epstein's activities.

Meanwhile, the European Commission said Tuesday it will look into whether Mandelson, who served as the EU's trade chief between 2004 and 2008, broke its code of conduct over his Epstein ties.

Mandelson – a back-room architect of Labour's revival as an electoral force in the 1990s under Tony Blair – quit the party on Sunday to avoid causing it "further embarrassment" from the slew of revelations.

Bank records released on Friday by the US authorities suggested that in 2009, Mandelson, who was then business secretary, forwarded an economic briefing to Epstein intended for then-leader Gordon Brown , captioning it: "Interesting note that's gone to the PM."

Epstein also appeared to have transferred a total of $75,000 (£55,000) in three payments to accounts linked to the top Labour politician between 2003 and 2004.

Mandelson, 72, told the BBC on Sunday he had no memory of the money transfers and did not know whether the documents were authentic.

His comments were "gobsmacking" and caused the public "to lose faith in all politicians", Starmer told his cabinet.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 17:29:33 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/2fec1944-011f-11f1-aeea-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26033470028233.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Digital sovereignty (2/3): Can Europe’s businesses survive without US Big Tech?</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/technology/20260203-digital-sovereignty-can-european-businesses-survive-without-us-big-tech</link><description>When a German business lobby asked IT executives how they would fare without access to US technology, their reply offered a sobering reality check for champions of European autonomy .

More than 95% said they wouldn’t survive two years if the United States cut off access to its digital technologies and services, according to the survey carried out last year by Bitkom, Germany’s largest digital industry association.

Compared with earlier surveys, Bitkom’s findings pointed to growing pessimism about the resilience of German businesses at a time of heightened tensions between the Trump administration and Europe.

There is widespread fear that Europe’s businesses could end up as collateral damage in the event of a deeper transatlantic fallout, says Bertrand Trastour, global sales director for Stormshield, an Airbus subsidiary specialising in sovereign cybersecurity solutions.

“It's clearly on people’s minds,” Trastour acknowledges. “I’m using an American smartphone as we speak. What would we do without it? We don't have any viable alternatives in Europe for certain types of equipment.”

According to the Bitkom survey, an abrupt shortage of high-tech gear from the likes of Apple or Google is a key concern voiced by German business, for whom coping without US-made smartphones, laptops or tablets is inconceivable.

It's not just the American hardware that Europe’s businesses depend on. “One wonders what would happen if US software publishers were to suspend the licences they provide for European companies,” Trastour says.

Without access to customer relationship management (CRM) tools provided by California-based Salesforce, for instance, many factories in Europe would be forced to drastically scale back their operations, resulting in layoffs.

Washington could also choose to place export controls on certain advanced technologies, mirroring steps already taken to curb the rise of China’s AI industry.

Limiting chip exports to Europe would significantly curtail research and development on the continent, warns Christophe Grosbost, chief strategy officer at the Innovation Makers Alliance.

“We are very dependent on GPUs, the graphics chips sold mainly by Nvidia, which are used to run the data centres where information is stored to train AI models,” Grosbost explains.

But European companies are not entirely helpless, says Trastour, whose company provides cybersecurity solutions that are strictly “French- or European-made".

“The goal is to build technological autonomy,” Trastour explains. “We cannot completely wean off US tech, but by using European functional building blocks [software that performs specific functions] we can come up with a technological mix that offers a degree of resilience.”

Experts point to an abundance of European tools and services , many of which remain little-known.

Jitsi, a collaborative communication tool developed by Bulgaria's Emil Ivov, is touted as an alternative to Microsoft Teams. European cloud providers like France's OVH and Switzerland's Infomaniak have emerged as viable competitors to larger North American firms.

The French government announced in late January that its 2.5 million civil servants will stop using Zoom, Microsoft Teams and others by 2027 in favour of Visio, a homegrown videoconferencing system.

While the Trump administration once championed “alternative facts”, America's Big Tech firms are no fans of alternatives to their tools and platforms. Competitors are required to fend off accusations of monopoly, but they remain largely invisible, crushed by “the massive marketing budgets that tech giants have been showering on the public for decades”, says Martin Hullin, head of the European Network for Technological Resilience and Sovereignty at the Bertelsmann Foundation, a German think tank.

Yet there is a world beyond Gmail, Word, X, Chrome and Apple. Europe, in particular, is home to “many small companies with very interesting ideas and products that are sometimes of better quality than their American equivalents”, argues Frans Imbert-Vier, CEO of technology consulting firm UBCOM and a key advocate of European technological independence.

The hard part is often finding them. Who, for example, has ever heard of Olvid, a French alternative to WhatsApp and text messaging?

France’s Emmanuel Macron has sought to set an example with his “start-up nation” slogan. His government has developed a whole batch of homegrown digital tools to escape American control, aiming to replace Teams with “Visio”, Google Drive with “Files”, and WeTransfer with “FranceTransfer”.

With strained EU-US relations leading to renewed interest in technological sovereignty, some experts in the field have posted catalogues of alternative solutions online.

For each American software programme, Austrian IT developer Constantin Graf has compiled an almost exhaustive list of European alternatives. The ambitious German project Digital Independence Day is less exhaustive but more educational. Its website offers step-by-step instructions on how to switch, for instance, from PayPal to Wero, a European mobile payment system.

But ditching US tools and systems in favour of European alternatives is far from straightforward, particularly for large companies that operate internationally, warns Francesca Musiani, head of the Internet and Society Centre at France’s National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS).

“Large international firms tend to build their entire productivity frameworks on a stack of highly integrated American 'bricks’ such as the cloud, collaborative tools (like Teams), CRM and AI,” she explains. Removing one “brick” risks destabilising the entire system.

Unlike government agencies, Musiani adds, private companies “cannot always invoke sovereignty or national security to justify choosing alternative solutions that are sometimes more expensive or less efficient in the short term”.

Moreover, the bigger players “tend to be risk-averse and inclined to maintain the status quo” rather than migrate thousands of employees and retrain them on new systems, notes Johan Linaker, a specialist in digital sovereignty and innovation at the Research Institutes of Sweden (RISE). This conservative culture “can be counterproductive” if a rapid shift towards European solutions is required.

Smaller, nimbler companies may be quicker to jump on the technological autonomy bandwagon but would still face a bumpy ride.

“It won't happen overnight and it will require investment in training, research and acquisition,” says Frans Imbert-Vier, CEO of technology consulting firm UBCOM and an advocate of European technological independence.

Pointing to such “invisible costs” of decoupling from American technology, Musiani warns that the process “can lead to errors, frustrations and productivity losses”, in turn resulting in a “loss of competitiveness” – particularly in the face of competition from the US.

Helping to facilitate this transition is where European authorities need to step in, says Imbert-Vier.

“In 2024, the European Union purchased €111 billion worth of American technology,” notes the UBCOM CEO, for whom part of this expenditure could have been “directed towards supporting European innovation” instead.

Martin Hullin, director of the European Network for Technological Resilience and Sovereignty at Germany's Bertelsmann Foundation, warns that sticking with a single service provider – i.e., the United States – is “very short-term thinking” that poses a long-term risk to efficiency.

He argues that companies need the courage to take decisions that might be costly in the short term but will ultimately make them more resilient.

Research published last year by Hullin and other economists concluded that Europe needs to invest around €300 billion over 10 years to establish economic sovereignty in technology.

But a failure to do so could prove even costlier in the long run, experts warn.

While decoupling “carries an economic cost, being too dependent on a monopoly across the Atlantic probably carries a greater one”, argues Trastour.

“It’s a strategic decision and it has to be made now.”

Their journey from Egypt on Monday through the frontier post and across the "yellow line" zone controlled by Israel and an allied Palestinian militia group, involved lengthy delays and the confiscation of gifts including toys, one of the women said.

"It was a journey of horror, humiliation and oppression," said 56-year-old Huda Abu Abed by phone from the tent her family is living in at Khan Younis in southern Gaza .

Her account was supported by that of another woman Reuters interviewed, and by comments from a third woman interviewed on Arab television.

In response to a Reuters request for comment, Israel's military denied its forces had acted inappropriately or mistreated Palestinians crossing into Gaza, without addressing the specific allegations made by the two women interviewed.

About 50 Palestinians had been expected to enter the enclave on Monday but by nightfall only three women and nine children had been let through, Palestinian and Egyptian sources said, with another 38 stuck waiting to clear security.

Of the 50 people waiting to leave Gaza, mostly for medical treatment, only five patients with seven relatives escorting them managed to cross into Egypt on Monday.

Abu Abed said the returnees, who were restricted to a single suitcase each, first encountered problems at the crossing where European border monitors confiscated toys they were taking home as gifts, she said.

She spent a year in Egypt for heart treatment but returned before it was finished because she missed her family. An adult daughter had also travelled to Egypt for medical treatment. An adult son was killed in December 2024 and she was not able to say goodbye to him, she said. Two other children are in Gaza.

Once through the crossing and on the Gaza side of the border, the 12 returnees boarded a bus for their journey through the Israeli-controlled zone and across the "yellow line" demarcating Israeli and Hamas-held zones.

A second woman, Sabah al-Raqeb, 41, said the bus, escorted by two four-wheel-drive vehicles, was stopped at a checkpoint manned by Israel-backed Palestinian gunmen who identified themselves as belonging to the Popular Forces, commonly known as the Abu Shabab militia.

The women's family names were read out over a loudspeaker and each was led by two men and a woman from Abu Shabab militia to a security point where Israeli forces were waiting. They were then blindfolded and handcuffed, she and Abu Abed said.

They were asked about their knowledge of Hamas, about the October 7, 2023 attack on Israel that triggered the war, and other issues relating to militancy, the two women said. The Palestinian anti-Hamas gunmen also said they could remain in the Israeli-held zone, Raqeb said.

"The officer asked me why I came back to Gaza. He said it was destroyed. I told him I came back for my children and family," said Raqeb, who has returned to her seven children living in a tent after leaving Gaza two years ago for what she had expected to be a short trip for medical treatment.

Abu Abed said the questioning lasted more than two hours.

In a statement denying any wrongdoing, Israel's military said there were no known incidents of inappropriate conduct, mistreatment, apprehensions or confiscation of property by the Israeli security establishment.

It said there was an "identification and screening process at the 'Regavim' screening facility, which is managed by the security establishment in an area under (Israeli military) control." It said that process followed screening by European personnel as part of a mechanism agreed upon by all parties.

The Rafah crossing, the sole route in or out for nearly all Gaza's more than 2 million inhabitants, has been shut for most of the war. It was meant to be reopened in the first phase of the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas agreed in October.

Rafah, a city of a quarter of a million people, was almost entirely depopulated during the war as Israel told all residents to leave before conducting extensive demolitions that have left it a wasteland of rubble.

The city lies in a security cordon retained by Israel after its troops pulled back to the yellow line in October, and where the Popular Forces are also operating.

Since the forces' leader, Yasser Abu Shabab, was killed last year they have been led by his deputy, Ghassan Dahine. "The Fifth Unit under my command will play an important security role regarding entry and exit through the Rafah crossing," Israel's Ynet news website quoted Dahine as saying.

Some 20,000 Gazans are hoping to leave for treatment abroad. Despite the slow reopening, many of them said the step brought relief. On Tuesday, 50 Palestinians were expected to cross into Gaza from Egypt, according to an Egyptian source.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 18:29:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/23WWQKWSQZJXDBFH4FB7M7WYSE.jpg?auth=e7534117e395488289915cda3eb769a7f99ffd8a539b5c9b2d925b716294b4b9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>French prosecutors seek 5-year ban from public office for Le Pen in appeal trial</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/french-prosecutors-seek-5-year-ban-public-office-le-pen-appeal-trial-2026-02-03/</link><description>PARIS, Feb 3 (Reuters) - French prosecutors on Tuesday requested a four-year prison sentence and a five-year ban from public office for far-right leader Marine Le Pen in her appeal trial over the misuse of European Union funds.

The announcement follows weeks of sometimes violent tumult in Minneapolis, where U.S. President Donald Trump has deployed thousands of armed, masked agents as he tries to deport more migrants than any of his predecessors.

New York Attorney General Letitia James said the state's new legal observers would be volunteer employees from her office, trained to observe, without interfering, whether Trump's immigration enforcement "remains within the bounds of the law."

"I am proud to protect New Yorkers' constitutional rights to speak freely, protest peacefully, and go about their lives without fear of unlawful federal action," James, a Democrat, said in a statement. "We have seen in Minnesota how quickly and tragically federal operations can escalate in the absence of transparency and accountability."

A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which enforces immigration law, did not respond to a request for comment.

Trump, a Republican, has reserved his most aggressive surges in immigration enforcement for states governed by his political opponents, particularly California, Illinois and Minnesota. New York is home to one of the biggest and busiest DHS field offices, but Trump has not announced any major enforcement surge in the state.

He says the deportations of many migrants, including some who were legally admitted into the U.S., are necessary to reduce crime, although his argument is often contradicted by crime data.

In Minneapolis, residents have come out in protest, many blowing whistles and recording video as immigration agents in military-style gear roam the streets. Twice in January, immigration agents fatally shot U.S. citizens who had come out to protest or observe: Renee Good and Alex Pretti.

Minnesota's leaders have accused the Trump administration of going too far and violating the constitutional rights of both migrants and U.S. citizens, including their rights to observe and protest government actions.

In New York, small groups of legal observers are common at street protests, sometimes wearing the bright green hats of the National Lawyers Guild, focused on whether local police are violating rights or laws that protect freedom of speech.

But a formal state-organized effort to deploy legal observers to monitor federal law enforcement appears to be new. James, an outspoken foe of Trump who successfully sued him and his real estate firm for financial fraud, says she will use information gathered by the observers to decide whether to bring legal challenges.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 18:29:26 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/L2A5BZXBYVLLDCEXH6IPJUVLVA.jpg?auth=813565f365dbf6f71a785f9805167b9e240fb2e47f812b32b489dea7d11ce43a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US military says some forces have been dispatched to Nigeria</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/us-military-says-some-forces-have-been-dispatched-nigeria-2026-02-03/</link><description>DAKAR, Feb 3 - The U.S. has sent a small team of troops to Nigeria, the general in charge of the U.S. command for Africa said on Tuesday, the first acknowledgment of U.S. forces on the ground since Washington struck by air on Christmas Day.

President Donald Trump ordered airstrikes on what he described as Islamic State targets in Nigeria in December and said there could be more U.S. military action there.

Reuters earlier reported that the U.S. had been conducting surveillance flights over the country from Ghana since at least late November.

The top general said the U.S. team was sent after both countries agreed that more needed to be done to combat the terrorist threat in West Africa.

"That has led to increased collaboration between our nations to include a small US team that brings some unique capabilities from the United States," General Dagvin R.M. Anderson, head of the U.S. military's Africa Command AFRICOM, told journalists during a press briefing on Tuesday.

Anderson did not provide further details about the size and scope of their mission.

Defense Minister Christopher Musa confirmed that a team was working in Nigeria but did not provide further details.

A former U.S. official said the U.S. team appeared to be heavily involved in intelligence gathering and enabling Nigerian forces to strike terrorist-affiliated groups.

Nigeria has come under intense pressure by Washington to act after President Trump accused the West African nation of failing to protect Christians from Islamist militants operating in the northwest.

The Nigerian government denies any systematic persecution of Christians, saying it is targeting Islamist fighters and other armed groups that attack both Christian and Muslim civilians.

Boko Haram and Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) fighters have intensified attacks on military convoys and civilians, and the northwest remains the epicentre of the 17-year Islamist insurgency.

The U.S. military’s Africa Command said the strike was carried out in Sokoto state in coordination with Nigerian authorities and killed multiple ISIS militants.

The strike came after Trump in late October began warning that Christianity faces an "existential threat" in Nigeria and threatened to militarily intervene in the West African country over what he says is its failure to stop violence targeting Christian communities.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 18:29:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/VMZ4CUVL7RM45OLVKQSJMCEVCU.jpg?auth=f30556c92a1c42f3aee27a8f11225e9e7775ce863d006fab3eb9fc1d2a68d10e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ex-general quits Italy's League party, posing problem for Meloni</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/ex-general-quits-italys-league-party-posing-problem-meloni-2026-02-03/</link><description>ROME, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Former army general Roberto Vannacci quit the League group, part of Italy's governing coalition, on Tuesday to set up his own far-right party, potentially complicating Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's hopes of winning re-election next year.

Vannacci shot to prominence two years ago, promoting what he said were traditional Italian values, while disparaging LGBTQ people, migrants, minorities and feminists.

Despite being forced out of the military, League leader Matteo Salvini embraced Vannacci's values and brought him into his party, making him the deputy chief in the hope he would help revive the group's faltering movement.

However, Vannacci remained aloof from much of the League hierarchy and on Tuesday confirmed that he planned to go it alone a week after trademarking the logo for a new political group called Futuro Nazionale (National Future).

"No boxer wins a fight by throwing moderate hooks," Vannacci said on X, promising to lead an uncompromising right-wing party.

Pollsters predict he could win up to 2% of the vote, not enough to enter parliament, but possibly a decisive drain on support for Meloni and her coalition allies.

"On paper the centre-left and centre-right camps are quite close together, so taking even two percentage points away from the right could be very relevant," said Lorenzo Pregliasco, who founded the YouTrend polling firm.

The next national election is scheduled for 2027.

Salvini said he was "disappointed and bitter".

"We are used to thinking that words like honour, discipline and loyalty have a precise meaning, especially for those who have worn a uniform," Salvini wrote on X, accusing Vannacci of betraying his trust.

Salvini had hoped that bringing him into the League would broaden its appeal and halt its slide in the polls.

At first the gamble seemed to pay off: Vannacci helped the League secure a respectable 9% in the 2024 European elections, briefly silencing more moderate figures in the party who were unhappy with his outspoken views.

But instead of fusing with the League, Vannacci built his own faction within the party, held rallies outside of Salvini's control and refused to contribute to party coffers, shunning standard expectations for elected officials.

Pregliasco said he could draw away voters from both the League and also Meloni's conservative Brothers of Italy party, which has become more moderate since forming the backbone of the current government.

"My right is true, coherent, identity-driven, strong, convinced, enthusiastic, pure and contagious," Vannacci said on X.

Prosecutors allege Malami, in November 2022, knowingly abetted terrorism financing by refusing to prosecute suspected terrorism financiers whose case files were forwarded to him while he served as attorney general.

The pair pleaded not guilty and were ordered to remain in the custody of the Department of State Security ahead of commencement of trial on February 20 after rejecting an oral bail.

The arraignment adds to Malami's widening legal troubles, which include separate ongoing money‑laundering proceedings and a related asset‑forfeiture case before the Federal High Court.

In December, Malami was charged with 16 counts of money laundering and conspiracy involving billions of naira.

Defence lawyers argued the pair had already spent two weeks in detention and were brought to court from the hospital, but the judge insisted on a formal bail motion.

Prosecutors also claimed Malami and his son were found in December 2025 in possession of a firearm and cartridges without a valid licence.

These offences are punishable under provisions of Nigerian law.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 18:29:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Turkey determined to take relations with Saudi Arabia to higher level, Erdogan tells crown prince</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/turkey-determined-take-relations-with-saudi-arabia-higher-level-erdogan-tells-2026-02-03/</link><description>ANKARA, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Turkey's President Tayyip Erdogan met Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Riyadh on Tuesday and told him Turkey was determined to take relations to a higher level in areas including renewable energy and defence industry, Erdogan's office said.

Zelenskiy said Ukraine had been expected to make concessions, but it was also up to Russia to make concessions, mainly "to stop the aggression".

Details surrounding the circumstances of his death were not immediately clear.

While Saif al-Islam is well-known in the north African country, especially for his role in shaping policy before 2011, his public profile has receded in recent years.

In 2015, a Libyan court passed a death sentence in absentia on Saif al-Islam for suppressing peaceful protests during the country's 2011 revolution that ended his father's rule.

He has also been provisionally charged by the International Criminal Court for alleged crimes against humanity, a case his lawyers failed to dismiss.

In 2021, Saif al-Islam registered as a presidential candidate for a December vote that eventually collapsed amid a political deadlock.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 19:28:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/3PTZYNBD4JJTJHGGLKM6GQJ3LE.jpg?auth=d01ee0d57a7a3718c060dc2e90fef748f14f58d7856b665257f151d3fe794f61&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump's call to 'nationalize' elections draws furious pushback from Democrats</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trumps-call-nationalize-elections-draws-furious-pushback-democrats-2026-02-03/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Feb 3 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s call for Republicans to "nationalize" elections drew pushback on Tuesday from lawmakers, including from a few Republicans, as Democrats voiced fresh concern that he intends to interfere with the November midterms that will determine control of Congress.

In a podcast interview with former FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino released on Monday, Trump repeated his false claims that the 2020 election was stolen from him and said his party should “take over” and " nationalize " voting in at least 15 places, without detailing what he meant.

Under the U.S. Constitution, state governments oversee elections, not the federal government, and most contests are administered by county and local officials.

Democratic elected officials and voting rights advocates said Trump’s comments, just days after the FBI searched the election office in Fulton County, Georgia, for 2020 ballots, show he plans to try to undermine or perhaps even manipulate the results of this year’s elections.

"This is not about the 2020 election," Democratic U.S. Senator Mark Warner of Virginia said at a press conference. "This is frankly about what comes next."

The party in power has historically lost seats in midterm elections, and Democrats need to flip only three Republican-held districts in November to gain control of the U.S. House of Representatives .

A senior Republican campaign operative told Reuters that it did not appear that there was an overarching strategy behind Trump's comments, beyond an ongoing Justice Department effort to procure voter rolls from many Democratic-leaning states.

"I think this is just an idea that if we fix elections, we'll never lose," the operative said.

Lawmakers and election experts were less sanguine.

“The last time he started talking like this, his allies minimized the risks and we ended up with Jan 6,” Brendan Nyhan, a political science professor at Dartmouth College wrote on X, referring to the January 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by a mob of Trump supporters.

Democratic U.S. Senator Dick Durbin called Trump's comments "outrageous" but "not unexpected" in an X post.

"What it tells us is he’s very worried about the outcome of that election and he’s prepared to violate the most basic constitutional guarantees in America to ensure his victory," he added.

Trump has often expressed a desire to overhaul the country’s elections, based on false conspiracy theories that his loss in 2020 to Democrat Joe Biden was fueled by fraud. He has called for mail-in ballots to be outlawed, questioned the security of voting machines and claimed falsely that millions of non-citizens regularly cast ballots.

The two top congressional Republicans, House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, did not offer support for taking over elections but defended Trump’s demands that voters provide proof of U.S. citizenship and photo identification.

Thune told reporters on Tuesday he was “not in favor of federalizing elections.”

“I'm a big believer in decentralized and distributed power,” he said. “It's harder to hack 50 election systems than it is to hack one.”

Johnson said it was not necessary to take over elections in some states, but argued that Trump’s concerns about election integrity were justified.

Some hardline Republicans briefly threatened on Tuesday to block a deal to end a partial government shutdown unless the bill includes citizenship and voter ID provisions.

Last week, the FBI executed a search warrant for 2020 ballots in Fulton County, Georgia, a central battleground in Trump’s unsuccessful effort that year to remain in power, which will also host one of the most competitive Senate races this year . The county district attorney’s office charged Trump with election interference in 2023, though the case was dropped in November, a year after Trump won his second term in office.

Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, appeared in Georgia alongside the FBI, alarming Democratic lawmakers. It’s highly unusual for the director of national intelligence to be involved in operations involving domestic elections, particularly if there is no clear foreign nexus.

Warner, who co-chairs the Senate intelligence committee, has said the Office of the Director of National Intelligence has not alerted Congress to any foreign threats to election infrastructure.

Gabbard's presence in Georgia "under a thin veil of legitimacy" raised "serious legal and constitutional questions and politicizes an institution that must remain neutral and apolitical," Warner said on Tuesday.

Gabbard said in a letter to Warner and Congressman Jim Himes, the Democratic co-chair of the House intelligence committee, that Trump had requested her presence at the FBI raid last week. She also said she has the legal authority to coordinate and analyze election security matters.

In April, Gabbard said at a cabinet meeting that her office was investigating election integrity issues, asserting there was evidence that electronic voting systems are “vulnerable to exploitation to manipulate the votes being cast.”</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 19:28:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5JYIY6GU6ZPVTGGWSVAEUNQ63I.jpg?auth=ce1103a31310c584d001b876ed9b03f5d75e39dfbfc50020fad44f30d232a86e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UK police confirm investigation into Mandelson over Epstein leaks</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-police-confirm-investigation-into-mandelson-over-epstein-leaks-2026-02-03/</link><description>LONDON, Feb 3 (Reuters) - British police said on Tuesday they have launched an investigation into Peter Mandelson, Britain's former ambassador to the U.S., over alleged misconduct in public office following the release of millions of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein.

Islamabad would join a small group of countries with a diplomatic presence in Benghazi, in a move that could boost eastern authorities in their rivalry with Libya's west.

Libya descended into turmoil after a 2011 NATO-backed uprising toppled Muammar Gaddafi and has been divided into eastern and western authorities since a 2014 civil war. The U.N.-recognised government in Tripoli controls the west, while LNA leader Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar's forces based in Benghazi hold the east and south, including major oilfields.

Haftar discussed the consulate with officials during an ongoing visit to Pakistan, the sources said.

He met Pakistan's army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir in Rawalpindi on Monday to discuss "professional cooperation", the Pakistani military said.

On Tuesday, Haftar and his son Saddam met Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to discuss "ways to enhance bilateral cooperation across various fields, in addition to addressing regional and international issues of mutual interest," the LNA's media office said in a statement.

The department previously said Haftar met senior Pakistani army officials "within the framework of strengthening bilateral relations". It did not give further details and Reuters could not immediately reach eastern Libyan authorities for comment.

Pakistan's prime minister's office and foreign ministry did not respond to requests for comment.

Pakistan's air force said in a statement that Saddam Khalifa Haftar met Air Chief Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu to discuss expanding defence cooperation, including joint training, with Islamabad reaffirming its support for the "capability development" of the Libyan air force.

Pakistan's army chief visited Benghazi in December, where he signed a multibillion-dollar defence deal with the LNA, previously reported by Reuters.

All three sources, who declined to be identified because they were not authorised to speak to the media, said the decision to open a consulate in Benghazi was linked to the $4 billion defence deal, one of Pakistan's largest-ever arms sales.

Libya has been under a U.N. arms embargo since 2011, although U.N. experts have said it is ineffective. Pakistani officials involved in the December deal said it did not violate U.N. restrictions.

Haftar has historically been an ally of the UAE, which supported him with air power and viewed him as a bulwark against Islamists, while Pakistan - the only nuclear-armed Muslim-majority nation - signed a wide-ranging mutual defence pact with Saudi Arabia late last year.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 19:28:42 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UAE pledges $500 million for Sudan aid as Washington gathers donors</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/uae-pledges-500-million-for-sudan-aid-washington-gathers-donors-2026-02-03/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Feb 3 - The United Arab Emirates on Tuesday pledged to donate $500 million to a U.N. fund for humanitarian aid for Sudan, amid a U.S. push to renew efforts towards a truce in the conflict that has devastated the country.

Sudan has accused the UAE of arming the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) which have been fighting the Sudanese army in the civil war that broke out in April 2023 - a charge the UAE denies but U.N. experts and U.S. lawmakers have found credible.

Speaking at a donor event in Washington, UAE state minister Lana Nusseibeh said her country wanted to see a truce in the conflict, without referring to her country’s alleged support for the RSF.

Nusseibeh has previously said the UAE condemns violations by both warring parties and wants to see an independent, civilian-led government in Sudan.

The U.S. special envoy for Africa, Massad Boulos, said he expected a total of $1.5 billion of new funding to be pledged at the Washington event, including an additional $200 million for Sudan from the United States. Other states represented at the event did not make clear promises of new aid.

The conflict in Sudan has killed tens of thousands of people, displaced millions and spread famine across the vast country. Fighting has raged in several areas in the past few months, with the latest frontline in the southern Kordofan region, where the army has claimed progress in recent days.

Boulos said Washington was pushing for a truce to be agreed upon by the parties in Sudan ahead of the start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan on February 17.

Boulos admitted that progress had been disappointing since President Donald Trump in November said he would intervene to stop the conflict at the request of Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

“We would have hoped to achieve peace much, much earlier,” said Boulos. “We’ve amplified our efforts and yet we haven’t really achieved that much yet, in terms of the humanitarian truce, which was the first item on the milestone roadmap.”

Officials from Egypt and Saudi Arabia would meet U.S. and UAE officials as part of a so-called Quad grouping that is working on a U.S. peace proposal, Boulos said, adding that the text of a peace plan had been accepted by those parties.

The warring parties themselves are yet to agree to a temporary truce or to the U.S. peace plan, but Boulos said he hoped it would ultimately be presented to the U.N. Security Council and then to Trump’s Board of Peace .</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 19:28:48 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/IR2CTH3T2NPBPK3AXGYAQGWUMM.jpg?auth=c49ece88623d7a1305ea6a911017f4a79efefb7c69096bc8881e40772fbf3b97&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>French prosecutors seek 5-year ban from office for far-right leader Marine Le Pen in appeal trial</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260203-french-prosecutors-seek-5-year-ban-from-office-for-far-right-leader-marine-le-pen-in-appeal-trial-no-immediate-enforcement</link><description>French prosecutors on Tuesday demanded that an appeal court maintain a five-year ban on far-right leader Marine Le Pen from holding public office over an EU parliament fake jobs scandal . They did not ‌request an immediate ‍enforcement of the sentence.

A lower court last year banned Le Pen, a three-time presidential candidate, from running for office for five years, in a bombshell ruling that has thrown her 2027 presidential run into jeopardy.

She is hoping to beat that ruling on appeal, but prosecutors are pushing for bans on holding public office over a fake jobs scam at the European Parliament – an accusation the 57-year-old far-right leader denies.

"We are going to ask you to largely uphold the criminal liability established in the initial trial , and ineligibility sentences will of course be sought," prosecutor Thierry Ramonatxo told a Paris court.

Le Pen, her National Rally party and 11 others are appealing the ruling by the lower court, which also sentenced her to four years in jail, including two suspended, and fined her €100,000 ($116,000).

The first trial found Le Pen, along with 24 former European Parliament lawmakers, assistants and accountants as well as the party itself, guilty of operating a "system" from 2004 to 2016 that used European Parliament funds to employ National Rally staff in France.

Not all of those convicted have appealed.

The prosecutor's office had requested bans from public office ranging from one to five years for Le Pen and 23 others in the initial trial.

The lower court ordered that Le Pen's office ban take effect immediately – not waiting for her appeal – and also handed bans to other defendants.

During the appeal trial from mid-January, Le Pen denied the National Rally had any "system" to embezzle European Parliament funds and said her party acted in "complete good faith".

The appeal trial wraps up this month. A verdict is expected this summer.

If the court upholds the first ruling, Le Pen will be prevented from running in the 2027 French presidential election, widely seen as her best chance to win the country's top job after several failed attempts.

She made it to the second round in the 2017 and 2022 presidential polls, before losing to Emmanuel Macron , who cannot run again next year after having held two consecutive terms in office.

Le Pen now again risks the maximum sentence of 10 years in prison and a €1 million ($1.16-million) fine if the appeal fails.

She is hoping to be acquitted – or at least for a shorter election ban and no time under house arrest.

Ramonatxo, the prosecutor, pushed back at claims last year that the judiciary had in any way aimed to "block a party leader's ascent to the highest executive office".

"To suggest that the judiciary could oppose the will of the sovereign people is inaccurate," he said.

"A judge is the guardian of the law and merely applies it."

A court in April handed down an eight-month suspended sentence to a 76-year-old man over a death threat against the judge who convicted Le Pen.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 19:29:02 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/ade13b5c-010d-11f1-bb89-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-02-03T075206Z-1490315012-RC26EJA9HALW-RTRMADP-3-FRANCE-POLITICS-LE-PEN.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Two dead, eight injured in strike on Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/two-dead-eight-injured-strike-ukraines-zaporizhzhia-2026-02-03/</link><description>Feb 3 (Reuters) - A Russian drone attack killed two people aged 18 and injured nine other people on Tuesday in the southeastern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia, the regional governor said.

In a meeting with the U.S. envoy, Netanyahu "made clear his position that Iran has repeatedly proven that its promises cannot be trusted," a statement from his office said.

Two Israeli officials said the meeting was also attended by Israel's spy agency head David Barnea, Defense Minister Israel Katz and military commander Eyal Zamir.

Iranian sources told Reuters last week that Trump had set three conditions for resumption of talks: Zero enrichment of uranium in Iran; limits on Tehran's ballistic missile programme; and ending its support for regional proxies, which align with longstanding Israeli demands.

Iran has long said all three demands are unacceptable infringements of its sovereignty, but two Iranian officials told Reuters its clerical rulers saw the ballistic missile programme, rather than uranium enrichment, as the bigger obstacle.

Iran and the United States will resume nuclear talks on Friday in Turkey. U.S. President Donald Trump has warned that with U.S. warships heading to Iran, bad things would probably happen if a deal could not be reached.

Tensions between Tehran and Washington are running high and the arrival of a U.S. aircraft carrier and supporting warships in the Middle East has expanded Trump's ability to take military action if he so wishes, after repeatedly threatening intervention over Iran's bloody crackdown.

During the early January protests, witnesses and rights groups said, security forces crushed demonstrations with lethal force, leaving thousands dead and many wounded. Tehran blamed the violence on "armed terrorists" linked to Israel and the U.S.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 20:02:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LI2WOKX3DJIIBIPKKGEWW4YZDM.jpg?auth=7959ec3bc0c5403da91cdb036d7b34dcbd134c011ed63af4d76a21c054ddf2d5&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Colombia's Petro says discussed Venezuelan gas, fight against drugs with Trump</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/colombias-petro-says-discussed-venezuelan-gas-fight-against-drugs-with-trump-2026-02-03/</link><description>BOGOTA, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Colombian President Gustavo Petro told local radio station Caracol on Tuesday that he and his U.S. counterpart Donald Trump had discussed the possibility of exporting Venezuelan gas via Colombia, the fight against drug trafficking and Colombia's trade and drugs spat with Ecuador at a White House meeting.

The two men have clashed since Trump began his current term, with the U.S. leader repeatedly accusing Petro's administration, without evidence, of enabling a steady flow of cocaine into the U.S., imposing sanctions on the Colombian leader and threatening military action against the South American country. Petro, in turn, has harshly critiqued U.S. support for Israel and called for criminal proceedings over U.S. missile attacks on suspected drug-running boats in the Caribbean.

But the relationship seemed to thaw last month and photos posted on X by Petro suggested their meeting had been cordial. They discussed the eradication - but not aerial fumigation - of coca crops, Petro said, and he asked Trump to help capture major drug traffickers living internationally and to mediate tensions with Ecuador's President Daniel Noboa.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 21:02:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/S6PPWNTNVZLMHC2HAO47LRQ7VY.jpg?auth=7d553caf539281bc26f74776c897ca510f37bac8f828051df86aebd96a669954&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, son of Libya's late dictator, killed in the northern African country, report say</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/africa/20260203-seif-al-islam-gaddafi-son-of-libya-s-late-dictator-killed-in-the-northern-african-country-report-say</link><description>Saif al-Islam Gaddafi , the son of Libya 's late long-time ruler, has died, relatives reported on Tuesday, without providing details on his death.

His adviser, Abdallah Othman Abdurrahim, confirmed his death in a social media post, without giving details.

"Seif al-Islam has fallen as a martyr," his cousin, Hamid Kadhafi, told Libyan network al-Ahrar, adding that the family had no further details.

Abdullah Othman Abdurrahim told al-Ahrar TV channel that Seif al-Islam was killed in his house by a group of four unidentified men. "Four armed men stormed the residence of Seif al-Islam Kadhafi after disabling surveillance cameras, then executed him," Abdurrahim was reported as saying.

Media outlets said he had died in Zintan, in northwestern Libya , although his whereabouts had long been unknown.

Hamid Kadhafi, his cousin, told al-Ahrar TV he had "fallen as a martyr".

Seif al-Islam, 53, had been seen as his father's successor. In 2021, he announced he would run for president, but those elections were indefinitely postponed.

While he held no official position in the North African country under his father's rule, he had been described as Libya's de facto prime minister, cultivating an image of moderation and reform prior to the 2011 Arab Spring revolt.

But that reputation soon collapsed when he promised "rivers of blood" in the face of the uprisings.

He was arrested in November 2011 in southern Libya following a warrant by the International Criminal Court ( ICC ).

He was sentenced to death in 2015 after a speedy trial but was granted amnesty.

Libya expert Emadeddin Badi said Seif al-Islam's death was "likely to cast him as a martyr for a significant segment of the population, while also shifting electoral dynamics by removing a major obstacle to presidential elections ".

"His candidacy and potential success had been a central point of contention," Badi wrote on X.

Muammar Gaddafi's last spokesman, Moussa Ibrahim, also posted on the social network: "They killed him treacherously. He wanted a united, sovereign Libya, safe for all its people."

"I spoke with him two days ago. He spoke of nothing but a peaceful Libya and the safety of its people."

Libya has struggled to recover from chaos that erupted after a NATO-backed uprising in 2011 overthrew long-time ruler Muammar Gaddafi.

Libya remains divided between a UN-backed government based in Tripoli and an eastern administration backed by Haftar.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 21:03:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/b182e38e-013d-11f1-892a-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/AP21348664966656-1.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UK's Starmer discussed Ukraine in call with Trump, British government says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/uks-starmer-discussed-ukraine-call-with-trump-british-government-says-2026-02-03/</link><description>Feb 3 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Keir Starmer spoke to U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday and discussed the situation in Ukraine, including the overnight Russian attacks on the country, the UK government said.

A coastguard official said they spotted a dingy transporting migrants towards Chios, which lies a few miles off the coast of Turkey, and ordered them to turn back.

"The smugglers manoeuvred toward the coast guard vessel causing a collision
 ," the official told Reuters.

Reuters was unable to independently verify how exactly the collision occurred. The nationality of the migrants was not clear.

Two coast guard officers were injured and transferred to hospital and 24 migrants have been rescued, a second official told Reuters. Witnesses reported that about 30-35 people were on board, a government official said.

The coast guard said that a search and rescue was underway with coast guard vessels, private boats and divers assisting the operation.

Greece, in the southeast corner of the European Union, has long been a favoured gateway to Europe for migrants and refugees from the Middle East, Africa and Asia.

In 2015-2016, Greece was at the frontline of Europe's migration crisis and nearly one million people landed on its islands, including Chios, from Turkey.

In recent years, arrivals have dropped and Greece has toughened its stance on migrants. Since 2019, the centre-right government has reinforced border controls with fences and sea patrols.

Greece has come under scrutiny for its treatment of migrants and refugees approaching by sea, including one shipwreck in 2023 in which hundreds of migrants died after what witnesses said was the coastguard’s attempt to tow their trawler.

The EU border agency said last year that it was reviewing 12 cases of potential human rights violations by Greece, including some allegations migrants seeking asylum were pushed back from Greece's frontiers.

Greece denies that it violates human rights or that it forcefully returns asylum seekers from its shores.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 21:58:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Exclusive: US authorizes US diluent supply to Venezuela oil sector</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/us-treasury-issues-license-authorizing-us-diluent-supply-venezuela-official-says-2026-02-03/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Feb 3 (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department on Tuesday issued a new license authorizing the export and sale to Venezuela of U.S. diluents, a key fuel needed to produce exportable crude oil grades in the OPEC country, according to a document shown to Reuters by an administration official.

The authorization, which is Washington's second general license granted so far to ease sanctions on Venezuela following the U.S. capture of President Nicolas Maduro last month, supports the administration's policy of recovering Venezuela's oil sector, the document says.

It expressly authorizes processing of payments from Venezuela's government for the authorized transactions.

The government of Tshopo province, where Kisangani is located, said in a statement on Sunday that eight explosive‑laden drones had targeted the airport serving Kisangani.

The airport lies about 17 km from central Kisangani, hundreds of kilometres from the front lines in North and South Kivu provinces, where AFC/M23 has seized large swathes of territory since 2022, capturing the key cities of Goma and Bukavu in a lightning offensive last year.

In a post on X, Corneille Nangaa, who leads the AFC, said the attack demonstrated that Congo's military no longer had air superiority.

"The use of Kisangani as a platform for projecting terror against our territories is now prohibited. The sanctuary of this rear base is over," he said.

Congo's military has not responded to requests for comment on the attacks.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 23:29:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/RCAYVU7HWNLTBJ3Z2CP366XQC4.jpg?auth=361cf8f1d05e4abbeec7587f36bc41a99a097265cfe31b3b9f8519d39ca297e6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump tells Minnesota to help more with US immigration enforcement. What does it already do?</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/trump-tells-minnesota-help-more-with-us-immigration-enforcement-what-does-it-2026-02-03/</link><description>Feb 3 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump says he wants more help from Minnesota with enforcing federal immigration laws. Minnesota says its state-run prison system has long cooperated with federal immigration agents, to the maximum extent required and allowed by law. So do many sheriff-run county jails.

Trump administration officials have said the deployment of thousands of armed agents into Minnesota's cities to deport migrants would continue if they do not get more cooperation from state and local officials. The agents have fatally shot two U.S. citizens in Minneapolis who were observing or protesting the surge, sparking angry demonstrations across the country.

Here is where Minnesota cooperates with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, where it does not, and how it says constitutional rights limit giving the Trump administration what it is seeking.

Tom Homan, the White House "border czar" dispatched by Trump in late January to Minnesota, puts it in simple terms: "Let us in the damn jail." ICE has long sought greater access to migrants in local jails and state prisons across the U.S., including those under a deportation order by the federal government.

When ICE learns that a migrant it is seeking to deport is in state, county or local custody, it often sends over a written "detainer request" form, asking that the jail or prison hold onto the migrant for up to 48 extra hours past when they would have otherwise been released.

Anyone convicted of a serious crime under Minnesota law is almost certain to serve their sentence in the prison system run by the state's Department of Corrections, which in January created a "Combating DHS Misinformation" section , opens new tab on its website, referring to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, under which ICE falls.

The DOC says it has long cooperated with ICE, and abides by state law , opens new tab that requires it to notify ICE each time it takes into custody someone convicted of a felony who is not a U.S. citizen, even if ICE has not yet sent a detainer request. As of early February, there were about 8,000 people in DOC prisons, of whom around 380 were not U.S. citizens, according to the department.

The DOC says it always cooperates with ICE detainer requests, working with ICE agents ahead of the prisoner's release date at the end of their state custodial sentence to arrange a transfer to federal custody. In 2025, this successfully happened with all 84 state prisoners sought by ICE, the department says.

Minnesota's jails are generally run by elected county sheriffs and house a much more rapidly shifting population than the state prisons: people who have been arrested but not yet charged, people accused of a crime who are being prosecuted but not yet convicted, and people who are serving short sentences for minor crimes, such as drunk-driving or low-value shoplifting.

Some sheriffs cooperate with ICE in a similar manner as the state prison system: sheriffs in seven of Minnesota's 87 counties have signed formal cooperation agreements , opens new tab with ICE. Others say cooperation can undermine public safety if immigrants who are victims of or witnesses to crimes are afraid to come forward.

The Hennepin County sheriff's office, which runs Minneapolis' main jail, used to let ICE agents in to interview people in its custody. That ended in 2018, after the election of a new sheriff with a policy of not cooperating, which has been carried on by the present sheriff, Dawanna Witt, who was elected in 2022.

Under the U.S. Constitution's Tenth Amendment, the federal government cannot command state officers to help it enforce federal laws, a violation of state sovereignty. But it can ask the states to volunteer their assistance.

In 2025, Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison told state prosecutors in an advisory opinion , opens new tab that "Minnesota law prohibits state and local law enforcement agencies from holding someone based on an immigration detainer if the person would otherwise be released from custody."

Detaining someone for up to 48 hours is an arrest like any other, Ellison wrote, and neither Minnesota nor federal law gives local officials the authority to make an arrest based on a request by another agency without a judge-signed arrest warrant.

He cited a 2019 ruling by the Minnesota Court of Appeals, Esparza v. Nobles County, that found that a sheriff continuing to detain someone after they were free to go under state law was likely unconstitutional.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 23:30:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/6LAYQ4U4VNK2FFO4W3RTXMDRXI.jpg?auth=24cfc9a24f3c7c8307e48bac458518b4ea0aac6e454de12974e0793719b3b754&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Petro and Trump strike conciliatory tone after year of tensions</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260203-petro-and-trump-strike-conciliatory-tone-after-year-of-tensions</link><description>Colombian President Gustavo Petro and US President Donald Trump appeared to bury the hatchet on Tuesday after a year of sparring that culminated in threats by Trump to topple the left-wing leader as he did in Venezuela .

“My impression of the meeting a few hours ago is first and foremost that it was positive,” Petro told reporters after meeting Trump at the White House behind closed doors.

Trump said he “got along very well” with the leader whom he recently accused of pumping cocaine into the United States and had warned to “watch his ass” after the fall of Venezuela’s Nicolas Maduro .

“He and I weren’t exactly the best of friends, but I wasn’t insulted because I never met him. I didn’t know him at all, and we got along very well,” Trump said at the White House hours after the talks ended.

Trump said the two countries were “working on” anti-drug trafficking cooperation, as well as on lifting US sanctions the Republican had imposed on the South American country.

Fears in Bogota that Petro could be subjected to one of Trump’s famously fiery televised Oval Office confrontations were dispelled when reporters were kept out.

Instead, it was Petro and his office who posted a series of pictures of the meeting.

“You are great,” Trump wrote to Petro as he signed a copy of his 1987 book Art of the Deal , according to the photos.

Despite being worlds apart politically, the Colombian returned praise for the 79-year-old US leader.

“The truth is I like straightforward Americans, people who say what they feel. We’re different, undoubtedly, by a lot. But frankness comes first,” he said.

The two leaders reclined in gold chairs in the Oval Office as they talked, accompanied by US Vice President JD Vance , Secretary of State Marco Rubio and senior Colombian officials, according to photos released by Petro’s office.

They also shared a warm handshake in the West Wing colonnade, next to portraits of former US presidents that Trump recently installed, along with unflattering biographies of some of his recent predecessors.

Petro also said after the meeting that Trump had agreed to mediate Colombia ’s trade war with Ecuador .

The South American neighbours have imposed import tariffs of 30 per cent on one another in a dispute over how to tackle drug trafficking – also a major political issue for Trump.

It was a far cry from the previous harsh rhetoric between a pair who come from absolute opposite ends of the political spectrum.

The Colombian had repeatedly defended Venezuela’s leader Nicolas Maduro, a fellow left-winger, before his capture by US forces on January 3. He also criticised deadly US air strikes on alleged drug trafficking boats.

Trump, meanwhile, has been pressing Colombia to crack down on drug trafficking, threatening military strikes on its territory as he had against both Venezuela and Mexico .

After the Maduro raid, an emboldened Trump stepped up his barbs, saying a Venezuela-style action against Petro “sounds good to me”.

But things turned a corner after an unexpectedly warm phone call on January 7.

“I mean, he’s been very nice over the last month or two,” Trump said on Monday on the eve of the visit. “He was certainly critical before that, but somehow, after the Venezuelan raid, he became very nice.”

Petro said on X shortly before the meeting that during the talks he was “determined to continue strengthening the relationship between two nations that share a common goal: the fight against drug trafficking”.

In an apparent reference to strikes on drug boats in the Caribbean and Pacific that have killed more than 100 people, he added that he wanted to do so “from an approach that prioritises life and peace in our territories”.

In an olive branch to Trump hours before their talks, Petro extradited an accused drug lord to the United States after a months-long suspension of such transfers.

Colombia also abruptly agreed on Friday to accept US deportation flights – reversing the very decision that triggered the falling-out between Trump and Petro last year.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 23:31:10 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/7250c52a-0122-11f1-ad81-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/HAP43fCWUAA2Ufr.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Lula tribute at Rio Carnival stirs political controversy ahead of elections</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260203-lula-tribute-at-rio-carnival-stirs-political-controversy-ahead-of-elections</link><description>The face of the Brazilian president is omnipresent as a samba school rehearses its Carnival parade in front of thousands of spectators chanting the refrain of its theme song: “Ole, ole, ole, ola; Lula, Lula!”

The decision by samba school Academicos de Niteroi to pay homage to veteran leftist President Inacio Lula da Silva at this year’s Carnival extravaganza has raised eyebrows just eight months before elections.

Academicos de Niteroi will be the first to parade down Rio de Janeiro ’s Sambodrome on February 15, at the start of the three-day competition that is the peak of the city’s annual Carnival festivities.

Twelve samba schools will compete in parades featuring thousands of participants, with colossal, often animated floats, booming drum sections, and dancers draped in little more than beads and glitter.

Each year the schools choose a theme linked to Brazilian culture, history, or popular figures.

While Academicos argues it wants to honour Lula to thank him for his social welfare policies, the opposition has denounced the parade as equivalent to a campaign event months before official campaigning begins in August.

Lula, 80, who is expected to attend the parade as a spectator, is seeking a fourth term in the October elections .

“This is not propaganda , it’s a tribute. Many people in our school were able to get an education thanks to the president’s public policies,” Hamilton Junior, one of the school’s directors, told AFP.

Junior said it was the story of a man from Brazil ’s poor north-east who “faced many hardships and became one of Brazil’s greatest presidents”.

During technical rehearsals at the Sambodrome – which draw large crowds – dancers dressed as steelworkers in reference to Lula’s past occupation.

The lyrics of the song recount Lula’s poor childhood in rural Pernambuco, his move to Sao Paulo, his union activism , and social policies implemented under his different administrations.

There is no mention of the October election, but the song does not shy away from Brazil’s current political scene .

It refers to “ tariffs and sanctions” imposed by US President Donald Trump to punish Brazil for putting his ally, former far-right leader Jair Bolsonaro , on trial for plotting a coup.

Trump has since lifted many of these measures.

The song also includes the phrase “no amnesty”, a nod to efforts by Bolsonaro’s supporters to reduce a 27-year prison sentence he began serving in November.

A large screen mounted on the back of a truck displayed images mocking Bolsonaro – showing him in a prison uniform or with blood-stained hands, a reference to his Covid scepticism.

Bolsonaro has anointed his eldest son, Senator Flavio Bolsonaro, as his political heir and presidential candidate.

One of the composers of the samba told local media that Lula had cried when Academicos leaders travelled to Brasilia last year to play the song for him.

Centre-right lawmaker Kim Kataguiri filed a lawsuit demanding Academicos return the one million reais ($180,000) each of the 12 schools receives in federal funding for the parade.

“It is unacceptable that the president sends one million reais, and even worse in an election year, to a samba school to celebrate a festival whose main theme is the president himself,” Kataguiri told AFP on Tuesday.

Lawmakers from the right-wing Partido Novo asked Brazil’s Federal Court of Auditors to block the funding.

A senator allied with Bolsonaro demanded that the courts prohibit the television broadcast of the parade.

The Brazilian agency for the promotion of international tourism, Embratur, which provides the funds, said in a statement that it “respects the artistic autonomy and freedom of expression of the samba schools”.

Watching the rehearsal, Adriano Santos, a 43-year-old social worker from the Rocinha favela, said the samba school was “being brave, innovative”.

“There will be those who like it and those who don’t, but I believe this parade will represent Brazil.”</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 23:31:12 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/2cf2f05e-eca8-11f0-be23-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-08T145548Z-254263623-RC22XIAG0K49-RTRMADP-3-BRAZIL-POLITICS-LULA.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump signs $1.2 trillion funding bill, ending government shutdown</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260203-trump-ends-government-shutdown</link><description>US President Donald Trump signed a roughly $1.2 trillion government funding bill on Tuesday, ending a partial federal shutdown that began over the weekend and setting the stage for an intense debate in Congress over Homeland Security funding.

The president moved quickly to sign the bill after the House approved it by a 217–214 vote.

“This bill is a great victory for the American people,” Trump said.

Tuesday’s vote wrapped up congressional work on 11 annual appropriations bills that fund government agencies and programmes through September 30, ending the partial government shutdown that began on Saturday.

Passage of the legislation marked the end of one funding fight, but the start of another. That is because the package funds the Department of Homeland Security for only two weeks, through February 13, at the behest of Democrats who are demanding tighter restrictions on immigration enforcement after the shooting deaths of Alex Pretti and Renee Good by federal officers in Minneapolis .

Difficult negotiations lie ahead, particularly for the agency that enforces the nation’s immigration laws – US Immigration and Customs Enforcement , or ICE.

House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries quickly warned that Democrats would not support any further temporary funding for Homeland Security without substantial changes to its immigration operations, raising the potential of another shutdown for the department and its agencies.

“We need dramatic change in order to make sure that ICE and other agencies within the Department of Homeland Security are conducting themselves like every other law enforcement organisation in the country,” Jeffries said.

House Speaker Mike Johnson said he expects the two sides will be able to reach an agreement by the deadline.

“This is no time to play games with that funding. We hope that they will operate in good faith over the next 10 days as we negotiate this,” Johnson said. “The president, again, has reached out.”

But Johnson’s counterpart across the Capitol, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R–S.D., sounded less optimistic. “There’s always miracles, right?” Thune told reporters.

The funding bill that cleared Congress on Tuesday contained provisions that appealed to both parties.

Republicans avoided a massive catch-all funding bill known as an omnibus as part of this year’s appropriations process. Such bills, often taken up before the holiday season with lawmakers anxious to return home, have contributed to higher federal spending, they say.

Democrats were able to fend off some of Trump’s most draconian proposed cuts while adding language to help ensure funds are spent as stipulated by Congress.

Still, Johnson needed near-unanimous support from his Republican conference to proceed to a final vote. He narrowly secured it during a roll call that was held open for nearly an hour as leaders worked to gain backing from a handful of GOP lawmakers seeking to advance unrelated priorities.

The final vote was not much easier for Republican leaders. In the end, 21 Republicans joined the vast majority of Democrats in voting against the bill, while the same number of Democrats sided with most Republicans in voting in favour.

Trump weighed in on Monday in a social media post, urging Republicans to stay united and telling holdouts: “There can be NO CHANGES at this time.”

The partial shutdown that is now ending differed in many ways from the autumn impasse, which affected more agencies and lasted a record 43 days.

That earlier standoff centred on extending temporary coronavirus pandemic-era subsidies for people receiving health coverage through the Affordable Care Act. Democrats were unsuccessful in securing their inclusion in the deal to end that shutdown.

Congress has since made progress. Some of the six appropriations bills passed before Tuesday ensured the current shutdown had less impact. Key programmes such as nutrition assistance and fully operating national parks and historic sites were already funded through September 30.

The remaining bills passed on Tuesday mean the vast majority of the federal government is now funded.

“You might say that now that 96 per cent of the government is funded, it’s just 4 per cent that’s outstanding,” Johnson said. “But it’s a very important 4 per cent.”</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 23:58:03 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/20301b28-0119-11f1-b2fd-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-02-03T011157Z-247941225-RC2YDJA2NHUU-RTRMADP-3-USA-CONGRESS-TEXAS-HOUSE.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Thailand's ex-PM Abhisit returns to political fray in boost for his party</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/thailands-ex-pm-abhisit-returns-political-fray-boost-his-party-2026-02-04/</link><description>BANGKOK, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Passersby stopped Thailand's former Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva every now and again to ask for selfies as the salt-and-pepper-haired leader walked through a bustling market in Bangkok, campaigning for general elections on February 8 .

"Good to see you again, still handsome just like before," said one noodle vendor, reflecting voters' persisting warm feelings for the Oxford-trained economist, who is making an unexpected comeback to frontline politics.

Abhisit's return has fuelled a revival of his Democrat Party, reshaping an electoral contest that formerly looked like a three-way tussle among the ruling Bhumjaithai Party, the progressive People's Party and the populist Pheu Thai Party .

"I just want to offer a choice and revive the party," Abhisit, 61, told Reuters, as he strolled down a major road in the capital, greeting office workers on lunch breaks.

"Every time I meet people, they are frustrated with the lack of choice."

Government employee Yuttapum Rattanamanee, a voter in the northeast, said he was one of four in his family backing the Democrats again because Abhisit came back to lead the party.

"When Abhisit left, the party lost its power because people no longer trusted the leadership," the 37-year-old added. "Abhisit is capable, competent and honest."

Thailand's oldest political party, the Democrats had long dominated the south and Bangkok, before sliding into decline after a military coup in 2014.

Despite the goodwill, Abhisit is unlikely to get enough support to become prime minister , a survey showed last week.

But he has helped his party win back conservative voters after years of lacklustre efforts, said Olarn Thinbangtieo, a political scientist at Burapha University.

"Its earlier decline came from leadership that drifted away from the party's principles," Olarn added. "His return has lifted support."

As prime minister from 2008 to 2011, Abhisit faced prolonged street protests by the "Red Shirt" populist movement backed by former premier Thaksin Shinawatra, who also founded Pheu Thai.

In 2010, he ordered a military crackdown on demonstrations in central Bangkok that killed 90, a toll rights groups blamed on "excessive and unnecessary lethal force" used by security forces seeking to restore order.

But Thai courts dismissed all the criminal cases faced by Abhisit and senior officials, with no convictions.

Abhisit stepped away from politics after the Democrats won just 52 of 500 seats up for grabs in the 2019 general election. In 2023, the party slid further, clinching just 25 seats.

Now the Democrats are resurgent, opinion polls largely driven by Abhisit's personal appeal show.

A survey by the National Institute of Development Administration (NIDA) ranked Abhisit third among likely prime ministerial candidates last week, while his Democrat Party took fourth place overall.

That suggests the party could emerge as a pivotal force in talks to form a coalition after an election that is expected to give no single party an outright majority.

The Democrats' gains could come at the expense of the ruling Bhumjaithai, splitting conservative and older voters nationwide, Olarn added.

Nevertheless, the NIDA survey put Abhisit a distant third to be prime minister, after frontrunner People's Party leader Natthaphong Ruengpanyawut and second-ranked Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul

FLOOD-HIT SOUTH

Much of Abhisit's support comes from his party's traditional southern heartland, parts of which were ravaged by catastrophic floods in November, killing 145 in nine provinces.

In the key province of Songkhla, swamped by its highest single-day rainfall in 300 years, a January survey showed Abhisit as the top choice for premier, well ahead of the incumbent Anutin.

"It suggests that southern people are coming back, warming to us," Abhisit added.

But winning in the capital, Thailand's single largest electoral block with 33 seats and 4.5 million voters, which was almost entirely swept by a predecessor of the People's Party in 2023, will be a tough task for the Democrats, he said.

"Ideally, we would have liked more preparation," Abhisit said, referring to the party's campaign in Bangkok.

The snap elections came after Anutin dissolved parliament in December, in the midst of a fierce border conflict with neighbouring Cambodia, which analysts said was timed to help the ruling party ride a wave of heightening nationalism .

Yet the current campaign is not solely based on nostalgia for Abhisit, who became prime minister aged 44, after a youthful start as a member of parliament at 27.

"It's about transforming the party as well as reviving it," he said. "We're bringing back the principles people once supported us for."</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 02:04:44 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/47P3VPHUP5JWPDKJOHGG42MQCI.jpg?auth=8ca8eb35b934b14163353bedaf6b1cc7443f2828f5c874e8d33fa08086f1ddc8&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UK police launch investigation into Mandelson over Epstein leaks</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/starmers-government-aids-police-probe-into-mandelsons-epstein-leaks-2026-02-03/</link><description>LONDON, Feb 3 (Reuters) - British police on Tuesday launched an investigation into Peter Mandelson, Britain's former ambassador to the U.S., over alleged misconduct in public office, following claims that he leaked market-sensitive information to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

London's Metropolitan Police said in a statement that the investigation follows the receipt of reports alleging misconduct in public office, including a referral from the British government.

Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government handed material to the police to investigate whether Mandelson leaked information to Epstein during the financial crash.

Starmer told his ministers on Tuesday that Mandelson's alleged leaks to Epstein were "disgraceful." A few hours later, Mandelson said he would retire from parliament's upper house, the House of Lords.

"The Met will continue to assess all relevant information brought to our attention as part of this investigation and won't be commenting any further at this time," Police Commander Ella Marriott said.

Separately, Thames Valley Police said in a statement they were reviewing a new claim against the former Prince Andrew.

Mandelson, a major player in the Labour governments of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown more than two decades ago, is facing possible criminal charges after emails released by the U.S. as part of the Epstein investigation suggested he had leaked confidential government documents to the financier.

The Times newspaper, which first reported the police investigation, said officers were expected to interview Mandelson and take statements from senior Labour figures, including former Prime Minister Brown.

Following the announcement of the investigation into Mandelson, a government spokesperson said it stood "ready to provide whatever support and assistance the police need."

The emails suggest that in 2009, Mandelson sent Epstein a memo written for Brown about possible UK asset sales and tax changes, and in 2010 gave Epstein advance notice of a 500-billion-euro ($590 billion) bailout by the European Union.

Mandelson, 72, was fired from his ambassadorial role in September, seven months after being appointed, after documents emerged showing he had remained close to Epstein for much longer than he had previously acknowledged.

In one message, he appeared to tell Epstein that his earlier conviction, for procuring a child for prostitution, was wrong and he should fight for early release.

On Tuesday, Starmer told his cabinet he was not reassured that the totality of the information had yet emerged, according to his spokesperson.

His comments marked his strongest condemnation yet of the man he appointed ambassador to Washington last year despite his known association with Epstein, who committed suicide in prison in 2019.

"The prime minister said he was appalled by the information that had emerged over the weekend in the Epstein files," his spokesperson said.

Late on Sunday, Mandelson resigned from the Labour Party to prevent "further embarrassment", after a new release of millions of documents exposed details of his closeness to Epstein, including suggestions of payments to Mandelson and his husband.

The scandal has sparked concerns about Starmer's decision to appoint Mandelson as ambassador instead of a career diplomat, a decision advocated by his chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney.

Labour lawmaker Clive Efford, speaking in parliament on Monday, said the "key question here is who advised the prime minister?"

MANDELSON: NO RECOLLECTION OF EPSTEIN PAYMENTS

Mandelson has not responded to requests about the allegations. A spokesperson, however, has said Mandelson had no recollection of financial payments, totalling $75,000, from Epstein, as suggested by other emails and media reports.

In an interview with the Times conducted late last month and published on Tuesday, Mandelson said Epstein had been a "master manipulator." He added: "I've had a lot of bad luck, no doubt some of it of my own making."

Starmer, seeking to get on the front foot after some of his lawmakers said Downing Street's initial response over the weekend was not strong enough, has ordered an investigation into Mandelson's links with Epstein during Brown's government.

Brown, however, pre-empted him, saying that he had asked officials to look into the matter back in September but that he had been told they had unearthed no departmental records.

The former prime minister said on Monday that after the "shocking new information" came to light in the latest tranche of Epstein papers, he had asked for "a wider and more intensive inquiry to take place."

Starmer has also called for the former Prince Andrew to testify before a U.S. congressional committee, following new revelations about his links to Epstein.

Asked about the situation at a meeting in Dubai on Tuesday, Prince Edward, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor's younger brother, said: "It's really important always to remember the victims," echoing previous statements from King Charles and Queen Camilla.

A Thames Valley Police spokesperson said the force was aware of allegations that a woman was taken to an address in Windsor, where the former prince resides, for sexual purposes in 2010.

The woman's lawyer told the BBC over the weekend that the woman, who is not British, was in her 20s at the time and was allegedly sent to Britain by Epstein for a sexual encounter with Mountbatten-Windsor. He has always denied any wrongdoing.

"We are assessing the information in line with our established procedures," the police spokesperson said, adding that the force takes any reports of sexual crimes extremely seriously.

A review does not necessarily lead to an investigation.

Here are contenders from among 93 eligible names parties have submitted as potential candidates for prime minister.

The caretaker prime minister and leader of the Bhumjaithai Party, Anutin , 59, secured the top post in September last year by outmanoeuvring the ruling Pheu Thai party just hours after a court sacked then-premier Paetongtarn Shinawatra .

His frenetic lobbying for support from Paetongtarn's coalition partners and the opposition underlines his credentials as a seasoned political dealmaker willing to work with any party to get in government.

Bhumjaithai was not a contender in the 2023 and 2019 elections, taking 71 and 51 seats respectively, but it was enough to win the staunch royalist key positions such as interior and health minister and deputy prime minister.

In a volatile political climate fraught with bitter rivalries, Anutin has been a rare bridge between warring political elites, giving him significant pull across party lines.

Though considered a conservative, he famously led a successful campaign to decriminalise cannabis in Thailand.

Bhumjaithai's short stint as ruling party and a slew of defections from other parties could give the former construction tycoon Anutin a stronger hand this time.

Staying on as prime minister will depend on his bargaining power as much as it will the ballot box.

Natthaphong, 38, is a former businessman and software engineer who ran a cloud service firm after university.

He was elected to parliament in 2019 with the progressive Future Forward Party, a forerunner for the Move Forward Party and its latest incarnation, People's Party .

The fan of video games played a crucial role in overseeing the online strategy of his parties, with Move Forward's mastery of social media campaigning key to its 2023 election victory.

After a court dissolved Move Forward in August 2024 and banned its top leaders for planning to amend a law that protects the monarchy from criticism, Natthaphong was unveiled as leader of its successor People's Party before becoming Thailand's youngest Leader of the Opposition in parliament.

Yodchanan , 46, is the son of former Prime Minister Somchai Wongsawat and part of the billionaire Shinawatra clan, the founders of the Pheu Thai party , and the dominant force in Thai politics for much of the last 25 years.

An engineer by training, Yodchanan spent most of his adult life in academia and is a professor in biomedical engineering at Bangkok's Mahidol University.

A political novice, his only government role has been as adviser on technology policies to the last Pheu Thai-led administration. He has big shoes to fill.

In a recent Reuters interview , he described himself as a very small guy, "on the shoulder of a giant", referring to his uncle, the polarising, currently jailed tycoon and former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra.

His aunt is ex-premier Yingluck Shinawatra. Both were toppled in military coups.

Yodchanan's cousin Paetongtarn Shinawatra was also prime minister and like his father, she was removed from power by a Constitutional Court verdict, as were two other premiers from outside the family. In all, six prime ministers under Pheu Thai or its previous incarnations were ousted.

If Yodchanan gets the top job, history would suggest it may not end well .

Career diplomat Sihasak, 67, is Thailand's foreign minister on his first foray into politics with the Bhumjaithai Party in its effort to recruit expertise and technocrats.

A former Thai ambassador to Japan, France and the United Nations in Geneva, Sihasak is well known in Southeast Asia and joins Anutin as the second of Bhumjaithai's two eligible candidates for premier.

Srikanya, 44, is deputy leader of the People's Party, a role she held with Move Forward. She had initially been tipped to become leader of the progressive movement when Move Forward was disbanded.

Educated in Thailand and France and holder of two master's degrees, Srikanya was Move Forward's finance minister-designate in 2023 before its attempt to form a government was blocked .

Abhisit , 61, was prime minister from 2008 to 2011 during major bouts of political violence and came to office only after a court removed two other premiers.

Media-savvy and a skilled orator, Abhisit was born and brought up in Britain, studying at Eton College and Oxford University, and holds Thai and British nationality.

Once backed by Thailand's conservative establishment, Abhisit's Democrat Party has been in decline but seeks to reinvent itself and could play an important role in government formation.

He has recently been a more neutral figure in politics and a return as prime minister should not be ruled out if crisis and deadlock ensue.

Veerayooth, 46, has a doctorate from Britain's Cambridge University and lectured in Japan before becoming an economic adviser to Move Forward. He is the third candidate of the People's Party's, a backup if Natthaphong and Sirikanya are banned by a court, as happened to its last two leaders.

They are among 44 former Move Forward lawmakers being investigated on accusations of ethics breaches for attempting to amend the royal insult law in 2021. If that case goes to the Supreme Court, they could face long political bans.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 02:05:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/PYUVKWBOHJN7JA7MPABX6EPPLE.jpg?auth=84536b0157ea65a3117eb555656532960588f7b9fe0f02b5d6f6b6482fe921ae&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US condemns South Africa's expulsion of Israeli diplomat</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/us-condemns-south-africas-expulsion-israeli-diplomat-2026-02-04/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Feb 3 (Reuters) - The United States on Tuesday condemned South Africa's decision to expel Israel's top diplomat last week, a State Department spokesperson said, calling the African nation's step a part of prioritizing "grievance politics."

"Expelling a diplomat for calling out the African National Congress party's ties to Hamas and other antisemitic radicals prioritizes grievance politics over the good of South Africa and its citizens," Tommy Pigott, the State Department's deputy spokesperson, said on X.

South Africa's embassy in Washington had no immediate comment.

On Friday, South Africa declared the top diplomat at Israel's embassy persona non grata and ordered him out within 72 hours.

It accused him of "unacceptable violations of diplomatic norms and practice," including insulting South Africa's president.

Israel responded by expelling South Africa's senior diplomatic representative to its country.

Israel and South Africa have had strained relations since South Africa in 2024 brought a genocide case in the International Court of Justice against Israel over its assault on Gaza.

Multiple rights groups, experts and scholars have also called Israel's assault a genocide. Israel denies that and called its actions self-defense following an October 2023 Hamas attack.

The genocide case has also contributed to U.S. President Donald Trump's attacks on Pretoria, including verbal scolding, trade sanctions and an executive order last year cutting U.S. funding.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 02:06:33 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran demands Oman venue for US talks as tensions rise in Middle East</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260204-iran-demands-oman-venue-for-us-talks-as-tensions-rise-in-middle-east</link><description>Iran is demanding that talks with the US this week be held in Oman , not Turkey, and that the scope be narrowed to two-way negotiations on nuclear issues only, a regional source said on Tuesday, adding new complications to an already delicate diplomatic effort.

Iran's move to change the venue and agenda for the talks, scheduled for Friday in Istanbul, comes amid heightened tensions as the US builds up forces in the Middle East .

Regional players have pushed for a resolution of a standoff that has led to mutual threats of air strikes and stirred fears of escalation into a wider war.

The US military on Tuesday shot down an Iranian drone that “aggressively” approached the Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea, the US military said, in an incident first reported by Reuters.

US President Donald Trump , who warned on Monday that “bad things” would probably happen if a deal could not be reached with Iran, told reporters at the White House on Tuesday: “We are negotiating with them right now.” He did not elaborate and declined to say where he expected the talks to take place.

The regional diplomat with knowledge of Iran's demands said Tehran sought “to change the format, they want to change the scope.”

“They only want to discuss the nuclear file with the Americans, while the US wants to include other topics such as the (ballistic) missiles and the activities of Iran's proxies in the region.”

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News that talks with Iran were still scheduled to take place later this week.

Iran's foreign ministry spokesperson said consultations on the venue were still under way, Iranian Nour News reported later on Tuesday. The spokesperson said planning has been carried out to hold the negotiations in the coming days and that Turkey , Oman and several other countries had expressed readiness to host the meeting.

A source familiar with the situation said earlier on Tuesday that Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner was due to take part in the talks, along with US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Aragchi.

Ministers from several other countries in the region, including Pakistan, Saudi Arabia , Qatar, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, had also been expected to attend, but the regional source told Reuters that Tehran now wants only bilateral talks with the US.

The US naval buildup follows Iran's violent crackdown against anti-government demonstrations last month.

Trump, who stopped short of carrying out threats to intervene, has since demanded nuclear concessions from Iran and sent a flotilla to its coast.

The priority of the diplomatic effort is to avoid conflict and de-escalate tension, a second regional official told Reuters earlier.

Iran’s leadership is increasingly worried a US strike could break its grip on power by driving an already enraged public back onto the streets, according to six current and former Iranian officials.

With tensions running high, an Iranian Shahed-139 drone flying toward the Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier “with unclear intent” was shot down by an F-35 US fighter jet, the US military said.

Iran's Tasnim news agency said connection had been lost with a drone in international waters, but the reason was unknown.

US Central Command said in another incident on Tuesday, this one in the Strait of Hormuz, Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps forces harassed a US-flagged tanker.

“Two IRGC boats and an Iranian Mohajer drone approached M/V Stena Imperative at high speeds and threatened to board and seize the tanker,” said Navy Captain Tim Hawkins, a spokesperson for Central Command.

Maritime risk management group Vanguard said the Iranian boats ordered the tanker to stop its engine and prepare to be boarded. Instead, the tanker sped up and continued its voyage.

Hawkins said a US Navy warship, the McFaul, was operating in the area and escorted the Stena Imperative, which was “proceeding safely.”

Earlier, the United Arab Emirates , a highly influential Gulf Arab oil producer and close US ally, said the region cannot afford another conflict and negotiations are needed.

Gulf Arab states are worried that Iran will carry out its threat to target US bases on their territory should Trump attack the Islamic Republic again.

In June, the United States struck Iranian nuclear targets, joining in at the close of a 12-day Israeli bombing campaign. Since then, Tehran has said its uranium enrichment work – which it says is for peaceful, not military, purposes – has stopped.

Iranian sources told Reuters last week that Trump had demanded three conditions for the resumption of talks: zero enrichment of uranium in Iran, limits on Tehran's ballistic missile programme, and ending its support for regional proxies.

Iran has long said all three demands are unacceptable infringements of its sovereignty, but two Iranian officials told Reuters that its clerical rulers saw the ballistic missile programme, rather than uranium enrichment, as the bigger obstacle.

One Iranian official said there should be no preconditions and Tehran is ready to show flexibility on uranium enrichment, including handing over 400 kg of highly enriched uranium, accepting zero enrichment.

Tehran's regional influence has been weakened by Israel's attacks on its proxies – from Hamas in Gaza to Hezbollah in Lebanon , the Houthis in Yemen and militias in Iraq – as well as by the ousting of Iran's close ally, former Syrian President Bashar al-Assad .</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 02:07:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/acbd8a52-0151-11f1-bd4e-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26030462309994.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Art teacher critically injured by student in southern France school stabbing</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260204-student-stabs-teacher-in-french-art-school</link><description>A 14-year-old school student stabbed an art teacher in southern France on Tuesday, leaving the 60-year-old in critical condition, a prosecutor said.

The pupil stabbed the teacher at least three times and was subsequently arrested on suspicion of attempted murder , said Raphael Balland, the public prosecutor in the southern city of Toulon.

There were no known “religious or political connotations” at this stage, Balland said.

“All we know is that there had been tensions with this teacher recently, and that he was angry with her,” the prosecutor added during a press briefing.

France’s education minister, Edouard Geffray, headed to La Guicharde secondary school, where the stabbing took place, in the town of Sanary-sur-Mer.

“My thoughts immediately go out to the victim, her family and the entire educational community, whose deep shock I share,” he wrote on X.

President Emmanuel Macron was being kept up to date on the teacher’s condition, presidential aides said.

France has seen a series of incidents in which pupils have attacked teachers or other schoolchildren.

A 14-year-old schoolboy was last year charged with the murder of a teaching assistant after allegedly stabbing her to death in June.

He attacked the 31-year-old, a mother of a young boy, during a bag search in the eastern town of Nogent.

In a separate case, a student in April killed a girl and wounded several other pupils in a stabbing spree in the western city of Nantes.

Panama's Supreme Court last week ruled the contracts violated Panama's constitution by giving the company exclusive privileges and tax exemptions.

It is unclear how long the arbitration proceedings could take, although given the political sensitivities involving the U.S. and China and the complexity of the deal, it could drag on for a number of years, some analysts said.

"This is an example of the increasing interconnection between international trade, geopolitics and law," said Jason Karas, international disputes specialist and managing partner of Karas So LLP in association with Mishcon de Reya.

The decision and move to seek arbitration casts further doubt on the future ownership of the two ports, which CK Hutchison has operated for nearly three decades, and the company's planned $23 billion deal to sell its port businesses.

"The board strongly disagrees with the determination and corresponding actions in Panama," CK Hutchison said in a statement to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

"The group continues to consult with its legal counsel and reserves all rights, including recourse to additional national and international legal proceedings in the matter."

The Panamanian government did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Ja Ian Chong, an associate professor of political science at the National University of Singapore, said international arbitration proceedings usually take a few years, and it is voluntary for a state to honour the decision.

"Panama can just ignore CK Hutchison ... I think that’s apparent to CK Hutch. They probably want to show to shareholders that they are doing all they legally can," he said.

The conglomerate may also want to show the Beijing and Hong Kong governments it is doing all it can to "avoid blame" amid China and U.S. tension, he added.

CK Hutchison's shares were up 2% on Wednesday in early trade, while the Hang Seng Index (.HSI) , opens new tab was down 0.4%.

China on Tuesday warned Panama there would be "heavy prices" to pay for the court ruling which it called "absurd" and "shameful and pathetic".

The two Panama Canal ports are at the heart of a $23 billion buyout bid led by BlackRock (BLK.N) , opens new tab and Mediterranean Shipping Company of CK Hutchison's 43 ports in 23 countries. BlackRock and MSC did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters.

After Beijing criticised the deal, the conglomerate said in July it was in talks to include a Chinese "major strategic investor" in the consortium.

Sources have said the Chinese investor is COSCO (1199.HK) , opens new tab , and it was seeking a large stake, while the others were keen for it to be a minority shareholder, a position that became a sticking point in talks.

The court ruling has made the future of the deal unclear, but some analysts think a transaction can be finalised without the two Panama Canal ports included in the portfolio of assets.

"The deal may continue with the remaining ports. The twist is that with the two key ports' situation crystallized by the Panama Supreme Court, actually the ports deal may have a clearer path to completion, from the legal perspective," said Winston Ma, New York University School of Law adjunct professor.

He said CK Hutchison could use the arbitration process to seek damages and compensation for having the contracts annulled.

The deal opened a new front in contention between the United States and China, as they grapple for control of the world's most important trade routes.

CK Hutchison's Balboa and Cristobal ports are considered strategic assets in the Panama Canal, the main seaborne trading route into the United States. Balboa is at the canal's Pacific entrance while Cristobal is at the Atlantic entrance.

The Panamanian court decision was welcomed by some U.S. lawmakers as a "win for America". President Donald Trump, who initially celebrated the proposed $23-billion ports sale, has called for the U.S. to "take back" the Panama Canal in the face of Chinese influence.

APM Terminals Panama, a Maersk (MAERSKb.CO) , opens new tab subsidiary, said on Friday it was willing to operate the Balboa and Cristobal terminals temporarily, to prevent any impact on regional and global trade.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 04:20:16 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BN6V5K3NPRLPZMAT5U2BJ4DIX4.jpg?auth=033cc7e68c308371d0182b21779f3a662d1a40a090eb0420caa71205fb1e3c3f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Maduro supporters rally in Caracas a month after US-led ouster</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260204-maduro-supporters-rally-in-caracas</link><description>Thousands of backers of Venezuela’s former leader Nicolas Maduro , who was ousted in a deadly US military operation, marched in Caracas on Tuesday to demand his freedom.

“Venezuela needs Nicolas,” chanted the crowd, a month to the day since he was spectacularly toppled and whisked away to stand trial on drug charges in New York.

Interim president Delcy Rodriguez has been walking a tightrope since then – trying to hold on to support from Washington but also from Maduro acolytes in her government and the Venezuelan people.

Several demonstrators, many of them public sector workers, held photos of Maduro and of his wife, Cilia Flores, who was also seized in the US raid.

The march, called by the government, stretched for several hundred metres, accompanied by trucks blaring music.

“These people are not American ,” said Maduro’s son, Nicolas “Nicolasito” Maduro Guerra, a deputy in Venezuela ’s National Assembly.

“We have achieved a profound anti-imperialist consciousness.”

Many protesters waved Venezuelan flags and were dressed in the red colours of the ruling “Chavista” movement named after Maduro’s socialist predecessor, Hugo Chavez .

“We feel confused, sad, angry. There are a lot of emotions,” said Jose Perdomo, a 58-year-old municipal employee who also declared his backing “for the decisions taken by our interim president, Delcy Rodriguez”.

He added that “sooner or later they will have to free our president”.

Rodriguez was a staunch backer of Maduro and served as his vice president.

US President Donald Trump has said he is willing to work with her as long as she toes Washington’s line, particularly on granting access to Venezuela’s vast oil reserves .

Under pressure, Rodriguez has started freeing political prisoners and opened Venezuela’s nationalised hydrocarbons industry to private investment.

The countries have rekindled diplomatic relations severed in 2019 after Maduro was accused of stealing his first re-election, with American envoy Laura Dogu’s arrival in Caracas on Saturday.

On Tuesday, in a video issued by the US mission, she pointed to a three-phase plan for the crisis-stricken South American country, ending in “the transition to a friendly, stable, prosperous and democratic Venezuela”.

Rodriguez confirmed the meeting, calling it a “frank conversation”.

Earlier on Tuesday, hundreds of university students and relatives of political prisoners also marched in the capital, calling for the quick approval of an amnesty law promised by Rodriguez.

Rodriguez said Tuesday she is working “intensely” on the amnesty law “that would allow us, in this whole period of political violence, of extremism, to carry out a national policy”.

The law has not yet come before parliament, whose leader is the acting president’s brother, Jorge Rodriguez, another staunch Chavista and Maduro backer.

Opposition deputy Stalin Gonzalez told AFP he expects the first debate on amnesty to be brought to the floor on Thursday.

“I hope that the amnesty opens the door to reconciliation, coexistence, peace and democracy,” he said.

Anti-government protests had been rare since the crackdown on demonstrations against Maduro’s contested claim to another re-election in 2024.

More than 2,000 people were jailed at the time.

“Freedom is in the streets and no one can stop it!” chanted the crowd.

The opposition in Venezuela has been calling for fresh elections to be held after Maduro’s ouster .</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 04:20:47 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/0ab086a4-0103-11f1-b73f-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-29T201700Z-1724631766-RC28BJA5NSKC-RTRMADP-3-VENEZUELA-OIL-LAW-MARCH.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Rights group condemns detention of Chinese journalists after corruption report</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/rights-group-condemns-detention-chinese-journalists-after-corruption-report-2026-02-04/</link><description>BEIJING, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Reporters Without Borders (RSF) late on Tuesday condemned the detention of two independent Chinese journalists, one a prominent investigative reporter, after they published a story alleging corruption by a local official in southwestern China.

The Paris-headquartered advocacy group said journalists Wu Yingjiao and Liu Hu, who gained national recognition more than a decade ago for uncovering graft among high-profile figures, were detained on Sunday in China's Sichuan province.

Police in Chengdu, the provincial capital of Sichuan, said in a statement on Monday they were investigating a 50-year-old man surnamed Liu, a 34-year-old man surnamed Wu and others on suspicion of "making false accusations" and "illegal business operations."

The statement added that they had been placed under "criminal coercive measures" - a legal term that typically refers to detention.

The authorities only provided their surnames, but several Chinese media and RSF identified the two as Liu Hu and Wu Yingjiao.

Police authorities in Chengdu did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

The arrests followed the January 29 publication of a co-authored investigative report on the social media platform WeChat which examinined alleged corruption involving Pu Fayou, the Communist Party secretary of Pujiang county in Sichuan.

Pu could not be immediately reached for comment.

The report has since been deleted from WeChat, a common step taken by censors in cases involving sensitive government exposes.

Liu is a former investigative reporter at New Express. He was detained by Beijing police in 2013 on charges of "picking quarrels and provoking trouble" for allegedly "fabricating and spreading rumours", but was later released on bail after spending 364 days in detention, said RSF.

Aleksandra Bielakowska, RSF's advocacy manager for the Asia-Pacific region, said the detention of the two journalists highlights a "restrictive and hostile" environment for independent reporting in China.

"We call on the international community to intensify pressure on the Chinese regime, rather than pursue a normalisation of relations that only enables further repression and allows the authorities to continue targeting reliable reporters," Bielakowska said.

Leaders of many democratic nations from South Korea, Canada to the United Kingdom have visited Beijing this year as they seek to improve relations with China amid ongoing trade and security tensions with the United States.

China ranked 178 out of 180 in the 2025 Reporters Without Borders Press Freedom Index. The group identifies the country as the world's largest jailer of journalists.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:33:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Guardiola vows to speak up for victims of global conflicts</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/guardiola-vows-speak-up-victims-global-conflicts-2026-02-04/</link><description>Feb 4 (Reuters) - Pep Guardiola said he will continue to use his platform as Manchester City manager to speak up for victims of global conflicts and violence.

Guardiola was speaking at a pre‑match press conference ahead of City's League Cup semifinal second leg against Newcastle United, five days after he voiced support for children in the occupied Palestinian territories at a charity concert in Barcelona.

"Never, ever in the history of humanity have we had the information in front of our eyes watching more clearly than now," Guardiola told reporters on Tuesday in Manchester.

"The genocide in Palestine, what happened in Ukraine, what happened in Russia, what happened all around the world - in Sudan, everywhere," he said, referring to the Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories.

"What happened in front of us? Do you want to see it? It's our problems as human beings. It's our problems."

He said society must work collectively to improve.

"Look what happened in the United States of America, Renee Good and Alex Pretti were killed. Tell me how you can defend that," Guardiola said. The fatal shootings of the two U.S. citizens by federal immigration agents sparked widespread protests in the United States.

"When I see the images, I am sorry it hurts. That is why in every position I can help speak up to be a better society, I will try and will be there. All the time. It is for my kids, my families, for you.

"There is not a perfect society, nowhere is perfect, I am not perfect, we have to work to be better."</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:33:33 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/FEDFBIGKERJEVEIWIJDWP5M6Z4.jpg?auth=38fe6729f09e21e93f6d6faac80cde2f9ea3efb6fe792565e9c6d35423f46978&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Pakistan sends helicopters, drones to end desert standoff; 58 dead</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/pakistan-sends-helicopters-drones-end-desert-standoff-58-dead-2026-02-04/</link><description>QUETTA, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Pakistan's security forces used drones and helicopters to wrest control of a southwestern town from separatist insurgents after a three-day battle, police said on Wednesday, as the death toll in the weekend's violence rose to 58.

Saturday's wave of coordinated attacks by the separatist Baloch Liberation Army brought Pakistan's largest province to a near standstill as security forces exchanged fire with insurgents in more than a dozen places, killing 197 militants.

"I thought the roof and walls of my house were going to blow up," said Robina Ali, a housewife living near the main administrative building in the fortified provincial capital of Quetta, where a powerful morning blast rocked the area.

Fighters of the BLA, the region's strongest insurgent group , stormed schools, banks, markets and security installations across Balochistan in one of their largest operations ever, killing more than 22 security officials and 36 civilians.

Police officials gave details of the situation on condition of anonymity as they were not authorised to speak to the media.

In the desert town of Nushki, home to about 50,000, the insurgents seized control of the police station and other security installations, triggering a three-day standoff.

Police said seven officers were killed in the fighting before they regained control of the town late on Monday, while operations against the BLA continue elsewhere in the province.

"More troops were sent to Nushki," said one security official. "Helicopters and drones were used against the militants."

Pakistan's interior ministry did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Pakistan's largest and poorest province, mineral-rich Balochistan borders Iran and Afghanistan and is home to Beijing's investment in the Gwadar deepwater port and other projects.

It has grappled with a decades-long insurgency led by ethnic Baloch separatists seeking greater autonomy and a larger share of its natural resources.

The BLA, which has urged people of the province to support the movement, said on Tuesday it had killed 280 soldiers during its Operation "Herof", Black Storm, but gave no evidence.

Security officials said the weekend attacks began at 4 a.m. on Saturday with suicide blasts in Nushki and the fishing port of Pasni and gun and grenade attacks in 11 more places, including Quetta.

The insurgents seized at least six district administration offices during the siege and had advanced at one point to within 1 km (3,300 ft) of the provincial chief minister's office in Quetta, the police officials said.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 06:53:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/SVEJ5NU7MNNEDFNEKCH5X6PLIY.jpg?auth=a64f66e197e9d7b214f62f72367754736dc0465e49b34be95ed906d26751b1ad&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Handbags and hashtags: Japan's Takaichi rides youth-led craze into election</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/handbags-hashtags-japans-takaichi-rides-youth-led-craze-into-election-2026-02-04/</link><description>TOKYO, Feb 4 (Reuters) - The handbag she carries is sold out, her pink pen has gone viral and even her favourite snacks are in hot demand: Japan's 64-year-old leader Sanae Takaichi has sparked an unlikely youth-led craze that could propel her to a big election win.

Polls suggest 'sanakatsu', roughly translated as 'sanamania', can help give Japan's first female prime minister a decisive mandate in Sunday's general election and unleash the spending plans she has promised will jolt the country's moribund economy.

Backed by her personal popularity, her ruling coalition could capture as many as 300 seats in the 465-seat lower house, polls this week showed, a remarkable turnaround given her predecessor resigned after losing control of both chambers in ballots over the last 15 months.

What's perhaps even more surprising is the appeal of the staunchly conservative leader with voters under 30, estimated by one recent poll at over 90%. Her overall popularity stands at around 60%.

Takanori Kobayashi, director at Hamano, the company that makes the $900 black leather bag that Takaichi regularly totes, says he has been stunned by the young people clamouring to buy the item on a nine-month backlog.

"The bag is usually bought by people in their forties or fifties," Kobayashi said at the company's factory in Nagano, central Japan, where press clippings of the prime minister are pinned to a notice board.

"But since it became well known, probably through social media, we have seen a lot of interest from customers in their twenties and thirties."

There has been a similar online buzz around the pink ballpoint pen she uses to scribble notes in parliament and the shrimp rice crackers she was seen clutching while riding a train.

Takaichi has built a social media following that dwarfs those of her rivals, both inside her ruling Liberal Democratic Party and across the opposition. She has about 2.6 million followers on X, compared with around 64,000 for Yoshihiko Noda, leader of the main opposition party.

Takaichi's personal approval ratings are almost double that of the LDP, traditionally a male-dominated party, according to a poll released on Monday by public broadcaster NHK.

Her viral posts stand out in Japan's usually staid politics, such as clips of her drumming to the hit song Golden from Netflix's K-Pop Demon Hunters with South Korean President Lee Jae-myung, or serenading Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni with 'Happy Birthday' in Italian.

When Takaichi announced the snap poll on January 19, she cast the vote as a de facto referendum on her leadership and policies, including fiscal expansion and a plans to strengthen defences to counter China's growing military might.

"Can you entrust the management of the nation to Sanae Takaichi? I ask the people directly to judge," she said.

She surprised voters and politicians with an election "to get an endorsement in a way that is actually rather presidential," said Koichi Nakano, a political science professor at Sophia University in Tokyo.

Takaichi's approach has won over Haruka Okuyama, a 32-year-old office worker who attended her first campaign rally in Akihabara, an anime and gaming culture hub in central Tokyo.

"A lot of young people follow social media these days, and I think there’s been an increase in conservative thinking among them," Okuyama said, pulling a magazine from her bag that she said she bought because Takaichi was on the cover.

Perched atop a campaign truck outside Akihabara station, Takaichi spoke about her modest upbringing outside Japan's political elite, and covered topics from the cost of hair salons to controlling immigration.

Takaichi, whose mother was a police officer and father worked at a car company, has said she has drawn inspiration from Margaret Thatcher , the daughter of a shopkeeper who became Britain's first female and longest-serving modern premier.

"She has a clear, decisive way of speaking," said Takeo Fujimura, a 24-year-old clerical worker who had volunteered to hand out paper Japanese flags at the event. "She communicates in a bright, positive way and I think that energy resonates with young people."

Not everyone at the rally had made up their mind.

Tomomi Kawamura, a 37-year old housewife, said she admired Takaichi's social media savvy, but was undecided on who to vote for. Rising prices were her main worry, she said, echoing concerns among other voters that the yen's slide - triggered in part by Takaichi's promised fiscal largesse - is fuelling inflation.

"Prices are so high," Kawamura said. "I want something done about that."

Some analysts question whether enough of the youth the prime minister has attracted will turn out to deliver the landslide that polls predict she will win on Sunday. Younger people have historically been less likely to vote than older generations that have underpinned the LDP's near unbroken post-war rule.

But even a modest win would underline how her personal appeal has single-handedly revived the fortunes of a party whose long grip on power was slipping fast, said David Boling, a principal at The Asia Group, a strategic advisory firm .

"The power of her personality seems to be transcending politics," he said.

Trade Minister Le Manh Hung met with several U.S. companies in the energy and technology sectors, including executives from Apple, Exxon Mobil, GE, AES and Excelerate Energy, according to a statement from the ministry.

The White House in October said the United States and Vietnam would finalise a trade agreement that will keep tariffs on most Vietnamese goods at 20% but remove duties on certain products.

Vietnam's shipments to the United States, its largest export market, reached a record high of $153 billion last year, despite the tariffs.

During the trip, trade minister Hung witnessed the signing of several memorandums of understanding with U.S. companies to buy American crude oil, ethanol and corn, Vietnam state media reported on Wednesday.

The MOUs were signed with Chevron, Marquis Energy and ADM Asia-Pacific Trading in Washington, the Vietnam News Agency reported.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 06:54:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CJGKTS5MNRKJFLMEA5MZO5OXPI.jpg?auth=0d55f47cf0074e623fffac30bf64eb52ef1dd5ebda7f8427e24b44c43237808f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US renews trade pact with African countries, bringing tariff relief</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260204-us-renews-trade-pact-with-african-countries-bringing-tariff-relief</link><description>The United States on Tuesday renewed the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) through the end of the year, an agreement that allows many African countries to access the US market duty-free.

US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said in a statement that President Donald Trump had signed into law a reauthorisation of the trade preference program through December 31, 2026, with retroactive effect from September 30, 2025 – the date it had expired.

"AGOA for the 21st century must demand more from our trading partners and yield more market access for US businesses, farmers, and ranchers," Greer said.

Trump has used trade and tariffs – which he has called his "favorite word" – as a carrot and a stick to reshape international relations, as he sees fit.

In a statement, Greer vowed to "work with Congress over the next year to modernise the program to align with" current US policy.

A cornerstone of US-Africa trade relations for 25 years, the AGOA has allowed the United States to buy billions of dollars of duty-free cars, clothes and other items from select African countries each year.

But the deal, which operates in 32 African nations, expired last September, affecting thousands of jobs and forcing exporters to absorb high tariff duties.

In 2024, $8.23 billion worth of goods were exported under the accord, half of which came from South Africa , mainly cars, precious metals and farm produce, and one fifth from Nigeria , mainly oil and other energy products, according to the United States International Trade Commission (USITC).

Smaller countries were hard hit, too. Lesotho 's textiles sector, the country's biggest employer, was hard hit by AGOA's expiration, and hundreds of workers demonstrated in the capital Maseru in late October against cuts sparked by the new American customs tariffs .

Negotiators from Ukraine, Russia and the United States were set to gather in Abu Dhabi on Wednesday, seeking to advance fraught talks on how to end the four-year war.

Several rounds of diplomacy between the sides have failed to strike a deal on ending Europe's deadliest conflict since World War II, which began when Russia invaded in February 2022.

The main sticking point is the long-term fate of territory in eastern Ukraine.

Moscow is demanding that Kyiv pull its troops out of swathes of the Donbas, including heavily fortified cities atop vast natural resources, as a precondition of any deal. It also wants international recognition that land seized in the invasion belongs to Russia.

Kyiv has said the conflict should be frozen along the current front line and has rejected a unilateral pull-back of forces.

The former prince, 65, had hoped to stay at Royal Lodge, his Windsor home of decades, for longer, the Sun newspaper said, but he was moved under the cover of darkness on Monday and driven to a cottage in Sandringham, the king's Norfolk estate.

A royal source confirmed that he was now resident there, but that he might occasionally return to Windsor in the coming weeks while a transitionary phase was completed.

"With the latest batch of Epstein files it was made clear to him that it was time to go," the Sun quoted a friend as saying.

"Leaving was so humiliating for him that he chose to do it under the cover of darkness."

Charles stripped Andrew of his titles in October and said he would be moved after details emerged of his ongoing relationship with Epstein.

The king has also said that his sympathy is with the victims of abuse.

New files related to Epstein published by the U.S. Justice Department on Friday included emails suggesting that Andrew maintained regular contact with Epstein for more than two years after he was found guilty of child sex crimes.

He has denied wrongdoing in connection with Epstein and had previously denied maintaining ties with the financier after Epstein's 2008 conviction, apart from a 2010 visit to New York to end their relationship.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 07:44:19 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/PMQZWJNIFNPCBCYPEXRIX4LNUQ.jpg?auth=e7dc9365afc943b2416d908db896437d10f6b1947bbea121653f5c07021c5922&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Taiwan must pass defence spending to avoid giving wrong impression, president says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/taiwan-must-pass-defence-spending-avoid-giving-wrong-impression-president-says-2026-02-04/</link><description>TAIPEI, Feb 4 (Reuters) - If Taiwan's opposition-controlled parliament continues to block $40 billion in proposed extra defence spending the international community could misunderstand the island's determination to defend itself, President Lai Ching-te said on Wednesday.

Pressure from politicans in the United States, Chinese-claimed Taiwan's most important international backer and arms supplier despite a lack of formal diplomatic ties, has grown on parliament not to hold up defence spending.

On Monday, U.S. Senator Roger Wicker, chairman of the Armed Services Committee and one of the strongest advocates for Taiwan in the U.S. Congress, wrote on X that he was "disappointed" to see Taiwan's opposition parties slash Lai's defence budget.

At a meeting of his Democratic Progressive Party, Lai said if the opposition continued blocking the plans and presses on with their own version, "This is bound to delay improvements to defence capabilities".

That "could lead the international community to misunderstand Taiwan's determination to defend itself and to safeguard peace in the Indo-Pacific", Lai added, in comments provided by his party.

Another U.S. lawmaker, Republican Senator Dan Sullivan, a staunch Trump administration supporter, directly criticised the Kuomintang (KMT), Taiwan's largest opposition party, senior officials of which are now visiting Beijing .

"It doesn't take a genius to figure out what's going on here," he said on X, in reference to the visit. "I've warned before - short changing Taiwan's defence to kowtow to the CCP is playing with fire."

Taiwan's opposition-dominated parliament has blocked Lai's budget plan , including missiles and drones as well as the new "T-Dome" air defence system, pushing instead for a proposal to fund only certain U.S. arms, rather than the entire package.

The KMT says while it supports strengthening Taiwan's defences, it has a right to fully scrutinise government spending plans and will not sign "blank cheques".

"We thank members of the U.S. Senate for their valuable input," it said in an English-language statement.

"The KMT remains fully committed to safeguarding Taiwan's security, strengthening our defence capabilities, and also engaging constructively through dialogue to advance peace and stability across the Strait."

China regularly stages military exercises around Taiwan, and refuses to talk to Lai, calling him a "separatist". Lai says only Taiwan's people can decide their future.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 07:45:39 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5425YUFTENKQBG7WGKZHER7FHQ.jpg?auth=c15a44c62d88d53bd890cb9879fd098f316a34141e21e616c95f22c8abab0046&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Philippines House panel finds bid to impeach Marcos lacks substance</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/philippines-house-panel-finds-bid-impeach-marcos-lacks-substance-2026-02-04/</link><description>MANILA, Feb 4 (Reuters) - The Philippine House justice committee on Wednesday said two impeachment complaints against President Ferdinand Marcos Jr, accusing him of corruption, violating the constitution and betraying public trust, were lacking in substance.

On a third day of discussions about the complaints filed separately by a lawyer and activists, the committee overwhelmingly decided both lacked merit. Marcos, who is midway through his term in office, had denied wrongdoing.

The House of Representatives is expected to convene for a plenary vote where it could either uphold the committee's findings or override the decisions. The chamber is currently dominated by loyalists of the president.

The committee did not announce the next steps to be taken to handle the two complaints.

For Marcos to be impeached it must be supported by at least one-third of the lower house. If that happens, he would be the second Philippine head of state to be impeached after Joseph Estrada, whose 2001 trial was aborted when some prosecutors walked out.

The complaints against Marcos included his decision to allow his predecessor Rodrigo Duterte to be arrested and taken to The Hague to face trial at the International Criminal Court over thousands of killings during his notorious "war on drugs".

Marcos, 68, was also accused of abusing his authority in spending public funds that led to a corruption scandal involving flood-control projects. His alleged drug use , which he has denied, also made him unfit to run the country, according to one of the complaints.

If the lower house decides to impeach him, the Senate would be required to convene for trial, where its 24 members serve as jurors.

Five top officials have been impeached in the Philippines and only one of those, a former chief justice, was convicted and removed from office.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 07:46:10 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/NQACGGZCYVP7TBKCUUODCCB2QI.jpg?auth=7dfc8f88aab402ba7f0bd7c562e57b0d3f70eed2a5bbbda8e15ae2ef61a02d38&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>At least 35 killed as bandits raid Kwara state community, lawmaker says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/least-35-killed-bandits-raid-kwara-state-community-lawmaker-says-2026-02-04/</link><description>BAUCHI, Nigeria, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Armed bandits killed at least 35 people and burned homes and shops during an attack late on Tuesday on a remote community in Nigeria's north-central Kwara State, a state lawmaker said on Wednesday.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 08:43:19 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/J2OT46IMSVO2LHG3HHCW3T5WGM.jpg?auth=1bb42dc711388997fd45b2f1aac58ca16ebd233c55b315fd77faa5f6343d7aff&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US and Iran to hold nuclear talks in Oman amid heightened tensions, diplomat says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/us-iran-hold-nuclear-talks-oman-amid-heightened-tensions-diplomat-says-2026-02-04/</link><description>DUBAI, Feb 4 - Nuclear talks between the United States and Iran are expected to take place in Oman on Friday, a regional diplomat said, with a possible confrontation looming as U.S. President Donald Trump builds up forces in the Middle East.

Trump has warned that "bad things" would probably happen if a deal could not be reached, ratcheting up pressure on the Islamic Republic in a standoff that has led to mutual threats of air strikes and stirred fears of escalation into a wider war.

Iran has said it will not make concessions on its formidable ballistic missile programme, calling that a red line in negotiations.

The Trump administration agreed to an Iranian request to move the talks from Turkey and negotiations are still ongoing about whether Arab and Muslim countries from the region will join the talks in Oman, Axios reporter Barak Ravid said on Tuesday, citing an Arab source.

The U.S. military on Tuesday an Iranian drone that "aggressively" approached the Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea, the U.S. military said, in an incident first reported by Reuters.

Trump told reporters at the White House on Tuesday: "We are negotiating with them right now." But he did not elaborate and declined to say where he expected the talks to take place.

A source familiar with the situation said Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, was due to take part in the talks, along with U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi.

Ministers from several other countries in the region including Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates had also been expected to attend, but the regional source told Reuters that Tehran now wanted only bilateral talks with the U.S.

The U.S. naval buildup follows Iran's violent crackdown against anti-government demonstrations last month in the deadliest domestic unrest in Iran since its 1979 revolution.

Trump, who stopped short of carrying out threats to intervene, has since demanded nuclear concessions from Iran and sent a flotilla to its coast.

The priority of the diplomatic effort is to avoid conflict and de-escalate tension, a regional official told Reuters earlier.

a U.S. strike could break its grip on power by driving an already enraged public back onto the streets, according to six current and former Iranian officials.

With tensions running high, an Iranian Shahed-139 drone flying toward the Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier "with unclear intent" was shot down by an F-35 U.S. fighter jet on Tuesday, the U.S. military said.

Iran's Tasnim news agency said connection had been lost with a drone in international waters, but the reason was unknown.

The U.S. Central Command said in another incident on Tuesday, this one in the Strait of Hormuz, Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps forces harassed a U.S.-flagged tanker.

"Two IRGC boats and an Iranian Mohajer drone approached M/V Stena Imperative at high speeds and threatened to board and seize the tanker," Navy Captain Tim Hawkins, a spokesperson for the Central Command, said.

Maritime risk management group Vanguard said the Iranian boats ordered the tanker to stop its engine and prepare to be boarded. Instead, the tanker sped up and continued its voyage.

In June, the United States struck Iranian nuclear targets, joining in at the close of a 12-day Israeli bombing campaign. Since then, Tehran has said its uranium enrichment work - which it says is for peaceful, not military purposes - has stopped.

Iranian sources told Reuters last week that Trump had demanded three conditions for resumption of talks: zero enrichment of uranium in Iran, limits on Tehran's ballistic missile programme and ending its support for regional proxies.

Iran has long said all three demands are unacceptable infringements of its sovereignty, but two Iranian officials told Reuters its clerical rulers saw the ballistic missile programme, rather than uranium enrichment, as the bigger obstacle.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 08:43:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/QZRJR563SJOB5JV5OZVXNRWSAY.jpg?auth=03ff0310ce9bbab79d488f8bab76ddcebf93635bd0b0fca3a8add9da8207bd10&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Art teacher critically injured by student in southern France school stabbing</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260204-art-teacher-critically-injured-by-student-in-southern-france-school-stabbing</link><description>A 14-year-old school student stabbed an art teacher in southern France on Tuesday, leaving the 60-year-old in critical condition, a prosecutor said.

The pupil stabbed the teacher at least three times and was subsequently arrested on suspicion of attempted murder , said Raphael Balland, the public prosecutor in the southern city of Toulon.

There were no known “religious or political connotations” at this stage, Balland said.

“All we know is that there had been tensions with this teacher recently, and that he was angry with her,” the prosecutor added during a press briefing.

France’s education minister, Edouard Geffray, headed to La Guicharde secondary school, where the stabbing took place, in the town of Sanary-sur-Mer.

“My thoughts immediately go out to the victim, her family and the entire educational community, whose deep shock I share,” he wrote on X.

President Emmanuel Macron was being kept up to date on the teacher’s condition, presidential aides said.

France has seen a series of incidents in which pupils have attacked teachers or other schoolchildren.

A 14-year-old schoolboy was last year charged with the murder of a teaching assistant after allegedly stabbing her to death in June.

He attacked the 31-year-old, a mother of a young boy, during a bag search in the eastern town of Nogent.

In a separate case, a student in April killed a girl and wounded several other pupils in a stabbing spree in the western city of Nantes.

The Israeli military said tanks had fired on Gaza and airstrikes had been launched after a gunman shot at Israeli soldiers and seriously injured a reservist.

The strikes targeted Gaza City and the southern city of Khan Younis. A Gazan health official told Reuters that Israel had also halted the passage of patients through the Rafah border crossing to Egypt, two days after it had reopened , allowing a trickle of Palestinians to cross for the first time in months.

A spokesperson for the Red Crescent said patients had arrived at a hospital in Khan Younis in preparation for crossing Rafah for treatment, only to be informed that Israel had postponed the evacuations.

"They called the patients and said today there is no travel at all, the crossing is closed," Raja'a Abu Teir, a Palestinian patient who was set to be evacuated, told Reuters at the hospital, where several patients were waiting in ambulances.

The Israeli agency that controls access to Gaza, COGAT, said in a statement on Wednesday that Rafah crossing remained open, but they had not received the necessary coordination details from the World Health Organization to facilitate the crossing.

The WHO did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Reopening the crossing was one of the requirements under the October ceasefire that set out the first phase of U.S. President Donald Trump's plan to stop fighting between Israel and Palestinian Hamas militants .

Sixteen patients from Gaza and 40 of their escorts crossed into Egypt on Tuesday, Gazan medics told Reuters.

A Hamas police source told Reuters that at least 40 people crossed from Egypt to Gaza late on Tuesday.

In January, Trump declared the start of the second phase of the ceasefire where the sides would negotiate the shattered enclave's future governance and reconstruction.

Key issues like the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the over 50% of Gaza they currently occupy and the disarmament of Hamas remain unresolved, while the fragile ceasefire has been marked by near-daily violence.

Since the start of the ceasefire, Israeli fire has killed at least 530 people, most of them civilians, according to Gaza health officials. Palestinian militants have killed four Israeli soldiers in the same period, according to Israeli authorities.

Israel's two-year offensive on the Gaza Strip killed more than 71,000 Palestinians, according to Gazan health authorities, displaced most of its population, and left much of the strip in ruins.

The October 7, 2023, Hamas attack that triggered the war killed around 1,200 people in Israel, according to Israeli tallies.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 09:44:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CLV7RDLXPJKPTO7Y4ZYLURGBXM.jpg?auth=42fada67bff6559491d50b65642df68049ee6dd18aecb8127f700a005b6679b8&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Eswatini high court dismisses case challenging deal on U.S. deportees</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/eswatini-high-court-dismisses-case-challenging-deal-us-deportees-2026-02-04/</link><description>MBABANE, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Eswatini's high court has dismissed a case filed by human rights lawyers who argued that the government's deal with the United States to accept third-country deportees was unconstitutional, a copy of the judgment seen by Reuters on Wednesday showed.

U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has so far sent at least 15 third-country deportees to Eswatini since last July. The small southern African country received $5.1 million as part of the deal.

The web of arms control deals negotiated in the decades since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, considered the closest the world ever came to intentional nuclear war, were aimed at reducing the chance of a catastrophic nuclear exchange.

Unless Washington and Moscow reach a last-minute understanding of some kind, the world's two biggest nuclear powers will be left without any limits for the first time in more than half a century when the New START treaty expires.

There was confusion about the exact time it would lapse, though arms control experts told Reuters they believed this would happen at 2300 GMT on Wednesday - midnight in Prague, where the treaty was signed in 2010.

Matt Korda, associate director for the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists, said that if there was no agreement to extend its key provisions, neither Russia nor the United States would be constrained if they wanted to add yet more warheads.

"Without the treaty, each side will be free to upload hundreds of additional warheads onto their deployed missiles and heavy bombers, roughly doubling the sizes of their currently deployed arsenals in the most maximalist scenario," he said.

Korda said it was important to recognise that the expiry of New START did not necessarily mean an arms race given the cost of nuclear weapons.

U.S. President Donald Trump has given different signals on arms control. He said last month that if the treaty expired , he would do a better agreement.

So far, Russian officials said, there has been no response from Washington on President Vladimir Putin's proposal to extend the limits of the treaty beyond expiry.

Total inventories of nuclear warheads declined to about 12,000 warheads in 2025 from a peak of more than 70,000 in 1986, but the United States and Russia are upgrading their weapons and China has more than doubled its arsenal over the past decade.

Arms control supporters in Moscow and Washington say the expiry of the treaty would not only remove limits on warheads but also damage confidence, trust and the ability to verify nuclear intentions.

Opponents of arms control on both sides say such benefits are nebulous at best and that such treaties hinder nuclear innovation by major powers, allow cheating and essentially narrow the room for manoeuvre of great powers.

Last year, Trump said that he wanted China to be part of arms control and questioned why the United States and Russia should build new nuclear weapons given that they had enough to destroy the world many times over.

"If there's ever a time when we need nuclear weapons like the kind of weapons that we're building and that Russia has and that China has to a lesser extent but will have, that's going to be a very sad day," he said in February last year.

"That's going to be probably oblivion."</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 09:44:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ZO6SHJLI25IELBXE4EBM67RY3E.jpg?auth=88629a5f5502bc21391ce529f02bb43424a0f80811335df826c56a1c9e8384af&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Storm Leo pounds Iberian Peninsula with torrential rains</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/storm-leo-pounds-iberian-peninsula-with-torrential-rains-2026-02-04/</link><description>RONDA, Spain, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Spanish and Portuguese authorities braced on Wednesday for the impact of Storm Leo, suspending classes in some areas and warning against travel, just one week after deadly Storm Kristin wreaked havoc across the Iberian Peninsula.

Spain's state meteorological agency AEMET forecast that some parts of the southern Sierra Grazalema may see rainfall equivalent to a full year of precipitation from the storm.

Authorities are concerned about the heightened risk of flooding as the ground remains saturated from the preceding storm and heavy rains last month.

Spain recorded 119.3 mm of rainfall in January, 85% above the 1992-2020 average, making it the second-wettest January of the 21st century, the Environment Ministry said.

The regional government in Spain's southern Andalusia region urged residents to avoid non-essential travel, warning that public safety alerts could quickly escalate to the highest red-alert level as the storm evolves, regional leader Juanma Moreno said.

In-person classes were suspended across the region, apart from in Almeria province, while Spain's Military Emergency Unit was on alert to provide a rapid response, including flood rescue, the stabilisation of landslide-prone areas and the monitoring of mining tailings ponds at risk of overflow.

Day centres for the elderly and disabled have been closed, and local governments in affected areas were advised to cancel outdoor sports activities, while about 3,000 people have been evacuated from areas most at risk of flooding.

High-risk regions include Grazalema, Campo de Gibraltar, Ronda and parts of Jaen, where residents received mobile alerts warning of the potential for heavy rainfall.

Emergency personnel, along with two aircraft and two helicopters, have been deployed to monitor flood-prone zones and provide real-time updates, Moreno said.

In Portugal, the national Civil Protection Service raised its preparedness to the highest level as its commander warned of a "very complex" meteorological situation ahead.

The Portuguese armed forces deployed up to 3,000 personnel and 42 inflatable boats with marine teams along flood-prone sections of the country's major rivers as weather conditions were forecast to worsen throughout the week.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 09:44:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LQJ4TA4PUJPI5HNG6IMUJNH5UI.jpg?auth=2f9ec97856b8eb53def28be0ed1bf8790f5690faf89535a5a78ddc8abb324b90&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Key South African coalition partner to get new leader in April</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/south-africas-da-leader-wont-seek-re-election-april-2026-02-04/</link><description>JOHANNESBURG, Feb 4 (Reuters) - South Africa's Democratic Alliance leader John Steenhuisen said on Wednesday that he would not seek re-election in the party's leadership contest in April but would continue in his role as agriculture minister.

Steenhuisen has led the pro-business DA since 2019 and has been overseeing the government's response to a worsening foot-and-mouth disease outbreak .

The DA is the second-biggest party in the coalition government formed in June 2024 after an election in which the African National Congress lost its parliamentary majority for the first time since the end of white minority rule in 1994.

"For the rest of this term of office, I will focus all of my time and energy as Minister of Agriculture on defeating the most devastating foot-and-mouth disease outbreak our country has ever seen," Steenhuisen told a press conference.

Political analysts say Cape Town Mayor Geordin Hill-Lewis, another senior DA member, is likely to stand for party leader in April and take over from Steenhuisen.

Steenhuisen has faced allegations that he used a party-issued credit card for personal expenses, although a DA investigation found no evidence that he had misappropriated funds.

"My term will be remembered for leading the DA into national government and putting South Africa on a new path to prosperity," he told reporters.

The DA has roughly 22% of seats in South Africa's lower house of parliament, while the ANC has 41%.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 09:45:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CRTJOWDTJBK3HC6RND6KFRQUB4.jpg?auth=537125b61297e65e37dff8a3bc42cd4970c0e682a75c38f2744611dc7d0b2be7&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>South Korea parliament to finalise bill on US investment fund by March 9</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/south-korea-parliament-finalise-bill-us-investment-fund-by-march-9-2026-02-04/</link><description>SEOUL, Feb 4 (Reuters) - South Korea's National Assembly has agreed to finalise a bill to make investments in the United States by March 9 under a trade deal between the countries, the ruling and main opposition parties said on Wednesday.

U.S. President Donald Trump threatened last week to hike tariffs on imports from South Korea, blaming a delay in enacting a trade deal in which the Asian ally promised to invest $350 billion in the United States.

A special committee will be set up on February 9 and have the power to draft the bill, which will be finalised by March 9, the two main parties' floor leaders said in a briefing.

South Korea's ruling Democratic Party in November introduced the bill to establish a special fund to finance the investment committed in the U.S. in return for lowering the tariffs to 15% on Korean autos.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 09:45:03 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/SG37C6AUHRJPJKROYZXZU4RZG4.jpg?auth=ab3f1b8b6f8e99d1c59022bf2a6fb8b6ff33ce1bd31b6fe29005f7bf9efe102d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Estonia detains ship heading for Russia suspected of smuggling</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/estonia-detains-ship-heading-russia-suspected-smuggling-2026-02-04/</link><description>COPENHAGEN, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Estonia's Tax and Customs Board said late on Tuesday it had detained a container ship sailing under the Bahamian flag in Estonia's internal waters that may be linked to smuggling from Ecuador.

"There is reason to believe that the vessel may have been used for smuggling," the authority said in a statement.

"The police special unit K-Commando boarded the ship, after which the vessel was detained under national supervision for the purpose of carrying out a customs inspection".

The ship, named Baltic Spirit, was en route from Ecuador to St. Petersburg in Russia and is not part of the Russian shadow fleet nor is it subject to European Union sanctions, they added.

Largely forgotten until recently, it is hoped this unique archive will help unravel the mystery of the rising number of younger people getting bowel cancer .

The archive contains tens of thousands of tumour and tissue specimens, some dating back to the early 20th century.

Preserved in formaldehyde and paraffin wax, they come from patients treated at the UK 's national bowel hospital, St Mark's, in northwest London.

In a study which began in January, researchers are using cutting-edge technology to compare archive tumours from the 1960s with ones from the present day.

Historically, patients treated at the hospital would have had a "very difficult time" with the disease, said Kevin Monahan, a consultant gastroenterologist, who is co-leading the groundbreaking project by St Mark's and the Institute of Cancer Research, London.

Their recovery – even after surgery – would have been "far from certain".

"We want to think about whether we can convert the suffering that they went through decades ago into a new hope for their grandchildren and their great grandchildren and others who might be at risk," he said.

The growing numbers of younger people being diagnosed with bowel cancer has left doctors worldwide perplexed.

According to Bowel Cancer UK, cases of the disease in people under 50 in Britain have increased by over 50 percent in the past 25 years.

Over 2,600 cases are diagnosed annually out of the nearly 44,000 cases across all age groups.

Research published by Bristol University and others in the British Journal of Surgery in 2020 showed an "exponential increase" over a similar period, with the conclusions supported by findings from both European and American studies.

"We can't time travel back to the 1960s... to see what people were exposed to (but)... in a way we have a record of it... within these boxes," Monahan said.

The bowel cancer expert and co-study lead, Trevor Graham of the London institute, aims to map how the DNA differs in the 1960s specimens from the ones of the current day.

By sequencing the DNA and using other laboratory techniques that "weren't possible even five years ago", they hope to pinpoint what is driving modern-day cases.

The project comes around a decade after the entire archive at St Mark's was nearly consigned to the hospital incinerator.

But after medics persuaded managers to hold on to it for a little longer, it was saved.

One ledger of yellowing pages vividly evokes the cases of patients from 1919, the year after the end of World War I .

The neatly-typed medical notes are accompanied with hand-drawn specimen pictures by the doctors.

Changes to diet, lifestyle and environmental pollutants such as microplastics have all been suggested as potential causes of the rise in cases, but definitive proof has been elusive.

Monahan's own hunch centres on a subtype of the E. coli bacteria in the gut.

"This bacteria may be carcinogenic, and the mark of that carcinogen in DNA has been found in younger people with bowel cancer under 50, four times as commonly as it has been in people with all cancer after the age of 50," he said.

If caught early, 90 percent of cases can be successfully treated, according to the National Health Service.

But Monahan said a bowel cancer diagnosis could be devastating for younger patients still juggling young families and trying to progress in their careers.

"Someone who's 35... very rarely do they think: 'Oh, I might have bowel cancer,'" he said.

Bowel cancer was previously only rarely seen in patients in their 20s and 30s.

Many younger patients wrongly blame themselves, Monahan said.

Exercising regularly and maintaining a healthy weight are important for general health, he stressed, but there are other factors when it comes to bowel cancer.

"Where I see people who are newly diagnosed with bowel cancer at a young age, they say: 'Why? Why has this happened to me? Because I'm healthy. I eat healthy, I exercise regularly.'

"And I say to them: 'It's nothing to do with what you have done.'"

The research project is expected to report its findings in three years.

Thanks to the archive, the researchers had a "great legacy", Monahan added. "We have an opportunity here to use that legacy."</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 09:45:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/6fe2388c-0177-11f1-b112-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/66094c651a7cdf1a3b42bd1e26c266daedf27282.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran demands Oman venue for US talks amid rising regional tensions</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260204-iran-demands-oman-venue-for-us-talks-amid-rising-regional-tensions</link><description>Iran is demanding that talks with the US this week be held in Oman , not Turkey , and that the scope be narrowed to two-way negotiations on nuclear issues only, a regional source said on Tuesday, adding new complications to an already delicate diplomatic effort.

Iran's move to change the venue and agenda for the talks, scheduled for Friday in Istanbul, comes amid heightened tensions as the US builds up forces in the Middle East .

Regional players have pushed for a resolution of a standoff that has led to mutual threats of air strikes and stirred fears of escalation into a wider war.

The US military on Tuesday shot down an Iranian drone that “aggressively” approached the Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea, the US military said, in an incident first reported by Reuters.

US President Donald Trump , who warned on Monday that “bad things” would probably happen if a deal could not be reached with Iran, told reporters at the White House on Tuesday: “We are negotiating with them right now.” He did not elaborate and declined to say where he expected the talks to take place.

The regional diplomat with knowledge of Iran's demands said Tehran sought “to change the format, they want to change the scope”.

“They only want to discuss the nuclear file with the Americans, while the US wants to include other topics such as the (ballistic) missiles and the activities of Iran's proxies in the region.”

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News that talks with Iran were still scheduled to take place later this week.

Iran's foreign ministry spokesperson said consultations on the venue were still under way, Iranian Nour News reported later on Tuesday. The spokesperson said planning has been carried out to hold the negotiations in the coming days and that Turkey, Oman and several other countries had expressed readiness to host the meeting.

A source familiar with the situation said earlier on Tuesday that Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner was due to take part in the talks, along with US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Aragchi.

Ministers from several other countries in the region, including Pakistan , Saudi Arabia , Qatar , Egypt and the United Arab Emirates , had also been expected to attend, but the regional source told Reuters that Tehran now wants only bilateral talks with the US.

The US naval buildup follows Iran's violent crackdown against anti-government demonstrations last month.

Trump, who stopped short of carrying out threats to intervene, has since demanded nuclear concessions from Iran and sent a flotilla to its coast .

The priority of the diplomatic effort is to avoid conflict and de-escalate tension, a second regional official told Reuters earlier.

Iran’s leadership is increasingly worried a US strike could break its grip on power by driving an already enraged public back onto the streets, according to six current and former Iranian officials.

With tensions running high, an Iranian Shahed-139 drone flying toward the Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier “with unclear intent” was shot down by an F-35 US fighter jet, the US military said.

Iran's Tasnim news agency said connection had been lost with a drone in international waters, but the reason was unknown.

US Central Command said in another incident on Tuesday, this one in the Strait of Hormuz , Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps forces harassed a US-flagged tanker.

“Two IRGC boats and an Iranian Mohajer drone approached M/V Stena Imperative at high speeds and threatened to board and seize the tanker,” said Navy Captain Tim Hawkins, a spokesperson for Central Command.

Maritime risk management group Vanguard said the Iranian boats ordered the tanker to stop its engine and prepare to be boarded. Instead, the tanker sped up and continued its voyage.

Hawkins said a US Navy warship, the McFaul, was operating in the area and escorted the Stena Imperative, which was “proceeding safely”.

Earlier, the United Arab Emirates , a highly influential Gulf Arab oil producer and close US ally, said the region cannot afford another conflict and negotiations are needed.

Gulf Arab states are worried that Iran will carry out its threat to target US bases on their territory should Trump attack the Islamic Republic again.

In June, the United States struck Iranian nuclear targets, joining in at the close of a 12-day Israeli bombing campaign. Since then, Tehran has said its uranium enrichment work – which it says is for peaceful, not military, purposes – has stopped.

Iranian sources said last week that Trump had demanded three conditions for the resumption of talks: zero enrichment of uranium in Iran, limits on Tehran's ballistic missile programme, and ending its support for regional proxies.

Iran has long said all three demands are unacceptable infringements of its sovereignty, but two Iranian officials told Reuters that its clerical rulers saw the ballistic missile programme, rather than uranium enrichment, as the bigger obstacle.

One Iranian official said there should be no preconditions and Tehran is ready to show flexibility on uranium enrichment, including handing over 400 kg of highly enriched uranium, accepting zero enrichment.

Tehran's regional influence has been weakened by Israel's attacks on its proxies – from Hamas in Gaza to Hezbollah in Lebanon , the Houthis in Yemen and militias in Iraq – as well as by the ousting of Iran's close ally, former Syrian President Bashar al-Assad .</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 09:45:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/acbd8a52-0151-11f1-bd4e-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26030462309994.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukraine, Russia begin second round of US-brokered peace talks in Abu Dhabi</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/ukraine-russia-begin-second-round-us-brokered-peace-talks-abu-dhabi-2026-02-04/</link><description>KYIV, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Ukrainian and Russian negotiators began a second round of U.S.-brokered talks in Abu Dhabi on Wednesday, seeking to advance efforts to end Europe's biggest conflict since World War Two.

The two-day trilateral meetings come after President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said that Russia had exploited a U.S.-backed energy truce last week to stockpile munitions, attacking Ukraine with a record number of ballistic missiles on Tuesday.

"Another round of negotiations has begun in Abu Dhabi. The negotiation process started in a trilateral format — Ukraine, the United States, and Russia," Rustem Umerov, Ukraine's top negotiator, said on the Telegram app.

Umerov said that teams would also meet in separate groups to discuss specific negotiation tracks and would then follow up with a joint meeting to synchronise positions.

Over the past year, U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has pushed both Kyiv and Moscow to find a compromise to end the four-year conflict, triggered by Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, but the two sides remain far apart on key points despite several rounds of talks with U.S. officials.

The most sensitive issues are Moscow's demands that Kyiv give up land it still controls and the fate of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe's largest, which sits in a Russian-occupied area.

Moscow wants Kyiv to pull its troops out of all of the eastern Donetsk region, including a belt of heavily fortified cities regarded as one of Ukraine's strongest defences, as a precondition for any deal.

Ukraine said the conflict should be frozen along the current front line and has rejected any unilateral pullback of its forces.

Russia currently occupies about 20% of Ukraine's national territory, including Crimea and parts of the eastern Donbas region seized before the 2022 invasion.

Military analysts have said that Russian forces have gained about 1.5% of Ukrainian territory since the start of 2024.

Polls show that the majority of Ukrainians oppose a deal that hands Moscow land. Kyiv residents told Reuters on Wednesday they were sceptical the new round of talks would bring any major breakthroughs.

"Let's hope that it will change (something), of course. But I don't believe it will change anything now. We will not give in, and they will not give in either," Serhii, 38, a taxi driver, told Reuters.

The first round of talks was held in the UAE last month, marking the first direct public negotiations between Moscow and Kyiv.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 10:39:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/NLRXNNQWLNNQFIOEZBKGML7CUU.jpg?auth=686e90c4c6db713ee9b8cf080803d2bf997a48330e810aade9166f2a5c72bba5&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Socialist poised to defeat far-right leader in Portugal presidential vote, poll shows</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/socialist-poised-defeat-far-right-leader-portugal-presidential-vote-poll-shows-2026-02-04/</link><description>LISBON, Feb 4 (Reuters) - The moderate Socialist candidate is poised for a decisive victory over the populist far-right leader in Sunday's presidential election run-off in Portugal, according to a new poll.

Antonio Jose Seguro, ex-Socialist leader, leads with 67% in voting intentions, versus 33% for the leader of anti-establishment Chega, Andre Ventura, according to the survey by Catolica University pollsters released by broadcaster RTP late Tuesday.

In the five decades since Portugal's Carnation Revolution ended authoritarian rule, a presidential runoff has occurred only once before, in 1986, highlighting political fragmentation and voter frustration with mainstream parties amid the far-right's rise.

Portugal's presidency is largely ceremonial, but plays a key role in mediating the country's divided political landscape and holds powers to veto legislation and dismiss the government.

Seguro has said he would be a moderate, unifying president, independent of partisan politics, and would not act as a "shadow prime minister", refusing to interfere in the government's day-to-day role.

By contrast, Ventura has warned he would be "an interventionist president", vowing to fight decades of mainstream party corruption and advancing a strong anti-immigration agenda.

He faces criticism for remarks seen as racist towards the Roma community and South Asian immigrants.

Chega, founded less than seven years ago, emerged last May as the main opposition force after winning 22.8% of the vote in a parliamentary election.

Ventura's critics say he is only using the presidential election to further strengthen and expand his party's presence in the country.

The survey, conducted between January 29 and February 2, interviewed 1,601 people and has a margin of error of 2.4%.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 10:39:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/E5UA324NQ5L7VOZKW7SYVFQP7I.jpg?auth=ea539fb6fa416198125f2dadb2c56289af8bf4a2128fcb92a106cd233f8745ce&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Pope Leo urges Russia and US to renew last nuclear arms treaty</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/pope-leo-urges-russia-us-renew-last-nuclear-arms-treaty-2026-02-04/</link><description>VATICAN CITY, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Pope Leo on Wednesday urged leaders in Russia and the United States to renew their last nuclear arms control treaty, New START , which caps the number of strategic nuclear weapons deployed by each country.

Leo, the first U.S. pope, said during his weekly audience at the Vatican that the current world situation "calls for doing everything possible to avert a new arms race."

The treaty, signed in 2010, is due to expire on Thursday. Russian President Vladimir Putin proposed in September that the treaty could be informally extended for another year, but as of Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump had not responded.

"I issue an urgent appeal not to let this instrument lapse," said the pope. "It is more urgent than ever to replace the logic of fear and distrust with a shared ethic, capable of guiding choices toward the common good."

The expiring of New START would mark the end of more than half a century of constraints on nuclear weapons.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 10:40:43 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/NU4Y55YRQNMNDJZLEIRTHTZX44.jpg?auth=265d6b6dec1a036936fed00bc9da61c0dd75732038ec4fe8feac47c92380cc71&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Vital aid flights to Houthi-held capital in Yemen to resume, says UN</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/vital-aid-flights-houthi-held-capital-yemen-resume-says-un-2026-02-04/</link><description>GENEVA, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Vital aid flights to the Houthi-controlled capital of Yemen, blocked for a month by the Iran-aligned group, will resume this month, allowing critical supplies to reach millions in need amid a worsening humanitarian crisis, the U.N. said on Wednesday.

The Houthis' decision on Tuesday to approve flights for the month of February will allow aid groups to enter and exit the capital, Sanaa, which is under the group's control, U.N. Resident Coordinator and Humanitarian Coordinator for Yemen Julien Harneis said in a statement.

The U.N. has warned of a worsening humanitarian crisis in Yemen with some 21 million people needing aid, including millions living in Houthi-controlled areas.

Yemen has suffered 11 years of conflict between the Houthis, who seized the capital Sanaa in 2014, and the internationally recognised government based in Aden. Some 4.8 million people are internally displaced and nearly half a million children require treatment for severe malnutrition.

On Friday, the U.N. had said the Houthis had not let the U.N. Humanitarian Air Service fly to Sanaa for over a month or to the city of Marib for over four months. These flights are the only way for NGO workers to enter and exit Houthi-controlled areas, Harneis said, and U.N. operations are limited to government-held areas.

The Houthis have previously described the work of some U.N. agencies as a political, military and intelligence operation aimed at subjugating Yemenis - allegations the United Nations denies.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 10:41:04 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7HNSHAEN2ZL3LODSQI2KPEHBHU.jpg?auth=dc376cfaee0bcfebaac9cfa99da5bbf11ae760c7bef2cc96de6dde48ee19f094&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Myanmar junta plans 'super-body' to tighten grip on military, new government</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/myanmar-junta-plans-super-body-tighten-grip-military-new-government-2026-02-04/</link><description>Feb 4 (Reuters) - Myanmar's junta will form a new entity to oversee both the military and civilian administration, a move experts say will allow paramount ruler Min Aung Hlaing to become president without loosening his grip on the powerful armed forces.

Just days after the completion of a final phase of an election that will see a parliament convene next month and power transferred to a nominally civilian government, the junta announced its plans in state media late Tuesday to create the five-member Union Consultative Council.

Its mandate is exceptionally broad, granting it control over every critical component of national security and the legislative process, said Naing Min Khant, program associate at the Institute for Strategy and Policy - Myanmar think-tank.

"The formation of the Union Consultative Council represents a significant institutional shift, likely to create a 'super-body' designed to hold supreme authority above the executive, legislative, and judicial branches," Naing Min Khant said.

A spokesperson for the junta did not answer calls seeking comment on the council.

Min Aung Hlaing took control of Myanmar in a 2021 coup that ousted a civilian government led by Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi and triggered widespread protests that expanded into a nationwide civil war.

More than 93,000 people have since been killed in violence in Myanmar, according to the Armed Conflict Location &amp; Event Data Project.

The 69-year-old Min Aung Hlaing has indicated he intends to hand over "state responsibilities" to the next government. He is widely expected to become president.

The military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party swept the election , winning 81% of available upper and lower house seats in a contest criticised by the United Nations, some Western nations and rights groups as a one-sided exercise to keep the ruling generals in power through proxies.

State-run media did not provide a reason for why the council was being formed.

According to two lawyers, it will potentially enable Min Aung Hlaing to become president while ensuring he retains full control over the military, which has governed Myanmar for five of the past six decades.

It would also ensure he had control over the civilian-led administration and legislative matters, they said.

"I believe that this newly appointed Union Consultative Council will oversee the new (military) Commander-in-Chief on one hand, and the government on the other," said Kyee Myint, adding that the body would prevent any successor to Min Aung Hlaing as military chief from holding too much power.

But there appears to be no oversight for the new council, according to Naing Min Khant.

"A defining feature of this arrangement is its total lack of accountability," he said.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 10:41:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/E6FK432RMZKPVDJ2VAPY27FP6I.jpg?auth=75b9708bd7e22215b4530ecb62edac6a9cdb52022ca54f5020f1823f6db742c2&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US hosts countries for talks to weaken China's grip on critical minerals</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/us-hosts-countries-talks-weaken-chinas-grip-critical-minerals-2026-02-04/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Feb 4 (Reuters) - The United States will host more than 50 countries on Wednesday for talks aimed at boosting their access to critical minerals, in a bid to loosen China's grip over vital industrial inputs that has allowed it to control global supply chains.

The gathering comes after President Donald Trump on Monday launched a strategic stockpile of critical minerals, called Project Vault , backed by $10 billion in seed funding from the U.S. Export-Import Bank and $2 billion in private funding.

China has wielded its chokehold on the processing of many minerals as geo-economic leverage, at times curbing exports and suppressing prices and undercutting other countries' ability to diversify sources of the materials used to make semiconductors, electric vehicles and advanced weapons.

South Korea, India, Thailand, Japan, Germany, Australia, and the Democratic Republic of Congo are among countries attending the Washington meeting, though the U.S. has not released a full list.

Beijing's expanded export controls on rare earths last year caused production delays and shutdowns for auto manufacturers in Europe and the U.S., and a China-generated glut of lithium has stalled plans to expand production in the U.S.

Such dependencies have unnerved Washington and its partners, which nonetheless have struggled for years to implement policies to stand up durable domestic mining and processing alternatives for lithium, nickel, rare earths and other critical minerals.

China's leverage was on full display in October when Trump agreed to trim tariffs on the country in exchange for Beijing's pledge to hold off on stricter restrictions on rare earths exports.

The talks underscore a broader U.S. push to work with partners to counter China's dominance over critical minerals by coordinating policy tools at a time when Trump has angered allies with his sweeping "America First" tariff policies.

Washington and its partners are weighing measures that include aligning trade and investment incentives, encouraging new mining and processing capacity outside China, and exploring market interventions such as price floors, strategic stockpiles and export restrictions to reduce Beijing's leverage over supply chains vital to advanced manufacturing and national security.

"I think this is a recognition by the United States that it must act in concert with others to reduce its vulnerability in areas where China has supply dominance," said Scott Kennedy, who leads the Chinese business and economics program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.

U.S. Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum said on Tuesday that 11 more countries would be named to a critical minerals trade club this week, joining the U.S., Australia, Japan, South Korea, Saudi Arabia and Thailand. He said 20 more countries showed "strong interest" in joining the coalition.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Vice President JD Vance will deliver remarks at the meeting of ministers from across Europe, Asia, Africa and Latin America, which according to the State Department, aims to "advance collective efforts to strengthen and diversify critical minerals supply chains."

"China has long played an important and constructive role in keeping the global industrial and supply chains of critical minerals safe and stable and is willing to continue to make active efforts in this regard," China's embassy in Washington told Reuters when asked about the meeting.

Industry experts say countries must find the right balance of incentives to boost investment in critical minerals production.

Those could include deploying newly created Section 232 tariffs in coordination with allies to establish industry-wide price floors for specific materials.

The Trump administration last year struck a price-floor agreement with rare earths producer MP Materials, but Reuters has reported the administration may now be moving away from company-specific deals in favor of a broader, international approach.

Washington's Group of Seven partners and the European Union have considered price floors , opens new tab to promote rare earth production, as well as taxes on some Chinese exports to incentivize investment.

Australia, which has been positioning itself as a critical minerals alternative to China, has also said it would establish a strategic reserve of minerals, expected to be ready by the second half of 2026.

Canberra is also considering setting a price floor to support local critical minerals projects.

"The reality is that none of us have tested these tools in this context. So, we're looking to see which will be most effective. Most likely it will be a bit of a menu of tools ... I don't think there's going to be a one silver bullet," one meeting participant told Reuters on condition of anonymity.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 10:41:27 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/I7GSK7W2ZRKOTLEK2L5T3TOLVA.jpg?auth=c3c419c43fe2e20e8151c9236e643ae9accd7f8fcaf745504dd2488a908bfcf8&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>In pictures: Northern Morocco floods force evacuation of 50,000 people</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/africa/20260204-in-pictures-northern-morocco-floods-force-evacuation-50-000-people</link><description>More than 50,000 people have been evacuated from their homes in northern Morocco due to severe weather and heavy rainfall affecting several provinces, the interior ministry said on Tuesday.

The evacuations began on Friday, mostly in Larache province, where the city of Ksar El Kebir – about 100 kilometres (62 miles) south of Tangier – has seen significant flooding, the ministry said.

Evacuees were partly taken in by relatives elsewhere, while those requiring assistance were sent to temporary shelters set up by the authorities, the ministry said.

Morocco's national weather service forecast heavy rains, strong winds and snowfall at altitudes above 1,500 metres from Monday to Wednesday in several provinces.

Authorities said the Moroccan army had been deployed to support relief efforts on the instructions of King Mohammed VI .

Last December, 37 people were killed in sudden floods in Safi, in Morocco's deadliest weather-related disaster in the past decade.

In recent weeks, severe weather and flooding in neighbouring Algeria killed two people, including a child.

In Tunisia , at least five people are dead, with others still missing, after the country saw its heaviest rainfall in over 70 years last month.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 10:42:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/ad022144-01ab-11f1-bcde-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-02-02T182851Z-160873474-RC2ACJAMMSSM-RTRMADP-3-MOROCCO-FLOODS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Libyan prosecutors open probe into killing of Gaddafi's son Seif al-Islam</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/africa/20260204-libyan-prosecutors-open-probe-into-killing-of-gaddaffi-son-seif-al-islam</link><description>Libyan prosecutors said Wednesday they were investigating the killing of Seif al-Islam Gaddafi , son of slain ruler Muammar Gaddafi , in the city of Zintan.

The public prosecutor's office said forensic experts had been dispatched to Zintan in northwest Libya, where he was shot dead, adding that efforts were underway to identify suspects.

"The victim died from wounds by gunfire," the office said in a statement, adding that investigators were looking to "speak to witnesses and anyone who may be able to shed light on the incident".

A lawyer of Seif al-Islam, Marcel Ceccaldi, said he was killed by an unidentified "four-man commando" who stormed his house in Zintan on Tuesday.

Libya has struggled to recover from profound instability that erupted after a NATO-backed uprising in 2011 overthrew Muammar Gaddafi.

Libya remains divided between a UN-backed government based in Tripoli and an eastern administration backed by Khalifa Haftar .

Neither authority has commented on Seif al-Islam's death.

The only public reaction came from Moussa al-Kouni, vice-president of the Presidential Council representing the Fezzan region.

"No to political assassinations, no to achieving demands by force, and no to violence as a language or a means of expression," he wrote on X.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 10:42:47 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/397a72c4-01b2-11f1-a083-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/000-962U6WK.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Xi, Putin hail ties in video call as Ukraine war nears anniversary</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/xi-putin-hail-ties-video-call-ukraine-war-nears-anniversary-2026-02-04/</link><description>BEIJING, Feb 4 (Reuters) - China's President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin both hailed their ties during a video call on Wednesday held in the run-up to the fourth anniversary of Moscow's war in Ukraine .

Putin said the Moscow-Beijing relationship was an important stabilising factor at a time of growing global turbulence, in a Russian state television broadcast of the talks.

Xi, speaking via an interpreter, called for the countries to work out a "grand plan" to further bilateral relations which he said were advancing in the right direction.

China and Russia declared a "no limits" strategic partnership days before Putin sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine in February 2022.

Since then, China has emerged as an economic lifeline for Russia by stepping up trade with the northern neighbour while Western powers piled sanctions on Moscow.

Xi and Putin last met in Beijing when China staged a massive military parade in September that was also attended by North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un.

During that meeting, Xi said China-Russia ties had "withstood international turbulence" and pledged to coordinate with Moscow on issues concerning their core interests.

Ukraine and Europe have accused Beijing of providing direct military aid to Russia's war effort. Beijing denies the accusations and says it is not a party to the conflict.

On Tuesday, senior diplomats of the two countries met in Beijing to discuss the global security situation and other issues and reached "broad consensus", the Chinese foreign ministry said.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 11:33:56 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CWIXRLIRZBK5BBVLCANKSWJ65Q.jpg?auth=8529ca334d9290d0dd8df7a76dbf07905eeb9c1618cdccf185ca272d917df253&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Greenland shatters temperature record, redrawing economy from fishing to minerals</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/cop/greenland-shatters-temperature-record-redrawing-economy-fishing-minerals-2026-02-04/</link><description>NUUK, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Greenland, the Arctic island coveted by U.S. President Donald Trump, experienced its warmest January on record this year, as a rate of warming four times faster than the global average redraws the outlook for sectors from fishing to mining.

Trump has said the U.S. must own Greenland, an autonomous part of the Kingdom of Denmark, for security reasons although he has backed away from threats to take the island by force .

Preliminary temperature readings from the Danish Meteorological Institute in the Greenlandic capital Nuuk averaged +0.2 degrees Celsius (32.4 degrees Fahrenheit) in January, the highest on record and well above the historical average of -7.7 degrees between 1991 and 2020.

"Climate change is already clearly visible on Greenland," said Jacob Hoyer, head of the National Centre for Climate Research at the Danish Meteorological Institute.

"From the records we can see that it is warming four times faster than the mean temperature hike in the world."

The warm weather means sea ice extends less far south along the coast each winter and is thinner even where it does exist, making it difficult to use for transport, according to Hoyer.

It can also affect the mainstay of Greenland's economy - fishing. Catches of mainly shrimp, halibut and cod are the biggest export and accounted for 23% of gross domestic product in 2023, according to Statistics Greenland, while the industry provides 15% of all jobs.

"The waters around Greenland are also warming up, and that can change the ecosystem and the fishery business. It will most likely have an impact," said Hoyer, adding it was too early to tell exactly how.

While Trump has chiefly highlighted security concerns, Greenland also holds strategic mineral resources that could play a part in the power struggle for the island. A Danish survey published in 2023 showed 25 of the 34 minerals deemed "critical raw materials" by the European Commission were found there.

Red tape surrounding mining concessions, harsh conditions and opposition from indigenous groups have historically made mining expensive. The flip side of the warming climate could be that such ventures become more profitable as extraction and shipping become less costly, Hoyer said.

Still, businesses in many established sectors face uncertainty in the here and now. Casper Moller, owner of a company providing tours for tourists, says the lack of snow and ice makes these difficult by snowmobile or skis.

"So, what we are doing at this moment is just crossing our fingers that we will reach more snow quite soon," he said.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 11:34:07 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/OY3FQFZKDBPHBAKL4XPRSZ74RY.jpg?auth=ad0f8a92819c8a033f2a0c79c1c3c6f3be07ed6e150019e27cfc1d37350dc560&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuelan expats who helped propel Canada oil sands growth see return home as unlikely</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/venezuelan-expats-who-helped-propel-canada-oil-sands-growth-see-return-home-2026-02-04/</link><description>CALGARY, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Professional engineer Luis Cabana couldn't take a walk in downtown Calgary in the mid-2000s without someone he knew calling out to him in Spanish.

Office towers in the corporate heart of Canada's oil and gas sector were at the time heavily populated with Venezuelan expats who had fled persecution and economic stagnation in their home country.

Wintry and vast, Canada is geographically far from the heat and humidity of Venezuela. But the oil sands of northern Alberta and Venezuela's Orinoco Belt produce a remarkably similar variety of thick, tar-like heavy crude, a fact that over the decades prompted thousands of Venezuela's best and brightest engineers, scientists and geologists to move to cities like Calgary, Edmonton and Fort McMurray.

"We were over-represented. I knew another professional at every single company downtown," said Cabana, who came to Canada in 2006 and spent more than a decade in project management positions in Canada's energy sector.

These expats helped Canada develop its oil sands and become the world's largest producer of heavy crude, even as Venezuela's own oil production declined. And in spite of U.S. President Donald Trump's stated goal to revive Venezuela's oil industry, many Venezuelans who built careers in Canada say they are unlikely to return to the country of their birth as they have built lives elsewhere.

Trump's move to revive Venezuela's oil industry has sparked anxiety in Canada, as an increase in heavy oil supply from Venezuela could displace some of the oil that refiners in the United States buy from Canada.

A significant increase in Venezuelan output is unlikely for years, however, because U.S. companies are reluctant to invest in big-ticket, multi-year projects without signs of long-term political stability and a new legal framework with wide endorsement in the South American country.

Reuters spoke to four Venezuelans in Canada, each of whom came to the country during one of several waves of migration starting in the early 2000s. One of the most significant occurred between 2001 and 2010, after the rise of Hugo Chavez's regime, and following a massive strike at state-owned oil company PDVSA and the resulting collapse of the Venezuelan oil industry.

Some of the 7,450 Venezuelans who - according to federal statistics - came to Canada during that period had occupied senior roles at PDVSA. Chemist Pedro Pereira, who had been director of PDVSA's technology strategy and was blacklisted by the Venezuelan government after the strike, took a position at the University of Calgary where he led nanotechnology research for oil sands applications. He also recruited dozens of other Venezuelans with expertise in heavy oil to join him.

"I ended up producing technology not for Venezuela – which was the country that paid abundantly for the education of all these people – but for Canada," said Pereira, who today runs his own Calgary-based tech company focused on renewable energy.

Many other Venezuelans migrated to the oil sands hub of Fort McMurray, a small, northern Alberta city surrounded by boreal forest.

"When I got there it was minus 35 (Celsius), and when I left Caracas, it was plus 25, so it was a bit of a shock," said Lino Carrillo, who had worked in heavy oil processing and refining in Venezuela before being recruited by Canada's Suncor Energy in 2004.

Venezuela's oil industry decline coincided with the growth of Canada's, as the early part of this century was a period of significant oil sands expansion driven by high oil prices and technological breakthroughs.

"People appreciated the Venezuelan knowledge," said Carrillo. "I believe Canada would have accomplished what it did with the development of the oil sands anyway, but what they did was they brought in people with 15, 20 years of experience and that helped shortcut the path."

Carrillo, who worked in a number of senior oil sands management positions and is now retired, maintains close ties to Venezuela and even worked directly on the development of opposition party leader Maria Machado's energy platform .

Machado, who fled the South American nation in a daring seaborne escape in December, is competing for Trump's ear with members of Venezuela's government and seeking to ensure she has a role in governing the nation going forward.

Many expats say even if Venezuela begins to rebuild its oil industry and returns to democracy, a reverse wave of migration from Canada's oil sands back to the Orinoco Belt is unlikely.

"Venezuelan expats have lots of conversations about 'will they go back, how can they help their country recover,'" said Pereira. "But it's two generations that have passed now, and the ones that have expertise, most of them are at least 55 years old."</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 11:34:52 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CCCENAUSVZP2RJVJ4F2CN7HNQU.jpg?auth=06e4bbad6a636ac317ce9d66fda395d0a0e2b1ae01dbdf5485b28404ba8e827f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Man convicted of attempting to assassinate Trump to be sentenced</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/man-convicted-attempting-assassinate-trump-be-sentenced-2026-02-04/</link><description>FORT PIERCE, Florida, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Ryan Routh , a man accused of hiding in the bushes of a Florida golf course with a semi-automatic rifle to try to assassinate Donald Trump less than two months before the 2024 U.S. election that returned him to the presidency, is set to be sentenced on Wednesday.

Prosecutors have asked U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon to sentence Routh to life in prison during the hearing in Fort Pierce, Florida. Routh, 59, was convicted by a jury last September of five criminal counts including attempted assassination after serving as his own defense lawyer at trial .

Prosecutors said in a court filing that Routh's crimes "undeniably warrant a life sentence" because he had plotted the assassination for months, was willing to kill anybody who got in the way and has expressed neither regret nor remorse.

Routh has asked the judge, a Trump appointee, to impose a 27-year term.

In a court filing, Routh denied that he intended to kill Trump, and said he was willing to undergo psychological treatment for a personality disorder in prison. Routh suggested that jurors were misled about the facts of the case by his inability to mount a proper legal defense at trial.

Routh, who at the time of his arrest had resided most recently in Hawaii after previously living in North Carolina, also was convicted of three illegal firearm possession charges and one count of impeding a federal officer during his arrest.

Secret Service agents spotted Routh hiding in bushes a few hundred yards (meters) from where Trump was golfing at Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach on September 15, 2024. Routh fled the scene and left behind an assault-style rifle but was later arrested.

The incident occurred two months after a bullet fired by a gunman grazed Trump's ear at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Both incidents came in the run-up to the November 2024 election in which Trump regained the presidency after having been defeated four years earlier by Democrat Joe Biden.

Trump, a Republican, turned the attempted assassinations into a campaign issue, saying the U.S. Justice Department under Biden could not be trusted with investigations.

Prosecutors said Routh arrived in South Florida about a month before the incident, staying at a truck stop and tracking Trump's movements and schedule.

Routh carried six cellphones and used fake names to conceal his identity, according to trial evidence, and prosecutors said he lay in wait in thick bushes for nearly 10 hours on the day of the incident. Investigators on the scene found the assault-style rifle, two bags containing body armor-like metal plates and a video camera pointed at the golf course.

Routh pleaded not guilty in the case but fired his lawyers and opted to represent himself at trial despite lacking any formal legal training.

His meandering opening statement touched on topics including the origin of the human species and the settlement of the American West before he was cut off by Cannon, who warned him against making a mockery of the courtroom. Routh's defense strategy focused on what he described as his nonviolent nature, but he offered little pushback as a parade of law enforcement witnesses detailed the evidence in the case.

Prosecutor John Shipley told jurors that Routh's plot was "carefully crafted and deadly serious," adding that without the Secret Service's intervention "Donald Trump would not be alive."

After the jury read the verdict, Routh appeared to try to stab himself with a pen several times and had to be restrained by U.S. marshals. His daughter yelled in court that her father had not hurt anyone and that she would get him out of prison.

Trump lauded the verdict in a post on his Truth Social site, writing, "This was an evil man with an evil intention, and they caught him."</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 11:35:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WNHPPXBGLVLCDJFPL5DWFRXORI.jpg?auth=dff60a1d0483fcc96e108980e207d16fe90f4a21294603acc6593d0426c0e1fc&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Exclusive: State prisons grew deadlier and more violent amid guard shortage</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/state-prisons-grew-deadlier-more-violent-amid-guard-shortage-review-finds-2026-02-04/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Feb 4 (Reuters) - State prisons in the United States became more violent and nearly 50% deadlier over the past five years as authorities struggled to keep enough guards on the job, according to a government-funded report to be released on Wednesday.

The United States locks away more people than any other nation, including about 1 million people in state-run prisons. The previously unreported evaluation, paid for by the U.S. Department of Justice and conducted by an initiative called Safe Inside, found that those systems are under increasing strain, even as many states sharply reduced the number of people they locked up.

“We have less staff and they’re asked to do more,” said John Wetzel, a former head of Pennsylvania’s prison system and the chairman of Safe Inside, a nonpartisan research effort focused on improving state prisons. “We’re seeing the increased deaths, increase of assaults and there’s no argument that these are going up.”

The staff shortages mean prisons have fewer people on duty to protect inmates, and fewer who can take them to medical appointments, Wetzel said.

The rising death rate came as the number of assaults on inmates increased 54% over the same period, and the number of assaults on prison staff rose 77%, the review found. The report did not include details about the raw numbers of assaults.

The death rate among state prisoners increased 47% between 2019 and 2024, the most recent years for which the organization could gather data. The deaths include homicides, suicides and violence, and the report concluded that understaffing and high turnover “likely contribute” to the increase, though researchers said they lacked enough data to prove causation.

The review based that report on conditions in 12 state prison systems; most of the rest, it said, did not report adequate information on the number of people who died in their custody. It found that the death rate was 2.8 for every 100,000 prisoners in 2019; by 2024 it had risen to 4.1.

“There is not enough personnel to provide the attention that is needed to people in state custody,” said Maria Goellner, vice president of Families Against Mandatory Minimums, which advocates reducing the number of people in prison. “So you do see increased neglect, abuse and violence, and horrendous prison conditions.”

She added part of the problem is that states are imprisoning people "who don't need to be there."

The increase in deaths was particularly sharp in some states. In Alabama, researchers documented 337 inmates who died in 2024, compared to 99 in 2019. In California, which operates one of the nation’s largest prison systems, deaths among inmates were largely unchanged even though the state cut its prison population by nearly a quarter.

Spokesmen for the Alabama and California prisons did not respond to questions about the deaths.

The researchers chose those years so that they would not capture deaths from the coronavirus pandemic, which wreaked havoc in some jails and prisons and also pushed state and local governments to free thousands of people to slow the virus’s spread. Michael Thompson, the director of Safe Inside, said the death rate has increased faster than could be explained by prisoners getting older or sicker.

Prisons throughout the United States have struggled for years to hire enough guards and other staff, and to keep the ones they have. New York , opens new tab and Florida , opens new tab have sent thousands of National Guard soldiers to fill gaps in understaffed prisons.

The Safe Inside review found understaffing cost states more than $2 billion in overtime in 2024, 80% more than five years earlier. Some prison workers told researchers that they worked multiple 18-hour shifts in a row and that some facilities were so shorthanded that it was common for guards to be unable to take a bathroom break because there was no one to fill in for them while they were gone. That pressure, in turn, makes it harder to keep workers from quitting.

In Michigan, for example, the report found that one of every six prison jobs was unfilled last year. At some prisons, almost a third of jobs were vacant.

A spokeswoman for Michigan’s Department of Corrections, Jenni Riehle, said the rate of unfilled jobs had fallen slightly since then.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 11:36:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/PXYN6JVXVJI33EEIUKDDNZ34IU.jpg?auth=66c608e7d5ee52eade77ad248ac6fc76343d7ad0903892e6486dd89ba424516f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>In Kyiv freezing under Russian attacks, a veteran plumber fights back by fixing the heat</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/kyiv-freezing-under-russian-attacks-veteran-plumber-fights-back-by-fixing-heat-2026-02-04/</link><description>KYIV, Feb 4 (Reuters) - At 66, railway worker Volodymyr Vasyliev could have long since been fully retired. Instead, he was below ground in the middle of a 24-hour shift, trying to fix pipes that had burst under a Soviet-era high-rise, part of an army of technicians drafted in to keep Ukrainians warm through the coldest winter yet of war.

As Russia keeps pounding Ukraine's heating and power system in what Ukrainians say is a campaign to freeze them into submission, fixing pipes is Vasyliev's way of fighting back.

"What, am I supposed to forgive them? Say, 'That's it, I give up'?" he said on a break from his shift in the city's northeastern outskirts. "They'll never see the day."

Ukrainian negotiators met their Russian counterparts on Wednesday in Abu Dhabi for a new round of U.S.-brokered talks aimed at ending the nearly four-year war.

Meanwhile, Moscow's forces have been hammering Ukraine's energy grid, knocking out power and heating for long periods in Kyiv and other major cities as temperatures hover as low as -20 Celsius (-4 F) in the capital.

Russia briefly paused strikes after President Vladimir Putin made a promise to U.S. President Donald Trump, but resumed them on Monday with some of its worst attacks yet, knocking out heat to more than 1,000 residential towers in Kyiv.

Vasyliev is one of a group of nearly 250 state railway workers from around the country dispatched in recent weeks to prop up recovery efforts in Kyiv. They have so far restored heating or water to 160 buildings, the company says.

During a recent visit by Reuters, he was snaking through the darkness of a damp cellar scattered with debris and dust from broken insulation. Clanking metal echoed. Another bundled worker held a hissing flame to a pipe.

Later, in his own kitchen where power had just returned after a 12-hour outage, Vasyliev teared up while recalling an elderly woman who attempted to pay him during a shift.

"Her son is fighting (in the war), and there she is with the money," he said, his voice crackling. "Our people are wonderful."

Polling suggests Russia's attacks have done little to break Ukrainians' will.

Sixty-five percent say they are ready to endure fighting as long as necessary, according to a survey released on Monday by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology. Just over half reject giving up all of the eastern Donetsk region, which Russia demands in any peace deal. The figures have not significantly shifted in months, despite the brutal winter.

"Ukrainians are once again demonstrating that they are able to survive in the most difficult conditions," wrote the institute's executive director Anton Hrushetskyi. "And not just survive, but also maintain optimism and will."</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 13:01:19 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/6UFY5FFLDRNOLJCP3BOMHQXSWQ.jpg?auth=845ee49ca52691e6f4db363d44e5ad416ce06888dad284d9cb3f17bf0c46596a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russian comedian accused of telling offensive joke about Ukraine war veteran is jailed for nearly six years</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-comedian-accused-telling-offensive-joke-about-ukraine-war-veteran-is-2026-02-04/</link><description>MOSCOW, Feb 4 (Reuters) - A Russian stand-up comedian was convicted of inciting hatred and jailed for nearly six years on Wednesday over a joke he made about a legless war veteran, which triggered outrage among nationalists and military bloggers.

A Reuters reporter in court said that the comedian, Artemy Ostanin , had been handed a sentence of five years and nine months and a fine of 300,000 roubles ($3,908).

It was the latest in a series of rulings which have harshly punished people judged by the authorities to have spoken rudely or falsely about the Russian army at a time when it is fighting in Ukraine.

Ostanin was also convicted of offending the feelings of Christians with another off-colour joke he made about Jesus, which angered Orthodox nationalists.

Ostanin, who had apologised to anyone whose feelings he had hurt, denied wrongdoing and said that the joke he made about the war veteran had made no mention of the conflict in Ukraine.

His arrest and treatment were punishment enough for any offence he had caused, Ostanin said during his trial.

Russia passed sweeping censorship laws in 2022 shortly after it went to war in Ukraine. Pro-Kremlin figures and organisations have since publicly denounced people they deem to have broken those laws, and have reported them to the authorities.

Prosecutors said the six defendants, whose trial began in November, were members of the now-banned group Palestine Action, which organised the assault on the Elbit Systems UK facility in Bristol, southwest England, in August last year.

The six – Charlotte Head, 29, Samuel Corner, 23, Leona Kamio, 30, Fatema Zainab Rajwani, 21, Zoe Rogers, 22, and Jordan Devlin, 31 – all denied charges of aggravated burglary, violent disorder and criminal damage.

Rajwani, Rogers and Devlin were found not guilty of violent disorder by a jury at London's Woolwich Crown Court, while it could not reach verdicts on the same charge against Head, Corner and Kamio after more than 36-and-a-half hours of deliberation.

Corner had also denied causing grievous bodily harm with intent for hitting a female police sergeant with a sledgehammer. The jury was unable to reach a verdict on that count.

The six defendants hugged in the dock and waved to supporters in the public gallery, who cheered loudly after the judge had left the court.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 13:02:43 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>At least seven killed, eight hurt in Russian attacks in Ukraine-controlled Donetsk, governor says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/least-seven-killed-eight-hurt-russian-attacks-ukraine-controlled-donetsk-2026-02-04/</link><description>Feb 4 (Reuters) - At least seven people were killed and eight more hurt in Russian attacks in the town of Druzhkivka in the Ukraine-controlled frontline region of Donetsk in the east, the regional governor said on Wednesday.

European NATO members including Finland have been rethinking their foreign policy strategies in recent weeks, after U.S. President Donald Trump in January inflamed tensions with his European allies over Greenland, an overseas territory belonging to Denmark.

Finland will update its foreign and security policy doctrine to reflect the changes in the international situation, Stubb told members of Parliament in a speech.

"We must honestly acknowledge that the United States is undergoing change. Its approach to its allies, as well as its way of conducting foreign policy, is also changing," he said, calling the U.S. nevertheless "an important ally".

Stubb has sought to maintain close relations with Trump to seek his support for Ukraine amid Russia's invasion and to boost Finland's own security as a neighbour to Russia.

"The foreign policy of the current U.S. administration is underpinned by an ideology that conflicts with our own values," Stubb said, giving as examples of such conflicts of values the U.S. undermining the existing international order, operating outside international institutions and downplaying the importance of Europe.

Stubb gave no timeline for the foreign and security policy review, but said the work with the government was only beginning.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 13:03:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/OE3MQRBJ45OOBGFGWT3NRIAOBA.jpg?auth=7ea16356970e6a6c5a50123ee5f2fcc72be0e585c62c985b5c79aeb2ca8778ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Quidditch team from Ugandan village harbours Harry Potter-inspired World Cup dreams</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/africa/20260204-quidditch-team-from-ugandan-village-harbours-harry-potter-inspired-world-cup-dreams</link><description>Far from the legendary skies above Hogwarts school, a young woman chased a "Golden Snitch" highlighting how the craze for Harry Potter 's favourite sport, Quidditch, has taken hold in a remote Ugandan village.

In a clearing surrounded by banana trees, around 135 kilometres (80 miles) from the capital Kampala, players ran around with sticks between their legs instead of broomsticks.

The adapted version of Quidditch is officially called quadball, and does not require the same magical or flying abilities as the sport invented by J.K. Rowling for her world-conquering fantasy books .

But it has gained a following around the world and it came to Katwadde, deep in rural southern Uganda, in 2013 thanks to primary school teacher John Ssentamu, who discovered the sport after reading a Harry Potter book over the shoulder of someone on a bus.

"The word 'Quidditch' meant nothing to me, neither in English nor in any other language, so I went on Google," Ssentamu, 47, said.

"I was like hey it's a game... it's beautiful. I think I could introduce this to my community," he said.

Ssentamu put together a team around Good Shepherd Primary school where he teaches.

Ten years of hard work paid off in 2023 when Ssentamu's team hosted and won the first national quadball tournament. The east African country now has more than 200 players.

The aim of quadball is to throw balls through hoops. But Ssentamu loves the way it combines elements of netball, football, volleyball , and rugby – and also the equality between men and women, which is an official requirement for every team.

But without magic, reality can intrude.

The team lacks the funds to travel, said Ssentamu, and despite invitations, they have been unable to attend the quadball World Cup , held every two years since 2012 in Europe or the Americas .

Thirty-one teams took part in the last World Cup, a three-day event in Belgium last year.

"My dream is to see a team from here going to the World Cup of Quidditch, because it would be a revelation for the whole world," he said.

Still, the sport has boosted the community in Katwadde, attracting children to the school in an area where education is not always a priority.

Vicky Edith Nabbanja, Ssentamu's daughter, is one of the "beaters", who can temporarily knock opposing players out of the game with dodgeballs.

"It has brought youth together and it has opened up their minds" while also helping to create "a community of belonging", the 25-year-old said.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 13:03:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/7f47659e-01b9-11f1-8400-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/000-946W2FF.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Italy foiled Russia-linked cyberattacks on embassies, Olympic sites, minister says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/italy-foiled-russia-linked-cyberattacks-embassies-olympic-sites-minister-says-2026-02-04/</link><description>MILAN, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Italy has thwarted a series of cyberattacks targeting its foreign ministry facilities, including an embassy in Washington, as well as websites linked to the Winter Olympics and hotels in Cortina d’Ampezzo, Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani said on Tuesday.

Marius Borg Hoiby, 29, son of Crown Princess Mette-Marit and stepson to Crown Prince Haakon, could face years in prison if found guilty of the most serious of the 38 charges against him.

On Tuesday, the first day of his trial, he pleaded not guilty to the most serious charges of rape and domestic violence but admitted some lesser charges, including driving too fast.

He also said he was partially guilty - a plea allowed under Norwegian law - of aggravated assault and reckless behaviour.

On Wednesday, on his first day on the witness stand, Hoiby said it was very difficult for him to give testimony, in front of so many journalists.

"It is very difficult for me to speak in front of so many people. I have been surrounded by the press since I was three. I have been harassed ever since," he said, breaking down in tears.

After a moment, he said he had received "heavy medication" and said he would try to do as much as he could.

"I am known as the son of Mummy," he said, referring to Mette-Marit. "Which means I have an extreme need for affirmation," he said. "A lot of sex, a lot of alcohol."

"Few can relate to the life I have led. A lot of parties, alcohol, some drugs," he said.

Wearing jeans and a dark blue jumper over a beige shirt, Hoiby, who spoke with his arms crossed over his chest, sometimes consulted his handwritten notes in the notebook in front of him.

Among the charges against Hoiby are one count of rape with sexual intercourse and three counts of rape without intercourse, some of which he filmed on his telephone, the prosecution has said.

He denied the videos on his phone show acts of rape.

"If I had thought I had material that showed an assault, I would never have kept that material," he said, noting he had never shared them with anyone.

Hoiby's trial is scheduled to run until March 19.

The trial comes at a time of multiple challenges for the royal family, in addition to the ongoing scrutiny of Mette-Marit over her ties to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

The royal palace told Reuters on Wednesday Mette-Marit had postponed until further notice a planned private trip abroad, without providing further details.

That news was first reported by daily Aftenposten.

An opinion poll conducted on Monday for daily newspaper Verdens Gang showed a fall in the number of Norwegians in favour of keeping the monarchy - to 61% from 72% last year - and a 10-percentage-point rise to 27% in those who want a republic.

King Harald, 88, Europe's oldest living monarch, cut back activity in 2024 after being hospitalised to treat an infection and later receiving a pacemaker.

Mette-Marit herself is in need of a lung transplant after being diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis in 2018, a chronic disease that causes scarring in the lungs and leads to a reduced oxygen uptake.

Meanwhile, King Harald's daughter, Martha Louise, stepped down from official royal duties in 2022 to allow her to more freely pursue her own business ventures, and said both she and her husband, an American self-styled shaman, would refrain from using her title as princess in a commercial setting.

They both received criticism last year for starring in a Netflix documentary chronicling their daily lives, including their wedding, and for being critical of the king and queen.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 14:08:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LHEHMEEL3VJWDKWQY6PE63T7E4.jpg?auth=9642e9ff1558751524ded28caa9c2f3cc9f4c12ec7853bf281a4c7190bd20259&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'Angel Meloni' scrubbed off Rome church painting on priest's orders</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/angel-meloni-scrubbed-off-rome-church-painting-priests-orders-2026-02-04/</link><description>ROME, Feb 4 (Reuters) - An angel restored with the face of Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has been scrubbed off a wall painting in a central Rome church on the orders of the parish priest, following a political and clerical uproar .

One of two angels in a chapel of the Basilica of St Lawrence in Lucina, close to government headquarters, was altered to look virtually identical to the 49-year-old right-wing leader, Italy's first woman premier.

The image was spotted on Saturday by centre-left newspaper la Repubblica and stirred outrage among opposition figures and irritation from Cardinal Baldo Reina, Vicar General for the diocese of Rome.

When the church opened on Wednesday, the Meloni-like face had been painted over, leaving the angel headless.

"I always said that if (the Meloni image) proved divisive we would remove it," the church priest Daniele Micheletti told Italian news agency ANSA.

"There was a procession of people that came to see it instead of listening to Mass or praying. It wasn't acceptable."

The amateur artist who restored the painting, Bruno Valentinetti, was quoted by Repubblica on Wednesday as saying he had been asked to erase it by the Vatican.

A spokesperson for the Holy See declined to comment. The Rome diocese said it would release a statement later.

On Saturday, Cardinal Reina expressed "bitterness" over the incident, ordered an investigation and warned that "images of sacred art and Christian tradition cannot be misused or exploited".

The Italian Culture Ministry also announced an inquiry, while Meloni laughed off the incident. She posted a picture of the disputed painting on Instagram, with the caption "No, I definitely don't look like an angel", and a laughing emoji.

The altered wall painting was done in 2000, and is not under any heritage protection. Valentinetti is its original author and was asked to restore it to fix water damage, priest Micheletti said on Saturday.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 14:09:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/6BY4VDXFMVIJFJQRDW45ULR43A.jpg?auth=4beb498595e345b2557463faaf5c4b67ef2b142147f1d1a164fe891a68ae0bff&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia says uranium proposal for Iran is still on the table</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/russia-says-uranium-proposal-iran-is-still-table-2026-02-04/</link><description>MOSCOW, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Russia's foreign ministry said on Wednesday that a proposal to remove uranium from Iran as part of a deal to ease U.S. concerns was still on the table, but that it was for Tehran to decide whether or not to remove it.

Despite a US-brokered truce entering its second phase last month , violence has continued in the Gaza Strip , with Israel and Hamas accusing each other of breaching the agreement.

The latest bloodshed came days after Israel partly reopened the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt, the only exit for Gazans that does not pass through Israel.

The health ministry, which operates under Hamas authority, said that 21 people were killed in a series of strikes, with at least 38 others wounded, updating an earlier figure given by the territory's civil defence agency.

Among the dead were three children, said the agency, which operates as a rescue force under the Hamas authority.

"We were sleeping when suddenly shells and gunfire rained down on us," said Abu Mohammed Haboush, whose son was killed.

"Young children were martyred, my son and my nephew were among the dead. We lost many young men," he said, adding that he and his family were living far away from the so-called "Yellow Line", where Israeli forces are stationed.

AFP images showed mourners offering prayers in the compound of Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City, where several bodies wrapped in white shrouds were laid out.

An AFP photograph showed a relative holding a body of a child wrapped in a shroud at the hospital as relatives gathered around him.

Three bodies were brought to Nasser Hospital after Israeli strikes hit homes and tents housing displaced Palestinians in the southern Khan Younis area, the civil defence agency said.

Fourteen more bodies were taken to Al-Shifa Hospital, its director Mohamed Abu Salmiya said in a statement.

"We also received dozens of wounded. The situation is extremely difficult in the hospitals of the Gaza Strip due to the severe shortage of medicines and medical supplies," Abu Salmiya said.

Israel scrutinises all aid into besieged Gaza, a tiny coastal territory surrounded by fences, walls and the Mediterranean Sea.

The Israeli military said it had launched strikes after "terrorists opened fire on troops" Wednesday, seriously wounding an officer, adding that it considers the incident a violation of the ceasefire .

It said the troops came under attack near the "Yellow Line", without specifying which side of the line the troops were on.

The ceasefire took effect after two years of war in Gaza, sparked by Hamas's October 2023 attack on Israel.

Following what was reportedly US pressure, Israel allowed the opening of the Rafah crossing, but limited passage to patients and their travel companions.

Sick and wounded Gazans have begun crossing into Egypt to seek medical treatment since Monday.

On Tuesday, 45 people crossed into Egypt and 42 entered the territory, a source at the Palestinian Red Crescent Society said.

Shortly after midnight Wednesday, those meant to enter during the day on Tuesday arrived in Gaza through Rafah in a large bus, an AFP journalist reported.

Relatives of those returning from Egypt screamed in joy, hugging and crying.

"I am so happy to be back with my husband, my children, my family, my loved ones, and of course, my homeland," Fariza Barabakh, who returned that day, said.

"It's an indescribable feeling, thank God. What can I say? My two young children didn't recognise me, but thank God. I hope it will be alright," Yusef Abu Fahma, another returnee, said.

Gaza's health ministry says at least 556 people have been killed in Israeli strikes since the ceasefire took effect on October 10, while the Israeli military says four of its soldiers have been killed over the same period.

Saturday was among the deadliest days, with the civil defence agency reporting at least 32 people killed in Israeli attacks, which the military said were in response to a Hamas ceasefire violation.

The Budapest Municipal Court declined to comment on the specific case, but said in an email: "In general, in pending case(s) it is up to the relevant judge to take the step(s), who would assess the cases in line with his/her oath taken as a judge."

Budapest, run by liberal mayor Gergely Karacsony, has been locked in a financial dispute with Orban's government over a "solidarity tax" payable to the state. The dispute contributed to a Moody's downgrade of the city's credit rating .

Orban, in power since 2010, faces a tough reelection bid in parliamentary elections set for April 12.

The European Union has suspended billions of euros worth of funding over Orban's controversial rule-of-law reforms, hitting Hungary's economy.

Invoking special emergency powers, Orban said in a decree on Tuesday the pending lawsuit over the tax for 2023–2025 would be "terminated by the court." He said the tax must be collected.

Karacsony said the move was intended to prevent the city from "fighting in the courts against the extremely unjust and unlawful solidarity contribution."

"No longer even caring about pretences, the government has directly attacked the rule of law," he said in a Facebook post.

A government spokesman did not respond to Reuters' queries.

Kristof Andras Kadar, co-chair of legal advocacy group, the Hungarian Helsinki Committee, said the decree violated a core legal principle.

"This is the separation of the branches of power, as the executive branch – which is one of the parties to the lawsuit – suddenly says the court must end the case," he said.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 15:09:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LZSO72IN7NIT7JTQQCKW3S7EQE.jpg?auth=ecc9c48f98778ef256d02ab1178e319d5f951e9a71c91b8e0661b17f8ae8c21d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UK's Starmer expresses regret over Mandelson, says ex-ambassador 'lied repeatedly'</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uks-starmer-says-mandelson-repeatedly-lied-about-epstein-regrets-appointing-him-2026-02-04/</link><description>LONDON, Feb 4 - Prime Minister Keir Starmer expressed regret on Wednesday for appointing Peter Mandelson as UK ambassador to Washington, saying the Labour veteran had created a "litany of deceit" about his ties to U.S. sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

Starmer gave way to a demand by the opposition Conservative Party that the government publish information on how Mandelson was appointed. But he sought to narrow the scope of documents to be released, saying he would not publish any that could be prejudicial to national security or international relations.

Mandelson, a government minister when Starmer's Labour Party was last in power more than 15 years ago, quit the House of Lords on Tuesday over links to Epstein, and is now under police investigation for alleged misconduct in office.

Files released by the U.S. Justice Department last week include emails suggesting Mandelson had leaked government documents to Epstein, and that Epstein had recorded payments to Mandelson or his then-partner, now husband.

Mandelson has said he does not recall having received payments. He has not commented publicly on the allegations he leaked documents, and did not respond to messages seeking comment.

Starmer defended his own response, saying he had moved quickly to strip all titles and roles from a man he accused of "betraying" Britain.

But Starmer's explanation of how Mandelson was appointed did little to quieten opposition voices, who said the ambassador's selection in late 2024 put a question mark over the judgment of Starmer and his closest adviser, Morgan McSweeney.

"I am as angry as anyone about what Mandelson has been up to. The disclosures that have been made this week of him passing sensitive information at the height of the response to the 2008 financial crash is utterly shocking and appalling," Starmer told a rowdy session of parliament.

"He has betrayed our country, he's lied repeatedly, he's responsible for a litany of deceit. But this moment demands not just anger but action and that's why we've moved quickly," he said after telling lawmakers he had agreed with King Charles to remove Mandelson from the sovereign's formal body of advisers .

Parliament was due to vote later on Wednesday on the release of documents related to Mandelson's appointment.

Starmer appointed Mandelson in late 2024, arguing that Mandelson's past work in the governments of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown and as the EU's trade commissioner made him an ideal person to navigate relations with Washington under President Donald Trump.

Starmer sacked Mandelson in September after seven months in the job, when documents emerged showing Mandelson had remained close to Epstein after the financier was found guilty in 2008 of child sex crimes.

Emails released last week appeared to indicate that in 2009 Mandelson sent Epstein a memo written for Brown about possible UK asset sales and tax changes, and in 2010 gave Epstein advance notice of a 500-billion-euro ($590 billion) bailout by the European Union.

On Tuesday, Starmer's government passed a dossier about Mandelson to police, who launched an investigation into Mandelson over alleged misconduct in public office.

"The Metropolitan Police have been in touch with my office this morning to raise issues about anything that would prejudice their investigations," Starmer told parliament. "We are in discussion with them about that."</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 15:10:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/TBCLKG75D5NUVLGADX4AN2DFOU.jpg?auth=0631b09a424e4e60a8b5deae1f6b672d7a1325fcec5292e37a5d8a821c053631&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Cyprus confirms death of Russian ex-Uralkali CEO Baumgertner</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/cyprus-confirms-death-russian-ex-uralkali-ceo-baumgertner-2026-02-04/</link><description>NICOSIA, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Russian businessman Vladislav Baumgertner, a former chief executive of potash giant Uralkali, has been confirmed dead in Cyprus after going missing on January 7, authorities said on Wednesday.

Baumgertner's body was found on January 15 in a coastal area in the southern part of the island, but DNA testing was required to confirm his identity. The location where he was found falls within a civilian area controlled by the British Sovereign Base Areas in Cyprus.

"The circumstances and cause of his death are under investigation by the Criminal Investigation Department of police of the British bases," a spokesperson for the bases said, adding that Baumgertner's family had been informed.

Baumgertner, 53, had been living in the southern Cypriot city of Limassol in recent years.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 15:11:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russian comedian jailed nearly six years over war veteran joke</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-comedian-jailed-nearly-six-years-over-war-veteran-joke-2026-02-04/</link><description>MOSCOW, Feb 4 (Reuters) - A Russian stand-up comedian was convicted of inciting hatred and jailed for nearly six years on Wednesday over a joke he made about a legless war veteran, which triggered outrage among nationalists and military bloggers.

A Reuters reporter in court said that the comedian, , had been handed a sentence of five years and nine months and a fine of 300,000 roubles ($3,908).

It was the latest in a series of rulings which have harshly punished people judged by the authorities to have spoken rudely or falsely about the Russian army at a time when it is fighting in Ukraine.

Ostanin was also convicted of offending the feelings of Christians with another off-colour joke he made about Jesus, which angered Orthodox nationalists.

His arrest and treatment were punishment enough for any offence he had caused, Ostanin said during his trial.

Russia passed sweeping censorship laws in 2022 shortly after it went to war in Ukraine. Pro-Kremlin figures and organisations have since publicly denounced people they deem to have broken those laws, and have reported them to the authorities.

Ostanin's problems began after he performed in front of a small audience in March last year and joked about how an impoverished war veteran who had lost his legs after being blown up by a mine, and was now forced to get around on a skateboard, had run over his foot while navigating a Moscow underpass.

Ostanin also referred to a wheelchair as a "stump carrier."

Ostanin was not a household name at the time and a video of the moment he told the joke's punchline showed a panel of four fellow comedians remaining straight-faced as the sound of several audience members laughing rang out.

But video of the joke was seized upon by war bloggers and nationalists on the Telegram social media app, causing it to go viral with critics accusing Ostanin of crossing a line by crassly mocking veterans who were risking their lives on the battlefield.

Sorok Sorokov, a powerful Orthodox nationalist group, said many Russians had not understood that times had changed and that the state should tighten its control over such performances to stem what it called a general decline in moral values.

"In recent years, comedians have often crossed red lines and made jokes about topics that are taboo in any normal society," said Georgy Soldatov, director of the group's human rights centre.

Frightened by the backlash against his performance, Ostanin tried to flee Russia in March last year but was arrested by police in neighbouring Belarus, a close ally of Russia, and returned to Moscow to face charges.

Asked by the judge on Wednesday whether he understood his sentence, Ostanin said: "To hell with your judicial practice. No, I don't."</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 15:11:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/QPZ7CXANYVIS5JTT7SHFWNIUGA.jpg?auth=75abb2a8a0306a1db6da4989c312a875ccd5d2b3afbea40e23382690bdcd77c0&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China's Xi and Trump talk by phone, Chinese state media report</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/chinas-xi-trump-hold-call-chinese-state-media-reports-2026-02-04/</link><description>BEIJING, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Chinese President Xi Jinping spoke with U.S. President Donald Trump by phone on Wednesday, state broadcaster CCTV said, ahead of an expected visit by Trump to China in April and hours after Xi had a virtual meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin .

The latest test of Iran's missile capabilities occurred during the 12-day war in June 2025 with Israel during which Tehran fired salvoes of ballistic missiles into Israel, killing dozens of people and wrecking dozens of buildings and apartment blocks in the country's centre and north.

According to an analysis from the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) and AEI Critical Threats Project, Israel "likely destroyed around a third of the Iranian missile launchers" during the conflict.

Iranian officials have repeatedly said Tehran had recovered from the damage incurred during the war and that its capabilities are better than ever.

A ballistic missile is a rocket-propelled weapon that is guided during its initial ascent but follows a free-fall trajectory under gravity for most of its flight. It delivers warheads - containing either conventional explosives or potentially biological, chemical or nuclear munitions - over varying distances, with classifications ranging from short to intercontinental ranges depending on the missile type.

Western powers regard Iran's ballistic missile arsenal both as a conventional military threat to Middle East stability and a possible delivery mechanism for nuclear weapons, should Tehran develop them. It denies any intent to build atomic bombs.

Iran has the largest stockpile of ballistic missiles in the Middle East, according to the U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence. Iranian missiles have a self-imposed range of 2,000 km (1,240 miles), which officials in the past said was enough to protect the country since it covers the distance to Israel.

Many of Iran's missile sites are located in and around the capital Tehran. There are at least five known underground "missile cities" in various provinces, including Kermanshah and Semnan, as well as near the Gulf region.

The arsenal encompasses multiple long-range missiles that can reach Israel, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies. It says these include the Sejil, with a range of 2,000 km; Emad, 1,700 km; Ghadr, 2,000 km; Shahab-3, 1,300 km; Khorramshahr, 2,000 km; and Hoveyzeh 1,350 km.

The semi-official Iranian news outlet ISNA published a graphic in April 2025 showing nine Iranian missiles it said could reach Israel. These included the Sejil, which ISNA said was capable of flying at more than 17,000 km (10,500 miles) per hour and had a range of 2,500 km (1,550 miles); the Kheibar, with a range of 2,000 km (1,240 miles); and the Haj Qasem, with a range of 1,400 km (870 miles).

The Arms Control Association, a Washington-based think tank, says Iran's ballistic arsenal included the Shahab-1, with an estimated range of 300 km (190 miles); the Zolfaghar with 700 km (435 miles); Shahab-3 with 800-1,000 km (500 to 620 miles); Emad-1, a missile under development with a range up to 2,000 km (1,240 miles), and a Sejil model under development with an expected range of 1,500-2,500 km (930 to 1,550 miles).

Iran says its ballistic missiles provide an important deterrent and retaliatory force against the U.S., Israel and other potential regional targets.

According to a 2023 report by Behnam Ben Taleblu, a Senior Fellow at the U.S.-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies, Iran continues to develop underground missile depots complete with transport and firing systems, as well as subterranean missile production and storage centres. In 2020, Iran fired a ballistic missile from underground for the first time, it said.

"Years of reverse-engineering missiles and producing various missile classes have also taught Iran about stretching airframes and building them with lighter composite materials to increase missile range," the report said.

In June 2023, Iran presented what officials described as its first domestically made hypersonic ballistic missile, the official IRNA news agency reported. Hypersonic missiles can fly at least five times faster than the speed of sound and on a complex trajectory, which makes them difficult to intercept.

The Arms Control Association says Iran's missile programme is largely based on North Korean and Russian designs and has benefited from Chinese assistance.

Iran also has cruise missiles such as the Kh-55, an air-launched nuclear-capable weapon with a range up to 3,000 km (1,860 miles).

Iran responded to U.S. participation in Israel's air war against Iran in June by firing missiles at the U.S. Al Udeid air base in Qatar, but Tehran gave advance warning and no one was hurt. Washington announced a ceasefire hours later.

Iran's Revolutionary Guards used missiles in January 2024 when they said that they had attacked Israel's spy headquarters in Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurdistan region, and that they had also fired at Islamic State militants in Syria.

Tehran also announced missile strikes targeting two bases of a Baloch militant group in neighbouring Pakistan.

Saudi Arabia and the U.S. have said they believe Iran was behind a drone and missile attack on Saudi Arabia's prized oil facilities in 2019. Tehran denied the allegation.

In 2020, the Islamic Republic launched missiles at U.S.-led forces in Iraq, including the al-Asad air base, in retaliation for a U.S. drone strike that killed Major General Qassem Soleimani, a top commander of the Revolutionary Guards.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 15:16:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/Z3D6PFJBV5KSBD5QPIB7PD3TZM.jpg?auth=40dba258b63af677143e4e9d2b4b76bde884c0691f94461d9164519a1be83afb&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Exclusive: Donors reluctant to fund US-led Gaza plan as Hamas disarmament push stalls</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/donors-reluctant-fund-us-led-gaza-plan-hamas-disarmament-push-stalls-sources-say-2026-02-04/</link><description>JERUSALEM, Feb 4 (Reuters) - The U.S. has yet to secure funding commitments for its Gaza reconstruction plan as potential donors voice concerns that disagreements over Hamas disarmament could lead Israel to resume full-scale war in the enclave, sources told Reuters.

Hamas laying down its weapons is a key requirement under Donald Trump's plan to end the Gaza war. It calls for Israel's military to withdraw troops as Hamas disarms and for Gaza's reconstruction to be overseen by a "Board of Peace" chaired by the U.S. President.

Trump's plan got a boost this week with the reopening of Gaza's Rafah border crossing with Egypt. But sources close to Hamas say the group has yet to start talks on disarming, meant to precede the start of rebuilding Gaza's destroyed cities .

Two sources with direct knowledge of the Board's planning said that countries were hesitant to commit funds to a rebuilding plan unveiled last month by Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, until Hamas disarms.

"Countries want to see the funding will go for reconstruction within demilitarized places, and not to throw the money into another war zone," one of the sources said.

"If we pass that obstacle, then funding will not be an issue."

Seven Western diplomats told Reuters that the funding holdup, which has not been previously reported, was also being driven by a demand by some potential donors for funds to be managed by the United Nations rather than the Board of Peace.

The funding delay leaves Gaza's devastated population in limbo, unable to begin clearing rubble or rebuilding basic infrastructure, and feeds into worries among U.S. allies that a fragile October truce, shaken by repeated Israeli attacks in Gaza, could break down and lead to a resumption of heavy fighting between Israel and Hamas militants.

Alongside governments, potential donors could also include private sector contributors, the diplomats and the two sources said. They estimated the potential rebuilding cost to be in the range of $100 billion.

That money would fund a "New Gaza" rebuilt from scratch to include seafront residential towers, data centres and industrial parks, Kushner said at the World Economic Forum in Davos on January 22.

The plan does not call for compensation for Palestinians who saw their homes destroyed. Two of the diplomats said that it was not clear how the "New Gaza" plan would address land rights .

Kushner said in Davos that an event would be held in Washington in the coming weeks "where we'll announce a lot of the contributions that will be made ... from the private sector."

But the two sources familiar with the Board's planning said a date for that conference had not yet been set.

"In the meantime, we're not waiting for the event. There is discussion one on one," one of the sources said, without identifying specific donor targets.

A senior European diplomat said that no European or Western country had yet committed funds for Gaza's reconstruction.

"We need some serious private money ... The Europeans are not capable of funding it," the senior European diplomat said, citing fiscal constraints and growing domestic opposition within Europe to foreign aid spending.

Wealthy, oil-rich Gulf Arab states have expressed hesitation at financing Gaza's reconstruction without a broader political solution that includes Hamas disarming.

Representatives for the Board of Peace and for its Palestinian technocratic committee did not immediately respond to requests for comment for this story.

After a two-year Israeli assault that left most of Gaza in ruins and Hamas weakened, the group is still believed to possess rockets, which several Western intelligence sources estimate to number in the hundreds. It is also estimated to possess thousands of light weapons including rifles.

Senior officials in Israel, which launched the assault after the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack, say they do not believe Hamas will lay down its weapons without the use of force and that the military is preparing to return to war.

The first phase of Trump's plan left Hamas in control of a bit under half of Gaza, where the group polices streets and has reestablished its hold. Israel accuses Hamas of planning or attempting to carry out attacks on its troops, prompting strikes that have killed hundreds.

Hamas has agreed to discuss disarmament with other Palestinian factions, but neither Washington nor regional mediators had presented the group with any detailed or concrete disarmament proposal, two Hamas officials told Reuters .

One of the sources with knowledge of the Board's planning said it would be difficult to secure private sector financing without at least some progress toward disarmament.

"We came to the conclusion that if you really want to (rebuild) with the full spectrum of financing, you need peace area pricing," the source said, suggesting the cost of financing would be risk-adjusted to the level of security in a given area.

"Now it doesn't mean that we wait for the full process to be done, but we want to see that it's really happening with full cooperation."

One of the first tasks will be clearing an estimated 68 tonnes of rubble and war debris in Gaza. The Board of Peace was in talks with several parties to award potential rubble clearing contracts, the source and a U.S. official familiar with the matter said.

Several rubble clearing contracts could be awarded, the source said, adding that the aim is for tenders and the awarding of contracts to eventually be managed by a Palestinian technocratic body overseen by the Board.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 15:16:43 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HWIVS64RMBMKVLZWGBMHYNPJG4.jpg?auth=badf1d93cf148696b122f2c03d74d318eb7d714c4574bb01a1ff0c74753f51ad&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russian comedian jailed nearly six years over war veteran joke</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-comedian-jailed-nearly-six-years-over-war-veteran-joke-2026-02-04/</link><description>MOSCOW, Feb 4 (Reuters) - A Russian stand-up comedian was convicted of inciting hatred and jailed for nearly six years on Wednesday over a joke he made about a legless war veteran, which triggered outrage among nationalists and military bloggers.

A Reuters reporter in court said that the comedian, Artemy Ostanin, had been handed a sentence of five years and nine months and a fine of 300,000 roubles ($3,908).

It was the latest in a series of rulings which have harshly punished people judged by the authorities to have spoken rudely or falsely about the Russian army at a time when it is fighting in Ukraine.

Ostanin was also convicted of offending the feelings of Christians with another off-colour joke he made about Jesus, which angered Orthodox nationalists.

His arrest and treatment were punishment enough for any offence he had caused, Ostanin said during his trial.

Russia passed sweeping censorship laws in 2022 shortly after it went to war in Ukraine. Pro-Kremlin figures and organisations have since publicly denounced people they deem to have broken those laws, and have reported them to the authorities.

Ostanin's problems began after he performed in front of a small audience in March last year and joked about how an impoverished war veteran who had lost his legs after being blown up by a mine, and was now forced to get around on a skateboard, had run over his foot while navigating a Moscow underpass.

Ostanin also referred to a wheelchair as a "stump carrier."

Ostanin was not a household name at the time and a video of the moment he told the joke's punchline showed a panel of four fellow comedians remaining straight-faced as the sound of several audience members laughing rang out.

But video of the joke was seized upon by war bloggers and nationalists on the Telegram social media app, causing it to go viral with critics accusing Ostanin of crossing a line by crassly mocking veterans who were risking their lives on the battlefield.

Sorok Sorokov, a powerful Orthodox nationalist group, said many Russians had not understood that times had changed and that the state should tighten its control over such performances to stem what it called a general decline in moral values.

"In recent years, comedians have often crossed red lines and made jokes about topics that are taboo in any normal society," said Georgy Soldatov, director of the group's human rights centre.

Frightened by the backlash against his performance, Ostanin tried to flee Russia in March last year but was arrested by police in neighbouring Belarus, a close ally of Russia, and returned to Moscow to face charges.

Asked by the judge on Wednesday whether he understood his sentence, Ostanin said: "To hell with your judicial practice. No, I don't."</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 15:17:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/QPZ7CXANYVIS5JTT7SHFWNIUGA.jpg?auth=75abb2a8a0306a1db6da4989c312a875ccd5d2b3afbea40e23382690bdcd77c0&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump administration announces 'immediate' removal of 700 immigration officers from Minnesota</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260204-trump-administration-announces-immediate-removal-of-700-immigration-officers-from-minnesota</link><description>The Trump administration is reducing the number of immigration enforcement officers in Minnesota after state and local officials agreed to cooperate by turning over arrested immigrants, border czar Tom Homan said Wednesday.

About 700 of the roughly 3,000 federal officers deployed around Minnesota will be withdrawn, Homan said. The immigration operations have upended the Twin Cities and escalated protests, especially since the killing of protester Alex Pretti, the second fatal shooting by federal officers in Minneapolis .

“Given this increase in unprecedented collaboration, and as a result of the need for less public safety officers to do this work and a safer environment, I am announcing, effective immediately, we’ll draw down 700 people effective today — 700 law enforcement personnel,” Homan said during a news conference.

Last week, Homan said federal officials could reduce the number of federal agents in Minnesota, but only if state and local officials cooperate. His comments came after President Donald Trump seemed to signal a willingness to ease tensions in the Minneapolis and St. Paul area.

Homan pushed for jails to alert ICE to inmates who could be deported, saying transferring such inmates to the agency is safer because it means fewer officers have to be out looking for people in the country illegally.

At the news conference on Wednesday, Homan also said he is not leaving Minneapolis until a crackdown on illegal immigration is complete.

"I'm not leaving until we get it all done," said Homan.

The White House has long blamed problems arresting criminal immigrants on places known as sanctuary jurisdictions, a term generally applied to state and local governments that limit law enforcement cooperation with the Department of Homeland Security.

When questioned, Homan said he thinks the ICE operation in Minnesota has been a success.

“Yeah, I just listed a bunch of people we took off the streets of the Twin Cities, so I think it's very effective as far as public safety goes,” Homan said. “Was it a perfect operation? No. No. We created one unified chain of command to make sure everybody is on the same page. And make sure we follow the rules. I don’t think anybody, purposely, didn’t do something they should have done."</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 15:18:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/b9e63cde-01d7-11f1-ae3e-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26034550897384.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Germany seeks broader spy powers to counter rising hybrid threats</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/germany-seeks-broader-spy-powers-counter-rising-hybrid-threats-2026-02-04/</link><description>BERLIN, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Germany's government wants to give its spy agencies broader powers to confront rising hybrid threats, a sensitive step in a country where intelligence operations remain tightly constrained by post-war limits designed to prevent a repeat of Nazi abuses.

Many attacks on Germany in recent years were thwarted only thanks to intelligence shared by allies whose agencies operate with wider powers, Thorsten Frei, head of the German chancellor's office, acknowledged this week.

Frei, of the ruling conservatives, is calling for a "paradigm shift" that would allow the foreign intelligence agency, the BND, to deploy more intrusive surveillance tools, including access to private mobile phones and the ability to store data for up to a year.

"The aim is to be on an equal footing with our European partners in the field of intelligence gathering," he told Tagesspiegel newspaper.

"Intelligence services cooperate worldwide, and the only hard currency that counts is information."

Long dogged by questions over Nazi-era continuities , the BND has sought to define itself against Germany's two darkest intelligence legacies: Nazi repression and the Stasi's surveillance state.

That history must now be weighed against the heightened threats facing Germany, Frei said.

"In a time that is becoming increasingly threatening, we cannot stop at intelligence gathering alone," he said. "To protect our country, we must also put our services in a position to carry out certain operations."

Beyond collecting and analysing data, the BND should also be empowered to disrupt radio links during drone attacks and to disable so-called cryptocurrency wallets used to finance murders or acts of sabotage, he said.

Frei said legislation to reform the agency should be adopted this year, although it is likely to face resistance from opposition parties. No draft bill has yet been submitted to the Bundestag.

He also wants oversight of the BND to be concentrated in parliament's intelligence control committee, rather than requiring the agency to answer additionally to the so-called G10 commission, which monitors surveillance measures that interfere with communications privacy.

The proposals have drawn criticism from the opposition.

"Anyone who at the same time wants to extend data-retention periods and reduce oversight bodies is acting recklessly and blind to democracy," senior Left Party lawmaker Clara Buenger was quoted as saying by Tagesspiegel.

She warned that the plans represented "a massive leap in powers and in escalation risk."

Separately, Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt is pushing for similar upgrades to the domestic intelligence agency, the BfV, to allow it more surveillance methods and operational capabilities.

Both agencies have seen sharp increases in their budgets of more than 25% this year.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 16:12:04 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/FQAPMQIDPRKYTLQIQHMDU7LGPA.jpg?auth=5b0a215dde3c31bad064793ab70dd0bf88a9845204ee4c0273e67bab3b053f06&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Four people, including two Chinese nationals, arrested in France on suspicion of spying</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/four-people-including-two-chinese-nationals-arrested-france-suspicion-spying-2026-02-04/</link><description>PARIS, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Four people, including two Chinese nationals, have been arrested in France on suspicion of spying for China and have been brought before an investigative judge, the Paris public prosecutor's office said on Wednesday

Secretary-General Antonio Guterres is sounding the alarm on U.N. finances, warning that the world body is at risk of "imminent financial collapse" due to unpaid fees and a budget rule that forces it to return unspent funds.

Guterres has repeatedly spoken about the U.N.'s worsening liquidity crisis but this was his starkest warning yet, and it came as the United States, its main contributor - and debtor - is retreating from multilateralism on numerous fronts.

Here are some questions and answers about U.N. finances:

In a letter to member states last week, Guterres said there was a record $1.57 billion in outstanding dues for the U.N.'s regular budget, without naming the nations that owed them.

U.N. officials say more than 95 percent of what is owed to the regular U.N. budget is owed by the United States - $2.19 billion by the start of February. The U.S. also owes another $2.4 billion for current and past peace-keeping missions and $43.6 million for U.N. tribunals.
On December 30, the U.N. General Assembly approved $3.45 billion for the regular U.N. budget for 2026, following weeks of negotiations. This covers costs of running U.N. offices around the world, including the headquarters in New York, staff salaries, meetings and development and human rights work.

U.N. officials say the U.S. did not pay into the regular budget last year and owes $827 million for that, as well as $767 million for 2026. Next in line were Venezuela and Mexico, owing $38 million and $20 million respectively.

Contributions depend on economy size. The U.S. accounts for 22% of the regular budget, followed by China with 20%. Fees are officially due by Feb. 8 and so far 41 states have paid for 2026, a U.N. document showed , opens new tab .

Without naming the United States, U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said this week the U.N's "cash-flow problem" could be solved "if member states, who have an obligation to pay, pay."

The crunch comes at a time when U.S. President Donald Trump has launched a Board of Peace with himself as lifetime chair, which some fear could undermine the United Nations, a body with 193 member states formed in the ashes of World War Two that works to maintain international peace and security.

Under Trump, as well as refusing to make mandatory payments to the U.N.'s regular and peacekeeping budgets, the U.S. has slashed voluntary funding to U.N. agencies with their own budgets, and moved to exit U.N. organizations including the World Health Organization. In December, the U.N. appealed for a 2026 aid budget only half the size of what it had hoped for in 2025 , acknowledging a plunge in donor funding at a time when humanitarian needs have never been greater.

Guterres launched a reform task force last year , UN80, seeking to cut costs and improve efficiency. The approved 2026 regular budget is roughly $200 million higher than he proposed, but about 7 per cent lower than the approved 2025 budget.

Guterres warned in his letter that the U.N. could run out of cash by July and cited a "Kafkaesque" requirement for it to credit back hundreds of millions of dollars in unspent dues to states each year even if it never received the money. U.N. officials hope to overhaul this "bizarre" rule, which Guterres has called "a race to bankruptcy."

WHAT HAS THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION SAID?

Speaking to Politico on Sunday, Trump , opens new tab cast himself as the savior of the U.N. but declined to say if the U.S. would pay up.

According to Politico, Trump said he was unaware the U.S. was behind in its commitments but was sure he could "solve the problem very easily" and get other countries to pay — if only the U.N. would ask.

The White House and State Department did not respond when asked if the U.S. will pay, or if Trump meant that other countries should put up the money instead.

A senior State Department official did though say that "the U.N. needs to get back to basics" and accused it of wasting money.

"We have no interest in continuing to spend American tax dollars on such waste, fraud and abuse," the official said.

"The U.N. continues to pay its staff far more than for comparable U.S. government positions, provide unacceptable benefits and pensions, and increase the number of high-level bureaucrats in New York - up over 30% - in the last two years alone. The U.N. also spent $340 million just on meetings and conferences last year."

According to a draft U.N. budget document seen by Reuters in September, U.N. cost-savings plans for next year envisaged far smaller cuts to senior staff than to lower ranks .

It showed just two of 58 department head posts in the layer of under-secretaries-general beneath Guterres, or 3%, would go, compared to around 19% across the board and up to 28% for one lower-ranking category, according to Reuters calculations.

A U.N. official said Guterres aimed to deliver on reform while limiting the impact of cutbacks. If the U.S. did not pay, "at the end of the day, meetings can't be organized, work's not done, staff is not being paid," the official said.

At the White House, the two presidents agreed to joint military and intelligence actions against Colombian criminal capos who together produce and supply much of the world's cocaine.

Colombian Defence Minister Pedro Sanchez said the two countries would target Ivan Mordisco, Colombia's most wanted rebel; Chiquito Malo, commander of the Clan del Golfo cartel; and Pablito, an ELN guerrilla leader operating on the Venezuelan border.

The Petro-Trump pact upends years of spluttering Colombian efforts to negotiate peace accords with big criminal groups.

Colombia produces about 70 percent of the world's cocaine, and the United States is by far the world's largest consumer.

"These are not new Colombian targets, but they are new targets for a joint US-Colombia operation," Sanchez told Colombia's Caracol radio.

Sanchez said Venezuela would also be asked to join the campaign. Many cartel and guerrilla fighters have traditionally found safety crossing the Colombia-Venezuela border.

The Colombian governments have long accused Caracas of funding and offering a safe haven to leftist guerrilla and cocaine trafficking groups.

But after the ouster of Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro , there are hopes that security cooperation can improve.

Talks with the Gulf Clan had been ongoing for about five months in Qatar.

"This would be an attack on the good faith and commitments of Doha," the Gulf Clan said in a statement on social media announcing it would "temporarily" leave the negotiating table and hold internal consultations.

Israel controls the entry of all goods and people into the besieged Palestinian territory, where humanitarian conditions remain dire despite a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas which came into effect on October 10.

A justice ministry statement said the smuggled goods were worth millions of Israeli shekels and included cartons of cigarettes, iPhones, batteries, communication cables, car parts and more.

It described the operation as a "serious case of organised, systematic, and sophisticated smuggling of various goods into the Gaza Strip for profit", which began in the summer of 2025, when war was still raging in Gaza.

The justice ministry statement said charges had been filed against 12 individuals and one company.

A joint statement from the police and Israel's Shin Bet domestic intelligence agency confirmed they had "arrested several Israeli citizens and Gaza Strip residents who smuggled goods prohibited from entering the Gaza Strip".

It said those arrested included reservists in the Israeli military.

The statement added that the suspects had been "willfully ignoring the direct contribution of this activity to the strengthening of terrorist organisations in the Strip", notably Hamas.

"This morning (Wednesday), the Southern District Prosecutor's Office filed indictments against 12 of the suspects for offences including assisting the enemy in wartime, performing actions with property for terrorist purposes, obtaining something by fraud under aggravated circumstances, bribery offences, and economic offences," it added.

Israeli media reported that the brother of Israel's Shin Bet chief, David Zini, was allegedly linked to smuggling cigarettes into Gaza.

Reports said that Bezalel Zini was expected to be indicted on Thursday.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 16:18:08 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/e0ca775a-01d4-11f1-bb85-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25306600276744.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'Nobody wants to die': Ukrainians flee from southeast as Russia lurches forward</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/nobody-wants-die-ukrainians-flee-southeast-russia-lurches-forward-2026-02-04/</link><description>TAVRIISKE, Ukraine, Feb 4 (Reuters) - In the last few weeks, buses have stopped running to the village of Tavriiske in southeast Ukraine from the major city of Zaporizhzhia, some 50 km (31 miles) away.

As the war with Russia has drawn nearer, the village is slowly emptying. Maryna Vyshnevska, 35, said it had become too dangerous for her and her five children - some of the few remaining residents - to stay.

"We thought they (the Russians) would be driven back and all this would stop," Vyshnevska said, before packing her family and a handful of belongings into a police evacuation bus. "But when we realised it would only get worse and worse, it was better to leave."

As Russia and Ukraine start new U.S.-brokered peace talks in Abu Dhabi on Wednesday, Moscow's forces have slowly ground forward along various parts of the 1,200-km (745 mile) front line in recent months.

While closing on the so-called "fortress belt" of cities in the eastern Donetsk region, Russian troops are also advancing toward Zaporizhzhia - which is the capital of one of four Ukrainian regions the Kremlin has claimed as its own despite occupying only part of the Zaporizhzhia region.

Fighting has intensified in recent weeks in key areas of the southeastern front, Ukraine's military has said, particularly around the town of Huliaipole - 40 km (25 miles) to the east of Tavriiske.

In Tavriiske and nearby villages, which sit in a bulge in the frontline with Russian forces on three sides, residents told Reuters during a recent visit that they feared for their lives amid the constant threat of drone and bomb attacks.

Police teams and volunteers roam the main regional road - which is shrouded in anti-drone netting - to rescue residents in danger. Local authorities said almost no families remain in the area around Tavriiske.

"Every day, every week, we see more destruction and a greater risk of entering towns like these," said volunteer Vlad Makhovskyi, 51, adorned with a tactical helmet and gear.

At one location, two men lugged an elderly woman out of a ramshackle house on a bright pink bed sheet.

Nataliia Fedorenko, 66, broke down into tears describing the mounting emotional toll of remaining in a war zone as fighting worsened. Like Vyshnevska, she also left.

The BLA is the strongest of a number of insurgent groups long operating in the province bordering Afghanistan and Iran, a mineral-rich region that is home to Beijing's investment in Gwadar deep-water port and other projects.

Here are facts about the group, which has also targeted Chinese interests.

The BLA seeks independence for Balochistan, a province located in Pakistan's southwest and bordering Afghanistan to the north and Iran to the west.

It is the biggest of several ethnic insurgent groups that have battled the federal government for decades, saying it unfairly exploits Balochistan's rich gas and mineral resources.

The group says Balochistan's natural wealth belongs to its people and rejects federal control over resource extraction and security.

Balochistan's mountainous border region serves as a safe haven and training ground for the Baloch insurgents and Islamist militants.

Once considered a low-intensity insurgency, attacks by the Baloch Liberation Army have grown more frequent, coordinated and lethal in recent years.

The group stunned Pakistan's security establishment in 2022 when it stormed army and navy bases.

In August 2024, militants carried out coordinated attacks across Balochistan, including highway assaults in which passengers were pulled from buses and shot after identity checks.

In March 2025, militants opened fire on the Jaffar Express passenger train after sabotaging railway tracks, briefly taking hostages and triggering a major security operation , officials and local media said.

The BLA has deployed women suicide bombers, including in an attack on Chinese nationals in Karachi, and is designated a foreign terrorist organisation by the United States. Pakistan accuses India and Afghanistan of backing the militants, an allegation both countries deny.

The BLA often targets infrastructure and security forces in Balochistan, but has also struck in other areas - most notably the southern port city of Karachi .

The insurgents target Pakistan's army and Chinese interests, in particular the strategic port of Gwadar on the Arabian Sea, accusing Beijing of helping Islamabad to exploit the province.

Militants have killed Chinese citizens working in the region and attacked Beijing's consulate and language centre in Karachi.

It has also attacked civilians, migrant labourers from other provinces, a shift officials say marks an escalation in tactics.

The BLA, separately, was also at the centre of tit-for-tat strikes last year between Iran and Pakistan over what they called militant bases on each other's territory, which brought the neighbours close to war.

Balochistan is an important part of China's $65 billion investment in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, a wing of President Xi Jinping's Belt and Road initiative.

It is home to key mining projects, including Reko Diq , run by mining giant Barrick Gold (ABX.TO), and believed to be one of the world's largest gold and copper mines.

China also operates a gold and copper mine in the province.

The decades-old insurgency has continued to keep the province of some 15 million people unstable and created security concerns around Pakistan's plans to access untapped resources.

It is Pakistan's largest province by area, but smallest by population. Balochistan also has a long Arabian Sea coastline, not far from the Gulf's Strait of Hormuz oil shipping lane.

Hundreds of Baloch activists, many of them women, have protested in Islamabad and Balochistan over alleged abuses by security forces - accusations the government denies.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 17:27:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/SVEJ5NU7MNNEDFNEKCH5X6PLIY.jpg?auth=a64f66e197e9d7b214f62f72367754736dc0465e49b34be95ed906d26751b1ad&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Norway's Socialist Party backs down from threat to LNG electricity project</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/norways-socialist-party-backs-down-threat-lng-electricity-project-2026-02-04/</link><description>OSLO, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Norway's Socialist Party has withdrawn its support for a proposal to block Equinor's Hammerfest liquefied natural gas plant from receiving a planned onshore power connection, clearing the way for the grid development to proceed.

Parliament is due on Thursday to vote on an opposition proposal seeking to revoke the LNG plant's planned link to the power grid, but the motion is likely to fail without backing from the Socialist Party.

The government approved the connection in 2023 to cut greenhouse gas emissions at the plant on Melkoeya island off Hammerfest and extend its lifetime.

Critics say hooking up the currently gas-driven plant to the regional grid could deprive other companies of electricity, push up local prices and harm the interests of Sami Indigenous reindeer herders.

The far-left Red Party had tabled a motion to kill the plan, seeking to instruct the minority Labour government to "facilitate the release of the power allocated to the electrification project on Melkoeya" by grid operator Statnett.

Several political parties, including the right-wing Progress, had signalled they would back the proposal in recent weeks, putting it on course for approval.

The Socialist Party said on Wednesday it remained opposed to the project but was withdrawing its support for the motion because it was "in practice unlawful".

Earlier on Wednesday, Equinor (EQNR.OL) , opens new tab CEO Anders Opedal warned that the motion would have repercussions far beyond Hammerfest.

"This creates uncertainty for everyone who works on and with Melkoeya, but also for everyone who makes investments based on agreements in Norway and for Europe that needs the energy," Opedal said.

The plant is owned by Equinor, Petoro, TotalEnergies (TTEF.PA) , opens new tab , Vaar Energi (VAR.OL) , opens new tab and Harbour Energy (HBR.L) , opens new tab and accounts for 5% of Norway's gas exports.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 17:28:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>MSF says airstrike hit its hospital in South Sudan's Jonglei state</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/msf-says-airstrike-hit-its-hospital-south-sudans-jonglei-state-2026-02-04/</link><description>NAIROBI, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Médecins Sans Frontières said its hospital in South Sudan's Jonglei state, where it serves more than 200,000 people, was hit by an airstrike on Tuesday night, destroying the hospital's main warehouse and most of its critical medical supplies.

The charity said in a statement that South Sudanese government forces were the only armed party in the country with the capacity to perform aerial attacks.

Jonglei state's information minister declined comment when contacted by Reuters, directing all questions to the army.

An army spokesperson did not answer calls seeking comment.

Clashes that the United Nations says are occurring at a scale not seen since 2017 have been convulsing South Sudan for months, raising fears of a rekindling of civil war in Africa's youngest country.

Some of the fiercest fighting has taken place in Jonglei, located in the country's east on the border with Ethiopia, where government forces are seeking to halt an offensive by fighters loyal to Sudan People's Liberation Army-in-Opposition (SPLA-IO).

MSF said one of its staff members had suffered minor injuries in the airstrike on the hospital in Lankien, adding it had evacuated the hospital and discharged patients hours earlier after receiving information about a possible attack.

In a separate incident earlier on Tuesday, MSF said its health facility in Pieri, also in Jonglei, was looted by unknown assailants, rendering it unusable.

MSF said it was the only health provider serving about 250,000 people in Lankien and Pieri.

Late last month South Sudan's military ordered civilians and personnel from the United Nations mission and all charities to evacuate three counties in Jonglei state ahead of an operation there against opposition forces.

The U.N. mission has said that at least 180,000 people in Jonglei have been displaced by recent fighting.

That's more than we were expecting,” said Bergliot Christensen, who took part in the launch in early January of the Danish initiative Digital Stemme (“Digital Voice”) , which aims to help individuals regain control of their digital lives from the Big Tech giants.

“We launched our initiative on January 1, right around the time that US President Donald Trump started accelerating his rhetoric about invading Greenland ,” Christensen said.

“And I think that just made everything click in a new way where we don't just need to talk about how these things are an issue, we need to start acting – and we need to do it now.”

Tech giants have become so embedded in modern life that it is easy to forget how much power and influence they have over normal people just living their lives.

Christensen said there has long been “a feeling that something isn't right with the way that we all assembled online communities that don't always have our best interests in mind”.

“Then, shortly after Trump’s election, that photo of him posing with all the major tech bosses, looking smug, came to reinforce that impression,” she said.

While Danes have found themselves on the front lines of the pressure campaign from Donald Trump, they are not the only ones developing a technological aversion to anything “Made in USA”.

In Germany , the Chaos Computer Club – Europe’s oldest and largest hacktivist group – launched “Digital Independence Day,” or DI-Day , on January 6.

The initiative consists of monthly meetings across Germany, held on the first Sunday of each month, aimed at helping beginners “de-Google” their habits.

“We want to offer concrete, free and gradual help to get rid of American services. The idea is to turn a process that can seem tedious and technical into something rather fun and collaborative,” said Jochim Selzer, one of the Chaos Computer Club’s spokespersons on “digital self-defence”.

The aim is not to do everything at once. “For example, we first try out LibreOffice. Then, at the following event, we try switching from X to Mastodon. On the third meeting, we add Signal to our phones,” Selzer said.

In France , the French Data Network, a group promoting free software, backed the DI-Day initiative.

These Danish and German efforts may look like militant acts – and in part, they are.

But Trump’s threats to use technological leverage to pressure Europe do not concern only state sovereignty and the competitiveness of European companies.

“It's also an issue for individuals. Personally, I'm worried about my children and my grandchildren,” said Harald Wehnes, spokesperson for the Digital Sovereignty working group of the German Informatics Society.

A computer scientist at the University of Würzburg, Wehnes published an open letter denouncing what he calls “American technological imperialism” , which he says aims to turn Europe and its inhabitants into a “digital colony” of Washington and Big Tech – powerful multinationals such as Google , Meta and Amazon.

“Digital platforms [Facebook, Instagram, X] control the flow of information,” said Martin Hullin, director of the European Network for Technological Resilience and Sovereignty at the Bertelsmann Foundation, a German thinktank.

“Algorithms can polarise and disinformation can also undermine social cohesion,” he added.

There are precedents. “The Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2018 showed how data available on social networks can be exploited to influence user behaviour,” warned Frans Imbert-Vier, chief executive of the Swiss technology consulting firm UBCOM and an advocate of technological independence.

The collection of personal data on Facebook allowed Cambridge Analytica , a data analysis firm, to tailor political advertisements in an effort to influence US voters in 2016.

And those who oppose such practices may face consequences from the tech giants, who have little interest in relinquishing their position.

“Two German activists that are fighting hate online have been doing so very well for the past years that they ended up being banned from traveling to the US,” Hullin said.

The ban was imposed on the grounds that they were acting against freedom of expression.

German authorities denounced the decision as an attempt to impose a vision of free speech on Europeans that serves the purposes of Trump and billionaire X owner Elon Musk .

Christensen fears that digital dependence on these platforms has already backfired on Europeans amid the stand-off between Europe and Washington.

“I can’t prove it, but during a rally some people found that their posts about this event were not getting as much traction and reach on Facebook as they used to. And that naturally led to the question, is Facebook suppressing information about this demonstration in Denmark ?”

“We shouldn't tolerate having our discussions controlled by external forces located in a country with which we are in conflict,” she added.

Individuals targeted by the US administration could find themselves cut off from key aspects of digital life, with tangible consequences.

“What happens if you no longer have access to certain online payment methods or shopping sites where you used to buy your groceries?” Hullin asked.

Without Apple Pay, PayPal or access to Amazon, digital life can quickly become much more complicated.

While the Trump administration once championed “alternative facts”, America's Big Tech firms are no fans of alternatives to their tools and platforms. Competitors are required to fend off accusations of monopoly, but they remain largely invisible, crushed by “the massive marketing budgets that tech giants have been showering on the public for decades”, says Martin Hullin, head of the European Network for Technological Resilience and Sovereignty at the Bertelsmann Foundation, a German think tank.

Yet there is a world beyond Gmail, Word, X, Chrome and Apple. Europe, in particular, is home to “many small companies with very interesting ideas and products that are sometimes of better quality than their American equivalents”, argues Frans Imbert-Vier, CEO of technology consulting firm UBCOM and a key advocate of European technological independence.

The hard part is often finding them. Who, for example, has ever heard of Olvid, a French alternative to WhatsApp and text messaging?

France’s Emmanuel Macron has sought to set an example with his “start-up nation” slogan. His government has developed a whole batch of homegrown digital tools to escape American control, aiming to replace Teams with “Visio”, Google Drive with “Files”, and WeTransfer with “FranceTransfer”.

With strained EU-US relations leading to renewed interest in technological sovereignty, some experts in the field have posted catalogues of alternative solutions online.

For each American software programme, Austrian IT developer Constantin Graf has compiled an almost exhaustive list of European alternatives. The ambitious German project Digital Independence Day is less exhaustive but more educational. Its website offers step-by-step instructions on how to switch, for instance, from PayPal to Wero, a European mobile payment system.

Activists from the Chaos Computer Club and the organisers of Denmark’s Digital Stemme initiative acknowledge that detoxing from GAFAM is hard. “Individuals are embedded in an American digital ecosystem where they can connect with family, colleagues and friends. If they leave it, they become the social black sheep,” Imbert-Vier said.

Many non-American alternatives also struggle to attract users.

“It's no fun being on the most perfect social network if nobody else is there,” Christensen said.

That is why most advocates of digital autonomy stress the urgency of acting now – while frustration with the US remains strong enough in Europe to trigger a sizeable shift toward European digital options.

But there is reason to be circumspect.

“There was similar interest in [digital sovereignty] issues in 2013 after Edward Snowden’s revelations about NSA surveillance. But it didn't last long,” Selzer said.

– Have Trump’s threats spurred a European awakening?

– Can Europe’s businesses survive without US Big Tech?

– Are European citizens trapped by US Big Tech?

Human Rights Watch Executive Director Philippe Bolopion said global democracy was now back at 1985 levels, according to some metrics. He said Russia, China and the United States were all less free than 20 years ago, and 72% of the world's population was now living under autocracy.

"It's actually incredible to see how the Trump administration has really undermined all the pillars of U.S. democracy, all the checks and balances on power," Bolopion told reporters.

"We see a sort of very hostile environment in the U.S. and a very rapid decline of ... the quality of democracy in this country."

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Bolopion also said in the report that the Trump administration had leaned on racist tropes and "embraced policies and rhetoric that align with white nationalist ideology."

He criticized what he said was degrading treatment of immigrants and asylum seekers, the killing of two people in Minneapolis, and the deportation of hundreds of migrants to a mega-prison in El Salvador known for its harsh conditions, among other elements of Trump's immigration crackdown.

Masked immigration officers, often in tactical military-style gear, have become a common sight across the U.S. and protests have erupted in several cities.

Trump's hardline immigration agenda was a potent campaign issue that helped him win a return to the White House in 2024. Trump wanted Americans to feel safe in their communities and had pledged to remove "dangerous criminal aliens" from the U.S., a spokesperson said in defense of his immigration policy last week.

Human Rights Watch also cited strikes on suspected drug boats and criticized Trump for turning Venezuela over to President Nicolas Maduro's deputy after his capture , which Bolopion told reporters in a news conference was "risking a new human rights disaster."

Trump has said he should get the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to broker peace in a number of global conflicts. Human Rights Watch was skeptical, saying he had downplayed serious human rights violations by Russia in Ukraine, done nothing to stop atrocities in Sudan, and failed to pressure the Israeli government to stop crimes in Gaza, where Human Rights Watch has accused Israel of committing genocide and extermination . Israel has repeatedly rejected any accusation of genocide.

Elsewhere, the report said Chinese authorities systematically denied freedom of expression, freedom of religion and other rights, while Russia had further intensified a crackdown on dissent and civil society.

But in 2026 "the fight for the future of human rights will play out most sharply in the U.S., with consequences for the rest of the world," Bolopion said.

"Many Western allies have chosen to stay silent on U.S. actions because they fear increasing tariffs and weakening alliances.

The agency also urged developers to implement safety-by-design approaches and guardrails to prevent misuse of AI models. It said digital companies should prevent the circulation of these images by strengthening content moderation with investment in detection technologies.

"The harm from deepfake abuse is real and urgent. Children cannot wait for the law to catch up," UNICEF said in a statement. Deepfakes are AI-generated images, videos, and audio that convincingly impersonate real people.

UNICEF also raised concerns about what it called the "nudification" of children, using AI to strip or alter clothing in photos to create fabricated nude or sexualized images.

At least 1.2 million children across 11 countries disclosed having their images manipulated into sexually explicit deepfakes in the past year, according to UNICEF.

Britain said on Saturday it plans to make it illegal to use AI tools to create child sexual abuse images, making it the first country to do so.

Concerns have increased in recent years about the use of AI to generate child abuse content, particularly chatbots such as xAI's Grok - owned by Elon Musk - which has come under scrutiny for producing sexualized images of women and minors.

A Reuters investigation found the chatbot continued to produce these images even when users explicitly warned the subjects had not consented.

xAI said on January 14 it had restricted image editing for Grok AI users and blocked users, based on their location, from generating images of people in revealing clothing in "jurisdictions where it's illegal." It did not identify the countries. It had earlier limited the use of Grok's image generation and editing features only to paying subscribers.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 18:08:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HVZU6566JNOQZHCCVAU6XGT2LY.jpg?auth=ee9e2e0196b1788ed0a758314c1294e662f72905cf7c5b0f9c635437b3169db1&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US carries out strikes in Syria targeting Islamic States, military says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-carries-out-strikes-syria-targeting-islamic-states-military-says-2026-02-04/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Feb 4 (Reuters) - U.S. Central Command said on Wednesday that it carried out five strikes against multiple Islamic State targets in Syria, including a weapons storage facilities with 50 precision munitions.

The German citizen, identified only as Maja T., was arrested in Berlin in December 2023 on a European arrest warrant and was subsequently transferred to Hungary.

The presiding judge found Maja T. guilty of "attempting bodily harm... as part of an organised crime group".

According to the indictment, Maja T. was part of a far-left group that planned to take up an "ideological fight with violent attacks against sympathisers of the extremist right" with the aim of assaulting people with "various instruments capable of causing death."

The case drew international attention when Germany's Constitutional Court ruled in February 2025 that it had been unlawful to extradite Maja T., who identifies as non-binary, to Hungary, upholding her argument that the decision violated the European Union's Charter on Fundamental Rights.

Under Prime Minister Viktor Orban, Hungary has introduced anti-LGBTQ+ policies, including laws that Brussels says discriminate against people on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity.

Authorities in Hungary - an EU member but which has clashed with Brussels on a range of issues including LGBT rights and the rule of law - have given assurances that non-binary people are not subject to discrimination or violence in prisons there.

Maja T., who was one of several individuals to go on trial over the attacks, told the court that the accusations against her were political.

The German justice ministry said it had no comment.

The first accused in the trial was Italian teacher Ilaria Salis, who was released from house arrest in June 2024 after she was elected a member of the European Parliament. Prosecutors were seeking an 11-year sentence for her. Salis and her family said she was innocent.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 18:09:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/E4PQK34NDVK3BCNPRAY6BCFKSQ.jpg?auth=0243a957f56bc63180319b01230d87a3e3a802b4ee51830fffc6cad86b5a0ef2&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Germany's Merz heads to Saudi, Gulf in quest for new partners</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/germanys-merz-heads-saudi-gulf-quest-new-partners-2026-02-04/</link><description>BERLIN, Feb 4 (Reuters) - German Chancellor Friedrich Merz began a tour of Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates on Wednesday aiming to forge energy and arms partnerships as Europe's biggest and richest economy sought to reduce dependence on the U.S. and China.

"We need such partnerships more than ever at a time when politics is increasingly being determined by major powers," Merz said at the start of his three-day trip, adding the aim of such alliances was to preserve freedom, security and prosperity.

"Our partners may not all share the same values and interests, but they share the view that we need a world order in which we trust agreements and treat each other with respect," he added.

The tour, which follows visits to Brazil and South Africa last year and India last month, is part of a broader German initiative to diversify global alliances.

"In such a network of partnerships, we reduce unilateral dependencies, mitigate risks and create new opportunities together for our mutual benefit," said Merz.

In the Gulf, Merz said he wanted deeper cooperation in the energy and armaments sectors, adding Berlin was adopting a less restrictive approach on arms exports. Germany's economy minister prepared the ground last week.

Relations with Saudi Arabia deteriorated after the killing of Saudi Arabian journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018. Merz said while some improvements in human rights had taken place, there was more to be done and he would discuss this.

The Gulf states, with large sovereign wealth funds, already play a role in Germany's economy. Qatar is one of the largest foreign investors in Germany, holding stakes in companies such as Volkswagen, utility RWE and shipping group Hapag-Lloyd.

Merz said he would address broader regional issues, calling for greater peace, stability and cooperation, including normalization with Israel.

"One day, Israel should also be a welcome part of this order, not a rejected foreign body," said Merz, addressing the balance Gulf states maintain on Israel and Palestinians.

On Iran, Merz said he had three demands: that Tehran stops violence against its own people, halts its military nuclear programme and ends destabilizing activities in the region.

Germany remains one of Israel's closest allies in Europe, while Gulf states have navigated differing approaches to Iran, particularly since the Gaza war.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 18:09:03 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/PFSAWLW4TNL7JFYHX4XLB2SUVY.jpg?auth=49d94fb7d9a517fb9fd6cb967bc5e4e1515bf17592595980c819186d773a2524&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Serbia seeks EU gas deals as it reduces Russian supplies, says President Vucic</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/serbia-seeks-eu-gas-deals-it-reduces-russian-supplies-says-president-vucic-2026-02-04/</link><description>BELGRADE, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Serbia is diversifying its energy supply away from Russia and is already in talks to buy natural gas via a European Union purchasing mechanism, President Aleksandar Vucic said on Wednesday in an interview with Reuters.

The Balkan country, which wants to join the EU, is one of Europe's few remaining buyers of Russian natural gas - over 80% of its supplies come from there.

But the EU has pressured Serbia to find alternatives as it tries to reduce cash flows to President Vladimir Putin's Ukraine war chest.

Serbia failed to secure a new long-term contract with Russia's Gazprom last year, and a short-term deal reached in December expires on March 31.

Vucic said he understood EU policy towards Russian energy, saying "we have to adjust our energy policies to certain demands and requests."

"Still we will have big quantities of Russian gas, but we are taking more and more from Europeans," Vucic added in an interview at the presidency in Belgrade, flanked by an EU flag.

He said Serbia was aiming to secure 500 million cubic metres of gas annually, about a fifth of its needs, under the EU's communal gas-buying initiative , which it joined last year.

Serbia is already purchasing gas from Azerbaijan, via Bulgaria, and construction of a gas pipeline to North Macedonia that would give Serbia access to liquefied natural gas from Greece should start this year, he said.

An oil pipeline linking Serbia and neighboring Romania is expected to be completed in 2027.

"This is a big diversification," Vucic said.

Serbia fosters historic cultural and religious ties with Russia.

Moscow supports Belgrade in its opposition to the independence of Kosovo, a former, predominantly Albanian, southern province. Vucic has sought to balance relations with the Kremlin and Serbia's EU membership bid.

That line has become increasingly difficult to walk since Russia's 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Serbia's Russian-owned NIS oil company was placed under U.S. sanctions, forcing its expected sale to Hungary's MOL.

Meanwhile, Vucic said he is committed to joining the EU. He said the economy had improved, as had living standards and debt levels.

"No doubt, since I am president, Serbia will be on its EU path," he said.

The EU has long demanded that Serbia must boost the rule of law, media freedoms and root out organised crime and corruption if it wants to join.

Critics say recent reforms to the judicial system would reduce its independence, complicating Serbia's route to EU.

Vucic said authorities are ready to "scrutinise" the disputed set of judicial laws with European bodies.

Vucic, a populist, suffered a political blow when a railway station roof collapsed in Novi Sad in 2024, killing 16 people. The disaster triggered countrywide protests , calling for an end to corruption and early elections.

Vucic acknowledged that graft is a problem in Serbia and is "dissatisfied" with efforts to eradicate it. "It is about corruption in our state institutions... including politicians."

Still he dismissed the demonstrations as a plot by international security agencies - including those from neighbouring Croatia, Albania and Kosovo - to overthrow the government, without providing proof.

Officials from those countries have denied such accusations.

Vucic's second and final term expires in 2027. Amid street protests, he has said he will call snap elections this year.

He said he was not sure what he would do next, but did not rule out returning to party politics or seeking to become prime minister.

"I would like to be less engaged in politics or not at all, but taking care of my legacy might require some sort of engagement, we'll see."</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 18:09:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/DUM525DA5VNNLAOEBVBUDXTH24.jpg?auth=fcd1480da39cc855d1cc6d54943c51cf4de520c44974ecf6df95f95df4bddcd2&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Pope Leo likely to visit Peru in November, bishop says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/pope-leo-likely-visit-peru-november-bishop-says-2026-02-04/</link><description>LIMA, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Pope Leo will likely travel to Peru in November, the president of the nation's Catholic bishops said on Wednesday, for a visit expected to draw large crowds to see a pontiff who was a missionary in the South American country for decades.

Bishop Carlos Garcia Camader told a press conference in Lima it was "very probable" that Leo would visit in November or the first week of December. Garcia, who recently visited with the pope at the Vatican, put the chances of a visit at 80%.

Leo, the former U.S. Cardinal Robert Prevost, spent decades in Peru . He was first ordained a bishop for the diocese of Chiclayo, in the country's northwest, and became a Peruvian citizen in 2015.

Garcia joked at the press conference that while the likelihood of a visit to Peru was 80%, the likelihood that Leo would visit Chiclayo during any visit to the country was 100%.

Garcia and most of the Peruvian bishops were in Rome last week for a series of meetings with Vatican officials, undertaken by Catholic bishops normally every five years.

Leo surprised the group by inviting them to have lunch together, an unusual honour.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 18:09:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/QU64WIPUCNLHVHJLXCM4QS642Y.jpg?auth=572252396339bfcd2774885dfe4ecf28c1ea41211c10fe6af66de364f87756b2&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Telegram's Durov says Spanish social media plans weaponise safety</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/telegrams-durov-says-spanish-social-media-plans-weaponise-safety-2026-02-04/</link><description>MADRID, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Telegram founder Pavel Durov on Wednesday joined Elon Musk in publicly criticising plans by Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez to ban social media access for under 16s and to prosecute executives for hate speech on their platforms.

Durov said in a message to Telegram users that the proposal to block children would force social media platforms to gather the data of all users and measures to curb hate speech would prompt platforms to strip content to avoid prosecution.

The proposal by Sanchez to criminalise the use of algorithms deemed as amplifying harmful content would allow governments to control what users see, said Durov, who is based in Dubai.

"These aren't safeguards; they're steps toward total control. We've seen this playbook before - governments weaponizing "safety" to censor critics," he wrote on Telegram.

Spain's government defended its plans in a lengthy statement saying Durov's criticism sent to all Spanish users of Telegram was unprecedented and unwarranted and underlined the urgent need to regulate social media and messaging apps to protect its citizens from "propaganda".

Sanchez said in Dubai on Tuesday that his plans were in line with a "Coalition of the Digitally Willing" of likeminded European countries wanting to clean up social media.

The politician, one of a dwindling band of leftist leaders in Europe, has been criticising technology platforms since early last year when he proposed ending anonymity on social media and linking users' data to a common EU identity wallet .

His wider campaign against disinformation began earlier and was instigated by what he described as a right-wing smear campaign against his family over the investigation of his wife Begona Gomez for influence peddling. She denies the charges and the case is ongoing .

Spain joins countries such as Britain, Greece and France in considering tougher stances on social media, after Australia in December became the first nation to prohibit access to such platforms for children younger than 16.

Russian-born Durov was detained in Paris in August 2024 over alleged criminal activities on the messaging app. In March last year he denied any wrongdoing .

His message about the Spanish plans was forwarded from an account in his name to a channel that normally advises Telegram users about security and account issues.

Musk, the owner of X, has also condemned Sanchez's proposed measures, describing him in an X post on Monday as "a tyrant and a traitor to the people of Spain".

The 2010 New START treaty , which limits the size of the Russian and U.S. strategic nuclear arsenals, expires at the end of Wednesday, and the two sides have not held any talks on a replacement.

The first source said Emmanuel Bonne, who has been at the helm of Macron's diplomatic cell since 2019, had met officials at the Kremlin.

He did not give more details beyond saying the aim was to have dialogue on key issues, most importantly Ukraine .

The French presidency neither confirmed nor denied the talks, but said: "As the President said during his doorstep yesterday, discussions exist at a technical level in full transparency and in consultation with President Zelenskiy and with the main European colleagues."

The two diplomatic sources said allies had been made aware of the initiative and that Bonne had held talks with Yuri Ushakov, a senior aide to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Macron said in December that Europeans would have to re-engage in direct talks with Putin if the latest U.S.-led efforts to broker a Ukraine peace deal founder.

European leaders wary of Putin's military ambitions have smarted at their exclusion from peace talks led by U.S. President Donald Trump's administration, compelled instead to shore up Ukraine's negotiating positions from the sidelines.

Macron told reporters on Tuesday that efforts were under way to restart dialogue with Putin.

"It's being prepared and so there are discussions that are being held at a technical level," he said, adding that it was being done in consultation with Ukraine.

"It's important that the Europeans restore their own channels of discussion."</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 19:24:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/FCEZYKMY7RIG5MNMMXWDSGP2GI.jpg?auth=cbe1d50512c1e65d1d4a7cebe680d6286ab938b2fff8863ba59c9d778d082668&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Tunisian police arrest member of parliament who mocked president, two lawmakers say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/tunisian-police-arrest-member-parliament-who-mocked-president-two-lawmakers-say-2026-02-04/</link><description>TUNIS, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Tunisian police arrested lawmaker Ahmed Saidani on Wednesday, two of his colleagues said, in what appeared to be part of an escalating crackdown on critics of President Kais Saied.

Negotiations at the COP30 event in Brazil in November on how to address climate change were dealt a geopolitical blow earlier in the year when U.S. President Donald Trump pulled the world's biggest economy out of the talks.

The summit ended with a deal to triple finance for poorer nations to adapt to climate change, but no new global commitments to reduce fossil fuel use or cut planet-heating emissions faster - terms that had prompted EU countries to consider walking out in the final hours of the talks.

The 27-country EU is now assessing how to strengthen its strategy for future negotiations by using its trade, finance and development leverage in climate talks, the document showed. EU climate ministers will discuss the ideas at a meeting in Cyprus on Friday.

"The EU encountered increasing difficulty in lining up international support for translating its high level of ambition into concrete negotiation outcomes," the document said, referring to the EU's attempts to secure a stronger deal on cutting emissions.

It said changing geopolitical dynamics had contributed to "a feeling that (the EU) was largely isolated in the final phases of negotiations" at COP30.

The EU, alongside climate-vulnerable island states and some Latin American countries, had pushed to address fossil fuels in the COP30 deal - a proposal blocked by countries including top oil exporter Saudi Arabia.

But the EU had also faced criticism from poorer nations for resisting an increase in climate funding until late in the negotiations.

Andre Correa do Lago, Brazil's president of COP30, said countries' assessments of how successful the summit had been reflected different priorities in how they tackle climate change.

"The word 'ambition' doesn't belong to a vocabulary that only exists in the EU. When you say 'ambition' in the EU, it's mitigation. When you say 'ambition' in India, it's finance. When you say ambition in other countries, it's technology," he told Reuters.

The EU paper suggested a failure to leverage its trade and development tools had "limited the EU's ability to reinforce its positions and to shape incentives in the negotiating rooms and beyond".

A spokesperson for Cyprus, which holds the EU's rotating presidency and drafted the document, confirmed the discussions on the bloc's role in international climate negotiations.

"Our aim is to keep the momentum and continue reflecting on this important matter, with a view to strengthening the effectiveness of the COP31 negotiations," the spokesperson said.

Many of the EU's trade deals include incentives on climate and low-carbon energy. An EU-India trade deal last month included 500 million euros ($590.90 million) in support to help India reduce emissions.

"We're in a new era which is more transactional," one EU diplomat said, adding that some governments also wanted a clearer EU line on when to reject future COP deals that it deems too weak.

The EU is struggling to maintain support for ambitious climate action among its own member countries, and last year agreed a new climate target just days before COP30 began, owing to disagreements between governments over how ambitious it should be.

Talks between the countries amid fears of a military confrontation have been planned for Friday, with Iran pushing to restrict the negotiations to discussion of its long-running nuclear dispute with Western countries.

"If the Iranians want to meet, we're ready," Rubio told reporters.

"They've expressed an interest in meeting and talking. If they change their mind, we're fine with that too," he said.

"In order for talks to actually lead to something meaningful, they will have to include certain things, and that includes the range of their ballistic missiles, that includes their sponsorship of terrorist organisations across the region, that includes their nuclear programme and that includes the treatment of their own people," Rubio said.

A senior Iranian official, however, said the talks would only be about Iran's nuclear programme, and that its missile programme was "off the table".

The meeting was originally planned for Turkey, but a Gulf official, another regional official and Iranian state-affiliated media said ​the talks were expected to take place in Oman.

But US ​officials decided to reject ​Iran's ‍request ​to change ​the location for talks planned for Friday, ‍US news site Axios ​reported on Wednesday, citing ‌two US officials.

Earlier Wednesday, Rubio said US envoy Steve Witkoff was prepared for the talks but that the location was "still being worked ​through" after Iran had previously agreed to a particular format.

Iran wanted the meeting to take place in Oman as a continuation of previous rounds of talks held in the Gulf Arab country on its nuclear programme and asked for a change of location from Turkey, the regional official said.

This was to avoid any expansion of the discussions to issues such as Tehran's ballistic missiles, the regional official said.

Plans for the talks, to be mediated by several countries, were still being finalised, the Gulf official said, adding that the discussions would start on the nuclear issue and then move to other topics on a step-by-step basis.

The diplomatic efforts come after US President Donald Trump 's threats of military action against Iran during its bloody crackdown on protesters last month and the deployment of more naval power to the Gulf.

After Israel and the United States bombed the Islamic Republic last summer, renewed friction has kindled fears among regional states of a major conflagration ‍that could rebound on them or cause long-term chaos in Iran.

Trump has continued to weigh the option of strikes on Iran, sources say. Oil prices have risen on the tension.

Trump has warned that "bad things" would probably happen if a deal could not be reached, ​ratcheting up pressure on the Islamic Republic in a standoff that has led to mutual threats of air strikes.

Iran’s leadership is increasingly worried a US strike could break its grip on power by driving an already enraged public back onto the streets, according to six current and former Iranian officials.

Trump, who stopped short of carrying out threats to intervene during last month's crackdown, has since demanded nuclear ‌concessions from Iran, sending a flotilla to its coast.

Iran also hopes for an agreement that could help lift Western sanctions over its nuclear programme that have ravaged its economy – a major driver of last month's unrest.

Ministers from several other countries in the region including Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates had been ‍expected to attend Friday's talks, but a regional source told Reuters that Tehran wanted only bilateral talks with the US.

Iranian sources told Reuters last week that Trump had demanded three conditions for the resumption of talks: zero enrichment of uranium in Iran, limits on Tehran's ballistic missile programme and an end to its support for regional proxies.

Iran has long said all three demands are unacceptable infringements of its sovereignty, but two Iranian officials told Reuters its clerical rulers saw the ballistic missile programme, rather than uranium enrichment, as the bigger obstacle.

An Iranian official said there should not be preconditions for talks and that Iran was ready to show flexibility on uranium enrichment, which it says is for peaceful, not military purposes.

Since the US strikes in June, Tehran has said its uranium enrichment work has stopped.

In June, the United States struck Iranian nuclear targets, joining in at the close of a 12-day Israeli bombing campaign and Iran struck back ‍at Israel with missiles and drones.

Iran said it replenished its missile stockpile after the war with Israel last year, warning it will unleash its missiles if its security is under threat.

Adding to tensions, on Tuesday the US military shot down an Iranian ‌drone that "aggressively" approached the Abraham Lincoln aircraft ​carrier in the Arabian Sea, the US military said.

In another incident in the Strait of Hormuz , the US Central Command said Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps forces had approached a US-flagged tanker at speed and threatened to board and seize it.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 19:26:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/9e084b5a-dd3e-11f0-8ca7-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2025-12-19T192110Z-409487497-RC2TJIAOB005-RTRMADP-3-SUDAN-POLITICS-USA-RUBIO-1.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Italy probes 80-year-old over alleged Sarajevo 'sniper tourism'</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/italy-probes-80-year-old-over-alleged-sarajevo-sniper-tourism-2026-02-04/</link><description>MILAN, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Milan prosecutors have placed an elderly Italian man under investigation as part of an investigation into alleged "sniper tourism" in Sarajevo in the 1990s, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said on Wednesday.

The sources said the man, the first individual to be identified in the inquiry that began last year, is an 80-year-old former truck driver who lives near the northern Italian town of Pordenone.

The prosecutors are investigating allegations that foreigners were paid to shoot at civilians during the siege of Sarajevo, Bosnia's capital, during the war in the former Yugoslav republic three decades ago.

The man, who was not named, faces charges of several counts of premeditated murder, aggravated by base motives, the sources said.

They did not say whether he is suspected of directly carrying out killings or of helping with transport and logistics for clients.

He remains at liberty and has been summoned by prosecutors for questioning on February 9, the sources added.

About 11,000 civilians were killed by shelling and sniper fire from Bosnian Serb army positions on hills around the besieged city during the 1992-95 war that followed Bosnia's declaration of independence from Yugoslavia.

Milan prosecutors opened their investigation after local journalist and novelist Ezio Gavazzeni filed a legal complaint over allegations that Italians and other foreigners had paid members of Bosnian Serb forces to let them take part in shooting excursions, which some referred to as "sniper tourism".

Gavazzeni said he was inspired to look into the allegations after watching the 2022 documentary "Sarajevo Safari" by Slovenian director Miran Zupanic.

Gavazzeni said wealthy foreigners paid large sums of money to take part. He said the Italians used to meet in the city of Trieste before travelling to Belgrade, where Bosnian Serb soldiers escorted them to hills overlooking Sarajevo.

The launch of the Italian investigation in November 2025 raised survivors' hopes that those responsible would be brought to justice.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 19:59:26 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ISH5DGE6VFMCTE2CNCSRXSKKTI.jpg?auth=49ba82a104972af7e895b71e53621bc4835853ce717a8a0c23975f4ae74ebacd&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuelan official Saab, formerly held in US, arrested again-Colombian media</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/venezuelan-official-saab-formerly-held-us-arrested-again-colombian-media-2026-02-04/</link><description>Feb 4 (Reuters) - Venezuelan official Alex Saab, a Colombian-Venezuelan former businessman once held in the U.S., was arrested in Venezuela on Wednesday, several Colombian media outlets said.

Saab, a close ally of President Nicolas Maduro, now in U.S. custody, was cinematically detained in Cape Verde in 2020 and held for more than three years in a bribery scheme, before he was granted clemency in exchange for the release of Americans held in Venezuela.

He returned with fanfare to Venezuela, where Maduro, detained in a U.S. raid on Caracas last month, lauded his loyalty to the country's socialist revolution and feted him as a national hero.

Maduro later made Saab industry minister , a position he held until last month, when he was removed by interim president Delcy Rodriguez.

Colombian television station Caracol reported Saab had been detained by the domestic intelligence service SEBIN. Caracol added that he could be extradited to the U.S., while Blu Radio said the operation was conducted in tandem with the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation.

Caracol Radio, a separate entity to the television station, said the arrest took place in the first hours of Wednesday morning and that businessman Raul Gorrin was also being held.

The Venezuelan communications ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment and it was not immediately possible to ascertain whether Saab or Gorrin have legal representation.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 19:59:52 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HUKKRHADMZMHVJOTILOXNONJW4.jpg?auth=4c0635b383c6f9d4ef53326cfcb690774d58cf408ca42243e91da9c4f0ec7ae5&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran-U.S. talks to take place in Oman on Friday, U.S. official confirms</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-us-talks-take-place-oman-friday-us-official-confirms-2026-02-04/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Feb 4 (Reuters) - U.S. talks with Iran will take place on Friday in Oman, a U.S. official confirmed on Wednesday, after Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said that nuclear talks with the U.S. are set to be held in the Omani capital Muscat at around 10 a.m. on Friday.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 21:34:03 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4TNLFG3EIBLJFN4HB2RXOJ3CWU.jpg?auth=fefc35bde85eb161e55c0ca8cdcbd2580fabc846c93fd3b9646856a09a8aec7d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>55,000 Ukrainian soldiers killed on battlefield, Zelenskiy tells French TV</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/55000-ukrainian-soldiers-killed-battlefield-zelenskiy-tells-french-tv-2026-02-04/</link><description>PARIS, Feb 4 (Reuters) - The number of Ukrainian soldiers killed on the battlefield as a result of the country's war with Russia is estimated at 55,000, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy told France 2 TV on Wednesday.

The New START agreement will end Thursday, formally releasing both Moscow and Washington from a raft of restrictions on their nuclear arsenals.

Campaigners have warned the treaty's demise could unleash a new arms race between the world's top nuclear powers, and encourage China to expand its arsenal.

"We assume that the parties to the New START treaty are no longer bound by any obligations or symmetrical declarations within the context of the treaty," Russia's foreign ministry said in a statement.

"The Russian Federation intends to act responsibly and prudently," it added, but warned it was ready to take "decisive" countermeasures if its national security was threatened.

Russian President Vladimir Putin offered in September to keep abiding by the warhead limits in the treaty for a year, but he received no formal response from Washington, the Kremlin says.

US President Donald Trump said at the time it sounded "like a good idea" but there were no subsequent negotiations.

A Kremlin aide said earlier that Moscow was "open" to dialogue on the issue.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio , asked about the end of New START, appeared in no hurry to extend it, saying only that Trump would address the issue later.

"The president's been clear in the past that in order to have true arms control in the 21st century, it's impossible to do something that doesn't include China, because of their vast and rapidly growing stockpile," Rubio said.

China's nuclear arsenal is growing quickly but is still well below the levels of Russia and the United States.

Trump in his first term also looked ready to let New START lapse as he insisted on including China.

Joe Biden agreed with Russia to extend New START for five years after he defeated Trump in the 2020 election, but tensions between the two countries later deteriorated over Moscow's offensive in Ukraine.

The treaty, signed in 2010 by then-Russian president Dmitry Medvedev and his US counterpart Barack Obama , limited each side's nuclear arsenal to 1,550 deployed strategic warheads, a reduction of nearly 30 percent from the previous limit set in 2002.

It also allowed each side to carry out on-site inspections of the other's nuclear arsenal, although these were suspended during the Covid-19 pandemic and have not resumed since.

Russia froze its participation in the agreement in 2023, but said it was continuing to voluntarily adhere to the warhead limits.

Pope Leo XIV said Wednesday that each side needed to do "everything possible" to avert a new arms race.

"I urge you not to abandon this instrument without seeking to ensure that it is followed up in a concrete and effective manner," the American-born pope said at his weekly general audience.

The International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons called on Russia and the United States to commit to honour the New START limits while a new agreement was negotiated.

"Without New START, there is a real danger the new arms race will accelerate between the US and Russia – more warheads, more delivery systems, more exercises – and other nuclear-armed states will feel pressure to keep up," said Melissa Parke, executive director of the Nobel Peace Prize-winning group.

The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists last month set its flagship "Doomsday Clock" closer than ever to midnight amid fears the agreement's expiry could start an arms race.

Russia and the United States together control more than 80 percent of the world's nuclear warheads but arms agreements have been withering away.

In 2019, the two countries withdrew from the landmark Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty, which limited the use of medium-range missiles.

In 2023, Putin signed a law revoking Russia's ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, although Moscow said it would stick to the moratorium on atomic testing.

Trump in October ordered the Pentagon to start nuclear weapons testing to equal China and Russia, although he has not followed through.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 21:35:19 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/1be1bb6e-01df-11f1-a484-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/8c79f0e75776ece9374c2b738f17ba3551e52cce.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Melania Trump says talks with Putin team continue to free Ukrainian kids</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/melania-trump-says-talks-with-putin-team-continue-free-ukrainian-kids-2026-02-04/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Feb 4 (Reuters) - U.S. first lady Melania Trump said on Wednesday she remains in contact with Russian President Vladimir Putin's team in an effort to secure the return of more Ukrainian children from Russia.

"I'm working on it, and we are in the process," she told reporters at the White House. "I hope we have success very soon."

She did not share details about talks between her representatives and Putin's team.

An East Wing spokesman said the lines of communication had continued after Melania Trump wrote a letter to Putin -- hand-delivered by her husband, President Donald Trump, last August -- about abducted Ukrainian children.

Fifteen children have been returned to Ukraine since the first lady started her advocacy, including seven children in December.

Ukraine has accused Russia of abducting at least 19,000 of its children and taking them to Russia or Russian-occupied territory without the consent of family or guardians since it invaded Ukraine in February 2022. Russia has repeatedly denied abducting Ukrainian children, saying it acted to keep them safe from the fighting.

On Wednesday, Russian and Ukrainian officials said they had " productive " talks in U.S.-led negotiations aimed at ending the four-year-old war, although Russia earlier this week attacked Ukraine with hundreds of drones and a record number of ballistic missiles.

Melania Trump, who has kept a low profile during her husband's second term, met at the White House on Wednesday with two freed Israeli American hostages, Keith and Aviva Siegel.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 22:28:58 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/S5WZV3L6PRP2HLZXQZPZWTTSOA.jpg?auth=36aef8e3bd86f2df82d0285acc8ee5786aa2a017f9f92e4bd6cb2e92b88ab4a0&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Nearly two dozen more prisoners freed in Venezuela, legal rights group says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/nearly-two-dozen-more-prisoners-freed-venezuela-legal-rights-group-says-2026-02-04/</link><description>Feb 4 (Reuters) - Twenty-two more prisoners have been released in Venezuela, the country's top legal rights group said on Wednesday, as liberations promised by the interim government slowly continue.

Legal rights organization Foro Penal said earlier in the day that 350 people who it classes as political prisoners had been freed since Jan. 8, when the government announced the effort. In the afternoon, Foro Penal said that it had confirmed 22 more releases, including of the journalist Rory Branker.

Government officials - who deny holding political prisoners and say those jailed have committed crimes - have given a much higher figure of releases, of nearly 900, but have not been clear about the timeline and appear to be including releases from previous years in their count. The government has never provided an official list of how many prisoners will be released nor who they are.

Families of prisoners say the releases have progressed too slowly, and Foro Penal says nearly 700 political prisoners remain jailed, an updated count including prisoners whose fearful families had not previously reported their detentions.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 22:55:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/XCQ6WAPVS5JWNB5ZSBJ2OCO3PU.jpg?auth=545e4164b5d1e43ad7e59c4b341cbef3a84c1cd70f593722d61b0d9653e96c1d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Washington Post announces major job cuts amid financial strain</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260204-washington-post-announces-major-job-cuts</link><description>The Washington Post , owned by billionaire Amazon founder Jeff Bezos , announced major job cuts on Wednesday, saying that “painful” restructuring was needed at the storied newspaper.

The Post, which gained legendary status when its reporting helped bring down President Richard Nixon in the Watergate scandal, will see “substantial” reductions in its newsroom, executive editor Matt Murray said.

The shrinking of the Post comes as major traditional media outlets in the United States face intense pressure from President Donald Trump , who routinely denigrates journalists as “fake news” and has launched multiple lawsuits over coverage of his presidency.

Bezos, one of the world’s richest people, has become close to Trump in the Republican’s second term. His Amazon behemoth controversially paid Trump’s wife, First Lady Melania Trump , a reported $40 million for a documentary this year, along with another $35 million for marketing.

Murray said the changes at the Post reflect the radically shifting economy for news media.

“This will help to secure our future … and provide us stability moving forward,” Murray said in a note to employees.

He cited changes to the news ecosystem, from individuals who “generate impact at low cost” to AI-generated content , as well as financial challenges that have already produced rounds of cost-cutting and buyouts at the Post.

“The company’s structure is too rooted in a different era, when we were a dominant, local print product,” he said. “And even as we produce much excellent work, we too often wrote from one perspective, for one slice of the audience.”

On Facebook, Marty Baron, the Post’s executive editor until 2021, said: “This ranks among the darkest days in the history of one of the world’s greatest news organisations.”

The Post did not disclose the number of job cuts, but The New York Times reported that approximately 300 of its 800 journalists were laid off.

Most of the paper’s journalists overseas were let go, including its entire Middle East roster and its Kyiv-based Ukraine correspondent.

Sports, graphics and local news departments were sharply scaled back, and the paper’s daily podcast, Post Reports , was suspended, local media reported.

Murray said the Post would now focus on politics, national security, technology, investigations and business, among other topics.

But a reporter who covered Amazon – currently valued at $2.6 trillion – was let go.

“These lay-offs are not inevitable. A newsroom cannot be hollowed out without consequences for its credibility, its reach and its future,” the labour union representing many Post journalists said in a statement.

It called on supporters of the paper, acquired by Bezos in 2013, to rally outside its Washington headquarters at noon on Thursday.

The White House ’s communications director, Steven Cheung, issued a typically scornful message.

“Just a reminder that printing fake news is not a profitable business model,” he posted on X.

Baron, the Post’s former executive editor, said owner Bezos had resisted “brutal pressure” from Trump in the past, but that the paper was battered by “ill-conceived decisions that came from the very top”.

Bezos reined in a liberal-leaning editorial page and blocked an endorsement of Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris days before the 2024 election – breaking the so-called firewall of editorial independence and seen as bowing to Trump.

In response, loyal readers “fled the Post. In truth, they were driven away,” Baron said.

The Wall Street Journal reported last month that 250,000 digital subscribers left the Post after it refrained from endorsing Harris, and that the paper lost around $100 million in 2024 as advertising and subscription revenues fell.

In May 2024, Post publisher Will Lewis told staff the paper lost $77 million over the preceding year and had lost half of its audience since 2020.

In stark contrast, The New York Times announced on Wednesday that it gained more than one million digital subscribers in 2025, bringing its total to nearly 13 million and confirming its dominant position in the US media market.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 22:55:56 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/bb50849a-0208-11f1-96f8-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/9e5617cb3f07c66c526f2fddd10ffd031133f4ba.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US charges suspect with terrorism in killing of two Israeli diplomats</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-charges-suspect-with-terrorism-killing-two-israeli-diplomats-2026-02-04/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Feb 4 (Reuters) - A man accused of killing two Israeli diplomats in Washington, D.C., last year was indicted on four additional counts of terrorism, in a new indictment that was unsealed on Wednesday.

The new indictment includes nine charges , including hate crimes, filed earlier. Several of the charges carry a maximum penalty of death or life imprisonment, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia said.

"These additional terrorism-related charges carry a mandatory life sentence under D.C. Code, while also reflecting the reality that this act was in fact an act of terror," U.S. Attorney Jeanine Ferris Pirro said in a statement.

Prosecutors accuse Elias Rodriguez, 31, of opening fire on people leaving an event for young professionals and diplomats hosted by the American Jewish Committee, an advocacy group that fights antisemitism and supports Israel.

He fired approximately 20 shots from a semi-automatic handgun, and called out "Free Palestine," according to prosecutors.

Lawyers for Rodriguez did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Yaron Lischinsky, 30, and Sarah Lynn Milgrim, 26, who both worked for Israel's Embassy in Washington, were killed.

Darren B. Cox, the FBI assistant director in charge of the Washington Field Office, said Rodriguez wrote and published a manifesto as an attempt to "morally justify his actions" and inspire others to commit political violence.

The shooting, which was condemned by leaders worldwide, came amid polarization, including student protests , in the United States over the war in Gaza .

The war was Israel's response to Hamas' October 2023 attack that left at least 1,665 Israelis and foreign nationals dead. More than 67,000 Palestinians were killed in Gaza between October 7, 2023 and October 7, 2025, according to Gaza health authorities.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 23:30:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ZVDAQD6M2ZJ25NKFFPL5TBMIN4.jpg?auth=33c5503be274e2c1c4263391aebb04666deed248cf32f84d83077b445fecded1&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Exclusive: US spy chief's office investigated voting machines in Puerto Rico</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/us-spy-chiefs-office-investigated-voting-machines-puerto-rico-2026-02-04/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Feb 4 (Reuters) - A team working for President Donald Trump's spy chief, Tulsi Gabbard, last spring led an investigation into Puerto Rico's voting machines, said Gabbard's office and three sources familiar with the previously unreported events.

The sources said the goal was to work with the FBI to investigate claims that Venezuela had hacked voting machines in Puerto Rico, but added the probe did not produce any clear evidence of Venezuelan interference in the U.S. territory's elections.

Gabbard's office, in a statement to Reuters, confirmed the May investigation but denied a link to Venezuela, saying its focus was on vulnerabilities in the island's electronic voting systems. Her team took an unspecified number of Puerto Rico's voting machines and additional copies of data from the machines as part of its investigation, a spokesperson for Gabbard's Office of the Director of National Intelligence said.

Her office said the taking of voting machines and data was "standard practice in forensics analysis."

Noting similar voting infrastructure elsewhere in the United States, it added: "ODNI found extremely concerning cyber security and operational deployment practices that pose a significant risk to U.S. elections."

Venezuela's government did not respond to a request for comment.

ODNI said that some security gaps in voting machines used in Puerto Rico stemmed from their use of vulnerable cellular technology and that software flaws existed that could give hackers access deep into vital electoral systems.

The Puerto Rico operation appeared to be part of an effort by Trump administration officials to pursue unproven allegations of voting fraud, the sources said. The preoccupation with voter fraud dates to Trump's reelection loss in 2020 and has not abated, said the sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss non-public operations.

Gabbard's appearance at an FBI raid of an election facility in Fulton County, Georgia , last week highlights her direct involvement in these issues. Last week's FBI raid in Georgia prompted alarm among some national security experts worried that Gabbard and the ODNI have overstepped their authority in investigating a sensitive domestic matter.

Gabbard was not physically present during the operation in Puerto Rico, her office said, even though her agency took on a coordinating role in the investigation.

U.S. officials involved in the Georgia investigation sought records related to the 2020 presidential election that Republican Trump has falsely claimed he lost against Democrat Joe Biden because of widespread fraud.

Domestic election security matters are typically handled by law enforcement agencies, say current and former U.S. officials, not the nation’s intelligence services.

Gabbard's office said it had the authority to carry out the investigation.

"Given ODNI's broad statutory authority to coordinate, integrate, and analyze intelligence related to election security and our known work on understanding vulnerabilities to foreign and other malign interference, ODNI conducted an examination of electronic voting systems used in Puerto Rico’s elections," the spokesperson said.

Reuters sources said it was the unproven allegation of Venezuelan involvement in voting irregularities in the U.S. territory's elections that had raised questions about possible foreign interference – something Gabbard had the legal authority to investigate.

The Caribbean island's residents are U.S. citizens but do not have voting representation in Congress and cannot vote in presidential general elections.

Challenging the denials of Gabbard's office about Venezuela's role, the three sources told Reuters that the FBI team involved in the Puerto Rico operation was probing the theory that Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro's government had hacked U.S. voting, an allegation that has strong support among some Trump supporters but for which no evidence has surfaced publicly.

The operation in Puerto Rico involved the FBI field office in southern Florida whose agents were coordinating with a group overseen by Gabbard investigating threats to election security, said two of the sources familiar with the operation.

This group included U.S. national security officials, law enforcement agents and government contractors, the sources said.

Gabbard's office said the United States Attorney in Puerto Rico, his team of homeland security investigations agents, and an FBI supervisory special agent "facilitated the voluntary turnover of electronic voting hardware and software to ODNI for analysis."

The U.S. military seized Maduro in Caracas in January, removing him from power, and brought him to New York to face drug trafficking charges, which he denies. Puerto Rico’s elections have had irregularities but no credible evidence has emerged to support allegations of Venezuelan attacks to influence voting there.

"We have had widely reported problems in election administration. But they are all attributable to incompetence and corruption, not foreign interference," said Pablo Jose Hernandez Rivera, a Democrat elected in 2024 to represent Puerto Rico in the U.S. House of Representatives in a non-voting capacity.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 23:53:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/67OWS5RF7RPTRCFITTGAFNXJA4.jpg?auth=27a88c54acfc2ea8d5f0e84a8348dc0589dcb48e03087ea1c1e7fd4693709fdd&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Australia charges teenager over alleged death threats to Israeli President Herzog</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/australia-charges-teenager-over-alleged-death-threats-israeli-president-herzog-2026-02-04/</link><description>SYDNEY, Feb 5 (Reuters) - An Australian teenager has been charged for allegedly making online death threats against Israeli President Isaac Herzog, ahead of his upcoming visit to Australia.

The 19-year-old man allegedly made the threats on a social media platform last month "towards a foreign head of state and internationally protected person", the Australian Federal Police said in a statement.

The offence carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in jail.

Police did not name the intended target of the alleged threats, but Australian media widely reported they were directed at Herzog. The Sydney Morning Herald newspaper also reported the teenager allegedly made threats against U.S. President Donald Trump.

He was refused police bail and will appear before a court in Sydney on Thursday. Police said a mobile phone and equipment for making or using drugs were seized during a search at a home in Sydney on Wednesday.

President Herzog is due to arrive in Australia on Sunday for a five-day visit, following an invitation by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese in the aftermath of the deadly shooting at Bondi Beach in December.

He is expected to meet survivors and the families of the victims of the shooting at Sydney's Bondi beach on December 14 at a Jewish Hanukkah celebration, which killed 15 people.

Herzog's visit has drawn opposition from pro-Palestine groups, with protests planned in major Australian cities.

Police in the state of New South Wales, home to Sydney, on Tuesday extended restrictions on protests in parts of the city ahead of Herzog's visit, citing "significant animosity" from some groups.

The Palestine Action Group has called on supporters to attend a rally in Sydney on Monday, urging people to march to the New South Wales state parliament in what is described as a "mass, peaceful gathering."

Deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles said Herzog would receive standard security arrangements given to all visiting foreign leaders.

"He will be a welcomed and honoured guest," Marles told ABC News on Thursday.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 23:55:08 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/GNB3YKRMKBLX3LRIGATJ2CJCBQ.jpg?auth=cf0e7e1d946450f3dfaa18f1906bac91094c5532b3025fd1b4c7ea3ed797afe6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Relations with US 'rock solid,' Taiwan president says after Trump-Xi call</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/relations-with-us-rock-solid-taiwan-president-says-after-trump-xi-call-2026-02-05/</link><description>TAIPEI, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Relations between Taiwan and the U.S. are "rock-solid" and cooperation programmes will continue and not change, Taiwan President Lai Ching-te said on Thursday after Chinese President Xi Jinping discussed the democratically governed island with President Donald Trump.

In the Wednesday call , Xi told Trump that the U.S. should "carefully" handle arms sales to the island that Beijing views as its own territory.

Speaking to reporters in central Taiwan, Lai said Taiwan and the U.S. have strong channels of communication.

"Taiwan–U.S. relations are rock-solid; all cooperation programmes will continue and will not change," Lai said, adding that the U.S. commitments to Taiwan also remain unchanged.

The fact that Taiwan is not part of the People's Republic of China also remains unchanged, he added.

The U.S., like most countries, has no formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan but is the island's most important international backer and is bound by law to provide it with the means to defend itself.

In December, the Trump administration announced $11.1 billion in arms sales to Taiwan , the largest ever U.S. weapons package for the island.

China refuses to speak to Lai and calls him a "separatist." Lai says only Taiwan's people can decide their future.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 02:06:08 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5N45RQ44KBO6TJOQDBAFPG3L6I.jpg?auth=11faa96a7a27dd953bbca4ffdcc93d5c1819a873f1b8cdfe8b481c405e3768f0&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China open to more practical cooperation, strategic coordination with Laos</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-open-more-practical-cooperation-strategic-coordination-with-laos-2026-02-05/</link><description>BEIJING, Feb 5 (Reuters) - China is willing to deepen practical cooperation and strengthen strategic coordination with Laos, President Xi Jinping said to Laos President Thongloun Sisoulith in a message, state news agency Xinhua reported on Thursday.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 02:06:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/GRQTU73SHZKJVH6XY5QW6KZZBQ.jpg?auth=39286963f62fbbc35cdab6fffc314002684faaa34b9800b115f1734c39dd5eff&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump backs MAGA prosecutor in race to fill Marjorie Taylor Greene's seat</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-backs-maga-prosecutor-race-fill-marjorie-taylor-greenes-seat-2026-02-05/</link><description>Feb 4 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Wednesday endorsed a conservative local prosecutor in a Georgia special election to replace Marjorie Taylor Greene, who resigned from the U.S. House of Representatives amid an acrimonious split with the president.

Trump said that he was throwing his support behind Clay Fuller, the district attorney for four counties in northwest Georgia, describing him as an "America First Patriot" and a proponent of the president's Make America Great Again movement.

"He is strongly supported by the most Highly Respected MAGA Warriors in Georgia," Trump said on his Truth Social platform.

The endorsement is expected to boost Fuller's chances in the March 10 election to replace Greene, who had been one of the most prominent voices in the MAGA movement before breaking with Trump late last year.

The split was driven primarily by Greene's aggressive push to have the Department of Justice release files related to the late Jeffrey Epstein , a convicted sex offender, as well as her criticism of Israel's war in Gaza and U.S. aid to the country.

Angered by her stances, Trump called her a "traitor" and withdrew his support for her. Greene's resignation from her seat representing Georgia's 14th district in the House of Representatives became effective in January.

In addition to Fuller, former Georgia state Senator Colton Moore - a staunchly conservative and pro-Trump Republican -- has been seen as a front-runner in a crowded race of 16 Republicans.

Democrat Shawn Harris, a cattle farmer and retired brigadier general who lost to Greene in 2024, is running again in the conservative district. Harris got 35.6% of the vote in 2024, compared to Greene's 64.4% of the vote.

In announcing his candidacy, Fuller had characterized himself as an "America First prosecutor" in alignment with Trump.

"This is the honor of a lifetime. I will not let you or Georgia’s 14th District down," Fuller said in a statement following Trump's endorsement on Wednesday.

If no candidate wins a majority, the top two vote-getters will face off in an April 7 runoff.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 02:06:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/XTRLNFXVZ5IBJMOAPNU5DQV3G4.jpg?auth=a24d2867452d0a06589bf6008d6bb0b3cb3028aacf128e5d2571ac6986123015&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UN chief calls New START expiration 'grave moment'</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/un-chief-calls-new-start-expiration-grave-moment-2026-02-05/</link><description>Feb 4 (Reuters) - United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Wednesday called the expiration of the New START Treaty a grave moment for international peace and security and urged Russia and the United States to negotiate a new nuclear arms control framework without delay.

New START , which was due to run out at midnight on Wednesday, capped the number of strategic nuclear warheads that the United States and Russia can deploy, and the deployment of land- and submarine-based missiles and bombers to deliver them.

"For the first time in more than half a century, we face a world without any binding limits on the strategic nuclear arsenals of the Russian Federation and the United States of America – the two States that possess the overwhelming majority of the global stockpile of nuclear weapons," Guterres said in a statement.

He said the dissolution of decades of achievement in arms control "could not come at a worse time – the risk of a nuclear weapon being used is the highest in decades."

At the same time, Guterres said there was now an opportunity "to reset and create an arms control regime fit for a rapidly evolving context" and welcomed the appreciation by the leaders of both Russia and the United States of the need to prevent a return to a world of unchecked nuclear proliferation.

"The world now looks to the Russian Federation and the United States to translate words into action," Guterres said.

"I urge both states to return to the negotiating table without delay and to agree upon a successor framework that restores verifiable limits, reduces risks, and strengthens our common security."</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 02:06:17 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HERYES2LL5MKRDSGJQEGCQ4X54.jpg?auth=5358756b10d86275495b97e93b124dd6cc5ab527a5823f854e221d2f9a454145&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukraine energy minister warns of more power cuts, possible Russian attacks</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/ukraine-energy-minister-warns-more-power-cuts-possible-russian-attacks-2026-02-04/</link><description>Feb 5 (Reuters) - Ukraine's energy minister warned households on Wednesday that planned blackouts could worsen in coming days and Russian forces could launch a new air attack to further disable power and heating networks.

Denys Shmyhal said well over 200 emergency crews were at work in the capital restoring heating to apartment buildings after a series of mass Russian attacks in January. Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said on Tuesday that more than 1,100 buildings remained without heating.

"The situation with energy remains very difficult. There is a risk that timetables for power cuts could get worse," Shmyhal wrote on Telegram after a daily meeting of senior officials devoted to energy issues.

"This is linked to the last strike and the fact that the shortfalls in generation in the power system are still significant. And the Russians are preparing for new attacks on the energy sector in the coming week."

Shmyhal said that buildings where restoring heating is likely to take some time were to receive assurances that they will have electricity for 18 hours a day.

Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko, also writing after the daily meeting, said 217 Russian attacks on Ukraine's energy system had been recorded since the beginning of the year. She provided a list of assistance, including hundreds of generators, supplied by European countries and the U.N. Children's Fund.

President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, speaking in his nightly video address, said the situation in Kyiv was worse than in other cities and resources were being redirected to the capital, along with additional help to Ukraine's second-largest city, Kharkiv.

Zelenskiy on Tuesday said Russia had deployed hundreds of drones and a record number of ballistic missiles in its latest mass attack on Ukraine focusing on energy sites on the eve of three-sided peace talks with Russia and the United States.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 02:06:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/FQ7OV3AFQFJKFIAUNBISE2TNOE.jpg?auth=ae41b9c934f0378af22a83485e994d2e94a7cd245b1aeef6bd1fc7b25c6e47ae&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Armed Islamist extremists kill 162 in western Nigeria villages</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/africa/20260205-armed-islamist-extremists-kill-162-in-western-nigeria-villages</link><description>Armed extremists killed at least 162 people during attacks on two villages in western Nigeria, a lawmaker said Wednesday, in one of the deadliest assaults in recent months.

The attacks targeted the villages of Woro and Nuku, in the state of Kwara, on Tuesday evening, Mohammed Omar Bio, a member of parliament representing the area, told The Associated Press.

He said the attacks were carried out by the Lakurawa, an armed group affiliated with the Islamic State group. No one has claimed responsibility for the attacks.

Ayodeji Emmanuel Babaomo, the Red Cross secretary in Kwara state, said the organisation has been unable to reach the communities where “scores of people were killed” because they are in a remote area – about eight hours from the state capital and near Nigeria ’s border with Benin .

Footage from the scene on local television show bodies lying in blood on the ground, some with their hands tied, as well as burning houses.

State governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq described the attack as a “cowardly expression of frustration by terrorist cells” in response to ongoing military operations against armed extremists in the state.

Nigeria is in the grip of a complex security crisis, with an insurgency by Islamic militants in the northeast alongside a surge in kidnappings for ransom by gunmen across the northwest and north-central regions over recent months.

Separately on Tuesday, unknown gunmen killed at least 13 people in the village of Doma, in the northwestern state of Katsina, police spokesman Abubakar Sadiq Aliyu said. No one has claimed responsibility for the attack.

Boko Haram extremists in northeastern Nigeria killed at least 36 people last week during separate attacks on a construction site and on an army base.

The armed groups in Nigeria include at least two affiliated with IS, an offshoot of the Boko Haram extremist group known as the Islamic State West Africa Province in the northeast, and the lesser-known Islamic State Sahel Province (ISSP), known locally as Lakurawa, and prominent in the northwest.

The Nigerian military has said in the past that the Lakurawa has roots in neighbouring Niger and that it became more active in Nigeria’s border communities following a 2023 military coup.

James Barnett, a researcher at the Washington-based Hudson Institute, said the attack in Kwara state was most likely perpetrated by the Jama’atu Ahlis Sunna Lidda’awati wal-Jihad, or JAS, a Boko Haram faction that has been responsible for other recent massacres in the area.

On Tuesday, the head of US Africa Command said the United States had sent a small team of military officers to Nigeria, the latest step in its response to the security crisis. In December, US forces launched air strikes on IS-affiliated militants in Nigeria.

Africa’s most populous country has been in the diplomatic crosshairs of the US following threats by US President Donald Trump to attack the country, alleging it is not doing enough to protect its Christian citizens.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 02:06:33 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/aa466176-00f8-11f1-9e75-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP24084235785424.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Macron's envoy met with Russian officials for peace talks in Moscow</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260204-macron-envoy-met-with-russian-officials-for-peace-talks-in-moscow</link><description>French President Emmanuel Macron ’s most senior diplomat was in Moscow on Tuesday to hold talks with Russian officials, according to a source familiar with the meeting and two diplomatic sources.

The first source said Emmanuel Bonne, who has been at the helm of Macron’s diplomatic cell since 2019, met officials at the Kremlin. He did not give further details beyond saying the aim was to hold dialogue on key issues, most importantly Ukraine.

The French presidency neither confirmed nor denied the talks, but said: “As the President said during his doorstep yesterday, discussions exist at a technical level, in full transparency and in consultation with President Volodymyr Zelensky and with the main European colleagues.”

The two diplomatic sources said allies had been made aware of the initiative and that Bonne had held talks with Yuri Ushakov, a senior aide to Russian President Vladimir Putin .

Macron said in December that Europeans would have to re-engage in direct talks with Putin if the latest US-led efforts to broker a Ukraine peace deal were to founder.

European leaders, wary of Putin’s military ambitions, have smarted at their exclusion from peace talks led by US President Donald Trump ’s administration, compelled instead to shore up Ukraine’s negotiating position from the sidelines.

Macron told reporters on Tuesday that efforts were under way to restart dialogue with Putin.

“It’s being prepared, and so there are discussions that are being held at a technical level,” he said, adding that this was being done in consultation with Ukraine.

“It’s important that the Europeans restore their own channels of discussion.”</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 02:06:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/839f5018-df07-11f0-b559-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/2025-12-02T131140Z-1094515744-RC2D8IAZ5M9E-RTRMADP-3-UKRAINE-CRISIS-PUTIN-WITKOFF.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Australia says attempted bombing of national day protest was act of terror</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/australia-says-attempted-bombing-national-day-protest-was-act-terror-2026-02-05/</link><description>SYDNEY, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Australian authorities said on Thursday they were treating as a terrorism incident an attempt to bomb a rally protesting against the country's national day on January 26, the first such charge in the state of Western Australia.

They arrested a 31-year-old man on accusations of hurling a homemade bomb into a crowd of several thousand people in the city of Perth. No one was injured because the bomb did not explode.

Police and state leader Roger Cook said the man held white supremacist views and the attack was an attempt to target Aboriginal people, one of Australia's two main Indigenous groups.

"This charge ... alleges the attack on Aboriginal people and other peaceful protesters was motivated by hateful, racist ideology," Cook told a news conference. If proved, it carries a maximum sentence of life in prison.

Australia Day, which commemorates Britain's colonisation of the country in 1788, is a public holiday marked by picnics, barbecues and ceremonies for new citizens but it has also attracted criticism from some including in the Indigenous community, with "Invasion Day" protest rallies nationwide.

The names and faces of sexual abuse victims. Bank account and Social Security numbers in full view.

All of these things appeared in the mountain of documents released Friday by the US Justice Department as part of its effort to comply with a law requiring it to open its investigative files on Jeffrey Epstein .

That law was intended to preserve important privacy protections for Epstein's victims. Their names were supposed to have been blacked out in documents. Their faces and bodies were supposed to be obscured in photos.

Mistakes, though, have been rampant. A review by The Associated Press and other news organisations has found countless examples of sloppy, inconsistent or nonexistent redactions that have revealed sensitive private information.

A photo of one girl who was underage when she was hired to give sexualised massages to Epstein in Florida appeared in a chart of his alleged victims. Police reports with the names of several of his victims, including some who have never stepped forward to identify themselves publicly, were released with no redactions at all.

Despite the Justice Department’s efforts to fix the oversights, a selfie taken by a nude woman in a bathroom and another by a topless woman remained on the site, their faces both in full view, as of Wednesday evening.

Some accusers and their lawyers called this week for the Justice Department to take down the site and appoint an independent monitor to prevent further errors.

A judge scheduled a hearing for Wednesday in New York on the matter, then cancelled it after one of the lawyers for victims cited progress in resolving the issues. But that lawyer, Brittany Henderson, said they were still weighing “all potential avenues of recourse” to address the “permanent and irreparable” harm caused to some women.

“The failure here is not merely technical,” she said in a statement Wednesday. “It is a failure to safeguard human beings who were promised protection by our government . Until every document is properly redacted, that failure is ongoing.”

Annie Farmer, who said she was 16 when she was sexually assaulted by Epstein and his confidant, Ghislaine Maxwell , said that while her name has previously been public, other details she'd rather be kept private, including her date of birth and phone number, were wrongly revealed in the documents.

“At this point, I’m feeling really most of all angry about the way that this unfolded,” she told NBC News. “The fact that it’s been done in such a beyond careless way, where people have been endangered because of it, is really horrifying.”

The Justice Department has blamed technical or human errors on the problems and said it has taken down many of the problematic materials and is working to republish properly redacted versions.

The task of reviewing and blacking out millions of pages of records took place in a compressed time frame. President Donald Trump signed the law requiring the disclosure of the documents on November 19. That law gave the Justice Department just 30 days to release the files . It missed that deadline, in part because it said it needed more time to comply with privacy protections.

Hundreds of lawyers were pulled from their regular duties, including overseeing criminal cases, to try and complete the document review – to the point where at least one judge in New York complained that it was holding up other matters.

The database, which is posted on the Justice Department website, represents the largest release of files to date in the yearslong investigations into Epstein, who killed himself in a New York jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges.

Associated Press reporters analysing the documents have so far found multiple examples of names and other personal information of potential victims revealed.

They have also found many cases of overzealous redactions.

In one news clipping included in the file, the Justice Department apparently blacked out the name “Joseph” from a photo caption describing a Nativity scene at a California church. “A Nativity scene depicting Jesus, Mary and (REDACTED),” it said.

In an email released in the files, a dog’s name appeared to have been redacted: “I spent an hour walking (REDACTED) and then another hour bathing her blow drying her and brushing her. I hope she smells better!!” the email said.

The Justice Department has said staff tasked with preparing the files for release were instructed to limit redactions only to information related to victims and their families, though in many documents the names of many other people were blacked out, including lawyers and public figures.

The Justice Department has said it intended to black out any portion of a photo showing nudity, and any photos of women that could potentially show a victim.

In some photos reviewed by The AP, those redactions did obscure women's faces, but left plenty of their bare skin exposed in a way that would likely embarrass the women anyway. Photos showed identifiable women trying on outfits in clothing store dressing rooms or lounging in bathing suits.

One set of more than 100 images of a young woman were nearly all blacked out, save for the very last image, which revealed her entire face.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 04:30:47 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/28718252-fe69-11f0-ae35-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26031020763767.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia will continue to supply oil to Cuba, RIA cites ambassador</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/russia-will-continue-supply-oil-cuba-ria-cites-ambassador-2026-02-05/</link><description>MOSCOW, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Russia has repeatedly supplied oil to Cuba in recent years, and will continue to do so, Russia's ambassador to Cuba Viktor Coronelli said in an interview with state news agency RIA.

Klitschko said the attack caused damage in residential buildings in one district, and in another debris fell on the roof of an office building, causing a fire.

Debris also fell close to a shopping centre, and at a different side windows were broken in a kindergarten, Klitschko said on the Telegram messaging app.

Ukraine's Air Force said Russia launched two ballistic missiles and 183 drones at Ukraine overnight - air defence shot down 156 drones.

A man was also hurt in a surrounding Kyiv region, the regional governor said.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 07:01:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Taiwan Strait missions are about international law, not provocation, French diplomat says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/taiwan-strait-missions-are-about-international-law-not-provocation-french-2026-02-05/</link><description>TAIPEI, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Naval missions by foreign countries in the Taiwan Strait are about asserting international law, rather than offering provocation, France's de facto ambassador in Taipei said on Thursday, speaking of voyages that routinely infuriate China.

In addition to claiming sovereignty over democratically governed Taiwan, Beijing views the narrow, highly strategic strait as Chinese territorial waters and has responded aggressively on occasion to foreign navies sailing there.

"We are careful to send these naval assets into international waters without any provocation," Franck Paris, director of the French Office in Taipei, told reporters.

They aimed to send a clear message that international law prevails in the waters and should remain so, added Paris, whose country is chairing the Group of Seven nations for the coming year.

U.S. warships traverse the strait every few months, enraging Beijing, and some U.S. allies, such as France, Australia, Britain and Canada, have also made occasional transits.

Paris said it had now become routine for G7 statements to include language on maintaining the status quo across the strait and opposing use of force or coercion.

"This is a clear message that we repeat all the time, and I think there is a good choreography between a number of G7 partners to send this message," he added, pointing to past naval trips by Canada and the Netherlands, among others.

The last publicly confirmed sailing by a French navy ship in the strait, a conduit for trade running into billions of dollars a year, was in 2024.

The government of Taiwan, which rejects Beijing's sovereignty claims, welcomes such transits as support for freedom of navigation. China's military routinely operates in the waterway in what Taipei views as a pressure campaign.

France, like most countries, has no formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan, but is viewed by Taipei as an important partner and fellow democracy.

Three decades ago it sold Mirage fighter jets and frigates to Taiwan, although the United States is the island's most important international source of arms.

"These assets are still used by the Taiwanese defence," Paris said, adding that French companies helped maintain them by providing necessary equipment.

"This is the framework that we are committed to and this framework has not been questioned for years."</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 07:02:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/DPLO2PVLF5I4ZF5F6YTKZPDIW4.jpg?auth=ee3848c612867327b64dffe1f4c7cf0b2230dc201541c1815349def0d5694f89&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>South Africa's trade minister heads to China, seeking duty-free export access</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/south-africas-trade-minister-heads-china-seeking-duty-free-export-access-2026-02-05/</link><description>JOHANNESBURG, Feb 5 (Reuters) - South Africa's trade minister Parks Tau will travel to China from Thursday to Saturday to sign the China–Africa Economic Partnership Agreement, which will see South African exports gain duty-free access to the Chinese market, Tau's office said.

South Africa is seeking to boost exports amid a tariff row with the United States, its second-largest bilateral trading partner after China.

U.S. President Donald Trump imposed a 30% tariff on South African exports to the U.S. in August, the highest rate in Sub-Saharan Africa.

Tau's trip to China "comes at a time when South Africa is pursuing an objective of market diversification and export growth," his office said in a statement on Thursday.

Ukraine, Russia and the United States will start a second day of talks in Abu Dhabi on Thursday, seeking to end Moscow's nearly four-year invasion.

The US-mediated talks are the latest chapter in the so far unsuccessful diplomatic effort to halt the war triggered by Russia's full-scale offensive in February 2022.

A first day of trilateral talks in the Emirati capital on Wednesday concluded with Kyiv describing the negotiations as "substantive and productive", though there was no apparent breakthrough.

Balochistan, Pakistan's largest and poorest province, was brought to a virtual standstill on Saturday when the separatist Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) stormed schools, banks, markets and security installations across the region in one of their largest operations ever.

The military said 22 security personnel and 36 civilians were killed in the attacks.

The BLA's coordinated strikes in over a dozen locations began after the military launched its "intelligence driven" Radd Al-Fitna 1 (countering chaos) operation, which the army said began on January 29.

"Through meticulous planning, actionable intelligence, and seamless joint execution Pakistan’s security forces and law enforcement agencies with support of intelligence agencies under Operation Radd-ul-Fitna-1 responded with precision and resolve," the military said in a statement, adding that 216 militants had been killed in all of Balochistan since the operation began.

Security officials and witnesses said the insurgents seized government buildings and police stations in several locations, including taking over the desert town of Nushki for three days before they were pushed out.

Helicopters and drones were deployed to Nushki to end the siege, security officials said.

Mineral-rich Balochistan borders Iran and Afghanistan and is home to Beijing's investment in the Gwadar deepwater port and other projects.

It has grappled with a decades-long insurgency led by ethnic Baloch separatists seeking greater autonomy and a larger share of its natural resources.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 07:55:19 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CIKFALOSTFJNPLSML53K4BBYDQ.jpg?auth=8a3f23a9734b9fa697c400e022851c6798fdb0d707879ae38086b556c3b1d99a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukraine, Russia start second day of peace talks in Abu Dhabi</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/ukraine-russia-start-second-day-peace-talks-abu-dhabi-2026-02-05/</link><description>KYIV, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Ukraine and Russia on Thursday started a second day of U.S.-brokered talks in Abu Dhabi to discuss how to end their four-year-old war, top Ukrainian negotiator Rustem Umerov said.

Opinion polls consistently show the progressive People's Party is Thailand's most popular party. With its ambitious reform agenda and mastery of social media, it has huge appeal among young and urban Thais and will be a force to reckon with.

Its predecessor Move Forward won the 2023 election , taking all but one of the 33 seats in the capital Bangkok and making inroads into conservative strongholds. But it lacked parliamentary support to form a government, despite a pact with the second-placed Pheu Thai party .

Surveys indicate People's Party has lost none of its momentum. It was backed by 36% of respondents in a January 16-28 poll of 26,661 people by Suan Dusit University, with the former ruling party Pheu Thai on 22.1% and Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul's Bhumjaithai third on 18.9%.

A January 23-27 survey of 2,500 people by the National Institute for Development Administration showed 34.2% support for People's Party, with Bhumjaithai at 22.6% and Pheu Thai on 16.2%.

At the last election in 2023, People's Party's forerunner won 151 of the 500 seats at stake, Pheu Thai took 141 and Bhumjaithai won 71.

An outright majority for any of the three main parties is unlikely so an alliance is almost certain to be required to form a government.

But this could be tricky given bad blood and ideological differences between the parties , with bitter histories of betrayal and big fallouts within the past six months. Pacts with some of the dozens of smaller parties running could be decisive in breaking any deadlock and the party that wins most seats in the election may not prevail.

People's Party's advantage will be its strength at the ballot box but forming a coalition could be difficult. Bhumjaithai's politically savvy leader Anutin is an accomplished dealmaker willing to work with any party and his efforts would likely be backed by influential conservatives outside of politics.

The once-dominant Pheu Thai, controlled by the billionaire Shinawatra family , has a big war chest at its disposal, though it has been hit by defections to Bhumjaithai and declining popularity. Some analysts believe Pheu Thai is most likely to partner with Bhumjaithai to form a government, as it has previously.

People's Party looks to have the upper hand, but its liberal, anti-establishment agenda and long-term quest for institutional reform could stand in its way, even if it has moderated its stance of late.

Its popularity and policies that have included tackling monopolies and reforms to the military and judiciary could upend Thailand's decades-old status quo and threaten interests of business groups, powerful elites and royalist generals. It has very influential enemies.

Its first incarnation Future Forward was dissolved by a court in 2020 for a campaign finance violation, triggering street protests. It returned as Move Forward and won most votes in the 2023 election but was blocked from forming a government by army-appointed senators and dissolved by a court for campaigning to amend a law that protects the monarchy from criticism.

It regrouped again as People's Party, the English name commonly used by the Khana Ratsadon, which launched a 1932 revolution that ended Thailand's absolute monarchy.

People's Party is braced for more legal action, with the National Anti-Corruption Commission, which has a broad remit, now investigating 44 former Move Forward lawmakers for ethics breaches for attempting to change the royal insult law in 2021, a plan it has now dropped.

Among them are 15 People's Party members, including two of its three prime ministerial candidates, leader Natthaphong Ruengpanyawut and deputy leader Sirikanya Tansakun. If referred to the Supreme Court, they could face some kind of political ban.

Anutin, 59, is a political pragmatist with a party big enough to negotiate key ministerial posts and a place in numerous coalition governments.

A staunch royalist who has positioned himself strategically between rival political clans, Anutin's rise to the premiership last September demonstrated his ability to outfox opponents, moving quickly after a court sacked then Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra and lobbying parties to abandon her coalition and back him instead.

Anutin needs to drum up more support and expand on Bhumjaithai's 71 seats in the last election and leverage his ties in the country's establishment to help form an alliance capable of keeping People's Party at bay.

Parties contesting the election have submitted up to three prime ministerial candidates . Any party with at least 25 seats can nominate a candidate to be put to a parliamentary vote.

Support of more than half of the lower house's 500 members is required to become prime minister. If a candidate fails, the house must convene again and the process is repeated for other candidates until a premier is chosen, with no time limit on this process.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 07:57:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/J4UQCRRWZNP2RP3F2FDNU2HAGQ.jpg?auth=c895b1cf0f3e80004468cacf8aa01046868bd99e0ee01ea027813be0823faf5c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>French navy seizes more than 4 tonnes of cocaine from ship in South Pacific</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260205-french-navy-seizes-more-than-4-tonnes-of-cocaine-ship-south-pacific</link><description>France 's navy has seized 4.25 tonnes of cocaine from a ship in the south Pacific, officials said Wednesday.

The vessel, from Central America and believed bound for South Africa , was intercepted in French Polynesia , the country's high commission in the island territory said.

Its cargo was destroyed at sea, away from the Polynesian economic zone and marine protected area, officials said.

The prosecutor's office did not bring charges so as not to burden the local court with a case of drug trafficking not destined for French Polynesia itself.

The high commission said the vessel and its crew were freed under international law.

The navy seized almost five tonnes of cocaine, believed headed for Australia , from a fishing vessel near French Polynesia last month.

The United Nations has said in recent years that organised crime groups trafficking cocaine and methamphetamine have expanded their presence in the Pacific.

Large amounts of drugs are transported from North and South America for Australian and New Zealand markets, according to the UN.

French Polynesia lies along these maritime routes and is itself affected by significant methamphetamine use.

The thieves who robbed the famed Paris museum last October made off with an estimated €88 million ($104 million) in jewels, but dropped the empress's diamond- and emerald-studded crown as they escaped, leaving it crushed and broken.

Investigators have yet to locate the other jewels , but recovered the dropped crown.

The Louvre said in a statement the piece had been "badly deformed", but remained "nearly intact" and would be restored to its original state, "without the need for reconstruction".

The museum said the crown was damaged when the thieves tried to remove it through a narrow hole they had sawed in the glass case where it was displayed.

The Louvre said the crown still had all its pieces, except for one of the eight golden eagles that adorned it.

It retains all 56 of its emeralds and all but 10 of its 1,354 diamonds, the museum said.

It said an expert committee led by the museum's president, Laurence des Cars, had been selected to supervise the restoration, which would be carried out by a qualified expert chosen in a competitive selection process.

Authorities have arrested all four alleged members of the heist crew, but have not found the mastermind – or the remaining jewels.

The thieves made off with eight other items of jewellery, including a diamond-studded tiara that belonged to Eugenie, wife of Napoleon III.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 07:57:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/88e41da4-025e-11f1-8273-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/000-96797CQ.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>French Navy intercepts boat with cocaine in Caribbean</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/french-navy-intercepts-boat-with-cocaine-caribbean-2026-02-05/</link><description>PARIS, Feb 5 (Reuters) - The French Navy has intercepted a boat that was carrying cocaine and handed it over to the Barbadian authorities, France's Armed Forces Minister said on Thursday, as the United States and other countries step up their fight against drug trafficking .

France, which has overseas territories in the Caribbean and Latin American regions, has been pushing a more aggressive policy in recent months on drug trafficking.

The French Monitoring Center for Drugs and Drug Addiction published a report in December saying that cocaine had overtaken cannabis as the leading illegal drug in France.

Gang-related drug crime is on the rise in France, and during a visit to Colombia, the world's largest cocaine producer, France's Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot launched a multi-pronged plan to fight an explosion of drug trafficking in Latin America, the Caribbean and increasingly Europe.

Hun Manet wrote to French President Emmanuel Macron asking for access to any historical and technical documents that France might have that relate to the border, and also welcomed France's expertise and advisory support, the foreign ministry said in a statement dated February 4.

The 817-km (508-mile) border was first mapped by France in 1907, when Cambodia was its colony, and was based on the natural watershed dividing the country from Thailand.

Disputed territories include several renowned historical sites, including the 11th century Hindu temple Preah Vihear, known to Thais as the Khao Phra Viharn.

France's Embassy in Cambodia and the Thai foreign ministry did not immediately respond to separate requests for comment.

Cambodia also welcomed France's "constructive engagement" in efforts to resolve the long-standing dispute, the prime minister said, according to the statement.

Hun Manet had said Macron indicated a willingness to help in previous meetings.

Fighting between the two southeast Asian neighbours broke out in July last year after weeks of tensions sparked by the death of a Cambodian soldier in a skirmish in late May.

After five days of clashes that killed 43 people, the conflict ended in a fragile ceasefire brokered in Malaysia after an intervention by U.S. President Donald Trump.

Hostilities resumed in December and lasted more than three weeks, with both sides accusing the other of violating the terms of the ceasefire.

As many as 101 people were killed and more than half a million displaced on both sides before a new truce was declared on December 27.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 08:44:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/NC5TWCLQJNKQVFWIQEUIBOGQW4.jpg?auth=0ac5e588986d9c862bb2793e897192ba49fc55d06dd8e382a7d15b9dee162fcb&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>For Serbia's Muslim students, protest brings sense of belonging</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/serbias-muslim-students-protest-brings-sense-belonging-2026-02-05/</link><description>By Marko Djurica

When Merima Avdic crossed a bridge over the Danube River to reach the city of Novi Sad in November, a Serbian flag in her hand, fireworks lit the sky and tens of thousands of protesting students cheered to welcome her and her peers.

She had walked more than 400 km (249 miles) from the University of Novi Pazar in the Muslim-majority Sandzak region of southwest Serbia, to join one of the largest and longest protests in the country in decades, triggered by the collapse of a railway station roof a year earlier.

Sixteen people were killed, leading to calls for the government to step down amid accusations of corruption and a lack of accountability that many blame for the disaster in Novi Sad.

Government officials have denied allegations of state graft that led to poor construction standards.

Joining the thousands in Novi Sad was a huge moment for Avdic, a student from Serbia’s small Bosniak Muslim minority, wearing her hijab.

On her arrival in Novi Sad she felt, finally, like she belonged in Serbia, she said.

“During the walk, I was stunned to see so many people who supported us and who came out to tell us that we are not alone,” Merima said. “A gentleman from Kosjeric gave us his flag because we didn’t have one. With it we marched into Novi Sad.”

Muslims account for 4 percent of Serbia’s population, and more than half live in the Sandzak region, where Avdic was born. They have lived there for generations, including through the decades of war, Serb nationalism and ethnic conflict that tore the former Yugoslavia apart.

Protests that have swept across Serbia over the last year have been led by students and have united Serbians of all ethnicities and age groups bound by a common drive for reform and an end to corruption in the Balkan country.

In few places has the new sense of unity in protest been more apparent than at the State University of Novi Pazar, where a community that once faced prejudice and state oppression now feels accepted in a broader movement for change.

Founded in 2007, the university, the first in the region, gave the Bosniak minority access to local state-funded higher education for the first time. But national acceptance of their community took longer.

Merima felt the national shift on the journey to Novi Sad. The students even spent a night in the medieval Orthodox monastery of Studenica where they were served a halal breakfast - something unimaginable 25 years ago.

Located between Bosnia, Montenegro and Serbia, the region’s Muslim population, which observes Islam less strictly with few women wearing hijabs, has long felt marginalised. In 1991, 99% of voters in Sandzak called for autonomy from Serbia in a non-binding referendum.

“In the past 30 years Novi Pazar was sidelined, people lived in fear, and never stood up,” Avdic said. “I am proud of myself and my colleagues and how we destroyed prejudice and showed that we want to live in this country.”

A photo at one protest in Kraljevo, in central Serbia, captured Nadija Delimedjac, a student from Novi Pazar wearing a hijab, with Sava Nikolic from Cuprija with a traditional Serbian hat. It went viral on social media and became a symbol of the changes made by the students.

A year-long blockade of Novi Pazar University by the students, which had stopped lectures taking place, ended little over a week ago, after the replacement of the university's rector and the reversal of a ban on 200 students, who had been expelled for their anti-government activism.

Their protest outlasted those at most other universities in Serbia, and saw students occupy the buildings even after authorities had cut the heating.

“I am stunned by the sacrifice they have made,” said Delimedjac’s father Muamer, referring to the march to Novi Sad. “Diversity is our fortune.”

Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022 after eight years of fighting in the east, triggering the deadliest war in Europe since World War Two and biggest confrontation between Moscow and the West since the depths of the Cold War.

Dmitriev, Putin's envoy on investment who has played a central role in U.S.-mediated negotiations on Ukraine, said that "warmongers" from Europe and Britain were "constantly trying to interfere with this process, constantly trying to meddle in it".

"And the more such attempts there are, the more we see that progress is definitely being made," he told reporters ahead of the talks. "There is positive movement forward."

He said active work was underway on restoring relations with the United States, including within the framework of a U.S.-Russia working group on economy.

Tuesday's assault on Woro village was the deadliest this year in the state bordering Niger, a hotspot where Islamic State West Africa Province and other armed groups have stepped up village attacks and mass kidnappings.

The violence highlights fears that jihadist factions from the north are pushing south along the Niger-Kwara axis toward the Kainji forest, which security analysts warn could become their next stronghold.

Nigeria has come under scrutiny after U.S. President Donald Trump accused it last year of failing to protect Christians amid Islamist attacks and mass kidnappings. U.S. forces struck what they described as terrorist targets on December 25.

Abuja says it is working with Washington to improve security and denies any systematic persecution of Christians.

Tinubu said the new military unit would stem further attacks and protect remote communities. He condemned the attack as "cowardly and barbaric," saying the gunmen targeted villagers who had rejected attempts to impose extremist rule.

"It is commendable that community members, even though Muslims, refused to be conscripted into a belief that promotes violence over peace," Tinubu said in a statement.

Residents told Reuters the attackers were jihadists who had long preached in the village, urging locals to abandon the Nigerian state and adopt Sharia rule. When villagers refused, the militants opened fire.

About 38 houses were destroyed, said Saidu Baba Ahmed, a lawmaker representing the district at the state assembly.

In a separate attack in northern Katsina state on Tuesday, gunmen killed at least 21 people, moving from house to house to shoot their victims, residents and local police said.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 09:45:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/QY6R6HFL5BIALOE6JJ2DS3RCGE.jpg?auth=771576236ffa81ab34671e138c251268e363300fda284f9ac1195f52edff2363&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>One dead, a girl missing as Storm Leonardo batters Portugal and Spain</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/one-dead-girl-missing-storm-leonardo-batters-portugal-spain-2026-02-05/</link><description>MADRID, Feb 5 (Reuters) - One man died in Portugal after flood waters engulfed his car and in Spain, a girl was dragged away by a river after trying to rescue her dog, as Storm Leonardo lashed the Iberian peninsula with heavy rains and strong winds on Thursday.

Leonardo is the latest in a wave of half a dozen winter storms that have swept across Portugal and Spain this year, killing several people, ripping roofs off homes and flooding towns.

A man of around 70 died on Wednesday in Portugal's southern Alentejo region after his car was swept away on a flooded road near a dam, Portuguese authorities said.

In southern Spain's Malaga province, a girl went missing after she was dragged away by the Turvilla river while trying to rescue her dog.

"We spent the whole afternoon and night yesterday searching in the river from the place where the girl fell in until the very end of the river. We found the dog, but not her," Malaga fire chief Manuel Marmolejo said on Spanish television.

Storm Marta, the next weather front in the so-called "storm train", is expected to hit the region over the weekend, according to state weather agency Aemet.

Reconstruction costs in Portugal after last week's Storm Kristin alone could total over 4 billion euros ($4.7 billion), Economy Minister Manuel Castro Almeida said.

People waded waist-deep through Alcacer do Sal in southern Portugal after successive storms caused the river Sado to breach its banks. Restaurant terraces were completely underwater, with sandbags stacked in front of doors to protect homes and shops.

"I've never seen anything like this. It's surreal," said resident Maria Cadacha. "There are a lot of people here, very good people, many shopkeepers, homes with damage. I wouldn't want to be in their shoes."

Andalusia's emergency services had attended to more than a million incidents by midnight on Wednesday, they said on X.

Fourteen rivers and 10 dams were at "extreme" risk of overflowing, according to Antonio Sanz, head of the regional government's interior department.

Portugal's National Civil Protection said it had registered at least 70 incidents as of early Thursday.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 09:46:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7WXRYZLTZFON7GCBJZPW4L53MY.jpg?auth=f165d2efc550b893708a3bc88fdd140ecf08ee4ef27e8b24c18872ac0e71bce9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UN rights chief appeals for $400 million as crises mount and funding shrinks</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/un-rights-chief-appeals-400-million-crises-mount-funding-shrinks-2026-02-05/</link><description>GENEVA, Feb 5 (Reuters) - U.N. human rights chief Volker Turk appealed for $400 million on Thursday to address mounting human rights needs in countries such as Sudan and Myanmar, after donor funding cuts drastically reduced the work of his office and left it in "survival mode".

The U.N. office is appealing for $100 million less than last year, after a significant scale back of its work in some areas due to a fall in contributions from countries including the U.S. and Europe.

"We are currently in survival mode, delivering under strain," Turk told delegates in a speech in Geneva, urging countries to step up support.

In the last year, Turk's office raised alarm about human rights violations in Gaza , Sudan , the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ukraine , and Myanmar, among others.

However, due to slashes in funding, Turk's office undertook less than half the number of human rights monitoring missions compared to 2024, and reduced its presence in 17 countries, he said. Last year it received $90 million less in funding than it needed, which resulted in 300 job cuts , directly impacting the office's work, Turk said in December.

"We cannot afford a human rights system in crisis," he stated.

Turk listed examples of the impacts of cuts, noting the Myanmar programme was cut by more than 60% in the last year, limiting its ability to gather evidence.

A U.N. probe into possible war crimes in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is also struggling to become fully operational due to limited funding, while work to prevent gender-based violence and protect the rights of LGBTIQ+ people globally has been cut up to 75%, the office said.

"This means more hate speech and attacks, and fewer laws to stop them," Turk stated.

The U.N. human rights office is responsible for investigating rights violations. Its work contributes to U.N. Security Council deliberations and is widely used by international courts, according to the office.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 09:46:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/GTZYQU7WDRMYDFT4BFBRBCR5QQ.jpg?auth=256f72a2751208b37c309c8da80d7ee4bc80cf9e89f08a0e2e095d3dc8eea685&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>India to sign trade deal with United States in March, minister says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/india/india-us-trade-deal-be-signed-march-indian-trade-minister-says-2026-02-05/</link><description>NEW DELHI, Feb 5 (Reuters) - India and the United States expect to sign a long-awaited formal trade deal in March, after which New Delhi will reduce tariffs on U.S. goods, Trade Minister Piyush Goyal said on Thursday.

They will issue a joint statement in four or five days, prompting Washington to cut duties on Indian exports to 18% from 50%, he added, laying out the first official timeline for the adoption of the deal since it was unveiled on Monday.

President Donald Trump announced the surprise trade deal with India, which slashes U.S. tariffs on Indian goods in exchange for India putting a halt to Russian oil purchases and lowering trade barriers.

Goyal said India will import at least $500 billion worth of energy, aircraft and chips, among other purchases from the United States over the next five years.

Its orders from companies such as planemaker Boeing (BA.N) , opens new tab could amount to $70 billion to $80 billion, he added.

"If you add engines, it will probably cross $100 billion," Goyal said.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 09:47:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/FSC3NN5QJFPHBNMTHH6TL5QLZU.jpg?auth=ccc95a9371c2ed41711293438d3882b8cc037da55284ebb6de5912f4eb5bcecc&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>IOC fears Americans will face jeers at Winter Olympics opening ceremony</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260205-ioc-fears-americans-face-jeers-winter-olympics-opening-ceremony-italy</link><description>The International ‍Olympic Committee is ​hoping the Milano Cortina Winter Games' opening ceremony on Friday will not be marred by ⁠jeers against Americans , and will be a show of respect for athletes from around the world.

US Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio are expected at the event ​in the San Siro stadium.

There are concerns spectators could boo them or ‍the American team, with the presence of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Border Patrol agents a source of anger ​in Italy .

ICE's Homeland Security Investigations division will back up the US State ​Department's Diplomatic Security Service at the February 6-22 Milano Cortina Olympics.

ICE and Border Patrol agents have come under heavy criticism in the US over their enforcement of President Donald Trump 's immigration crackdown, and recent news ICE would be operating at the Games caused anger in Italy and led to protests.

"I hope that the opening ceremony is seen by everyone as an opportunity to be respectful of each other," ‍IOC President Kirsty Coventry told a press conference on Wednesday when asked if she had any concerns that American athletes ​or officials could be booed.

Italian politicians have strongly criticised the presence of ICE agents in the country, despite assurances that there is nothing unusual about the deployment, highlighting how ‌the image of the US has been tarnished in recent months.

"When we went to the (Olympic) village that is the best reminder of how we ‍should be," Coventry said. "You see athletes from every walk of life. No one is asking what country they come from or what religion. They are all just hanging out.

"It was a real opportunity to put into perspective how we could be and so, for me, I hope that the opening ceremony will do that and will be a reminder for everyone how we could be," said ‍Coventry, who took over at the IOC last year.

Vance will be joined by his wife, Usha, the second ‌lady of the ​United States, for the ceremony. The delegation will also include Rubio, US Ambassador to Italy Tilman Fertitta and several former Olympic champions.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 09:48:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/4cbaa124-0275-11f1-94e2-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26035652977979.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Kremlin dismisses Western claims that Epstein was Russian intelligence asset</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/kremlin-dismisses-western-claims-that-epstein-was-russian-intelligence-asset-2026-02-05/</link><description>MOSCOW, Feb 5 (Reuters) - The Kremlin said on Thursday it did not want to waste time answering questions about unproven suggestions in Western media and by Poland's premier that late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein may have been some sort of Russian intelligence asset.

Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said on Tuesday that Warsaw would launch an investigation into what it said were possible links between Epstein and Russia's intelligence services, and into any potential impact on Poland.

Tusk gave no evidence for his assertions, though Western media have questioned over recent days whether or not Epstein was a Russian agent collecting compromising material about the rich and powerful.

Asked by Reuters about Tusk's remarks and about Western media reports, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: "I would like to joke about such versions, but let's not waste our time."

Russian officials say that claims of a link between Epstein and Russian intelligence are clearly being thrust into the public sphere to distract from a scandal they say has laid bare the hypocrisy of powerful men across the U.S. and Europe.

In the files on Epstein released by the U.S. Department of Justice, Russia is mentioned thousands of times.

They also indicate that some of the young women Epstein was in contact with were from Russia, including a 26-year-old woman he sought to introduce to Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor , the younger brother of Britain's King Charles.

Various media organisations and bloggers have also speculated that Epstein was spying for Israel's Mossad foreign intelligence service or the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency.

No definitive proof has yet been published by a major news organisation that he was working for any intelligence service.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 10:41:17 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5GQFO6MDVVNR3CZELBL5URKB7Y.jpg?auth=ee8161e638b23d2772b403e16adc72499cdea7ba42aa34e96a60ed888b38612d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia expels German diplomat in tit-for-tat move</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/russia-expels-german-diplomat-tit-for-tat-move-2026-02-05/</link><description>MOSCOW, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Russia's foreign ministry said on Thursday that it had expelled a German diplomat in response to what it said was Berlin's unfounded expulsion of a Russian diplomat accused of espionage in January.

Current DA leader John Steenhuisen announced on Wednesday that he would not seek re-election at a party leadership contest in April, prompting speculation about who will take over.

Political analysts consider Hill-Lewis, who has served as mayor of Cape Town since 2021, a favourite for the post.

"After John Steenhuisen's announcement yesterday, I have been approached by many party members to stand for the position of Federal Leader," Hill-Lewis wrote in a statement posted on X.

Hill-Lewis said he would only confirm whether he would run for the DA leadership later this month, in line with internal party rules on when public campaigning can start.

Whatever his decision, he said he would seek a second term as Cape Town mayor in local government elections expected to happen late this year.

The coalition government was formed in June 2024 after the biggest party, the African National Congress, lost its parliamentary majority for the first time since the end of white minority rule in 1994.

The DA has 22% of seats in the lower house of parliament and the ANC 41%.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 10:42:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Large blaze breaks out at major German research centre</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/large-blaze-breaks-out-german-research-centre-2026-02-05/</link><description>BERLIN, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Firefighters are responding to a large blaze that broke out at a leading accelerator facility for research purposes in the south-western German city of Darmstadt on Thursday morning, according to police.

The fire has been brought under control but extinguishing work is expected to continue until the evening, police told Reuters.

A spokesperson added that the fire brigade was working to ascertain whether any hazardous substances had been released.

The fire brigade was not immediately available for comment.

According to the Hessenschau news outlet, the fire broke out in the area where the institute's particle accelerator is located.

There were no reported injuries, police said.

It is unclear how the fire began, a spokesperson added.

Pictures of the GSI Helmhotz Centre in Darmstadt showed huge, billowing clouds of smoke pouring out of the building.

The centre was not immediately reachable for comment.

It operates an accelerator facility for heavy ions, which are ions of especially heavy atoms such as gold or lead. Ions are atoms that have lost part of their shell of electrons.

They have a positive electrical charge and can be concentrated into beams and accelerated to extremely high velocities in electric and magnetic fields for experiments in various fields of research.

Nearby residents were warned to keep their doors and windows closed and to turn off their ventilation systems if possible.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 10:42:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US, Ukraine, Russia delegations agree to exchange 314 prisoners, Witkoff says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/us-ukraine-russia-delegations-agree-exchange-314-prisoners-witkoff-says-2026-02-05/</link><description>Feb 5 (Reuters) - Delegations from the United States, Ukraine and Russia have agreed to exchange 314 prisoners, U.S. President Donald Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff said in a post on X on Thursday.

Starmer has previously said he will release the vetting advice he was given when he selected Mandelson for the Washington role, but on Thursday he said he also needed to abide by a police request not to release anything that could prejudice an investigation.

"It had been publicly known for some time that Mandelson knew Epstein, but none of us knew the depth and the darkness of that relationship," he told reporters.

Among Group of Seven countries, Canada recorded the highest rate of food inflation in December, according to government data. Food prices rose by 6.2% in December, double the rate in the U.S., and more than three times the rates in France and Germany.

Carney leads a minority government in Canada and relies on support from other parties to pass legislation and stay in power. While Canadians have consistently rated Carney as the best leader to deal with threats from U.S. President Donald Trump, voter sentiment could change quickly if concerns about American aggression lessen - and cost-of-living issues become more urgent, as they have in Britain, the U.S. and elsewhere.

A statement from the Bank of Canada this week noted that grocery prices jumped by 22% in the last three years, compared to 13% for other consumer prices. The central bank said last year's food inflation was mostly driven by imported foods, supply shortages caused by extreme weather and the significant depreciation of the Canadian dollar in 2024.

Carney announced last week that the country’s poorest 12 million people will get a tax credit for the next five years, “to make sure Canadians have the support they need now.” The government is also taking other measures, like setting aside C$500 million to help businesses deal with supply chain disruptions and allowing producers to write off greenhouse expenses.

But the measures do little to lower food prices in Canada, which is now the biggest driver of inflation, according to Jeremy Kronick, director of the Centre on Financial and Monetary Policy at the C.D. Howe Institute think tank in Toronto.

“This will mostly provide relief to people who are choosing between paying rent or buying food, but it is not going to bring food prices down,” said Michael von Massow, a professor at the University of Guelph who specializes in food economics.

John Fragos, press secretary for Canada's Finance Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne, said the new government initiatives were only a first step towards curbing food costs.

"We've bridged the food inflation gap as it exists now and we're taking aim at structural issues that will, over the medium and long term, bring down the price of groceries," said Fragos.

In late 2024, ex-Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also announced a two-month suspension of a sales tax on selected goods "to give Canadians more money in their pockets." It had mixed results, with some sectors like restaurants reporting increased sales while other businesses did not see an impact.

Academics point to entrenched issues including the dominance of just five companies in the grocery sector, a shorter growing season for produce in Canada, and a reliance on the U.S. that has resulted in higher prices via supply chain disruptions.

“There are some uniquely Canadian problems that make the cost of food here so very expensive,” said Michael Widener, who studies food systems at the University of Toronto.

"Labour and transportation costs are higher, and geographically, we are not close to many other markets,” he said, adding that the dependence on produce from the U.S. and Mexico made Canada extremely vulnerable.

Sylvain Charlebois, an expert in food distribution at Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia, said the government should focus on efforts like eliminating high transportation costs between provinces, addressing the high internal costs of production due to labour laws and the industrial carbon tax among other constraints, and increasing competition within the grocery sector. Canada is a major producer of canola, wheat, dairy and meat but is almost entirely dependent on imports of fresh produce during the winter.

Fresh fruit and vegetables routinely cost at least twice as much in Canada as they do in Britain and elsewhere in Europe; a two-pound bag of carrots in Canada costs $2.21, compared to $0.95 in Britain and $1.18 in Germany, according to online retailers.

Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre has long railed against the high cost of food for Canadians, but that has not translated into increased support. He still trails Carney by double digits in opinion polls -- and Carney's approval has risen since his widely praised Davos speech that openly called out the world's superpowers for using "economic integration as weapons," according to several polls.

A poll by Nanos on January 30 showed 54% of Canadians approved of Carney but also noted that 11.4% said inflation was their biggest concern, up from 9.3% a month earlier.

The Conservatives' co-deputy leader Melissa Lantsman told reporters on Monday that "no amount of tax rebates" will solve the problem of food inflation, adding that more than 2 million Canadians, or about 5% of the population, now rely on food banks, the highest-ever recorded number.

Shachi Kurl, president of the non-profit pollster Angus Reid, said despite food costs consistently ranking among Canadians’ top concerns, Trump's repeated threats to annex the country have translated into a bigger issue for voters.

“For the time being, food prices are not a voting issue,” Kurl said. “But if Canadians think that is something they can hold their leader accountable for, it may yet become one.”

Ashton Arsenault, who was an aide to a Conservative minister under previous leader Stephen Harper, said exorbitant food costs should present an opportunity for Conservatives to win more public support, but that a steady rise in prices over the years have largely left most Canadians resigned to the inflation.

“Even when things get really bad, we are still very Canadian and polite about it and don’t take to the streets to protest,” he said. “This is a very tough problem to fix and it will take political courage to do it.”</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 11:37:17 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7644VDDEZZKGVF55ARK7KTEM6M.jpg?auth=fde2be166f1df5f32881f30b8d1f4ae2f50662ea76494d936e9e8914f8c0b5d8&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Latvia launches human trafficking investigation after Epstein file release</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/latvia-launches-human-trafficking-investigation-after-epstein-file-release-2026-02-05/</link><description>VILNIUS, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Latvia has launched a criminal investigation into potential human trafficking after the release of documents related to late U.S. sex offender Jeffrey Epstein that included references to Latvian model agencies and models, police in the Baltic nation said on Thursday.

The investigation, which also involves Latvia's prosecutors and its Organised Crime Bureau, will centre on "the possible recruitment of Latvian nationals for sexual exploitation in the United States", police said in a statement.

It has asked potential victims to come forward.

Latvian President Edgars Rinkevics called for the investigation after the public broadcaster reported the Epstein documents included passport data and travel details for several Latvian women.

Eriks Neisans, head of the Natalie modelling agency mentioned in the documents, denied any knowledge of wrongdoing to the public broadcaster.

The U.S. Justice Department's recent release of millions of internal documents related to Epstein has revealed the late financier and sex offender's ties to many prominent people in politics, finance, academia and business - both before and after he pleaded guilty in 2008 to prostitution charges.

Latvia's neighbour Lithuania has launched its own investigation into human trafficking earlier this week.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 11:38:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/F743D6VTAZJNLFOWNHL44QVU74.jpg?auth=917037009e9494d251a239e33f15422eaa5f3e5fb018db3d1ace2f1bb7999f5c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran detains two vessels in the Gulf carrying smuggled fuel, state media says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-detains-two-vessels-gulf-carrying-smuggled-fuel-state-media-says-2026-02-05/</link><description>DUBAI, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Iran's revolutionary guards have detained two vessels in the Gulf carrying over 1 million liters of smuggled fuel, state media reported on Thursday, adding that the vessels' crews comprising 15 foreigners were referred to judicial authorities.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 11:38:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/J2OT46IMSVO2LHG3HHCW3T5WGM.jpg?auth=1bb42dc711388997fd45b2f1aac58ca16ebd233c55b315fd77faa5f6343d7aff&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Germany's Merz shares concerns over Iran escalation on Gulf trip</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/germanys-merz-shares-concerns-over-iran-escalation-gulf-trip-2026-02-05/</link><description>DOHA, Feb 5 (Reuters) - German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said on Thursday that concerns about a further escalation in the conflict with Iran have characterised his talks during a trip to the Gulf region.

The UK leader was set to release documents linked to the appointment of the former peer Mandelson, 72, one of numerous prominent figures embarrassed by revelations of ties to the late US financier.

"He's betrayed our country, he's lied repeatedly, he's responsible for a litany of deceit, but this moment demands not just anger, but action," Starmer told parliament.

Starmer accused the former minister and EU trade commissioner of failing "time and time again" to reveal the full extent of his relationship with Epstein during vetting for the Washington role last year.

Starmer's government agreed to submit to the parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee all documents in connection to the appointment, following growing anger from the opposition and some members of Starmer's own Labour party.

The prime minister's judgement is under scrutiny following new allegations that Mandelson had passed confidential and potentially market-sensitive information to Epstein nearly two decades ago.

"He lied repeatedly to my team when asked about his relationship with Epstein before and during his tenure as ambassador," Starmer told MPs during a parliamentary grilling.

"I regret appointing him. If I knew then what I know now, he would never have been anywhere near government."

UK police have announced they are probing the claims, which emerged from email exchanges between Mandelson and Epstein that revealed their warm relations and financial dealings, as well as private photos.

Around that time, Epstein was serving an 18-month jail term in 2008-2009 for soliciting a minor in Florida, while Mandelson was a UK government minister.

The mails were part of a vast trove of files about Epstein published by the US Justice Department.

Epstein was facing charges of alleged sex trafficking when he killed himself in jail in 2019.

Mandelson, for decades a pivotal and divisive figure in British politics, has had a chequered career and has twice resigned from government for alleged misconduct.

Starmer sacked him as ambassador in September after only seven months in the post following an earlier release of files about Epstein.

On Tuesday, Mandelson resigned from the upper house of parliament – the unelected House of Lords – after the latest release of files.

Other emails in the latest tranche appear to show Mandelson celebrating the American financier's release from prison in July 2009 as "Liberation Day!"

A day later, Mandelson asked Epstein: "How is freedom feeling?" Epstein replied: "She feels fresh, firm, and creamy."

Mandelson then replied: "Naughty boy."

The lewd comments were slammed by UK MPs, who heaped pressure on Starmer to explain his decision to hand Mandelson the ambassador's job in February 2025.

"Did he think at all about Epstein's victims?" asked Liberal Democrats leader Ed Davey.

Pledging to release the vetting documents, Starmer said he wanted MPs to see how "Mandelson completely misrepresented the extent of his relationship with Epstein".

London's Metropolitan Police confirmed on Tuesday it had launched an investigation into Mandelson on suspicion of misconduct in public office.

If any charges were brought and he were convicted, he could potentially face imprisonment.

The latest batch of US documents showed Mandelson had in 2009 forwarded an economic briefing to Epstein intended for then Prime Minister Gordon Brown .

The latest release also showed Epstein appeared to have transferred a total of $75,000 in three payments to accounts linked to the British politician between 2003 and 2004.

Mandelson has told the BBC he had no memory of the money transfers and did not know whether the documents were authentic.

The EU is also investigating whether Mandelson breached any of its rules during his time as trade commissioner from 2004-2008.

The former minister, who is gay, had previously claimed to have been excluded from Epstein's sexual activities.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 11:39:17 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/3696809e-f513-11f0-86e3-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26014418430745.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>These Venezuela political prisoners got out of jail, but they still aren’t free</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260205-venezuela-political-prisoners-got-out-of-jail-but-they-still-are-not-free</link><description>EDITOR’S NOTE : This article is a translation of an article originally published in French on February 2. Since that date, journalist Carlos Julio Rojas has decided to speak out publicly on the television network NTN 24 , breaking the ban on public comments that was imposed on him as a condition of his release.

On January 8, the president of Venezuela’s National Assembly, Jorge Rodríguez, declared that the government had decided to release a "significant number" of people. This announcement – made only five days after US Army special forces captured president Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores – was met with hope and expectation by the families of political prisoners . Many went to the detention centres to call for their release.

Four weeks after this announcement, 350 political prisoners have been released , according to Venezuelan NGO Foro Penal, whose name translates to "Penal Forum".

To display this content from X (Twitter), you must enable advertisement tracking and audience measurement.

However, hundreds of political prisoners are still behind bars. One of them is Perkins Rocha, the lawyer of opposition figure María Corina Machado , who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2025.

Rocha represented the opposition in the National Electoral Council during the contested presidential election in July 2024. A month later, he was arrested. One UN expert said that his arrest and detention "could be in retaliation for helping opposition candidates during Venezuela’s last election".

Rocha is being held at El Helicoide, a prison in Caracas that the opposition and human rights activists say is a torture centre.

Our team spoke to Rocha’s wife, María Costanza Cipriani. She says that she wasn’t able to visit him in prison until October 2025, more than a year after his arrest.

I don’t understand why he hasn’t been released yet because a lot of people with similar backgrounds have already been able to leave prison. Even if I am very happy for those who have been released, because they are all innocent, it’s really a difficult moment for me. I keep asking myself, "When will they call me to tell me that my husband will be released?"

Edward Ocariz is a member of the Comité por la Libertad de los Presos Políticos (Committee for the Liberation of Political Prisoners), a Venezuelan NGO.

Though many political prisoners have been released from prisons recently, largely because of pressure from the international community, we expected a much higher number.

More and more families are daring to speak out about the fact that their loved ones are incarcerated, something that they weren’t doing before, because they were so terrified. So we’ve discovered more than 200 new cases of political prisoners in January alone. There are still around 1,200 people imprisoned for political reasons, according to our estimates. And there are surely more.

The NGO Foro Penal reported in late January that, by their count, 711 political prisoners remained in prison. They also said that new cases had been reported to them in recent weeks.

Ocariz says that, in Venezuela, some citizens have been imprisoned simply because they were "denounced" by those with close links to the regime.

María Costanza Cipriani, the wife of lawyer Perkins Rocha, explains:

If my husband is freed, I would like him to be freed completely, meaning that he would be at liberty to give interviews, describe what he experienced, leave the country to visit his children, participate in the reconstruction of the country, etc. I say that because the people who have been freed thus far still have not regained their liberty: they may no longer be in prison, which is already an important step, but they were released under strict conditions.

Carlos Julio Rojas is one person facing the situation that Cipriani described. Rojas is a journalist and coordinator of an association for the residents of north Caracas . He was arrested on April 15, 2024 and was also imprisoned in El Helicoide. He was finally able to leave prison on January 14, but has not regained total liberty – a situation denounced by Amnesty International .

Rojas is not allowed to speak publicly. So our team spoke to his wife, Francy Fernández Terán, on January 28. Her husband sat next to her during the interview, remaining silent.

His release document state s that he is not allowed to leave the country and that he has to report to court every 30 days. Then, the court also stipulated that he is not allowed to speak out or make statements. So he feels gagged.

We want his complete freedom and the end of censorship so that Carlos Julio and other journalists can speak, write, document what happened and speak about what they experienced in prison.

Francy Fernández Terán explains:

Carlos Julio was imprisoned solely because he was defending the rights of the residents of central Caracas when they didn’t have access to water or electricity and because he became a leader who was respected and listened to.

During his detention, he spent four months in solitary confinement. During this period, I had no news from him and I wasn’t allowed to bring him food, clothes or medicine. And his case received media attention. Without that, I think it could have been much worse.

He wasn’t allowed to write in prison and, one day, he said to me, "I’m afraid that when I go home, I won’t know how to write anymore." But he’s already written one article since getting out of prison – a very good article – though, of course, it can’t be published.

Edward Ocariz, from Comité por la Libertad de los Presos Políticos, confirms the restrictions imposed on political prisoners who have been released from prison.

They have all been released under judicial supervision measures . When they are released, they are given a document that says, for example, that they can’t go to protests or meetings and that they have to appear before a judge every month, etc. This violates some of their rights but it is legal: our country’s Code of Penal Procedure clearly lists measures like this. Requiring people to report to court once a month is a way to continue to control them.

However, there is also an illegal element to what the authorities are doing. When the prisoners go before a judge, they are often told that they are not allowed to speak out, that they can’t ask for help from NGOs… They even told some of them that they weren’t allowed to have cell phones. It is a form of intimidation, so that they remain silent.

As a result, it is very hard for us NGOs to record their accounts of what happened, even though it is necessary to document what they experienced in prison so that we can call for justice.

'The main effects are psychological'

The political prisoners who have been released all came out thinner. Many – including young, active people – have health problems that they didn’t have before like cardiopathy [a heart disease] or arterial hypertension. However, the main effects are psychological. Some of them are afraid to leave their homes, out of fear. Others wake up every time they hear a sound and sometimes wake up crying. Some of them are distant with their loved ones. Some feel abandoned because their children left the country while they were in prison.

On January 30, Venezuela’s interim president, Delcy Rodriguez, announced that a law of general amnesty, "covering the entire period of political violence between 1999 and today", would be presented to the National Assembly. During the same speech, she announced that El Helicoide would be shut down.

These announcements represent a glimmer of hope for the political prisoners still behind bars and for those who recently left prison but are still not free.

However, NGOs are viewing the announcement of this law with caution. Foro Penal said that any amnesty must not "favour or include those who committed human rights violations or crimes against humanity" and that it was important to ensure that these violations would not be repeated.

"Amnesty implies ‘erasing’ the crimes that were committed," María Costanza Cipriani, Perkins Rocha’s wife, says. "In the case of my husband, the crimes were invented. That said, if this law allows my husband to come home, then I would obviously be very happy."</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 11:39:19 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/8409783a-0068-11f1-a5e9-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/Venezuela-8.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Stepson of Norway's crown prince denies drugging alleged rape victim</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/stepson-norways-crown-prince-denies-drugging-alleged-rape-victim-2026-02-05/</link><description>OSLO, Feb 5 (Reuters) - The son of Norway's crown princess denied in court on Thursday that he ever drugged the alleged victim of one of the rapes he is charged with, on his second day of testimony in a trial that has transfixed Norway.

Marius Borg Hoiby, 29, who joined the royal family when his mother Mette-Marit married Crown Prince Haakon in 2001, is charged with 38 counts. He faces years in prison if convicted.

On Tuesday , he pleaded not guilty to four counts of rape and one of domestic violence. He pleaded guilty to offensive sexual behaviour, driving too fast and driving without a valid license.

Hoiby also said he was partially guilty - a plea allowed under Norwegian law - of aggravated assault and reckless behaviour.

On Wednesday , he denied that videos on his phone showed acts of rape and broke down as he recalled a childhood in the public eye.

The trial comes with his mother facing scrutiny over fresh revelations about her ties to the late U.S. sex offender Jeffrey Epstein , which has damaged the popularity of the royal family though most Norwegians still want a monarchy.

On Thursday, Hoiby answered questions about the search history on his phone, including for words such as "rape".

"Is this something you are interested in?" asked prosecutor Sturla Henriksboe.

"I have looked at a lot of weird stuff," Hoiby answered wearing jeans and a marine blue jumper over a white T-shirt, sometimes fiddling with a beaded bracelet between his fingers.

On Wednesday, the trial focused on the count of rape alleged to have taken place in 2018 in the basement of the Crown Prince family's residence on the outskirts of Oslo. The alleged victim said she was certain she had been drugged.

"Did you dope her down?" Henriksboe asked on Thursday.

"Never," replied Hoiby.

Henriksboe then asked Hoiby whether he knew of drugs that could "dope down", such as ketamine, and whether he could have access to them. Hoiby said he knew of such drugs and could probably have access to them.

John Christian Elder, the lawyer representing the alleged victim, asked Hoiby his thoughts about the fact that he is charged with counts of rape occurring when the alleged victims were sleeping or unconscious.

"I don't remember that episode so I don't know whether there was consent or not," said Hoiby, referring to the alleged rape in 2018.

Outside the courtroom, polls conducted this week showed the monarchy's popularity is taking a hit, though a majority of Norwegians still prefer it over a republic.

Crown Princess Mette-Marit is seen as unfit to become queen for 44% of Norwegians polled, with 35% uncertain and 22% saying she is suitable, according to a Norstat survey of 1,025 Norwegians for public broadcaster NRK and daily Dagbladet published on Wednesday.

Meanwhile, 54% Norwegians said Norway should remain a monarchy while 33% said it should become a republic, according to a poll for daily Aftenposten conducted February 2-3 among 1,024 respondents.

Parliament, in a long-planned vote, overwhelmingly endorsed the monarchy on Tuesday.

As Hoiby's trial has proceeded, King Harald and Crown Prince Haakon have continued with their official duties, with Harald visiting a hospital late on Wednesday. He did not speak to journalists who attended that visit.

He and Queen Sonja are due to attend the 2026 Winter Olympics in Italy at the weekend.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 13:03:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LS6L76JTQ5IGFCVQX7SMNTT2JQ.jpg?auth=71a7f12ddc147bde2f521a6680a1f8250f13cf1808259e903eb772561e05664f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Starlink used by Russian forces deactivated on battlefield, Ukraine says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/starlink-used-by-russian-forces-deactivated-battlefield-ukraine-says-2026-02-05/</link><description>KYIV, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Starlink internet terminals used by the Russian military on the battlefield in Ukraine have been deactivated, Ukraine said on Thursday, in what one official described as a "disaster" for Moscow that had disrupted its assault operations in many areas.

Ukrainian officials have said that Russia used thousands of Starlink terminals on the battlefield, something that military analysts say made their communications mobile and hard to disrupt. Reuters was not immediately able to determine the scale of the deactivation.

Ukraine said last week it was working with Elon Musk's SpaceX to block the use of Starlink terminals in Russian attack drones and was trying to compile a "white list" of all Ukraine's terminals so that Russian ones could be deactivated.

"Starlinks included in the 'white list' are working — Russian terminals have already been blocked," Defence Minister Mykhailo Fedorov, who took office last month, said on the Telegram app, noting that the process of verification was ongoing.

SpaceX did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Musk said on Sunday that moves by SpaceX to stop the unauthorized use by Russia of Starlink seemed to have worked .

Serhiy Beskrestnov, an adviser to Fedorov, said the impact of the deactivations was already significant.

"The enemy doesn't even have a problem on the fronts, the enemy has a disaster," he said. "All command of the troops has collapsed. Assault operations have been stopped in many areas."

Kyiv's military relies on tens of thousands of satellite-based Starlink internet connections for battlefield communication and for piloting some drone missions.

It said this week it had found Starlink terminals on long-range drones used in Russian attacks.

A source in the Ukrainian army on the eastern front told Reuters that Russian troops are experiencing significant problems with communication, with almost all connection via Starlink being off.

Reuters was not able immediately to verify that information independently.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 13:03:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BVTUECWLC5K7DLZFB7A4Q2YNTU.jpg?auth=a5eb03c3d22d35b430dbf9e0973e3d110b976c17285f69d900a9eec3871798b6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Spain's Sanchez: we won't be swayed by tech oligarchs on social media ban</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/technology/spains-sanchez-we-wont-be-swayed-by-tech-oligarchs-social-media-ban-2026-02-05/</link><description>MADRID, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Tech companies will not sway the will of the Spanish government as it intends to ban young people from social media platforms, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said on Thursday, accusing " tech oligarchs " of spreading lies about Spain.

Telegram founder Pavel Durov on Wednesday joined Elon Musk in criticising plans by Sanchez to ban social media access for under-16s and to prosecute executives for hate speech on their platforms.

Spain joins countries such as Britain, Greece and France in considering tougher stances on social media , after Australia in December became the first nation to prohibit access to such platforms for children younger than 16.

"Democracy will obviously not be swayed by the tech oligarchs of the algorithm," Sanchez told an event in Madrid. "Just yesterday they addressed millions of people via their platforms to spread lies."

Durov said in a Telegram message that Spain's proposed legislation would force social media platforms to gather data on all users and allow governments to control what users see. The day before, Musk posted on his X profile that Sanchez was "a tyrant and a traitor to the people of Spain".

The Spanish government said Durov's message to all Spanish users of Telegram showed the urgent need to regulate social media and messaging apps to protect citizens from misleading information.

Sanchez, one of a dwindling band of leftist leaders in Europe, has been criticising technology platforms since early last year, when he proposed ending anonymity on social media and linking users' data to a common EU identity wallet.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 13:03:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/K24OXYOIWNPSJNRZ5SRW2UTZ2Y.jpg?auth=67e9abe3873b1569e42a826f338fe325f35be58375b349276db607824f8b395e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Estonia releases vessel held on suspicion of smuggling after inspection</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/estonia-releases-vessel-held-suspicion-of-smuggling-after-inspection-2026-02-05/</link><description>STOCKHOLM, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Estonia's Tax and Customs Board said on Thursday it had allowed the seized Baltic Spirit cargo vessel to leave the port of Muuga after an inspection had not confirmed suspicions it carried contraband.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 13:03:42 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/J2OT46IMSVO2LHG3HHCW3T5WGM.jpg?auth=1bb42dc711388997fd45b2f1aac58ca16ebd233c55b315fd77faa5f6343d7aff&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Machado says Venezuelan elections could happen this year, Politico reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/machado-says-venezuelan-elections-could-happen-this-year-politico-reports-2026-02-05/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado said she believed elections could be held in her country later this year, speaking to Politico in an interview released on Thursday.

"We believe that a real transferring process with manual voting … could be done in nine to 10 months," Machado said. "But, well, that depends when you start."

Machado, whose party said it won 70% of the vote in Venezuela's 2024 election, met with President Donald Trump and spoke with his top diplomat and U.S. lawmakers last month following the U.S. capture of the country's longtime leader Nicolas Maduro.

"We have a legitimate leadership with huge popular support and our armed forces are also supportive of a transition to democracy," she told Politico.

Trump in January said he was considering getting Machado " involved some way " even as he has backed Venezuela's interim President Delcy Rodriguez.

Machado told Politico that she had not yet spoken to Trump about the election process.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio told U.S. lawmakers at a Jan. 28 hearing that Venezuela's new leaders were moving toward closer ties with Washington before meeting with Machado later that day.

U.S. intelligence reports have questioned whether Rodriguez is fully on board with the strategy for her country and if she intends to formally cut ties with U.S. adversaries, Reuters reported last month.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 13:03:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/JYZGF26DE5OW7AZF5IJ6XD325U.jpg?auth=00376171ed00eaa9792137d356a704ea007927c210373a6f1a57691ec2276d1f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Irish attorney general raises concerns on sanctioning services in Israeli settlements</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/irish-attorney-general-raises-concerns-sanctioning-services-israeli-settlements-2026-02-05/</link><description>DUBLIN, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Ireland's top government lawyer has raised several "significant" legal and practical issues in long-awaited advice on whether planned curbs on trade with Israeli settlements should be extended to services, a junior minister said on Thursday.

Ireland has been preparing a law to curb trade with settlements in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, facing pressure at home to widen the scope of the ban from goods to services, while Israel and the United States want the bill scrapped.

Ireland has been one of the European Union's most outspoken critics of Israel's assault in Gaza. But sources told Reuters last October that the bill was set to be limited to goods after lobbying by U.S. businesses based in the country.

"The advice, which is detailed and extensive, identifies a number of significant legal and practical issues with the regulation by a member state of trade in services with a country or territory outside the EU," Neale Richmond, a junior minister at the department of foreign affairs, told parliament.

"Following detailed consideration by officials in the department, clarification has been sought from the Attorney General on a number of legal issues... Any legislation must be legally robust (and) able to withstand challenge."

Dublin first committed to introducing legislation in October 2024. Ministers have for months blamed delays in progressing the bill on the need to await the attorney general's advice on the inclusion of services.

Limiting the bill to goods only would catch just a handful of products imported from Israeli-occupied territories such as fruit that are worth just 200,000 euros ($234,660) a year.

Adding services could entangle multinational companies in technology and other industries in Ireland doing business in Israel. Richmond reiterated concerns by other ministers that including services would be "considerably more complex".

Within the EU, Slovenia, Spain, the Netherlands and Belgium all followed Ireland in either committing to or introducing bans on trade with Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 13:03:48 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/D5BLXMGD35PMRI4TDR24HOFXC4.jpg?auth=72c11106c8aa8fba3ea9d9e8a80c7b4c40919a814f2a08377d88b9b585cc4887&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Azerbaijan hands long prison terms to former Karabakh officials</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/azerbaijan-hands-long-prison-terms-former-karabakh-officials-2026-02-05/</link><description>BAKU, Feb 5 (Reuters) - An Azerbaijani military court issued long prison sentences on Thursday to 13 former officials of Nagorno-Karabakh, where ethnic Armenians maintained an unrecognised breakaway statelet for three decades until Baku restored military control in 2023.

Five defendants, including former Karabakh leader Arayik Harutyunyan, were sentenced to life imprisonment. Eight others received prison terms ranging from 15 to 20 years.

They were convicted on charges including crimes against peace and humanity, war crimes, preparation and conduct of an aggressive war, genocide, violations of the laws and customs of war, terrorism and the violent seizure of power.

Human rights groups have raised concerns about the fairness of the trial, which began in January 2025.

Ethnic Armenians in Karabakh, an internationally recognised part of Azerbaijan, broke away from Baku's control as the Soviet Union fell apart in 1991.

Azerbaijan and Armenia fought two wars over the mountainous territory before Baku took it back in 2023 and its entire Armenian population of around 100,000 people fled to Armenia.

Harutyunyan's lawyer Javid Rzazade told Reuters that his client had expected the verdict.

"Arayik Harutyunyan was prepared for this court decision. We knew the court could issue a life sentence. Naturally, we do not agree with either the indictment or the verdict," Rzazade said, adding it was too early to decide on a possible appeal.

A verdict has yet to be passed on Ruben Vardanyan , a former billionaire banker who served as the number two official in Karabakh, and for whom prosecutors have demanded a life sentence.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 13:03:54 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Deaths were avoidable in Channel's worst migrant boat disaster, UK inquiry finds</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/deaths-were-avoidable-channels-worst-migrant-boat-disaster-uk-inquiry-finds-2026-02-05/</link><description>LONDON, Feb 5 (Reuters) - The deaths of more than 30 migrants who drowned attempting to travel from France to Britain in a small boat were avoidable, an inquiry into the worst disaster of its kind found on Thursday.

The inquiry said 27 men, women and children died when their dinghy deflated as they crossed the Channel in November 2021, while the bodies of four others have never been found.

Just two people survived, and one of them told the inquiry that more people were on board. The incident was the worst on record involving migrants in the narrow seaway separating France and Britain.

Inquiry chair Ross Cranston said in his report the deaths were avoidable, attributing responsibility primarily to the people smugglers who crowded at least 33 people on to "an unsuitable craft (with) inadequate safety equipment".

Cranston also said a French naval vessel had failed to respond to a call for help from the British coastguard, which in turn made "a number of flawed decisions", including a decision to end a search for survivors too early.

He added, however, that the British coastguard had been "placed in an intolerable position because of chronic staff shortages ... and other deficiencies" at the time.

Cranston said the issue of small boats carrying migrants from France, which has become a focal point for British voters and has helped propel Nigel Farage's anti-immigration Reform UK into an opinion poll lead, was not a matter for his inquiry.

"However, ultimately the practice of small boat crossings must end," he said. "Quite apart from other reasons, this is imperative to prevent any further deaths of people travelling on board small boats."

A British government spokesperson said there had been improvements made to Channel responses since 2021, "including closer working ties with France" and additional officers for search and rescue operations.

Imran Hussain, from Britain's Refugee Council, said the report showed "why it is so vital to have safe and legal routes to allow people to get to the UK".</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 13:03:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/S5ZDQ3JGIRMTNH4EBKCYW2X2WA.jpg?auth=624356f16168ef758ca18e7cd66719dcf4cdbf0b5fba8f53595f496a1e39c7bd&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Greece arrests member of military for espionage</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/greece-arrests-member-military-espionage-2026-02-05/</link><description>ATHENS, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Greek defence authorities have arrested a member of the Greek defence forces who was leaking "secret information" to "third parties", the Greek National Defence General Staff (GEETHA) said on Thursday.

According to sources close to the investigation, the man had been being monitored for months but his arrest was accelerated on suspicion that he was leaking "highly sensitive" information. He is also accused of attempting to hire other people.

Jean-Noël Barrot is on the first stop of a regional tour as France reassesses how to tackle jihadists after Kurdish allies in Syria , who were guarding detained IS group militants, were forced to disband under pressure from Damascus.

Barrot will move on to Iraq on Thursday afternoon before heading to Lebanon on Friday, according to the French foreign ministry.

In the Syrian capital, he met his counterpart Asaad al-Shaibani, with the pair discussing how to prevent a resurgence of IS group fighters after the Kurdish forces' withdrawal from swathes of northern Syria.

"For 10 years, France has fought relentlessly and mercilessly against the terrorists of Daesh in Iraq as well as in Syria," said Barrot, using an Arabic acronym for the IS group.

"I have come to reaffirm this absolute priority of France here in Syria."

Until now, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) had been the main partner on the ground of a western anti-jihadist coalition, but under military pressure from Damascus they are to integrate into the Syrian army.

"This tour stems from the convergence of two crises," a French diplomatic source said, referring to Barrot's trip.

"One that erupted very recently in northeastern Syria, with clashes between the Syrian authorities in Damascus and the Kurdish-dominated SDF, and the ever-present threat of a military escalation between the United States and Iran."

Western powers must now work with Syria's government to contain the IS group, the source said, but "there is not the same history, the same reflexes developed together, or the same bonds of trust", alluding to Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa 's past as a jihadist.

Sharaa, who overthrew former Syrian president Bashar al-Assad in December 2024, has been seeking to impose his authority over all the country including Kurdish-controlled areas.

Other issues on Barrot's agenda will be the question of integrating Syria's myriad minorities into its new political landscape.

France has positioned itself as an advocate of Kurdish rights and will be pushing Damascus to comply with an agreement announced last week aimed at integrating Kurdish institutions and forces into the Syrian state.

The agreement dashed the Kurds ' hopes of retaining an autonomous zone they had established in northern and northeastern Syria during a civil war that ravaged Syria between 2011 and 2024.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 14:26:12 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/36fb7634-0297-11f1-ac54-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/000-969J9PN.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Morocco evacuates 143,000 people in northwest as flood precaution, interior ministry says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/morocco-evacuates-143000-people-northwest-flood-precaution-interior-ministry-2026-02-05/</link><description>RABAT, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Moroccan authorities have evacuated more than 143,000 people in the flood-prone northwestern plains, the interior ministry said on Thursday, amid rising threats of inundation from heavy rain, swollen rivers and the release of more water from full dams.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 15:10:43 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/TWE53TWT7JIBLE4RJUHELYNVQY.jpg?auth=fb6abeee370041ef4030269ad07f73e4ff40ed757f1f64863644cb4376def6fe&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US, Russia close in on deal to continue New START nuclear arms treaty, Axios reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us-russia-close-deal-extend-new-start-nuclear-arms-treaty-axios-reports-2026-02-05/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Feb 5 (Reuters) - The United States and Russia are closing in on a deal to observe the New START nuclear arms control treaty beyond its expiration on Thursday, Axios reported, citing three sources familiar with the talks.

The , which set limits on each side's missiles, launchers and strategic warheads, is the last in a series of nuclear agreements dating back more than half a century to the Cold War.

Negotiations had been taking place over the past 24 hours in Abu Dhabi but an agreement had not been reached, Axios said, citing an additional source.

The White House had no immediate comment on the report, which followed a series of other developments in relations between the world's two biggest nuclear powers.

The U.S. military's European Command said on Thursday the U.S. and Russia had agreed in Abu Dhabi to resume a high-level military-to-military dialogue.

Also, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said peace talks with Russia, backed by the U.S., would continue in the near future after negotiators ended a second round of discussions in Abu Dhabi.

The Axios report on New START said it was unclear whether the agreement to observe the treaty's terms for an additional period of time, possibly six months, would be enshrined in any formal way.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday Russia was still ready to engage in dialogue with the U.S. if Washington responded constructively to a proposal by Moscow to keep abiding by the limits of the expiring New START nuclear treaty.

"Listen, if there are any constructive replies, of course we will conduct a dialogue," Peskov told reporters.

The New START treaty signed in 2010 allowed one single extension, which was agreed by former President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin for five years. Any new extension would require an executive decision to voluntarily extend the limits of the treaty.

U.S. President Donald Trump, who spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Wednesday, wants China brought into a nuclear reduction deal.

Beijing has so far declined negotiations with Moscow and Washington as it has a fraction of their warhead numbers - an estimated 600, compared to around 4,000 each for Russia and the U.S.

The White House said this week that Trump would decide the way forward on nuclear arms control, which he would "clarify on his own timeline" but gave no further details.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 15:11:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/OFAY5CZN6ZLNHOXMILDSSHL3CY.jpg?auth=a0ed58f9b8aefefeae42c51db83f9b5afe21074b44d70b1fc9cf78f4727a5213&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Slovenia prepares legislation to ban social media for under-15s</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/slovenia-preparing-law-ban-access-social-media-minors-under-15-2026-02-05/</link><description>Feb 5 (Reuters) - Slovenia is preparing draft legislation to ban social media access for children under 15, Deputy Prime Minister Matej Arcon told a news conference on Thursday.

Slovenia, with a population of around 2 million, is following Spain and Greece , which earlier this week proposed bans on social media use by teenagers in a sign of hardening attitudes in Europe towards the technology that some say is designed to be addictive.

Arcon said the Education Ministry had initiated the move, based on the experience of other countries, and that experts in education and digital technologies would also be involved in drafting the law that aims to protect children and adolescents.

"This has been a hot topic around the world and in Europe in recent weeks and months, and with this, we as a government are showing that we care about our children," Arcon said after the government session.

He said the government wants to regulate social networks where content is shared, mentioning TikTok, Snapchat and Instagram, among others.

While Spain wants to prohibit social media for under-16s, Greece is close to announcing a similar ban for children under 15, according to a senior government source.

Other countries, such as Britain and France, are also considering tougher stances on social media, after Australia in December became the first country to prohibit access to such platforms for children younger than 16.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 15:12:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/TOGRB4KN35IR5FBTH3H6XN32B4.jpg?auth=9287b2d7d311bb673b553568c4c7aa54011dc67828590c2c45f89e3ec0091cb6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US, Russia to reestablish military-to-military talks</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-russia-reestablish-high-level-military-to-military-dialogue-us-military-says-2026-02-05/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Feb 5 (Reuters) - The U.S. military said that Washington and Moscow on Thursday agreed to reestablish high level military-to-military dialogue, following talks in Abu Dhabi, a move which could signal a move towards normalizing some ties between the United States and Russia.

The United States halted military-to-military communication with Moscow just before Russia invaded Ukraine. The conflict, which began in 2022, is the deadliest war in Europe since World War Two and the biggest confrontation between Moscow and the West since the depths of the Cold War.

In a statement, the U.S. military said the aim of reestablishing the mechanism was to avoid miscalculation and escalation by either side.

"Maintaining dialogue between militaries is an important factor in global stability and peace, which can only be achieved through strength, and provides a means for increased transparency and de-escalation," the statement added.

The reestablishment comes after the commander of U.S. European Command, General Alexus Grynkewich, held talks with senior Russian and Ukrainian military officials in Abu Dhabi.

Even after high-level military talks were halted between the United States and Russia, they maintained an emergency deconfliction line.

Just over a year later, that choice has created the biggest threat yet for Starmer, with his lawmakers questioning his judgment and leadership after emails illustrated not only the extent of Mandelson's ties to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein but his alleged willingness to leak government business.

While Starmer does not appear in any immediate danger of falling over the scandal, six Labour lawmakers said on condition of anonymity it had further weakened a prime minister challenged by an increasingly restive Labour Party.

Now even those most loyal to him suggest it is a question of when, not if, he is removed from power, with several pointing to the May local elections as a pressure point.

One Labour activist said the situation for Starmer was now like the children's game Buckaroo, where players stack cowboy gear onto a mule until it buckles.

"You know it's all going to collapse for Starmer at some point," the activist said.

A Labour lawmaker said that after months of policy U-turns and missteps over donations, the Mandelson scandal "feels like something has shattered and that will be impossible to recover".

The Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy, put the probability of Starmer's removal this year at 80%, up from 65% previously, saying it had dealt "irreparable damage".

All six Labour lawmakers from different wings of the party said the appointment of Mandelson, dubbed the 'prince of darkness' by British media for his behind-the-scenes manoeuvring, had irreversibly tarnished a prime minister who came to power with a pledge to clean up politics.

It was never meant to be this way.

When Mandelson, 72, a minister when Labour was last in power more than 15 years ago, was appointed in late 2024, Starmer said the veteran brought "unrivalled experience to the role".

His work as a former aide and minister to former prime ministers, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, and as the EU's trade commissioner was touted by the government as being "crucial" to deepen Britain's relationship with the United States.

And Mandelson, the first political appointee to the position in almost half a century, was praised for helping to secure the first deal with the U.S. to lower some of Trump's tariffs on sectors such as cars.

But for the man who was known to have been an acquaintance of Epstein and of other wealthy individuals such as businessman Oleg Deripaska, who is now under sanctions over Russia's war in Ukraine, the post was always risky.

Mandelson denied granting favours to the Russian businessman while he was European trade commissioner.

Files released by the U.S. Justice Department last week included emails suggesting Mandelson had leaked discussions on possible UK asset sales and tax changes to Epstein during the financial crash, and that Epstein had recorded payments to Mandelson or his then-partner, now husband.

Mandelson has said he does not recall having received payments. He has not commented publicly on allegations he leaked documents, and did not respond to messages seeking comment.

He was sacked as ambassador in September 2025 and is now under police investigation for alleged misconduct in office.

Starmer has defended his own actions, accusing Mandelson of creating a "litany of deceit" about his Epstein ties and promising to release documents on how he was appointed.

"I share the anger that people feel when powerful individuals appear to escape scrutiny," Starmer said.

Starmer's attempts to move on from the scandal have proven futile - at a press conference on Thursday, almost every question was about how he failed to see the jeopardy of Mandelson's appointment, even though he was forced out of government twice under Blair over earlier allegations of misconduct.

"It had been publicly known for some time that Mandelson knew Epstein, but none of us knew the depth and the darkness of that relationship," he said.

That defence has done little to quell anger in Labour, which after winning a large majority in the July 2024 national election, has seen its grip on power falter after major policy U-turns.

British borrowing costs have also risen, suggesting investors think Starmer may be forced out.

The anger of several Labour lawmakers was focused on Starmer's closest adviser, Morgan McSweeney, defended by Starmer as being "an essential part of my team".

He has been blamed for presiding over a Downing Street operation which, they say, has failed to provide a firm narrative about how the government wants to change Britain.

Another Labour lawmaker said they thought Starmer would last until the May local elections, but would be vulnerable after.

"Either way he and Morgan are both now very badly damaged."</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 16:07:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WSQNJPTDG5NVZBSXGOPCGJF5RI.jpg?auth=9fd65e084f32af4d25f21ca07926eff3dfda92447a7d0ebf91a1512cbc464d11&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Activists plan new, bigger flotilla to try to bring aid to Gaza</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/activists-plan-new-bigger-flotilla-try-bring-aid-gaza-2026-02-05/</link><description>JOHANNESBURG, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Activists behind a flotilla intercepted at sea last year by Israel while trying to bring aid to Gaza will try again this year, expecting more than twice as many boats carrying up to 1,000 medics, they said on Thursday.

The Israeli military halted the roughly 40 boats in the Global Sumud Flotilla last October as they attempted to reach blockaded Gaza, arresting Swedish activist Greta Thunberg and more than 450 other participants.

Organisers, who gathered on Wednesday at the foundation of late South African leader Nelson Mandela in Johannesburg, said they hope to bring 100 boats for their next attempt.

"It is a cause ... for those that want to rise and stand for justice and dignity for all," Mandela's grandson Mandla Mandela, who was among activists detained last time, told the gathering. "We want to mobilise the ... global community to join forces with us."

Israeli officials repeatedly denounced last year's mission, and previous smaller-scale attempts to reach Gaza by sea, as publicity stunts.

Israel, which controls all access to the Gaza Strip, denies withholding supplies for its more than 2 million residents. Palestinians and international aid bodies say supplies reaching the territory are still insufficient, despite a ceasefire reached in October which included guarantees of increased aid.

Following the ceasefire, Israeli forces now control more than 53% of the Gaza Strip where they have ordered residents out. Nearly the entire population is crowded into a narrow strip along the coast, mostly living in makeshift tents and damaged buildings.

If the flotilla is blocked again, the activists said it would still be worth it to highlight Gaza's plight.

"We may not have reached Gaza physically (but) we have reached ... the people in Gaza," said one of the activists, Susan Abdallah. "They know that we care, that we will not stop at anything until we actually break the siege."</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 16:09:03 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/AEJDDR3KWVNWPGUNTQNLWDQ7AQ.jpg?auth=21b72173b61ca9b20aa48b86856d592760c13a6b57695fc23577b4a650ed0a0c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Brazil's Lula likely to visit Washington in early March</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/brazils-lula-likely-visit-washington-early-march-2026-02-05/</link><description>SAO PAULO, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said on Thursday he is likely to travel to Washington in the first week of March for a meeting with his U.S. counterpart Donald Trump.

Ambassador Tom Rose's furious response to Parliament Speaker Wlodzimierz Czarzasty underlined the precarious balancing act politicians from Poland's pro-European coalition government face in keeping their most important ally onside while Trump is pursuing "America First" policies many of them find unnerving.

Czarzasty said on Monday he would not support an initiative put forward by U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson and Israeli Knesset Speaker Amir Ohana to rally heads of parliaments to nominate Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize in 2026 for his efforts to bring peace to the Middle East .

"In my opinion, President Trump is destabilising the situation in these (international) organisations by representing the politics of force and using force to pursue a transactional policy," Czarzasty, leader of The Left, the junior coalition partner in the government, told journalists.

"All of this means that I will not support President Trump's Nobel Prize nomination because he doesn't deserve it."

Rose lashed out at Czarzasty on Thursday, saying Washington will have no further "dealings, contacts, or communications" with him, effective immediately.

"(Czarzasty's) outrageous and unprovoked insults directed against President Trump has made himself a serious impediment to our excellent relations with Prime Minister Tusk and his government," he wrote on social media platform X on Thursday.

"We will not permit anyone to harm U.S.–Polish relations, nor disrespect (Trump) who has done so much for Poland and the Polish people."

In response, Czarzasty wrote on X that he regretted the ambassador's reaction but would not change his position on fundamental issues.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 16:09:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/6JO46CDXENJIRFPBQTZALUGCJU.jpg?auth=e830d3a0c1bc014f13a7a4ab7fa05bf43733b67a35cf59accf99111f2c9e460b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Sixteen people killed in blast at illegal mine in northeastern India</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/india/sixteen-people-killed-blast-illegal-mine-northeastern-india-2026-02-05/</link><description>Feb 5 (Reuters) - At least 16 people were killed and more were feared trapped after an explosion at an unauthorised coal mine in India's northeastern state of Meghalaya, an official said, the latest in a series of similar incidents in the region in recent years.

The blast took place at around 10 a.m. local time (0430 GMT) in a 'rat-hole' mine - named because their tunnels are just big enough for workers to get through - in the East Jaintia Hills district, the district's deputy commissioner Manish Kumar told Reuters.

Rat-hole mines were once used extensively in India's northeastern states, but were banned in 2014 because of the large number of fatalities and the damage caused to the environment.

Local police were on the scene and have been conducting rescue operations, but attempts to reach the miners have been suspended due to a lack of equipment, the deputy commissioner said. Eight people were also injured in the incident, he added.

Rescue work was hampered because of the remote location of the mine, Kumar said, adding that it would take several hours of driving off-road for state and federal rescue workers to reach the spot and resume search and rescue operations.

"The Government of Meghalaya has ordered a comprehensive inquiry into the incident. Accountability will be fixed, and those responsible will face strict legal action," the state's Chief Minister Conrad Sangma said in a post on X.

The two foes had held several rounds of Oman-mediated nuclear talks in 2025, but the Iran-Israel war, which saw the United States conduct strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, derailed diplomacy days before a meeting was due.

US President Donald Trump has threatened renewed military action against Iran following its deadly crackdown on mass anti-government protests, but has also said he thinks Tehran is open to a deal.

The United States has said talks must cover Tehran's missile programme and its support for militant groups in the region.

Here are some of the thorny issues on the table:

The main dispute between Iran and the US concerns uranium enrichment.

Western countries and Israel, thought to be the Middle East's only country with nuclear weapons , say Iran is seeking to acquire a bomb, which the Islamic republic denies.

During the Iran-Israel war last June, the United States bombed three nuclear sites in Iran (Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan), with Trump later claiming the strikes "obliterated" the nuclear programme, although the extent of the damage remains unknown.

Experts say uranium enriched above 20 percent can have potential military applications but that enrichment must reach 90 percent to make a bomb.

Before the war, Iran was enriching uranium to 60 percent, according to the UN's International Atomic Energy Agency, far exceeding a 3.67 percent cap allowed under a now-defunct nuclear agreement that Iran reached with world powers in 2015.

Watch Iran-US talks will go ahead in Oman

The United States withdrew from that deal in 2018 and Iran subsequently abandoned its commitments under the agreement in retaliation.

Trump has repeatedly called for a complete end to enrichment, a condition much stricter than the 2015 deal.

Iran, which says it has a right to civilian nuclear power, deems this demand a "red line" and contrary to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty to which it and 190 other nations are signatories.

The location of Iran's reserves of more than 400 kilogrammes of highly enriched uranium is unclear after the US bombings last year. The stocks were last seen by IAEA inspectors on June 10.

"The materials are under the rubble (of bombed nuclear sites) and we have made no attempt to extract them... because it is dangerous," Ali Shamkhani, an adviser to Iran's supreme leader, told Lebanese media this week.

"We are discussing this issue with the IAEA in order to find a solution while ensuring safety," he added.

Iran suspended all cooperation with the UN nuclear watchdog at the end of September, justifying its decision as retaliation after UN sanctions were reinstated over its nuclear programme.

Several countries, including Russia, have offered to house Tehran's stockpile of enriched uranium as a safeguard, but Iran has refused.

"There is no reason to move the materials abroad when we can eliminate the sources of concern" about their end use, Shamkhani insisted.

"We have no plan to militarise our nuclear programme" and "we can therefore dilute the material from 60 to, say, 20 percent", he added.

"But in exchange, something must be paid," Shamkhani said, alluding to Iran's demand that sanctions be lifted.

Tehran is adamant that the talks be strictly limited to the nuclear issue and the lifting of sanctions, and considers this demand non-negotiable.

But Washington and its ally Israel are pushing for other grievances against the Islamic republic to be included.

In 2018, the United States' withdrawal from the previous nuclear deal was partly motivated by the absence of curbs in the agreement on Iran's ballistic missile programme, perceived as a threat to Israel.

According to media reports, Israel is now pushing to put this issue on the negotiating table, along with Iran's policy of financing militant groups across the Middle East, including Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas in Gaza and the Houthis in Yemen.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 16:11:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/a18fd72a-0291-11f1-b11c-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/829887171fea1281b31cd797609525c8f40f14df.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UAE plans compound for Palestinians in Israeli-held south Gaza, map shows</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/uae-plans-compound-palestinians-israeli-held-south-gaza-map-shows-2026-02-05/</link><description>JERUSALEM, Feb 5 (Reuters) - The United Arab Emirates has drafted plans to build a compound to house thousands of displaced Palestinians in a part of south Gaza under Israeli military control, according to a map seen by Reuters and people briefed on the plans.

The planning map shows where the "UAE Temporary Emirates Housing Complex" would be constructed near Rafah, once a city of a quarter million people but now almost completely destroyed and depopulated by Israeli forces.

Rafah, near the Egypt border, is where reconstruction of Gaza is expected to start under U.S. President Donald Trump's plan for a durable peace in the densely populated coastal enclave after two years of devastating war.

Donors have been reluctant to commit funds to the plan, worried that disagreements over disarming Hamas militants could lead the parties back to full-scale conflict.

However there are doubts about the political viability of the Emirati project, as most Palestinians could balk at being housed in an Israeli-controlled zone while the vast majority of civilians live in Hamas-run areas of Gaza, diplomats said.

Trump's plan saw the establishment of a U.S.-led, multinational mission for Gaza based in southern Israel, where Emirati officials have shared details of their plans to build temporary housing and provide basic services in Rafah, four diplomats briefed on the initiative said.

The map shows that the UAE housing would sit near the "yellow line" agreed under an October ceasefire to demarcate Israeli- and Hamas-controlled areas.

In response to questions for this story, an Emirati official said the Gulf country "remains committed to scaling up its humanitarian efforts to support Palestinians in Gaza", without confirming or denying plans to build the temporary housing site.

One of the diplomats said the Israeli military had cleared a large area leading from the Mediterranean coast toward Rafah for temporary housing projects like the one the UAE was planning.

The diplomats said the Emirati initiative resembled a U.S. proposal to build temporary housing for Palestinians in areas of Gaza that are still controlled by Israel. U.S. officials initially described their plan as "Alternative Safe Communities" and more recently as "Planned Communities", the diplomats said.

American officials had hoped that building housing in the Israeli-controlled areas could generate momentum toward Hamas' disarmament, encouraging Gazans to leave Hamas-controlled zones and depriving the Islamist group of a civilian population.

Kenneth Katzman, a Middle East expert at The Soufan Center, a U.S.-based, security-focused think tank, said the "Alternative Safe Communities" were designed as a way of gradually "choking Hamas off", but for it to be effective, it would have to be built at scale, housing hundreds of thousands of Palestinians.

"Only a couple of housing projects is not going to defeat Hamas. You need to do a lot ... to have an effect," he said.

The UAE, which established diplomatic relations with Israel in 2020 under a Trump-brokered accord, sees Hamas and other political Islamist groups as threats to Middle East stability.

The four diplomats doubted whether Palestinians would move in large numbers to areas under Israeli control and questioned whether the proposals risked a permanent division of Gaza .

But unlike the U.S. initiative, the Emiratis had identified a site where no homes previously existed, the diplomats said.

The Israeli military controls about 53% of Gaza, including its southernmost area that encompasses the ruined city of Rafah. Hamas controls the rest of the territory, where nearly all of Gaza's two million Palestinians are living in crowded tent camps and amid the rubble of destroyed neighbourhoods.

Foreign diplomats and aid workers say that humanitarian aid and shelter should be directed to areas where there are many people. About 20,000 Palestinians are thought to be inhabiting areas of Gaza under Israeli military control, diplomats say.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 17:26:49 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/74456BJTOJNB3CSYVWT4HHFDEE.jpg?auth=121c22dff096495c25fb9110b53f6e314b5b4d01387651906dfde9d9bfabede9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Taiwan risks becoming numb to China drills, but threat is urgent, defence minister says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/taiwan-risks-becoming-numb-china-drills-threat-is-urgent-defence-minister-says-2026-02-05/</link><description>TAIPEI, Feb 6 (Reuters) - Taiwanese people are at risk of becoming "numb" to China's daily military and other pressure tactics to wear down the island, but the threat is real and greater readiness is needed, Defence Minister Wellington Koo said.

China, which views democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory, sends its warplanes and warships into the skies and waters around the island on a daily basis. It held its latest war games near Taiwan in late December.

Speaking to reporters this week, in comments that were embargoed until Friday, Koo said over the past year, China has used military pressure, cyberattacks and psychological warfare against Taiwan through more "complex and precise actions."

The number of detected Chinese military aircraft, including fighters and drones, rose 23% in 2025 from a year earlier, as China tries to push the narrative that the Taiwan Strait is an "internal" Chinese waterway, he added.

"When such actions are repeated over and over, we worry that it can easily numb the public," Koo said. "But in fact, this kind of enemy threat exists urgently and realistically."

Taiwan's government rejects Beijing's sovereignty claims, saying only the island's people can decide their future.

While Taiwan will neither escalate nor provoke, its military is strengthening its preparedness by carrying out combat-oriented exercises, increasing the effectiveness of its reserve forces and boosting purchases of new weapons, he added.

The ministry is also looking at how to use emerging technologies like artificial intelligence for military purposes with its new defence innovation team, Koo said.

Mentioning an ongoing issue with delayed deliveries of U.S. weapons due to supply chain and capacity problems, Koo said production has "gradually returned to normal," while the U.S. is making the administrative process for purchases easier and quicker.

But Taiwan's opposition, which has a majority in Parliament, has stalled President Lai Ching-te's proposed $40 billion in extra defence spending , and has instead advanced its own proposal which is much smaller and does not fund all the U.S. arms purchases.

Koo said that investing in defence is investing in peace and that senior military officers, including Strategic Planning Director Huang Wen-chi, have been meeting with members of the media and talking to lawmakers to explain the government's spending plans.

"Facing today's rapidly changing international situation and increasingly complex security environment, we firmly believe that only by helping ourselves can others help us; national security must be held in our own hands," he said.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 17:26:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CRZJRM6FLFKD5FKNWO4INDLJ64.jpg?auth=878087d831188a0b8d85895b4bfedd06dde7f8769c186a3824c1ba73c23ad42b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>France places two Chinese nationals under investigation for spying</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260205-france-places-two-chinese-nationals-under-investigation-for-spying</link><description>French authorities on Thursday charged four people, including two Chinese nationals, on suspicion of having intercepted sensitive military data for Beijing, the Paris prosecutor's office said.

The move comes after police arrested the four individuals at the weekend in the southwestern Gironde region where the two Chinese suspects allegedly rented an Airbnb as part of a plan to capture sensitive information, including military intelligence.

The Paris prosecutor's office said two individuals have been remanded into custody and two others placed under judicial supervision, without offering details on their identities.

The probe focuses on the "delivery of information to a foreign power" likely to harm key national interests. This is punishable by up to 15 years behind bars.

The case was triggered after residents on January 30 spotted the installation of a satellite dish approximately two metres (around six-and-a-half feet) in diameter, which coincided with a local internet outage.

A search conducted the following day led to the discovery of "a system of computers connected to satellite dishes enabling the capture of satellite data", according to the prosecutor's office.

The set-up made it possible to intercept "exchanges between military entities", it said.

The two Chinese nationals had allegedly travelled to France with the intent to capture data from the Starlink satellite internet system and other "entities of vital importance" and transmit it back to China .

Their visa applications stated that they worked as engineers for a research and development company specialising in wireless communication equipment.

The two other suspects were arrested over allegations they illegally imported the equipment, the prosecutor's office said, without adding details of their identities.

In a separate case, a French applied mathematics professor was in December charged with allowing a Chinese delegation to visit sensitive sites in a case of suspected espionage . The engineering institute where he works has been partially designated as a "restricted area" since 2019.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 17:27:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/ada71500-02aa-11f1-925c-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/000-84QB4DA.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Saudi Arabia deploys cash and clout in Yemen after ousting UAE</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/saudi-arabia-deploys-cash-clout-yemen-after-ousting-uae-2026-02-05/</link><description>MUKALLA, Yemen/RIYADH - After pushing the United Arab Emirates out of Yemen late last year, Saudi Arabia is deploying political capital and billions of dollars in a bid to bring its southern neighbor more firmly under its control, a sign of Riyadh reasserting itself regionally after years of prioritizing a domestic agenda, six officials told Reuters.

It’s a formidable challenge. The wealthy Gulf kingdom is trying to bring together fractious armed groups and tribes while also propping up a collapsed state through major cash injections, with an unresolved conflict with Houthi rebels in north Yemen held at bay by a fragile truce - just as Riyadh faces a budget crunch at home.

The kingdom is budgeting nearly $3 billion this year to cover salaries for Yemeni forces and civil servants, according to four Yemeni and two Western officials, who said it included roughly $1 billion earmarked for salaries for southern fighters once paid by Abu Dhabi.

"Saudi Arabia has cooperated with us and expressed its readiness to pay all salaries in full," Yemeni Information Minister Muammar Eryani told Reuters in an interview, without providing a total figure. Eryani said the Saudi support would allow Yemen to reorganise the armed factions and bring them under state authority.

Riyadh wants a success story in the parts of Yemen controlled by the internationally recognized government that it backs, which is in exile from the Houthi-controlled capital Sanaa, the officials said.

It hopes that will pile pressure on the Iran-aligned Houthis, who control roughly a third of the country, to come to the table for talks, while building up Yemen’s government forces in case a military confrontation is necessary, all the sources said.

The kingdom has also dangled political carrots, telling Yemeni secessionists that their long-held dream of a separatist state could become reality - once the conflict with the Houthis is resolved, three of the officials said.

Saudi’s overall financial package for Yemen and the openness it has signaled to a separatist state have not been previously reported. Most of the seven officials Reuters spoke to in the Yemeni port city of Mukalla and in the Saudi capital requested anonymity to discuss policies that have not been publicly announced.

The Saudi government media office, as well as the Yemeni government, did not respond to requests for comment, including about the financial numbers or conversations about a pathway to a new state. Reuters could not independently verify what Saudi officials told their Yemeni counterparts about these policies.

In response to Reuters questions sent to the UAE government media office, an official said the UAE had dedicated "signficant resources" over more than a decade to improving security and humanitarian conditions in Yemen. After withdrawing its forces from Yemen last year, the UAE "is no longer involved in the Yemeni file in any aspect," the official said.

As well as the new stance in Yemen, Riyadh is playing a more active role in post-Assad Syria and in Sudan , another arena for its rivalry with the UAE, a shift from years dedicated to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's Vision 2030 domestic drive to modernise the Kingdom.

Although Saudi finances are already stretched – with low oil prices slowing down massive gigaprojects – it cannot afford a security risk next door, said Farea al-Muslimi, research fellow at Chatham House's Middle East and North Africa Program.

Instability in Yemen, with whom the Kingdom shares a 1,800km (1,000 mile) border, could derail its plans to attract foreign visitors and investment at home, Muslimi said. Houthi attacks on Saudi energy infrastructure in 2022 were quickly followed by the ceasefire.

Yasmine Farouk, Gulf project director at the International Crisis Group think-tank, said Saudi Arabia would prioritize the allocation of resources to Yemen because "it is now the sole owner of this problem.”

Saudi Arabia first intervened in Yemen in 2015, leading a loose coalition of Sunni states including the UAE against the Shi’ite Houthis, who had seized the capital the previous year.

Riyadh and Abu Dhabi both supported Yemen’s internationally-recognized government, as well as factions divided over whether their country should splinter into the northern and southern states that existed before a 1990 unification.

After years of fighting that triggered one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises , the 2022 truce has held, despite regional escalation tied to the Israel-Gaza war that saw the Houthis fire on Red Sea shipping.

In December, Emirati-backed separatists launched a surprise assault against Saudi-backed forces - a rare public display of an intensifying rivalry between the two Sunni powerhouses.

In response, Riyadh bombed an Emirati military shipment in Yemen, ordered Emirati forces to leave the country and supported a counter-attack against the UAE-backed separatist Southern Transitional Council.

Riyadh then shifted to a charm offensive, inviting STC figures to Riyadh for talks in early January. At first, Saudi officers confiscated their phones and questioned them for two days about the attack, according to three people familiar with the events.

But in the weeks since, Riyadh moved the separatists into five-star hotels in Saudi Arabia, paying their expenses and offering to fly in some of their families, the three people said.

"It's good to be on the winning side, even if you were the loser," one separatist official told Reuters.

The Saudi government did not answer Reuters questions about the sources' accounts of these events.

The Kingdom already paid Saudi-aligned fighters. It recently began funding hundreds of thousands of state workers and tens of thousands of STC fighters, the same men who attacked Saudi-backed forces in December and were paid by Abu Dhabi, according to the six officials.

Saudi's total bill for salaries, other development projects and energy support to Yemen could exceed $4 billion this year alone, two of the officials said.

"There is now one captain for this ship instead of multiple. That should mean it is less likely to sink," said one of the Western officials, who is familiar with the developments.

The official said Riyadh was now “buying loyalty and stability, but everyone is wondering whether they will sustain it.”

POLITICAL CARROTS - AND STICKS

The Kingdom wants to unify southern Yemen’s divided factions into a single Saudi-led military structure to prevent state fracture . It would also serve to build pressure on the Houthis, the six officials said.

"Saudi Arabia is seeking a better internal ordering within the anti-Houthi coalition—an ordering that would allow the Kingdom to present a stronger front in negotiations with the Houthis. This is why the stakes are so high," said Farouk, the analyst.

To incentivize support, Saudi Arabia has told secessionists that they can have their own state so long as other Yemenis agree - likely via a referendum - and they deal with the Houthi problem first, two of the Yemeni officials and one of the Western officials said.

A Yemeni separatist official said Riyadh told them the south’s fate was up to them. “But nothing can happen till the Houthis are dealt with," that official said.

Riyadh hosted a January conference of southerners where they flew the separatist flag, according to a Reuters reporter at the event. The move was seen as a magnanimous gesture by Saudi designed to draw the cause away from Abu Dhabi, Yemeni officials in attendance told Reuters.

Saudi Arabia has also used sticks.

It found Yemeni Defense Minister's Mohsen al-Daeri's perceived lack of opposition to the STC's offensive as tantamount to betrayal, according to three people briefed on Saudi's view of him. Daeri was dismissed and Saudi authorities detained him in Riyadh for weeks in January, two of those people said. He has since been moved to a hotel and has been welcoming some visitors, they said.

The Yemeni government, and the Saudi government’s media office did not respond to requests for comment about the allegations made by the sources. Reuters could not immediately reach Daeri for comment.

Riyadh has told some interlocutors it hopes to see the conflict in Yemen resolved by the end of this year, according to two Yemeni officials. Information Minister Eryani told Reuters he hoped military operations would cease by the end of 2026.

But Muslimi, the Chatham House expert, sees the deadline as ambitious and aimed at applying pressure on Yemeni forces to get their house in order.

Yemenis remain divided over visions of a single or divided state, and there is resistance among various separatist factions to Saudi plans to create a unified military command.

Muslimi said it could take up to five years for parties to negotiate and hold a referendum on the south’s fate.

Dismantling an entrenched, decade-old war economy in one of the world’s poorest countries could take even longer.

For a decade, Yemeni teacher Mohammad Al-Akbari has watched co-workers and students alike leave school to join armed groups backed by either Abu Dhabi or Riyadh.

Akbari’s monthly salary remains about $30. An 18-year-old fighter still earns at least $250.

"When we teach the kids, they say, what am I supposed to do with this education?" he told Reuters in the Yemeni port city of Mukalla.

"The most dangerous thing facing Yemen today is the impossibility to imagine a peaceful life outside of militarism and war and fighting," Muslimi said.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 18:11:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Slovak prosecutor ends probe over fighter jets, air defence systems donated to Ukraine</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/slovak-prosecutor-ends-probe-over-fighter-jets-air-defence-systems-donated-2026-02-05/</link><description>PRAGUE, Feb 5 (Reuters) - A Slovak prosecutor on Thursday shut down investigations initiated by Prime Minister Robert Fico's government claiming that donations of fighter jets and air defence systems by the previous administration to Ukraine were a crime .

Bratislava regional prosecutor Rastislav Remeta said that the dozen Soviet-era MiG-29 jets and the S-300 and KUB air defence systems donated to Ukraine were outdated, not fully operational and lacked missiles as well as pilots. He said their donation was no crime, as alleged by Fico and his aides.

"In the context of the time, value, report by (national auditors), information available, it was not proven that the government had violated fiduciary duties," Remeta told a televised news conference.

The previous government led by Eduard Heger and including Defence Minister Jaroslav Nad aided Ukraine in its defence against Russia's invasion , donating equipment in return for a pledge of compensation from NATO allies.

When the Moscow-friendly, leftist-nationalist Fico returned to power in late 2023, he halted government military aid for Ukraine, although he allowed growing commercial sales to continue.

A senior defence official in Fico's party said last year he suspected the donations by Nad were "the crime of sabotage, or treason, abuse of power and fiduciary duties". Fico said the donation compromised Slovakia's own air defence abilities.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 18:12:56 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ZDERENYGWJKWLP2WAKVV7RT3PQ.jpg?auth=11130e6d6c0b09686b27e967389bc85d419380dce6af9e99d2b446d6ba876204&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>No credible threats to Milano Cortina Games, U.S. security official says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sports/no-credible-threats-milano-cortina-games-us-security-official-says-2026-02-05/</link><description>MILAN, Feb 5 (Reuters) - There are no credible security threats to the Milano Cortina Games, a top U.S. security official told Reuters in Milan on the eve of the opening ceremony for the Winter Olympics.

"Right now we are not tracking any credible threats," Tim Ayers, director of the U.S. State Department's Diplomatic Security Service (DSS) Major Events Coordination Division, said in an interview on Thursday.

Ayers said the number one concern when securing a large event like the Olympics was a "lone wolf attack."

"That's something where some actor decides to do something one day. There's no prior planning, they just decide to do something. That's always a concern," he said.

"Fortunately the plan the Italians have put forward as far as concentric rings of security, shutting down streets, valid checks at all the places - that pretty much holds back on that concern."

Drones , especially for a Games that is taking place across such a large geographical area, are another concern, but he said Italy's airspace was well controlled by central and local governments.

"Although drones are always a concern everywhere, I think the plan the Italians have put forth is pretty strong to hold back drones," he said.

Cyber attacks also rank high on the list of potential security risks.

"Cyber attacks are always a concern. Every network, whether it's MiCo26, the Italian government, whatever it might be, they are probably seeing up to 1,000 DDoS - distributed denial-of-service attacks - each day," he said.

"But once again I believe the Italians are pretty much up to task in stopping those attacks."

Several political and environmental protests are scheduled to take place in the coming days and Ayers said that he was confident in DSS's ability to safeguard American athletes and tourists in Italy for the Games.

"With the protests we try to find out that information as early as possible," he said.

"Ninety five percent of the protests that happen in Italy have to be registered with the government, so they are either registered or people are talking about them on social media, so we find out about them."

DSS will first try to navigate American athletes away from the area where the protests are taking place but if that's not possible, he said Italian security forces and police have plenty of experience in dealing with those situations.

"The Italians are steady hands when it comes to protests. They've seen them before and they'll see them again. They know exactly what to do," he said.

"There have been several protests in the past year right here outside the U.S. Consulate in Milan. The Italians every time have held back the protest and channeled them into where they are supposed to be and controlled it.

"We have no reason to believe they won't do the same thing here."

Opening Ceremony for the Games will be held on Friday at Milan's San Siro stadium.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 18:13:17 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/FX5KIJ2VOZN6NGJ7CSH5MNQDVE.jpg?auth=9bd26ad151fd88f8645a93b64ea033864063fa42dc8b4d0748d0e5a831a0cb07&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump defends Noem, Gabbard and Bondi at National Prayer Breakfast</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-defends-noem-gabbard-bondi-national-prayer-breakfast-2026-02-05/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Feb 5 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump defended three members of his cabinet whose actions have drawn scrutiny and touted U.S. military strength in a free-wheeling speech on Thursday at the annual National Prayer Breakfast in Washington.

Trump frequently strayed off the teleprompter in remarks to religious leaders and lawmakers, pushing themes of law and order and American might abroad in a speech that he could easily have given at one of his ubiquitous political rallies.

He warned Hamas fighters in Gaza to disarm or face consequences, promoted first lady Melania Trump's new documentary and praised El Salvador President Nayib Bukele, who has championed a mega-prison called CEGOT where the United States has sent hundreds of mostly Venezuelan migrants.

In one of his few religious references, he quoted the biblical verse "blessed are the pure in heart" and wondered if he would qualify. "I'm not sure that applies to me necessarily," he said. "Does that apply to me? I try."

He also mused about his chances of going to heaven, saying "I really think I probably should make it" while noting he was "not a perfect candidate."

Trump rejected calls to fire Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who drew criticism after federal officers shot and killed two Americans protesting Trump's tough migrant deportation policies in Minnesota.

"Why would I do that?" he said, touting Noem's enforcement of the U.S. southern border and crime-fighting efforts.

The backlash from the killings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti in Minneapolis prompted Trump to put White House border czar Tom Homan in charge of operations in Minnesota in place of Noem. Trump told NBC News on Wednesday that a "softer touch" was needed there.

Trump also defended his director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, who was present for an FBI raid on an election facility in Georgia as part of Trump's ongoing quest to raise doubts about the vote in the 2020 presidential election that he lost to Democrat Joe Biden.

Claims of voting fraud in the 2020 presidential election have been rejected by courts, state governments and members of Trump's own former administration.

Gabbard, whose position typically concerns threats from abroad, wrote in a letter to lawmakers dated Monday that she observed FBI personnel executing a search warrant in Atlanta's Fulton County and was present there for a "brief period of time."

"She's doing a great job," Trump said of Gabbard and hinted of a Russian role in election tampering.

He also praised Attorney General Pam Bondi, who he said had sent Gabbard to Atlanta.

"Pam wanted her to do it," he said.

Trump expressed happiness with events in Venezuela after the U.S. military abducted and arrested President Nicolas Maduro in Caracas last month and seized control of that country's oil.

He said he is now working with acting president Delcy Rodriguez and said he is "getting along fantastically" with Venezuela.

Trump, who has assembled a large military force in the Middle East and could unleash it against Iran, extolled the strength of the U.S. military.

"We have a military where they all look like Tom Cruise, only bigger," he said.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 18:13:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/H6AT3TJRJRPCVAJADPR6BIWEVY.jpg?auth=65941047ce61ef4f44f29a552aeab65a1e710e509aa439bc5893cbdc522df7c6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>World Economic Forum investigates its CEO over Epstein links</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/world-economic-forum-investigates-its-ceo-over-epstein-links-2026-02-05/</link><description>ZURICH, Feb 5 (Reuters) - The World Economic Forum has launched an independent investigation into its CEO Borge Brende to clarify his relationship with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, the organisation said on Thursday.

The Geneva-based organiser of the Davos summit said it was looking into disclosures from the U.S. Justice Department that showed Brende had had three business dinners with Epstein and had also communicated with the disgraced financier via email and text message.

"In light of these interactions, the Governing Board requested the Audit and Risk Committee to look into the matter, which subsequently decided to initiate an independent review," the WEF said in a statement.

"This decision underscores the Forum's commitment to transparency and maintaining its integrity," it added.

The WEF said Brende, a former Norwegian foreign minister who has been CEO since 2017, fully supported the review, which he had requested himself.

Brende said in a statement he met Epstein in 2018 at a dinner in New York that he had been invited to by former Norwegian Deputy Prime Minister Terje Rod-Larsen.

Brende said he attended two similar dinners in 2019 with Epstein along with diplomats and business leaders, but these events, along with "a few emails and SMS messages" were the full extent of their interaction.

"I was completely unaware of Epstein's past and criminal activities," Brende said in the statement, adding the he regretted not conducting a more thorough investigation into Epstein before meeting him.

"Had I known about his background, I would have declined the initial invitation to join Rod-Larsen and any subsequent dinner invitations or other communications," Brende added.

He will continue his duties as CEO while outside counsel carry out the investigation, the WEF said.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 18:13:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/J5Y6YUUFBNLFZGHBJ6DJ3QKA4Y.jpg?auth=d9ff820ff57ffc687c55af1fe9e5696984bfb4aa80b239398e65802cedb2b45e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israel charges brother of Shin Bet’s chief for smuggling goods into Gaza</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260205-israel-charges-brother-of-shin-bet-chief-for-smuggling-goods-into-gaza</link><description>Prosecutors on Thursday filed charges against the brother of the head of Israel 's domestic intelligence agency for offences including "assisting the enemy in wartime", over the alleged smuggling of cigarettes into besieged Gaza.

Israel controls the entry of all goods and people into the Palestinian territory, where humanitarian conditions remain dire despite a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas which came into effect on October 10.

Bezalel Zini, the brother of Shin Bet chief David Zini, is charged along with other defendants with "assisting the enemy in wartime, performing transactions in property for terrorist purposes, obtaining something by fraud under aggravated circumstances, and taking bribes", the justice ministry said.

"A central category of prohibited goods smuggled into the Strip was tobacco and cigarettes, which have put a total of hundreds of millions of shekels into Hamas's coffers since the start of the war," the ministry added in a statement.

Bezalel Zini, a reservist in the Israeli military, is suspected of smuggling approximately 14 cartons of cigarettes into Gaza on three occasions, for which he received 365,000 shekels (around $117,400).

Two other defendants were indicted along with Zini on Thursday.

The smuggling was carried out "by misleading soldiers at the crossings into the Strip, and by presenting a false situation as if the defendants were entering as part of their military service for security purposes", the statement added.

It forms part of a wider smuggling network which the justice ministry described as a "serious case of organised, systematic, and sophisticated smuggling of various goods into the Gaza Strip for profit", which began in the summer of 2025, when war was still raging in Gaza.

Prosecutors on Wednesday filed charges against 12 individuals and a company in connection with the case.

A justice ministry statement on Wednesday said the smuggled goods were worth millions of shekels and included cartons of cigarettes, iPhones, batteries, car parts and more.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 18:14:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/38674562-02b4-11f1-aa79-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/000-34KR7ZZ.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran's foreign minister heads to Muscat for nuclear talks with US</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/irans-foreign-minister-heads-muscat-nuclear-talks-with-us-2026-02-05/</link><description>Feb 5 (Reuters) - Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi has departed for the Omani capital Muscat at the head of a diplomatic delegation for nuclear talks with the U.S. due to be held on Friday, the Iranian Foreign Ministry's spokesperson said.

The U.S. and Iran have agreed to hold talks in Oman on Friday, officials for both sides said, even as they remain at odds over Washington's insistence that negotiations must include Tehran's missile arsenal and Iran's vow to discuss only its nuclear programme.

Iran will engage in the talks "with authority and with the aim of reaching a fair, mutually acceptable and dignified understanding on the nuclear issue," the spokesperson Esmail Baghaei said on Thursday.

"We hope the American side will also participate in this process with responsibility, realism and seriousness," Baghaei added.

The case exposed the dangers firms face when operating in Mexico, particularly in the tourist and industrial hub that props up a multi-billion-dollar sector but is also plagued by cartel violence.

Authorities said Mayor Diego Rivera was detained during federal raids alongside the town's security director and the heads of public works and the land registry. The group led a corruption ring that targeted beer and tequila producers in the municipality, Security Minister Omar Garcia Harfuch said.

The world's largest tequila producer, Becle (CUERVO.MX) , opens new tab , was targeted by their scheme, investigators said in December. The Jose Cuervo producer filed a complaint accusing the mayor's administration of imposing an exorbitant property tax up to 20 times the legal rate and a fine of more than 60 million pesos ($3.45 million) while withholding permits and attempting to shutter one of its plants.

State authorities intervened, with the Jalisco governor saying at least 10 companies had filed complaints against the local administration.

Becle did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Tequila Regulatory Council said it did not have a position on the matter.

Officials allege Rivera's network was not only extorting businesses but also diverting public funds and collaborating with the CJNG, one of Mexico's most powerful and violent criminal organizations.

Rivera had previously drawn scrutiny after a local concert featured projected images of the cartel's fugitive leader, Nemesio Oseguera "El Mencho."

Tensions in relations between the United States and European allies , and uncertainty over how transatlantic ties will look in coming months and years, made some countries hesitant to sign joint agreements, several attendees and delegates said.

The pledge underscores growing concern among some governments that rapid advances in artificial intelligence could outpace rules around its military use, raising the risk of accidents, miscalculation or unintended escalation.

Governments are facing a "prisoner's dilemma", caught between putting responsible restrictions in place and not wanting to limit themselves in comparison with adversaries, said Dutch Defence Minister Ruben Brekelmans.

"Russia and China are moving very fast. That creates urgency to make progress in developing AI. But seeing it going fast also increases the urgency to keep working on its responsible use. The two go hand-in-hand," he said in comments to Reuters.

Only 35 countries out of 85 attending the Responsible AI in the Military Domain (REAIM) summit in A Coruna, Spain, on signed a commitment to 20 principles on AI on Thursday.

These included affirming human responsibility over AI-powered weapons, encouraging clear chains of command and control, and sharing information on national oversight arrangements "where consistent with national security".

The document also outlined the importance of risk assessments, robust testing and training and education for personnel operating military AI capabilities.

At two prior military AI summits in The Hague and Seoul in 2023 and 2024 respectively, around 60 nations, excluding China but including the United States, endorsed a modest "blueprint for action" without legal commitment.

While this year's document was also non-binding, some were still uncomfortable with the idea of endorsing more concrete policies, said Yasmin Afina, a researcher at the U.N. Institute for Disarmament Research, an adviser on the process.

Major signatories on Thursday included Canada, Germany, France, Britain, the Netherlands, South Korea and Ukraine.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 19:15:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/3XL5ES32YFP7LK4DINFJBT5ZCU.jpg?auth=fad5799e602d50c813d060b801340de8b358b0f8b90d15f767021c3d9e7e6f96&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Carney scraps Canada EV sales mandate, but earmarks funds to aid transition</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260205-carney-scraps-canada-ev-sales-mandate-but-earmarks-funds-to-aid-transition</link><description>Prime Minister Mark Carney on Thursday cancelled a mandate for all vehicles sold in Canada to be electric by 2035, while announcing a multi-billion-dollar plan to support EV production.

The announcement marked another departure from policies backed by his climate-focused predecessor Justin Trudeau , but Carney said he wanted to incentivize EV production while bolstering a Canadian auto industry hammered by US tariffs .

Since replacing Trudeau last year, Carney has also scrapped the former leader's carbon tax on individual households and advanced plans to build a new oil pipeline from Alberta to the Pacific coast – infuriating environmental groups.

Asked Thursday if he still considered Canada a leader in the fight against climate change , Carney said: "Absolutely."

He stressed his climate policies would be focused on "results and solutions".

Watch Donald Trump threatens 100% tariff on Ottawa

Trudeau had passed legislation mandating that 20 percent of vehicles sold this year be electric, with a 60 percent target by 2030 – benchmarks that faced criticism from automakers.

While he pivoted away from those mandates, Carney stressed that the future strength of Canada's auto industry required a transition to EVs.

"We know where the auto industry is headed. We're going to support that transition," he told reporters.

Carney said his goal was 75 percent EV sales by 2035, and a 90 percent target by 2040.

To get there, he has earmarked CAN$3 billion ($2.2 billion) "to help the auto industry adapt, grow and diversify to new markets", his office said in a statement.

Carney said his goal is to position "Canada to become a global leader in electric vehicle (EV) production".

Underlying the strategy was the need to prepare the Canadian sector for a future where the highly integrated North American auto sector is transformed by US tariffs, Carney said.

"There's no greater symbol of how closely the Canadian and American economies have been intertwined than automobiles," the prime minister said.

"The average car is built from parts that travel across our border up to eight times before landing on the showroom floor," he added, while warning: "That trade relationship that once was a great strength has now become a serious vulnerability."</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 19:15:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/6a561a76-02b9-11f1-b1e1-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/000-1B869X.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuela amnesty law would grant clemency to jailed protesters, draft shows</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/venezuela-amnesty-law-would-cover-political-protesters-return-assets-draft-shows-2026-02-05/</link><description>Feb 5 (Reuters) - An amnesty law being considered in Venezuela's legislature would grant immediate clemency to people jailed for participating in political protests or critiquing public figures, a draft of the law seen by Reuters on Thursday showed.

The bill would also return assets of those detained and cancel Interpol and other international measures previously issued by the government, allowing opposition figures in exile to return home.

Venezuela's opposition and human rights groups have said for years that the government has used detentions to stamp out dissent by politicians, members of the security services, journalists and activists, charging them arbitrarily with crimes like terrorism and treason. The government has always denied holding political prisoners.

The amnesty law , announced last week by interim president Delcy Rodriguez, would lead to hundreds of people being released if it were to be passed in its current form and would likely please the Trump administration, which has hailed prisoner releases.

Rodriguez, who took office after the U.S. captured and deposed President Nicolas Maduro last month, has been complying with U.S. demands on oil deals . The government has also been slowly releasing people classified as political prisoners by human rights groups and the country's opposition.

The bill is set to next be debated at the National Assembly, which is controlled by the socialist ruling party. Delcy Rodriguez's brother Jorge Rodriguez, the head of the assembly, is expected to read the bill's introduction at a Thursday session. It must be approved in two votes in order to pass.

The assembly has repeatedly passed laws in recent years that the government has said are meant to curb foreign influence and "fascism" in the country, including restrictions on the activities of NGOs and a ban from public office of people found to have promoted U.S. sanctions .

According to the draft, the amnesty will cover crimes committed between January 1, 1999, and the date that the law comes into force, and will be applied immediately to people who acted peacefully or who have health concerns. It would not provide amnesty for those convicted of human rights violations, war crimes, murder, corruption or drug trafficking.

Other alleged crimes, including instigation of illegal activity, resistance to authorities, property damage, rebellion, treason, and illegal carrying of weapons will all be covered by the amnesty if they were committed in the context of political protests, the draft said, specifying that it would include mass protests that rocked the country and led to deaths in 2007, 2014, 2017, 2019 and 2024.

Those latest marches, in 2024, took place after a contested election that Venezuela's opposition and international observers say the opposition roundly won. The government and judicial authorities backed Maduro, swearing him in for a third term.

The bill would also cover those accused of defamation if the act took place in the context of criticizing authorities.

The law would lift Interpol red notices and movement restrictions against people who have committed crimes covered by the amnesty, the draft said, "guaranteeing the safe and persecution-free return of Venezuelan citizens who are abroad."

Many members of the opposition and dissident former officials live in other countries to escape arrest warrants they say are politically motivated.

Also revoked by the law would be public office bans for political reasons and sanctions against media outlets.

Rights group Foro Penal says it has verified that 383 political prisoners have been freed since the government announced a new series of releases on January 8. It says more than 680 remain jailed, an updated count including prisoners whose fearful families had not previously reported their detentions.

The government has always denied holding political prisoners and says those jailed have committed crimes. Government officials have said the number of releases is nearly 900, but have not been clear about the timeline and appear to be including those freed in previous years.

Among the long-time advocates of releases and amnesty is Nobel Peace Prize winner and opposition leader Maria Corina Machado , who has several close allies imprisoned, including opposition politician Juan Pablo Guanipa and lawyer Perkins Rocha.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 19:58:08 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/2D5UZDB2TFMLTOFGDU3UTJHXYI.jpg?auth=fe398ce18d7a67d1752a43069219237a54242aaeb2d9fcfa1e547b74e67b39e3&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Italian police to get new arrest powers after Turin riot</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/italian-police-get-new-arrest-powers-after-turin-riot-2026-02-05/</link><description>ROME, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Italian police will be able to detain suspected troublemakers temporarily before street rallies to prevent them from spreading unrest under a new law-and-order decree adopted on Thursday by Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's rightist government.

The bill was drafted after a rally over the weekend by the hard-left in Turin in which more than 100 police officers were injured and nearly 30 protesters arrested, according to an interior ministry tally.

It was adopted on the eve of the opening ceremony for the February 6-22 Milano Cortina Winter Olympics . Officials have said they will be tightening security and preparing to deal with any protests against the presence of U.S. security officers .

"With the measures approved today we are strengthening the tools to prevent and combat widespread crime," Meloni said on X.

In Turin, some demonstrators threw bottles, stones and fireworks at police. Video footage showed an officer being attacked with sticks and a hammer.

Under the decree, which will come into force in the coming days, police will be able to hold suspected troublemakers in custody for up to 12 hours, to keep them away from protests.

The bill also includes measures against pickpockets, youth gangs, a ban on the sales of knives to minors, and greater self-defence guarantees for police officers and private citizens who respond to assaults.

The leader of the Green Left Alliance opposition party, Angelo Bonelli, said the bill was repressive and it would have been more effective to give the police more funds to fight crime.

He called preventive arrests "a serious violation of the constitutional right to demonstrate".

Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi rejected criticism of the new arrest powers, saying similar provisions existed in other European countries.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 19:59:04 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/URCAWODKFJJ5VNL4HR2A6UH4WM.jpg?auth=a6304f3830306a591e9f50234f0dae8b9fcc2c4bfbcaac7693d9c5c701da8ec9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>How a Jewish family’s Baghdad home became France’s rent-free embassy</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260205-how-jewish-family-baghdad-home-became-france-rent-free-embassy-iraq</link><description>Along the banks of the Tigris River, behind a gated compound, stands the French embassy in Baghdad , built in the 1930s for a seemingly very different purpose. It features columns, fountains, a swimming pool and enough bedrooms to accommodate more than a dozen people.

The house once belonged to the Lawees, a Jewish family who rented the property to France after fleeing anti-Semitism in Iraq. But for around 50 years, France has occupied the villa without paying rent – a situation recently upheld by a Paris court.

Brothers Ezra and Khedouri Lawee built the sprawling property – known within the family as Beit Lawee – in 1935, at a time when Iraq’s Jewish community numbered about 130,000. They lived there for about twenty years, eating fresh dates from the garden, playing tennis on the court next door, sleeping on the roof during sweltering summer nights.

“It was full of life,” said Philip Khassam, the 66-year-old grandson of one of the original owners. “There were parties, cousins everywhere.”

That world collapsed as regional tensions skyrocketed following the creation of the state of Israel in 1948. A couple of years later, in March 1950, the Iraqi government gave Jews one year to leave the country on condition they renounce their nationality. Nearly the entire Jewish population registered to depart, prompting a massive airlift known as Operation Ezra and Nehemiah .

The Lawee brothers moved to Canada , settling in Montreal, where they rebuilt their lives and became citizens. But the 3,800 m² residence in Baghdad, along with its 1,150 m² plot of land, remained part of their estate.

For about a decade, the property stood empty, watched over by a caretaker, before being rented in 1964 to the French government, which was seeking a new embassy site. To avoid political sensitivities, rent was paid partly in Iraqi dinars and partly in French francs.

The arrangement unravelled after the 1967 Six-Day War , which saw Israel rout the armies of its Arab neighbours. Iraq informed the French embassy that rent payments should be made to the Iraqi government instead, as it asserted state control over Jewish-owned properties.

France initially redirected only the dinar portion of the rent to Iraqi authorities while continuing to pay the family in francs, a move the family says implicitly acknowledged their ownership. In 1974, however, the French government stopped paying the Lawees altogether, amid a shift toward a more pro-Arab foreign policy .

The decision also proved financially advantageous, as court documents showed France paid Iraq only around 10 percent of the property’s market rent.

“For more than 50 years, France has saved roughly 90 percent of the market rent,” Khassam noted. “There is a legal term for that: unjust enrichment. ”

Even after the fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003, the family said France continued to occupy the property without compensation, despite requests to resume rent payments or allow the sale of the house.

The case resurfaced in recent years after Khassam began researching the property’s value, making cold calls around Baghdad and speaking to local real estate agents. He discovered that land scarcity in the Iraqi capital could place it in the millions of dollars.

In 2021, the family hired prominent French lawyers Jean-Pierre Mignard and Imrane Ghermi to pursue the claim.

“Property rights are a fundamental right in any democratic society,” Mignard told FRANCE 24. “And here, that right was denied for one simple reason: these people were Jewish and belonged to a religious community repudiated by today’s political Iraq.”

Earlier, a Paris court rejected the family’s $22 million lawsuit accusing France of unjustly profiting from discriminatory Iraqi policies that stripped Jews of their property. In a written ruling published on Monday, the court said the embassy’s contract “is not governed by French law and that it therefore does not have jurisdiction to settle the matter”, suggesting that Iraq would be the appropriate forum to resolve the dispute.

For Mignard, the ruling was both illogical and dangerous.

“I don’t even see how our clients could be authorised to enter Iraqi territory,” he said. “I don’t know what we could possibly argue before a court in Baghdad. This contract was governed by French law.”

He also pointed out to France’s own dark history. During the German occupation, the Nazi occupiers and the Vichy regime requisitioned what were called “Jewish properties”: apartments, hotels and artworks were seized after their owners were expelled.

Around 100,000 works of art were taken from France alone, according to the ministry of culture. In 2022, the French government passed a law to facilitate their restitution.

“That France could lose its memory to this extent and behave so poorly, simply because this Jewish property is located thousands of kilometres away, is frankly disgraceful,” Mignard said.

Khassam insisted the issue is neither political nor geopolitical.

“This has nothing to do with regional politics,” he said. “This is private property. Property rights are human rights.”

He also rejected the idea that ordinary Iraqis are hostile to the claim. “The people are not the problem,” Khassam said. “I’ve spoken to Iraqis in Baghdad. Jews were part of the fabric of that city. The issue is with governments, not people.”

The French foreign ministry, who did not respond to a request for comment, acknowledged in court filings that Iraqi legislation deprived Jewish owners of their real estate – yet relied on those very laws to justify continuing to occupy the house without paying the family.

“France is using an Iraqi law passed specifically to punish Jews in order to justify not paying Jewish owners,” Khassam said. “That is shameless.”

French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot visited Baghdad on Thursday and stayed overnight at the French embassy, according to the foreign ministry.

In a statement obtained by FRANCE 24, lawyers for the Lawee family said the French government “cannot hide behind a legal dispute that will take years in order to deny the rights of individuals excluded from their property for the sole reason that they were Jewish”.

The statement made a pointed reference to Barrot’s stay at the embassy, asking whether he felt that “the ground beneath the French Embassy in Baghdad is burning”.

The family plans to appeal the ruling.

“This is not a setback, it’s the beginning,” Khassam said. “If we fail, then France has failed in the eyes of the world, because it has trampled on its own laws and its own human-rights principles.”</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 19:59:58 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/c69991ee-02bb-11f1-a8c7-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/17-3.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump administration to end job protections for up to 50,000 federal workers</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-expand-his-control-over-federal-workers-2026-02-05/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Feb 5 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump will have more power to hire and fire up to 50,000 career federal employees in an overhaul of the government's civil service system announced by his administration on Thursday.

The overhaul, released by the Office of Personnel Management, fulfills Trump's campaign pledge to strip job protections from federal workers deemed by the president's team to be "influencing" government policy.

It is the biggest change to the rules governing the civil service in more than a century and targets employees that the administration sees as undermining the president's priorities. Trump called the overhaul "Schedule F" during his first administration.

"You can't run an organization if people are refusing to actually carry out the lawful objectives and orders of the administration," said OPM Director Scott Kupor, the administration's top HR official.

The rule will be scrutinized by a federal judge.

Federal worker unions and their allies sued in January to stop the policy before it was fully developed. Federal judges paused the litigation while the Trump administration finalized changes. A court challenge will resume in the coming days, said Skye Perryman of Democracy Forward, one of the groups behind the lawsuit.

"We will return to court to stop this unlawful rule and will use every legal tool available to hold this administration accountable," she said in a statement.

Trump will have the power to select which government positions will lose their job protections, according to the policy , opens new tab the Trump administration released on Thursday.

The Trump administration is also changing how long-standing legal protections that prohibit U.S. government agencies from retaliating against whistleblowers will be enforced, the OPM statement said.

Federal agencies will be in charge of setting up job protections for their own employees who accuse them of wrongdoing, such as violating the law or wasting money. That would be a change from the past, when an independent office known as the Office of the Special Counsel was charged with protecting whistleblowers from reprisal.

The Trump administration will require agency officials be "unbiased" when investigating accusations from whistleblowers that their employer retaliated against them, an OPM official told reporters on Thursday morning.

Reuters previously reported that the Trump administration was close to making this change.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 20:40:19 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/RGLJLBXRNNOCTABQA6UX3EX6UY.jpg?auth=d922a5c35ca84b9aa4a041a98df6d3168b14f04cc65acbaeee12f47fbb175386&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US watchdog to review high failure rate in FAA air traffic control training</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/us-watchdog-review-high-failure-rate-faa-air-traffic-control-training-2026-02-05/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Feb 5 (Reuters) - The U.S. Transportation Department Office of Inspector General said on Thursday it will open a probe into high failure rates among air traffic control trainees amid a long-standing shortage of controllers to manage U.S. air traffic.

The sources said high-level Mexican officials have been talking to U.S. counterparts in order to gain clarity on the scope of the tariff threat outlined by President Donald Trump in an executive order and see whether there was a way to deliver the much-needed fuel. It remains uncertain whether Mexico will find a solution.

The White House, the U.S. State Department and the Mexican presidency did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Mexico's Foreign Ministry said it had no information on the matter.

Cuba needs to import fuel for two-thirds of its energy needs, and is struggling with worsening power outages and long lines at gas stations.

Shipments of Venezuelan oil to the island ceased following a U.S. blockade of Venezuelan tankers in December and the capture of President Nicolas Maduro in early January, leaving Mexico as Cuba's largest supplier.

However, in mid-January, the Mexican government halted shipments of crude and refined products amid pressure from the Trump administration. Washington subsequently threatened tariffs on countries that supply oil to the communist-ruled island, saying that Cuba poses an "extraordinary threat" to U.S. national security - a claim Havana denies.

"There are talks happening almost every other day," said one of the sources, who requested anonymity to discuss private matters. "Mexico doesn't want tariffs imposed, but it is also firm in its policy of helping the Cuban people," the source added.

The Cuban government said on Thursday it is preparing a plan for "acute fuel shortages" and would release details over the next week.

This week, U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres warned that Cuba risks a humanitarian "collapse" if it does not receive oil to meet its needs.

Mexico, and in particular the ruling Morena party, has long maintained ideological and historical ties with Cuba, and President Claudia Sheinbaum is under pressure from within her coalition to not abandon Havana.

Three of the four sources said talks are progressing and they were hopeful a solution could be reached. Mexico could dispatch a tanker with gasoline to the island, as well as food and other supplies all classified as humanitarian aid within days if an agreement is reached, two of the sources said.

"Imposing tariffs on countries that supply oil to Cuba could trigger a far-reaching humanitarian crisis, directly affecting hospitals, food, and other basic services for the Cuban people, a situation that must be avoided through respect for international law and dialogue," Sheinbaum said last Friday.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 21:32:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CM4BBZVV35ILNFMAVPKOP33Y3Q.jpg?auth=e15bbce3d84032bf58a0f5929d5c79d529d6809679ecfc90ac39aba999f4aad7&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump has no 'formal plans' to deploy ICE at polling sites, White House says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-has-no-formal-plans-deploy-ice-polling-sites-white-house-says-2026-02-05/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Feb 5 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump has not discussed "formal plans" to deploy U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to polling sites at November's midterm elections, the White House said on Thursday, while declining to rule out their presence near voting locations.

Trump said on Monday that Republicans should "nationalize" and "take over" voting in at least 15 unspecified locations, repeating his false claims that U.S. elections are plagued by widespread fraud.

His remarks were echoed by Steve Bannon, a former Trump adviser and influential right-wing commentator, who repeated false claims that people living in the U.S. illegally vote in large numbers and said on his War Room podcast on Tuesday, "You're damn right we're gonna have ICE surround the polls come November."

Asked about Bannon's comments, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said: "I can't guarantee that an ICE agent won't be around a polling location in November … but what I can tell you is I haven't heard the president discuss any formal plans to put ICE outside of polling locations."

Federal law prohibits the president from deploying military troops at any location holding a general or special election, and several states criminalize carrying firearms at or near polling places. Immigration enforcement, in particular, has caused both U.S. citizens and legal residents to stay home out of fear of detention or racial profiling.

Democrats have raised concerns in recent months that Trump could deploy troops at polling locations to intimidate voters and interfere with the November elections that will determine control of Congress.

Some Republican lawmakers have been reluctant to back Trump’s call to nationalize elections. Senate Majority Leader John Thune said he is "not in favor of federalizing elections," while House Speaker Mike Johnson noted that "it's always been the responsibility of the states to administer elections."

Trump's push to expand federal control over elections comes as his administration has stepped up pressure on many Democratic-led states to turn over voter data, with the Justice Department suing nearly two dozen states over their voter rolls.

Last week, the FBI searched an election office in Georgia's Fulton County for records related to the 2020 election, as Trump continues to press false claims of fraud in his defeat.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 21:55:58 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/T4JB4QVENJOLLIMX5YT6TN74BY.jpg?auth=164093ddb087d903096915da2b7f7fa51bcbf3501174a731277b521ec3c43c1d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US says Trump prefers diplomacy with Iran but warns he has military options</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/turkey-is-doing-its-best-prevent-us-iran-conflict-erdogan-says-2026-02-05/</link><description>WASHINGTON/ DUBAI, Feb 5 (Reuters) - The White House said on Thursday that diplomacy is President Donald Trump's first choice for dealing with Iran and he will wait to see whether a deal can be struck at high-stakes talks, but also warned that he has military options at his disposal.

Final preparations were under way for Friday's meeting in Oman amid heightened tensions as the U.S. builds up forces in the Middle East, which Trump has called a massive “armada,” and regional players seek to avert what many fear could escalate into a wider war.

The talks were set to go ahead even though the two sides have had differences over the agenda, and that has increased doubts about the prospects for a deal. Trump has threatened to carry out strikes on Iran if an agreement cannot be reached.

The U.S. previously said it wanted the discussions to include Iran's missile arsenal and other issues, while Tehran has insisted on focusing exclusively on its disputed nuclear program. It was unclear whether that disagreement had been resolved.

“The president’s diplomacy is always his first option when it comes to dealing with countries all around the world, whether it’s our allies or our adversaries,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters when asked about the coming talks.

She reiterated Trump’s position that “zero nuclear capability is something he's been very explicit about” in his demands for Iran.

"He wants to see if a deal can be struck," Leavitt said. “And while these negotiations are taking place, I would remind the Iranian regime that the president has many options at his disposal, aside from diplomacy, as the commander in chief of the most powerful military in the history of the world.”

Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi departed for Oman on Thursday. His spokesperson Esmail Baghaei said Tehran would engage "with authority and with the aim of reaching a fair, mutually acceptable and dignified understanding on the nuclear issue."

"We hope the American side will also participate in this process with responsibility, realism and seriousness," Baghaei added.

Araqchi is expected to meet in Muscat with Steve Witkoff, Trump’s special envoy, and Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and adviser.

On the eve of the talks, Iran's state-run Press TV said "one of the country's most advanced long-range ballistic missile(s),” the Khorramshahr 4, has been deployed at one of the Revolutionary Guards underground missile sites. The missile has a range of 2,000 km (1,240 miles) and is capable of carrying 1,500-kg (3,300-pound) warhead, it added.

The U.S. has pressed Iran to accept a much more limited range for its missiles.

Trump's blunt warnings and Iran's vows of counter-strikes have spurred regional governments' efforts to calm the situation.

Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said his government was working hard to prevent U.S.-Iran tensions from tipping the Middle East into a new conflict. He has spent years cultivating a close relationship with Trump while expanding Ankara's diplomatic influence across the region.

Speaking to reporters on a return flight from a visit to Egypt, Erdogan added that talks at the level of the U.S. and Iranian leadership would be helpful after lower-level nuclear negotiations due in Oman on Friday, according to a transcript of his comments shared by his office on Thursday.

Tensions ratcheted up this week amid uncertainty over the location and format for the talks, which will follow Tehran’s bloody crackdown on street protests last month.

Asked on Wednesday whether Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei should be worried, Trump told NBC News: "I would say he should be very worried. Yeah, he should be."

After Trump spoke, U.S. and Iranian officials said the two sides had agreed to shift the talks' location to Muscat after initially accepting Istanbul.

At a press conference in Doha, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said on Thursday that "great concern" had been expressed about potential escalation in the conflict with Iran during his meetings with officials in a visit to the Gulf region. He urged Iran to end what he called aggression and help bring stability to the region.

Gulf Arab states fear that Iran will carry out its threat to target U.S. bases on their territory if the United States attacks the Islamic Republic.

China, meanwhile, said it supported Iran's legitimate right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy and opposed the "threat of force and sanction pressure."

Iran has said the talks must be confined to its long-running nuclear dispute with Western powers.

But U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Wednesday that talks would have to include the range of Iran’s ballistic missiles, its support for armed proxy groups around the Middle East and its treatment of its own people, besides nuclear issues. Iranian sources say the U.S. is demanding Tehran limit the range of Iran's missiles to 500 km (310 miles).

Tehran's regional sway has been weakened by Israel's attacks on its proxies - from Hamas in Gaza to Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen and militias in Iraq - and by the ousting of Iran's close ally, former Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

Iran says its nuclear activities are meant for peaceful, not military purposes, while the U.S. and Israel have accused it of past efforts to develop nuclear weapons.

The U.S. has sent thousands of troops to the Middle East, as well as an aircraft carrier, other warships, fighter jets, spy planes and air-refueling tankers.

Trump has warned that "bad things" would probably happen if a deal could not be reached.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 21:56:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/Q2XCMYJKCJOXBD2OGK6ITYOQBI.jpg?auth=3954fdaffb651b8b3d11c5eef1319f79d91f130e5b6cc8b56432512246a4ea56&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump says US retains right to 'militarily secure' Chagos airbase</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/trump-says-chagos-air-base-talks-with-uks-starmer-were-productive-2026-02-05/</link><description>Feb 5 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday he retained the right to "militarily secure" the joint Diego Garcia air base if future arrangements threatened American access, following "productive" talks with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer.

Last month, Trump criticised Britain's 2025 deal to cede sovereignty of the Chagos Archipelago - including an island with the joint U.S.-UK Diego Garcia base - as an act of "total weakness" and "great stupidity."

But in a post on Truth Social on Thursday, Trump said he understood the deal Starmer made was "the best he could make."

Starmer's 2025 deal transferred sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius while keeping Diego Garcia under British control through a 99-year lease that preserved U.S. operations at the base.

"However, if the lease deal, sometime in the future, ever falls apart, or anyone threatens or endangers U.S. operations and forces at our base, I retain the right to militarily secure and reinforce the American presence in Diego Garcia," Trump said.

BASE VITAL TO SECURITY: STARMER SPOKESPERSON

A Downing Street spokesperson said Starmer and Trump "agreed on the importance of the deal to secure the joint UK-U.S. base on Diego Garcia, which remains vital to shared security interests."

She added Britain and the U.S. would continue to work closely on the implementation of the deal.

The British government previously said it had acted for national security reasons after international court decisions threatened its ability to maintain the base under previous arrangements. The archipelago, home to around 4,000 personnel, has been used for long-range U.S. operations, including in Yemen and Afghanistan.

The deal includes 3 billion pounds ($4 billion) to be paid by Britain to Mauritius over the term of the agreement, with an option for a 50-year extension and Britain maintaining the right of first refusal thereafter.

The deal has faced strong opposition from Britain's Conservative Party, which argues it weakens the country's strategic position and risks undermining long-term security arrangements with the United States.

Mauritius has said its sovereignty over the islands had been unequivocally recognised in international law and the deal "should no longer be subject to debate" and should be implemented quickly.

"Relations between Hungary and the United States have reached new heights of cooperation and spectacular achievement under my Administration, thanks largely to Prime Minister Orbán," Trump said in a post on Truth Social.

"I was proud to ENDORSE Viktor for Re-Election in 2022, and am honored to do so again."

Hungary's centre-right Tisza party leads Orban's governing Fidesz party and the far-right Our Homeland party is on course to enter parliament, according to an opinion poll published on Tuesday.

Nationalist Orban faces the biggest challenge to his rule since Fidesz swept to victory in 2010 although the outcome remains highly uncertain, with opinion polls showing that many voters are still undecided.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 21:57:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/562MAV4R5VK7LLPK4FV4JT3MZA.jpg?auth=bf7c681914b9773b8386cec72431e9f415deb69fe65802db07277be6b66116a8&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump endorses Japanese PM Takaichi ahead of Sunday election</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/trump-endorses-japanese-pm-takaichi-ahead-sunday-election-2026-02-05/</link><description>Feb 5 (Reuters) - U.S President Donald Trump on Thursday said Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi had his "total endorsement" ahead of a legislative election in the east Asian country on Sunday, adding that they would meet March 19 at the White House.

“Prime Minister Takaichi is someone who deserves powerful recognition for the job she and her Coalition are doing,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social.

“Therefore, as President of the United States of America, it is my Honor to give a Complete and Total Endorsement of her, and what her highly respected Coalition is representing.”

Takaichi heads to a snap election she is widely expected to win this Sunday.

Last week the US Justice Department (DOJ) published a new cache of nearly 3 million government documents related to Epstein, who died in 2019 while awaiting trial for sex trafficking.

The financier was long alleged to have been a purveyor of sex with underage girls to some of the world's most powerful men.

The mere mention of someone's name in the files does not, in itself, imply any wrongdoing by that person.

However, the documents made public show at the very least connections between Epstein or his circle and certain public figures who have often downplayed – or even denied – the existence of such ties.

The latest files have highlighted just how broad his connections were as he sought influence with the world's most high-octane people, spotlighting the dark underbelly of the global elite.

He strove to forge ties with political leaders, especially in France, asking several contacts if they had connections to President Emmanuel Macron, former economy minister Bruno Le Maire or former president Nicolas Sarkozy.

Epstein's emails showed former high-profile French culture minister Jack Lang, now 86, once tried to sell Epstein a friend's property in the Moroccan region of Marrakesh.

Lang, who spent nearly 20 years as France's culture minister and education minister in different governments, has said he would not step down from his current position as president of the Paris-based Arab World Institute.

The French government on Thursday called for Lang to be summoned by the foreign and culture ministers.

The French presidential and prime minister's offices have asked the concerned ministers to summon Lang, according to sources close to Macron. The ministers of foreign affairs and culture have oversight of the Arab World Institute.

Lang has said he first met Epstein "about 15 years ago" and was "completely shocked" when he discovered his crimes.

But his daughter Caroline Lang, a film producer, resigned on Monday as head of the Independent Production Union.

From the libertarian billionaire Peter Thiel to the banker Ariane de Rothschild and former Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak , Epstein approached his contacts with targeted, tailored overtures – sometimes insistently.

His relationships transcended ideological boundaries, ranging from hard-right US figure Steve Bannon to influential left-wing intellectual Noam Chomsky.

The continuous recruitment of young women meanwhile underpinned his activities, with the files corroborating the existence of a network of intermediaries tasked with identifying and introducing "assistants" to Epstein.

The files so far – released in three major tranches since December – show that misogyny, racism and homophobia permeated his correspondence, often including photographs of naked women.

The DOJ previously drew the ire of Epstein's victims when released documents exposed their identities. The documents were subsequently withdrawn.

The archive also reveals Epstein's detailed schedule and careful discretion. He often favoured phone calls and face-to-face meetings over written communication.

While the DOJ has said it sees no grounds for new prosecutions, the latest release has triggered a landslide of repercussions for those mentioned in the files.

The World Economic Forum (WEF) on Thursday launched an independent investigation into its CEO ⁠Borge Brende to clarify his relationship with Epstein.

The Geneva-based organiser of the Davos summit said it was looking ​into disclosures that showed ‍Brende had had three business dinners with Epstein and had also communicated with the disgraced financier ​via email and text message.

"In light of these interactions, the ​Governing Board requested the Audit and Risk Committee to look into the matter, which subsequently decided to initiate an independent review," the WEF said in a statement released Thursday.

In the US, Bill and Hillary Clinton have finally agreed to be questioned by a congressional committee about the former president's friendship with Epstein.

Britain's former minister and EU trade commissioner Peter Mandelson , already fired from his role as ambassador to Washington, is now under police investigation, dealing yet another blow to embattled UK leader Keir Starmer .

The pressure has also intensified for Britain's former prince Andrew – now living far from Windsor – with the emergence of new photos showing him with an unidentified young girl and exchanges with Epstein.

Emails to Epstein from Andrew's ex-wife Sarah Ferguson called the financier "the brother" she had "always dreamed of".

Other royals across Europe are under public scrutiny for the first time. Epstein's previously unknown friendship with Norway's Crown Princess Mette-Marit has not done her reputation any favours.

Many who had played down or even denied their ties to Epstein – including former Microsoft CEO Bill Gates , former Norwegian premier Thorbjorn Jagland and Los Angeles Olympics chief Casey Wasserman – have seen their claims embarrassingly undercut.

Norwegian police on Thursday said that they opened an "aggravated corruption" investigation into Jagland over his links to Epstein.

Jagland was prime minister of Norway from 1996 to 1997, and secretary general of the Council of Europe from 2009 to 2019. Between January 2009 and March 2015, he also chaired the committee that selects the Nobel Peace Prize winner.

Norway has dismissed high-profile diplomat Mona Juul from her post as ambassador to Jordan.

Some figures have left their posts following the latest publication: Slovakia's Miroslav Lajcak, former minister and adviser to Prime Minister Robert Fico, and French film producer Caroline Lang, the daughter of former minister Jack Lang.

The sheer quantity of difficult-to-download documents, many of which are redacted and duplicated, makes analysing the files a mammoth task.

The four data sets posted online on Friday amount to roughly 2.7 million pages, which is the largest batch released since late December.

Most are PDF documents and contain either text or photos. An empty PDF is also published for videos, which are stored elsewhere.

Emails may appear multiple times, and each reply becomes a new document that includes the previous messages. Some documents are also scans of handwritten notes that are sometimes illegible or incomprehensible.

That could make it difficult to win agreement before February 13, when funding for the Homeland Security Department expires.

At issue is whether U.S. immigration agents deployed in Trump's immigration crackdown can wear masks, enter homes without displaying identification or judicial warrants, and conduct indiscriminate sweeps of suspects, rather than the targeted operations they conducted under previous presidents.

Democrats say the reforms are needed to rein in abuses by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection, including killing two U.S. citizens in Minneapolis last month. A January Reuters/Ipsos poll found 58% of Americans thought ICE had gone too far.

Republicans have pointed to possible changes of their own, such as punishments for "sanctuary cities" that do not cooperate with deportation efforts.

Senate Republican Leader John Thune dismissed Democrats' 10-point proposal as mainly "unrealistic and unserious."

Democrats hope they will have better luck with Trump, who has sought to de-escalate somewhat.

White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said on Thursday Trump is willing to negotiate, but added that some of the Democrats' requests were non-starters.

Georgetown University professor Christy Lopez, who worked on police practices for the U.S. Justice Department, said agents have less training and weaker standards than state and local law enforcement.

"These are pretty significant changes in terms of making them more accountable and sending the message ... you are not a secret police and allowed to do whatever you want," she said of Democrats' proposals.

Democrats and Republicans could find common ground on outfitting agents with body cameras. The DHS funding bill provides $20 million to purchase the equipment, and Trump's administration is deploying them in Minneapolis, the current focus of the crackdown.

Democrats, however, are pressing for rules mandating access to camera footage and other controls.

Republican Senator Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, a member of the Homeland Security panel, said she also supports independent oversight of ICE and CBP activities, as do Democrats.

But she said agents and their families could be at risk if they were required to remove their masks.

"I've been doxxed myself. It's an invasion of your own personal security," she said.

U.S. law enforcement agencies generally prohibit the use of masks in most circumstances.

Republicans are also resisting Democrats' demand that DHS officers obtain judicial warrants, rather than more easily obtained administrative warrants, before entering private property.

"We are never going to go along with adding an entirely new layer of judicial warrants because it is unimplementable," House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson said.

However, the two sides might find room for compromise. Republican Representative Michael McCaul of Texas told CBS' "Face the Nation" on Sunday that the Trump administration might not allow administrative warrants to be used to enter a home, for example.

Many Republicans have not weighed in yet on other Democratic proposals, including banning agents from churches, schools, hospitals and polling places, and prohibiting racial profiling.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 22:29:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/G3OBUP2XSFI73F5OHGSLI5RYT4.jpg?auth=bf485dcd4f69060688f9d42a28e7dad4290bc0325e871d962321e30844484bfa&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Norway police open investigation into ex-prime minister Jagland over Epstein files</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/norway-police-open-investigation-into-ex-prime-minister-jagland-over-epstein-2026-02-05/</link><description>OSLO, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Norway's economic crime police unit, Oekokrim, said on Thursday it has opened an investigation into former prime minister and chairman of the Norwegian Nobel committee, Thorbjoern Jagland, on suspicion of aggravated corruption.

The decision to investigate Jagland, also a former Secretary General of the Council of Europe, was based on information revealed by newly released files related to the late U.S. sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, Oekokrim said.

"We consider there are reasonable grounds for investigation, given that he held the positions of chair of the Nobel Committee and Secretary General of the Council of Europe during the period covered by the released documents," Oekokrom director Paal Loeseth said in a statement.

Jagland has not been charged with any crime and the investigation will among other things cover whether gifts, travel and loans were received in connection with his position.

The police also asked that the immunity Jagland has due to his position as a former head of an international organisation be lifted, a request acquiesced to by the Foreign Ministry.

"It is important that the facts of this case are brought to light," Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said in a statement.

"I have therefore decided that Norway will put forward a proposal to the Council of Europe's Committee of Ministers that Jagland’s immunity be revoked," he said.

A lawyer for Thorbjoern Jagland said he welcomed police opening an investigation and that his client would contribute fully to it.

"Based on what we have found so far, we are confident of the outcome," Anders Brosveet said in a statement to Reuters.

A spokesperson for the Norwegian Nobel Committee declined to comment on the news, but added that the committee "welcome all the facts in this case".

Jagland is one of several prominent Norwegian figures facing renewed scrutiny over their ties with Epstein. Another is Crown Princess Mette-Marit , who has said she displayed poor judgement in maintaining ties after Epstein was convicted.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 22:33:54 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5ZXUHMIQKNOL7KXX4YI7626SOU.jpg?auth=cb769f22a1288cc5f6b26723fae0415bcaad16599486d1b042a50f46913952f4&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US steps up aid to Cuba even while choking off fuel supply</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/us-steps-up-aid-cuba-even-while-choking-off-fuel-supply-2026-02-05/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Feb 5 (Reuters) - The U.S. will provide an extra $6 million in humanitarian aid to Cuba, the top State Department aid official said on Thursday, even as Washington has stepped up efforts to block oil supplies to the Caribbean island nation, causing crippling shortages.

Aid official Jeremy Lewin said at a news conference the new U.S. commitment would bring to $9 million the amount of assistance provided to the people of Cuba since Hurricane Melissa struck in October.

The aid is being delivered by the Catholic Church and Lewin said Cuba's communist authorities had so far not interfered with its distribution.

U.S. President Donald Trump has said Cuba will no longer receive oil from Venezuela after the U.S. operation to capture its leader Nicolas Maduro last month, and has threatened to impose tariffs on other suppliers like Mexico if they continue to ship fuel to the island.

Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel said earlier on Thursday his government would roll out temporary measures in the next week to deal with fuel shortages amid blackouts in several provinces.

Despite the U.S. moves on oil imports, Lewin argued that the humanitarian crisis in Cuba, which goes beyond the damage from Hurricane Melissa, was the fault of Cuba's government.

"It's because the government can't, you know, put food on the shelves ... They let these government-run stores go completely empty. They're not stocked," Lewin said. "And so what you've had is a humanitarian catastrophe."</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 22:58:43 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/NUV6CS5SY5OSZHGODCJQEDWB6I.jpg?auth=beaa2d32f4f2adae4cb5f24a79893cbf772023e0bf3239d19b4af6664cb87859&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Japan election: What to look for in Sunday vote</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/japan-election-what-look-sunday-vote-2026-02-05/</link><description>TOKYO, Feb 6 (Reuters) - Japan's first female prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, is seeking to secure her grip on power in a national election on Sunday, with polls suggesting a big win for her conservative party.

Here are some key developments to watch:

Takaichi's Liberal Democratic Party and its coalition partner, the Japan Innovation Party, known as Ishin, could capture around 300 seats in the 465-seat lower house of parliament, polls this week showed. That would be a significant jump from the razor-thin majority she now controls.

If the coalition snags 261 seats, dubbed an absolute stable majority, she can control parliamentary committees, easing the passage of legislation, including key budget proposals.

A super-majority of 310 seats would allow her to override the upper house, where her coalition lacks a majority.

If the polls have it all wrong and she loses her lower house majority, Takaichi has said she will resign.

Takaichi's election promise to help households cope with rising prices by suspending the 8% sales tax on food sparked a market selloff last month.

Investors baulked at the vagaries of how an economy with the heaviest debt burden in the developed world would pay for the estimated 5 trillion yen ($30 billion) hit to annual revenue.

Her comments on how she will implement those plans will be pored over by those same investors that fled Japanese government bonds and sent the yen sinking into crisis mode.

If she sets off a market rout, Takaichi may not be able to count on the Bank of Japan's help to tame it, Reuters reported this week.

Support for Takaichi, 64, is strongest among younger voters, not the older generations that have long formed the LDP’s electoral backbone, polls show.

Her modest background and nationalistic rhetoric have struck a chord with a disenchanted youth hopeful she can pull Japan out of a decades-long economic funk.

A conservative who draws inspiration from Britain's Margaret Thatcher, Takaichi has harnessed the power of social media and become an unlikely fashion icon, with fans clamouring to buy the bag she carries and the pink pen she scribbles with.

Whether younger Japanese bother going to polling stations on Sunday may determine the size of her expected win. In the October general election that preceded her rise to prime minister, just 36% of those aged 21 to 24 in the capital Tokyo voted, versus 71% of those aged 70 to 74.

A resounding victory could hand Takaichi new clout in an escalating dispute with powerful neighbour China, current and former Japanese officials said, though Beijing has shown no signs of backing down.

Weeks after taking office, Takaichi touched off the biggest dispute with China in over a decade by publicly outlining how Tokyo might respond to a Chinese attack on Taiwan.

A strong mandate could also accelerate Takaichi's plans to bolster Japan's military, drawing more anger from Beijing, which has cast her endeavours as an attempt to revive Japan's militaristic past.

Fielding a record 190 candidates, the far-right Sanseito party could make gains, with polls suggesting it may win around 15 seats, up from just two.

That would build on last year’s upper house election, when the party broke through with fiery warnings about foreigners and attracted notable youth support.

While Sanseito, which has sought ties with U.S. President Donald Trump's MAGA movement, will remain a small party, its emergence has helped shift the political discourse in Japan to the right, a trend seen in other advanced democracies.

Another factor that could influence turnout is the weather. The election will be the first since 1990 to be held in mid-winter, with some parts of northern and western Japan buried under record snowfall.

More snow is expected on Sunday, with possibly even a rare sprinkling in Tokyo, which could snarl up travel.

Turnout in Japanese elections, which the LDP has dominated in the postwar era, is lower than in most other advanced democracies at around 55% in recent votes.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 22:59:16 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/K7RA6RU3YBLXFBUYL4BX3DMLNA.jpg?auth=70d83234cf897ffff6e8666d255d56a5267ea66fe6d6882d4df192b645d62688&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Storm disrupts Portugal as presidential run‑off election approaches</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260205-storm-disrupts-portugal-as-presidential-run%E2%80%91off-election-approaches</link><description>A deadly storm that triggered floods and thousands of evacuations in the Iberian Peninsula sparked calls on Thursday for Portugal 's presidential run-off to be postponed, but electoral officials insisted it would go ahead.

The country of around 10 million people had barely recovered from last week's battering by rain and winds that killed five people, injured hundreds and left tens of thousands without power.

This week's Storm Leonardo has left one dead in Portugal and lashed the southern Spanish region of Andalusia, where rescuers were searching for a missing woman and evacuated thousands of people.

Scientists say human-driven climate change is increasing the length, intensity and frequency of extreme weather events such as the floods and heatwaves that have struck both countries in recent years.

Portuguese officials issued their highest flood alert for the Tagus in the central Santarem region on Thursday and evacuated people from homes near the river.

Civil Protection chief Mario Silvestre said it was the worst flood threat along the Tagus in nearly three decades.

Local media quoted far-right presidential candidate Andre Ventura as saying he would ask for Sunday's second-round vote to be pushed back a week due to the emergency, as "a matter of equality among all Portuguese".

But the national electoral authority said in a statement the vote would go ahead Sunday as scheduled.

"A state of emergency , weather alerts or overall unfavourable situations are not in themselves a sufficient reason to postpone voting in a town or region," it said.

Ventura is due to face the Socialist favourite Antonio Jose Seguro, who won the January 18 first round, for the mostly ceremonial position.

Seguro told local media: "It is up to the authorities to hold the election in each municipality... I call on the Portuguese people who are able to vote to do so on Sunday."

In Alcacer do Sal, south of Lisbon, mayor Clarisse Campos told national news agency Lusa that the municipality of around 10,000 electors had decided to postpone voting day by a week.

"The conditions are not in place. We have several isolated localities, and the town centre is completely flooded," she said.

Firefighters waded through the water and used inflatable boats to rescue trapped residents, AFP journalists saw.

Deolinda Guerra, a 78-year-old pensioner evacuated by the rescuers, said: "My house is full of water, everything is ruined: my washing machine, the fridge, everything."

A man in his 60s died in the southeast on Wednesday after being swept away by the current while attempting to drive across a flooded area.

The IPMA weather agency said last month, marked by a string of storms, was Portugal's second-wettest January this century.

Across the border in Spain , Andalusian emergency services said they had dealt with more than 3,200 incidents linked to the storm since Monday as the rain and wind triggered floods, landslides and building collapses.

Rescuers were searching for a woman swept away by a river in the Sayalonga municipality on Wednesday as she tried to rescue her dog from the current.

Authorities were evacuating around 1,500 people from the mountainous municipality of Grazalema, which on Wednesday soaked in as much rain as Madrid usually receives in a year.

Lara Olivar, a 25-year-old actress, told AFP in the village: "We never imagined that this would happen here," as water seeped into garages and homes.

Schools reopened in most of Andalusia after the lifting of the highest weather alert but remained suspended in the worst-hit areas, with road and rail transport still heavily disrupted.

The region's leader Juanma Moreno told reporters that 15 municipalities had been cut off as more than 80 roads were shut.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 23:32:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/0dad05a6-02d1-11f1-a086-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/000-969B8H2.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuela legislature advances amnesty bill for political detainees</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260205-venezuela-legislature-advances-amnesty-bill-for-political-detainees</link><description>Venezuela ’s legislature on Thursday advanced an amnesty bill proposed by acting President Delcy Rodríguez that could lead to the release of hundreds of opposition leaders, journalists and human rights activists detained for political reasons.

Such an amnesty is a central demand of the country's opposition and human rights organisations with backing from the United States . But the contents of the bill have not been released publicly, and rights groups have so far reacted with cautious optimism – and with demands for more information.

The bill, introduced just weeks after the US military captured then-President Nicolás Maduro , still requires a second debate that has yet to be scheduled. Once approved, it must be signed by Rodríguez before it can go into effect.

In announcing the bill late last month, Rodríguez told a gathering of justices, magistrates, ministers, military brass and other government leaders that the ruling party-controlled National Assembly would take up the legislation with urgency.

“May this law serve to heal the wounds left by the political confrontation fuelled by violence and extremism,” she said in a pre-taped televised event. “May it serve to redirect justice in our country, and may it serve to redirect coexistence among Venezuelans.”

Rights groups, fearing some political detainees will be excluded, want more details about the requirements for amnesty before any final vote.

The Venezuelan Programme for Education-Action in Human Rights, or PROVEA, issued a statement emphasising that the bill must be made public urgently due to its potential impact on victims’ rights and broader Venezuelan society.

Based on what is known so far about the legislation, the amnesty would cover a broad timeline, spanning the administration of the late Hugo Chávez from 1999 to 2013 and that of his political heir, Maduro, until this year. It would exclude people convicted of murder, drug trafficking and serious human rights violations, reports indicate.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 23:32:39 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/4da66170-02e5-11f1-b8f3-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26030814974084.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukrainian shelling causes 'serious damage' in Russia's Belgorod, governor says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukrainian-shelling-causes-serious-damage-russias-belgorod-governor-says-2026-02-06/</link><description>Feb 6 (Reuters) - Nighttime shelling by Ukraine inflicted "serious damage" in the Russian city of Belgorod, near the border, the region's governor said early on Friday.

Vyacheslav Gladkov, in a solemn video posted on Telegram after midnight, said city officials were holding an emergency meeting to devise a plan of action.

"I cannot say good evening, unfortunately, my dear friends," Gladkov said in the video, recorded in near-darkness.

"The enemy has shelled the civilian city of Belgorod. Everyone knows we have no military targets. There has been serious damage. I have been out to look around."

A post on the unofficial Russian Telegram channel Mash, which has sources in the security services, said missiles had hit the city that lies about 40 km (25 miles) from the Ukrainian border and power had been cut in some districts.

Ukrainian forces have regularly attacked Belgorod and nearby parts of the region since Russia's February 2022 invasion of its smaller neighbour.</description><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 02:06:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WF5GEP4PDFJ5DLU3P2ZIGL65YM.jpg?auth=cf1951726ef9e68db428f9688dfdbf675faf62f48eb72ff9198b4b2d5e5c6ccb&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Thai PM Anutin's gamble on nationalism to be tested in close election</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/thai-pm-anutins-gamble-nationalism-be-tested-in-close-election-2026-02-06/</link><description>BANGKOK, Feb 6 (Reuters) - When Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul dissolved parliament on Dec. 12, he did so hoping a surge of nationalism fuelled by last year's deadly border clashes with Cambodia would help him consolidate power in a general election .

Sunday's vote will prove whether that gamble pays off.

Polls show the electoral contest remains a three-way tussle among Anutin's ruling Bhumjaithai, the progressive People's Party and the populist Pheu Thai party .

But the reformist People's Party and its leader Natthaphong Ruengpanyawut are leading the pack by some margin, with their message of change and reforms cutting through the surging nationalism, although none of the parties are expected to win an outright majority.

That could leave parliament as fractured as when Anutin dissolved the body, citing struggles to run a minority government, amid some of the worst violence along the Thai-Cambodian frontier in decades.

The clashes, which left at least 149 people dead, unleashed a wave of nationalist sentiment that political parties have sought to harness.

In the final stretch before the vote, senior Bhumjaithai figures, including Anutin himself, have ramped up nationalist rhetoric, portraying the election as a choice between those loyal to the nation and those they accuse of being disloyal.

"If Thai people want a prime minister that Cambodia chooses, then vote for those parties," Anutin told a cheering crowd at a rally in Bangkok's Lumpini Park last week. "But I am confident that a Bhumjaithai government is for Thai people, 100%."

In a survey by the National Institute of Development Administration released last Friday, People's Party leader Natthaphong remained the frontrunner at 29.08%, followed by Anutin in second place at 22.24%.

Another survey by Suan Dusit University published on the same day showed Anutin at third, trailing Pheu Thai's candidate Yodchanan Wongsawat. Natthaphong held the top spot.

Anutin's decision to dissolve parliament was driven as much by political survival as by strategy, coming less than 100 days after he took office following the ouster of a coalition government led by Pheu Thai.

"Anutin's hand was forced because he was running a minority government," said political scientist Thitinan Pongsudhirak at Bangkok's Chulalongkorn University.

To take power after Pheu Thai's collapse , Anutin secured the backing of the People's Party, which demanded a referendum on constitutional amendment, among other conditions.

But the deal collapsed in early December after parliamentary disputes and the People's Party accused Bhumjaithai of reneging on the agreement.

Anutin denied the charge and dissolved parliament, even as fighting raged on with Cambodia, which was only halted in late December after both sides agreed to a truce .

"Although the ceasefire over the Thai-Cambodian border war is still in effect and has dampened the nationalist fervour, Anutin will still rely on nationalism and royalism to retain office," Thitinan said, referring to the premier's reverence for the monarchy.

Although its predecessor was blocked from taking power after it won the 2023 election, the People's Party has been able to sustain its momentum during this campaign, with its progressive stance drawing in those hoping for systemic and deep reforms.

The party has led almost all opinion polls since December, buoyed by detailed policy plans and a revamped team to address criticism that they don't have enough experience to run a government.

"Why can’t you accept that younger people can be more capable?" asked Kachen Bunlang, a 49-year-old motorcycle taxi driver in Bangkok, who supports the progressive movement.

"Honestly, I want them to come to power."</description><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 02:07:03 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/A5EM6LLKKNP45MKRH2ELY54Q2Y.jpg?auth=ffeb2ed80e36a2de04164bd892f4ed3be12e9752cc7cc35f840efbec8f93db57&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Britain expects Arctic security plans to be discussed by NATO next week</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/britain-expects-arctic-security-plans-be-discussed-by-nato-next-week-2026-02-06/</link><description>LONDON, Feb 6 (Reuters) - NATO defence ministers will likely discuss measures to bolster the security of Greenland in a meeting next week, British defence minister John Healey said, after U.S. President Donald Trump nearly upended the alliance over his desire to acquire it.

Trump has repeatedly asserted that he wants Greenland, saying European allies have failed to properly secure it. His comments sparked a dispute with NATO member Denmark over its overseas territory and strained the defence alliance.

Those tensions eased after NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said he had discussed how NATO allies could work collectively to ensure Arctic security with Trump, but details of those plans remain scarce.

Healey said a proposed NATO Arctic Sentry mission was a way in which "we, as NATO nations, can demonstrate to President Trump that we're already stepping up on Greenland's security, that we accept and agree that he's got a point of concern".

"Trump's put his finger on a challenge. What we're demonstrating to him is that NATO's already on it," Healey told Reuters in an interview, adding nations would "step up further".

"I would expect to see more discussions at the NATO Defence Ministers meeting that I'll be at in Brussels next week".

NATO has started military planning for "Arctic Sentry", which it describes as an enhanced vigilance mission in the area, but it had been unclear if it would be discussed at the February 12 meeting.

Britain has boosted its defence spending in light of the war in Ukraine and Trump's demand that NATO allies spend more.

Speaking on the sidelines of an event where 10 smaller companies pitched their technology to investors, Healey said he wanted "sources of private capital that haven't looked at defence before" so that record rising public defence investment could be matched by sources of private investment.</description><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 02:07:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/MFT6OOZXSRMRBBDE6SL4RMAOGA.jpg?auth=7033c42dcb7d693f3b8bd1157a30dbde558ca7071c6529c68a7e7fa354327f04&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>New Zealand celebrates national day with call to support Maori and preserve unity</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/new-zealand-celebrates-national-day-with-call-support-maori-preserve-unity-2026-02-06/</link><description>SYDNEY, Feb 6 (Reuters) - New Zealand must continue to evolve in a way that empowers its Indigenous Maori while preserving national unity, Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said, as the country on Friday marked the anniversary of the signing of its founding document.

Hundreds gathered near the historic Waitangi Treaty Grounds in North Island's Bay of Islands for the dawn service as paddlers representing the different tribes across the country arrived in Waka, the Maori traditional canoe.

They are expected to perform the haka, a traditional Maori dance, after disembarking.

Waitangi Day commemorates the Treaty of Waitangi, signed in 1840 by the British Crown and more than 500 Maori Indigenous chiefs setting out how the two sides agreed to govern. It still guides legislation and policy in New Zealand.

This year's celebration carries added political weight ahead of a national election scheduled in November, as tension with some Maori has grown after the conservative government, elected in late 2023, unwound some Indigenous policies and disbanded organisations aimed at improving the lives of Maori, who make up about 20% of the 5.3 million population.

A controversial bill last year seeking to reinterpret the Treaty's principles further sparked protests and failed after two of the three governing parties did not vote for it.

Luxon said people would have different views on the treaty but it was important to manage those differences effectively.

"We don't settle our differences through violence. We do not turn on each other, we turn towards the conversation. We work through our differences," Luxon said on X on Friday. He visited the treaty grounds on Thursday.

Governor-General Cindy Kiro said though the country had not always lived up to the principles of mutual strength and understanding that the treaty strived to achieve, it still remained a touchstone and framework for principled action.

Maori were dispossessed of much of their land during British colonisation and have higher levels of deprivation and incarceration, as well as poorer health outcomes than the wider population.

In previous years, many have used Waitangi Day to protest for civil and social rights, accusing successive governments of failing to adequately address the inequalities.</description><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 02:07:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LDM5XZCTJVKTDESX4OI6VRFUIM.jpg?auth=c6b2e58b1b7a4d1dceefb4414d5377e609b8580ec69e5fa8bd46525d0fddb731&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Thailand's election in numbers</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/thailands-election-numbers-2026-02-06/</link><description>BANGKOK, February 6 - Thailand will hold a general election on February 8 in a showdown between three big parties that could lead to its fourth prime minister in less than three years.

Trump has vowed to cut off Cuba's access to oil and stated the communist island was "ready to fall" as he warned it to "make a deal" with Washington "BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE."

The Republican did not say what kind of a deal he was after, but has repeatedly stated the two countries were in negotiations, which Havana has denied.

"Cuba is willing to engage in dialogue with the United States, a dialogue on any topic... but without pressure or preconditions," Diaz-Canel said on state TV and radio.

He said any talks must take place "from a position of equals, with respect for our sovereignty, our independence and our self-determination" and without "interference in our internal affairs."

Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio , the Miami-born son of Cuban immigrants, have made no secret of their desire to bring about regime change in Havana.

White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt told reporters Thursday: "I think the fact that the Cuban government is on its last leg and its country is about to collapse, they should be wise in their statements directed towards the president of the United States."

Asked about Cuba's denial of the existence of negotiations, she said her boss was "always willing to engage in diplomacy and I believe that is something that is taking place, in fact, with the Cuban government."

Cuba, in the grips of an economic crisis, had long relied on oil supplies from Venezuela , whose leader was ousted in a deadly US military operation last month.

Trump subsequently claimed to have taken control of Venezuelan oil , vowed to starve Cuba of the commodity, and threatened tariffs on any other nation stepping in to help US-sanctioned Havana.

The pressure tactics threaten to plunge Cuba into complete darkness as its power plants struggle to keep the lights on due to fuel shortages.

Earlier Thursday, hundreds of thousands of people in the country's east were left without electricity for hours after an electricity grid failure.

Diaz-Canel insisted his country still had friends, which he did not name, as it confronts what he described as an "acute fuel shortage."

"We cannot openly explain everything we are doing," he said, but "Cuba is not alone."

He said energy production from diesel- and oil-powered generators has been "zero" for weeks.

On Thursday, the US State Department announced it was providing $6 million in direct aid to Cubans through the Catholic Church in that country.

It comes after $3 million of earlier assistance, also provided through the same mechanisms, with the material aid being delivered by local parish representatives.

Mexico 's President Claudia Sheinbaum said this week that her country was using all available diplomatic channels to ensure a resumption of crude shipments to Cuba, but would not put itself at risk of punitive US tariffs .

Diaz-Canel said the pressure that Cuba found itself under highlighted the importance of its drive for greener energy and reducing reliance on others.

Cuban officials blame US sanctions for Cuba's worst economic crisis in decades, marked by shortages of fuel, food and medicine.

But observers say poor economic management and a tourism collapse following the Covid-19 pandemic contributed to the island's woes.</description><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 02:09:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/3c728a82-ee31-11f0-9420-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/8c0f0884d85af0e59fc22533f6d33929d9d4df8aw.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran, US to negotiate in Oman amid deep rifts and mounting war fears</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-us-negotiate-oman-amid-deep-rifts-mounting-war-fears-2026-02-06/</link><description>DUBAI/WASHINGTON, Feb 6 (Reuters) - Iran and the United States are set to hold high-stakes negotiations in Oman on Friday over Tehran's nuclear programme, but a dispute over the agenda suggests progress will be hard won amid the threat of a regional Middle East war.

While both sides have signalled readiness to revive
diplomacy over Tehran's long-running nuclear dispute with the West, Washington wants the talks to cover Iran's nuclear programme, its ballistic missiles , support for armed groups around the region and its "treatment of their own people", U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Wednesday.

Iran has said it wants Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi and U.S. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff to discuss only nuclear issues in Muscat.

Tehran said it will engage in the talks "with authority and with the aim of reaching a fair, mutually acceptable and dignified understanding on the nuclear issue".

"We hope the American side will also participate in this process with responsibility, realism and seriousness," Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei said on Thursday.

Tehran's leadership remains deeply concerned that U.S. President Donald Trump may still carry out his threats to strike Iran amid a buildup by the U.S. Navy near Iran.

The U.S. naval buildup, which Trump has called a massive “armada”, has followed a bloody government crackdown on nationwide protests in Iran last month, heightening tensions between Washington and Tehran.

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt on Thursday told reporters that Trump was looking to determine whether a deal can be struck but also issued a warning.

"While these negotiations are taking place, I would remind the Iranian regime that the president has many options at his disposal, aside from diplomacy as the commander in chief of the most powerful military in the history of the world," she added.

Trump has warned that "bad things" would probably happen if a deal could not be reached, ratcheting up pressure on the Islamic Republic in a standoff that has led to mutual threats of airstrikes.

Iran has warned it would respond harshly to any military strike and has cautioned neighbouring countries hosting U.S. bases that they could be in the firing line if they were involved in an attack.

"It's very difficult to see them conceding enough in talks tomorrow for the U.S. credibly to be able to claim that it's made a breakthrough. And this is where I think, military conflict is more likely than not," Edmund Fitton-Brown, senior fellow at Washington-based think-tank FDD, said.

Negotiators in Oman will have to navigate Iran's red line on discussing its missile programme to reach a deal and avert future military action. Tehran has flatly ruled out talks on its "defence capabilities, including missiles and their range."

Hours before the talks, Iran's state TV said that "one of the country's most advanced long-range ballistic missile

Khorramshahr 4" has been deployed at one of the Revolutionary Guards' vast underground missile complexes.

However, Tehran is willing to show "flexibility on uranium enrichment, including handing over 400 kg of highly enriched uranium (HEU) and accepting zero enrichment under a consortium arrangement as a solution," Iranian officials told Reuters last week. Iran also insists that its right to enrich uranium is not negotiable.

Iran says its nuclear activities are meant for peaceful, not military purposes, while the U.S. and Israel have accused it of past efforts to develop nuclear weapons.

In June, the United States struck Iranian nuclear targets, joining in the final stages of a 12-day Israeli bombing campaign. Tehran has since said its uranium enrichment work has stopped.

Tehran's influence throughout the region has been severely weakened by Israel’s attacks on its regional allies - known as the "Axis of Resistance" – from Hamas in Gaza to Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen and militias in Iraq – as well as by the ousting of Iran’s close ally, Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad.</description><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 04:26:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LBOSMVJV4RKNPENGC7QKG557WQ.jpg?auth=bcea9d365934681eb1dad4bb01f8e06e1e3ef508aa4421f736c8016853e05be3&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Taiwan teams with US firm Kratos to build attack drones to counter China</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/taiwan-teams-with-us-firm-kratos-build-attack-drones-counter-china-2026-02-06/</link><description>TAIPEI, Feb 6 (Reuters) - U.S.-based Kratos Defense (KTOS.O) , opens new tab and Taiwan's military have successfully tested a new jet-powered attack drone, a move aimed at rapidly boosting the island's ability to field "large numbers" of low-cost drone amid a rising Chinese threat.

In a recent test campaign at Kratos' facility in Oklahoma City, engineers from both sides validated the integration of a Taiwanese mission payload on the Mighty Hornet IV attack drone, Kratos said in a statement on Thursday.

Kratos called the test a "milestone" that could pave the way for deeper cooperation between the company and Taiwan's top military research body, the National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology (NCSIST).

The effort comes as Taiwan seeks to expand security ties with the United States, including jointly developing and manufacturing weapons , while China steps up military pressure to force the democratically governed island to accept Beijing's sovereignty claims.

In a statement, NCSIST described the project as a "new milestone in U.S.-Taiwan defence technology collaboration," saying such cooperation can shorten development timelines and meet Taiwan's needs for "rapid countermeasures and long-range preemptive strikes."

The Mighty Hornet IV is being developed as a low-cost, cruise missile-like weapon, and the two sides aim to base a "large quantity" of the systems in Taiwan as both a deterrent and a wartime asset, according to Kratos.

China, which views Taiwan as its own territory despite the island's objections, has been sending warplanes and warships into the skies and waters around Taiwan on an almost daily basis in what Taipei calls "grey zone" tactics. It held its latest large-scale war games near the island in late December.

The number of detected Chinese military aircraft, including fighters and drones, operating near Taiwan rose 23% in 2025 from a year earlier, Taiwan's defence minister said this week.

Taipei has been working to secure cheaper, more numerous unmanned systems that are key to complicating any potential Chinese attack.</description><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 04:26:43 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5FXSW7EORBNWDBYQPW5EJTNN2U.jpg?auth=a440e7091a47f224611975679a83e279eb09a1a2748017f152c71fab88c9269c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US military says it killed two people in strike on suspected drug vessel in Eastern Pacific</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us-military-says-it-killed-two-people-strike-suspected-drug-vessel-eastern-2026-02-06/</link><description>Feb 5 (Reuters) - The U.S. military said it killed two people in a strike on a suspected drug vessel in the Eastern Pacific on Thursday.

Lai, 78, the founder of the now-shuttered pro-democracy Apple Daily newspaper, was found guilty in December of two charges of conspiracy to collude with foreign forces under a China-imposed national security law, as well as a charge of conspiracy to publish seditious material.

Lai, who pleaded not guilty to all the charges, faces possible life imprisonment.

Among the allegations, Lai was found guilty of using Apple Daily as a platform to conspire with six former executives and others to produce seditious publications between April 2019 and June 2021, as well as to collude with foreign forces, including the U.S., between July 2020 and June 2021.

He was accused of conspiring with activist Andy Li, paralegal Chan Tsz-wah and others to invite foreign countries to impose sanctions, blockades and other hostile activities against Hong Kong and China.

The marathon trial began in December 2023 and ran for 156 days. In 2020, Beijing imposed a sweeping national security law upon the Asian financial hub following mass and sometimes violent pro-democracy protests in 2019.

Chief Justice Andrew Cheung, Hong Kong's top judge, recently said that calls to free Lai prematurely would undermine the city's rule of law.

"Such demands not only circumvent the legal procedures established to ensure accountability under the law, but also strike at the very heart of the rule of law itself," he said.

Some countries, including the U.S. and Britain, have said the trial was politically motivated and demanded Lai's immediate release. The Chinese and Hong Kong governments say Lai has been given a fair trial.

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he had a "respectful discussion" regarding Lai with Chinese President Xi Jinping during a recent trip to Beijing, though he declined to provide details.</description><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 04:26:49 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/QEEHITPH6VJO7G7HPXKMDWRX3Y.jpg?auth=b25eeb88645b21de53b5100f812f3e578bb7a0430428baff0113d5e762462de2&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Indonesia signs security pact with Australia</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/indonesia-signs-security-treaty-with-australia-prabowo-says-2026-02-06/</link><description>JAKARTA, Feb 6 (Reuters) - Indonesia and Australia signed a security treaty on Friday that commits them to consult each other if either country is threatened, President Prabowo Subianto said after a meeting with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese in Jakarta.

The pact, the full details of which have not yet been disclosed, was first announced in November when Prabowo visited Australia.

"This agreement signals that Australia and Indonesia's relationship is stronger than it has ever been," Albanese said on Friday in Jakarta.

"The treaty is a significant extension of our existing security and defence cooperation. It demonstrates the strength of our partnership and depth of our trust and cooperation."

Prabowo said the deal reflects the relationship between the two countries.

"To Indonesia, this reflects our full commitment to the good neighbour principles and our free and active foreign policy," he said.

"Indonesia and Australia are destined to live side by side, and we chose to build that relationship on the foundations of trust and good intentions."

Indonesia has a non-aligned foreign policy, pledging friendship with any country without joining any formal military bloc.

The treaty signed on Friday was modelled after a 1995 security agreement between the two countries, Australia's Foreign Minister Penny Wong has said.

The 1995 deal was withdrawn in 1999 after Australia led a United Nations peacekeeping force in East Timor, which had plunged into violence as it sought independence from Indonesia.</description><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 04:26:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WAFHSLLY4BIXTPFANOYOYAYWGM.jpg?auth=df36e46148d1df40dc79e42e573b0ff9218910d8a13ad277d1cab096722699a2&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Pardoned January 6 rioter pleads guilty to threatening US Democratic leader Jeffries</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/pardoned-january-6-rioter-pleads-guilty-threatening-us-democratic-leader-2026-02-06/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Feb 5 (Reuters) - A January 6, 2021, rioter , who was pardoned by President Donald Trump , pleaded guilty to a harassment charge after being accused of threatening to kill U.S. House of Representatives Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, prosecutors said on Thursday.

Christopher Moynihan, 35, pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor harassment charge in a hearing in Clinton, New York, and will be sentenced in April. His representative could not immediately be reached.

"Threats against elected officials are not political speech, they are criminal acts that strike at the heart of public safety and our democratic system," Dutchess County District Attorney Anthony Parisi said in a statement.

Moynihan, 34, was charged in October after he sent threatening text messages about an appearance Jeffries was scheduled to make in New York City, according to a complaint filed in New York state court in Clinton.

"Hakeem Jeffries makes a speech in a few days in NYC I cannot allow this terrorist to live. ... I will kill him for the future," the text messages read, according to the complaint.

"These text messages placed the recipient in reasonable fear of the imminent murder and assassination of Hakeem Jeffries by the defendant," the complaint had said.

In February 2023, Moynihan was sentenced to 21 months in prison on charges including obstruction of an official proceeding, a felony.

He was among nearly 1,590 people charged in the storming of the U.S. Capitol by supporters of Trump on January 6, 2021, in an unsuccessful attempt to prevent the certification of former President Joe Biden's 2020 presidential election victory over Trump.

On his first day back in office last year, Trump pardoned nearly everyone criminally charged with participating in the Capitol attack in a show of solidarity with supporters who backed his false claim of victory in the 2020 election.

Some other January 6 rioters have also been re-arrested, charged or sentenced for other crimes, according to a watchdog.</description><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 04:26:58 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BUHLQ4UQ2JML7KBL4C63AAFGWU.jpg?auth=05db1624755a47efe1e1b7effa092b427a721eac294a271f1ee561c283f6536d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Former Bank of China Vice President Lin Jingzhen expelled from Communist Party, Xinhua says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/former-bank-china-vice-president-lin-jingzhen-expelled-communist-party-xinhua-2026-02-06/</link><description>BEIJING, Feb 6 (Reuters) - Former Bank of China (601988.SS) , opens new tab , Vice President Lin Jingzhen has been expelled from the Communist Party for serious violation of discipline and law, state media Xinhua reported on Friday.

“You’re going to save a fortune,” President Donald Trump said at the site’s unveiling. “And this is also so good for overall health care.”

The government-hosted website is not a platform for buying medications. Instead, it's set up as a facilitator, pointing Americans to drugmakers’ direct-to-consumer websites, where they can make purchases. It also provides coupons to use at pharmacies. The site launches with over 40 medications, including weight-loss drugs such as Ozempic and Wegovy.

The site is part of a larger effort by the Trump administration to show it is tackling the challenges of high costs. Affordability has emerged as a political vulnerability for Trump and his Republican allies going into November's midterm elections , as Americans remain worried about the cost of housing, groceries, utilities and other staples of middle-class identity.

Trump stressed that the lower prices were made possible by his pressuring of pharmaceutical companies on prices, saying he demanded that they charge the same costs in the US as in other nations. He said prescription drug costs will increase in foreign countries as a result.

“We're tired of subsidising the world,” Trump said at the evening event on the White House campus that lasted roughly 20 minutes.

The administration is touting substantial discounts, though it's unclear just how much impact the changes will have for family budgets. The site includes the disclaimer that prices “may be even lower” for people with insurance, as it lists the “out-of-pocket price.” Also, some consumers might be able to use available generics that cost less than brand-name medications.

Still, Dr Mehmet Oz , administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, hyped the website as being transformative. He said the lower prices for Ozempic and Wegovy would cause the country to collectively lose 100 million pounds this year. He suggested that lower prices for the fertility drug Gonal-F would trigger pregnancies nationwide.

“We’re going to have a lot of Trump babies with these costs,” Oz said.

The president first teased TrumpRx in September while announcing the first of his more than 15 deals with pharmaceutical companies to lower drug prices to match the lowest price offered in other developed nations. He said in December the website would provide “massive discounts to all consumers" – though it's unclear whether the prices available on drugmakers' websites will routinely be any lower than what many consumers could get through their insurance coverage.

The website's Thursday release came after it faced multiple delays, for reasons the administration has not publicly shared. Last fall, Oz told Trump the site would share prices for consumers before the end of the year. An expected launch in late January was also pushed back.

The president has spent the past several months seeking to spotlight his efforts to lower drug prices for Americans. He has done that through deals with major pharmaceutical companies , including some of the biggest drugmakers like Pfizer, Eli Lilly and Merck, which have agreed to lower prices of their Medicaid drugs to so-called “most favoured nations” pricing. As part of the deals, many of the companies' new drugs are also to be launched at discounted rates for consumer markets through TrumpRx.

Many of the details of Trump's deals with manufacturers remain unclear, and drug prices for patients in the US can depend on many factors, including the competition a treatment faces and insurance coverage. Most people have coverage through work, the individual insurance market or government programmes like Medicaid and Medicare , which shield them from much of the cost.

Trump’s administration also has negotiated lower prices for several prescription drugs for Medicare enrollees, through a direct negotiation programme created by a 2022 law.</description><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 04:27:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/8d5e573e-0306-11f1-af32-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26037004772424.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>In Hasina’s hometown in Bangladesh, voters face an unfamiliar ballot</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/hasinas-hometown-bangladesh-voters-face-an-unfamiliar-ballot-2026-02-06/</link><description>GOPALGANJ, Bangladesh, Feb 6 (Reuters) - For the first time in decades, the image that once defined the hometown of Bangladesh's ousted premier Sheikh Hasina during elections, her Awami League party's "boat" symbol, is absent.

In its place, posters of rivals like the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), the Jamaat‑e‑Islami party and independents urge voters in Gopalganj to back them in the February 12 election.

The Gopalganj district has long been considered the Awami League’s safest ground, producing Hasina, the country's longest-serving prime minister, and her father, Bangladesh's founding leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.

Hasina ruled for more than 15 straight years until 2024, with the opposition either boycotting elections or marginalised through mass arrests of senior leaders. A youth‑driven uprising toppled Hasina in August 2024 and sent her into exile in India.

Her party has since been barred from the February election, being held under an interim government led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus.

Hasina told Reuters last October via email that the absence of the Awami League would leave millions of supporters without a candidate and push many to boycott the election .

“They can put up as many posters as they want," said Gopalganj rickshaw puller Ershad Sheikh, standing under layers of opposition posters hanging from poles.

"If there is no boat on the ballot paper, none of the 13 voters in my family will go to the polling station.”

A Dhaka court late last year sentenced Hasina to death for ordering a deadly crackdown on the 2024 uprising. A United Nations report estimated that up to 1,400 people were killed and thousands wounded — most by gunfire from security forces, though Hasina denied ordering the killings.

A survey of various voters published this month found that nearly half of former Awami League voters now prefer the BNP, the frontrunner in most opinion polls, followed by roughly 30% who favour Jamaat.

“These patterns suggest that former Awami League voters are not dispersing evenly across the party system or withdrawing from partisan preferences, but are instead consolidating their support around specific opposition alternatives,” said the survey by Dhaka-based Communication &amp; Research Foundation and Bangladesh Election and Public Opinion Studies.

In Gopalganj, families of Awami League activists say the transition away from Hasina has come at a high personal cost.

Shikha Khanam’s brother, Ibrahim Hossain, 30, an activist in the party’s student wing, was arrested in December under the Anti-Terrorism Act over unrest at a rally in July last year. Khanam said her brother had been falsely implicated.

Her family has now withdrawn completely from politics.

“We won’t vote. We are done,” she said.

The July rally in Gopalganj, organised by the newly formed student‑led National Citizen Party to mark the 2024 uprising, left five people dead in clashes with police. Several Awami League activists and members of minority communities said they are now living in fear.

Restaurant waiter Mohabbat Molla said the wider choice of candidates changes nothing for him.

“Our candidate isn’t here,” he said, referring to Hasina. “The Awami League isn’t here. So this election is not for us.”

COMPETITIVE ELECTION

Others see hope in the changing election bunting now hanging from Gopalganj's walls.

Businessman Sheikh Ilias Ahmed hopes the upcoming vote will finally allow people to choose freely.

“In the past, I went to the polling station and found my vote already cast,” he said. "This time, I want to believe things will be different.”

What Awami League voters do next may shape the outcome, said political analyst Asif Shahan, a professor at the University of Dhaka.

“I don’t expect a nationwide boycott,” said Shahan.

“The core loyalists may abstain, but undecided, locally focused voters are likely to turn out and could decide the result."</description><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 06:56:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KIY6MTXUU5JN3OKGJAU6FFTVKQ.jpg?auth=59158aeb962b7b5dc84450018e9110e7106851b1a80d6e431f1fe8fe14e8636e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Germany's Merz to visit Washington in March, Die Welt reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/germanys-merz-visit-washington-march-die-welt-reports-2026-02-06/</link><description>BERLIN -, Feb 6  (Reuters) - German Chancellor Friedrich Merz will make his third visit to Washington in early March, amid efforts to ease transatlantic tensions between European nations and U.S. President Donald Trump, German daily Die Welt reported on Friday.

While both sides ​have signalled readiness to revive diplomacy over Tehran's long-running nuclear dispute with the West, Washington wants the talks to cover Iran's nuclear programme, its ballistic missiles, ‍support for armed groups around the region and "treatment of their own people", US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Wednesday.

Iran has said it wants Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff to discuss only nuclear issues in ​Muscat.

The US in June struck Iranian nuclear targets, joining in the final stages of a 12-day Israeli bombing campaign. Tehran has since said its uranium enrichment work has stopped.

Iran's foreign minister called for "mutual respect" ahead of talks with the United States on the Islamic Republic's nuclear programme and other issues.

"Iran enters diplomacy with open eyes and a steady memory of the past year. We engage in good faith and stand firm on our rights," Abbas Araghchi wrote on X.

"Commitments need to be honored. Equal standing, mutual respect and mutual interest are not rhetoric – they are a must and the pillars of a durable agreement."

Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi arrived in Oman on Thursday for negotiations with President Donald Trump 's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff .

Iran 's foreign ministry said Thursday evening that it had a "responsibility not to miss any opportunity to use diplomacy" to preserve peace, adding it hoped Washington would participate in the discussions "with responsibility, realism and seriousness".

"They're negotiating," Trump said of Iran on Thursday. "They don't want us to hit them, we have a big fleet going there," he added, referring to the aircraft carrier group he has repeatedly called an "armada".</description><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 06:58:12 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/b77546f0-f1ad-11f0-9e2f-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-15T000335Z-694187229-RC2BIIAJFE47-RTRMADP-3-IRAN-ECONOMY-PROTESTS-ARAQCHI.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China flexes its muscle at Singapore Airshow as US isolated</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/china-flexes-its-muscle-singapore-airshow-us-isolated-2026-02-06/</link><description>SINGAPORE, Feb 6 (Reuters) - China used this week's Singapore Airshow to flex its military and aviation muscle, drawing heavy attention from regional delegations as Beijing sharpens its bid for influence in Southeast Asia.

The U.S. military has demonstrated its power this year through the precision extraction of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and a major naval buildup around Iran. Yet President Donald Trump has been vocal in his criticism of some of U.S. allies and imposed tariffs on them, creating an opening for China.

While China's fighter jets and commercial airliners remain far from achieving mass-market international adoption, their makers appeared more assertive and confident and enjoyed greater visibility this year at Asia's largest air show.

The PLA Air Force's aerobatic team made a headline-grabbing show debut of its Chengdu J-10C fighter jets, an aircraft whose export variant, the J-10CE, surged to prominence in 2025 when customer Pakistan used it to shoot down an Indian Air Force French Rafale.

Chinese state media reported the team had used mid-air refuelling to fly directly to Singapore for the high-profile deployment.

"That's a bit of a message to say: Our power projection is growing," said Tim Robinson, editor-in-chief of the Royal Aeronautical Society's Aerospace magazine.

"It's one of the key enablers a modern air force should have. Previously people said this is one of their weaknesses."

Inside the sweltering air show's air-conditioned halls, Chinese state companies occupied a prime spot with brightly lit displays dominated by a 1:2 scale model of AVIC's J-35A stealth multirole fighter. Little is known about the latest addition to Chinese air power, which was first seen domestically in 2024.

No technical data was displayed, but observers of the global arms marketplace said the message to Asia's buyers was evident.

"That's obviously positioned to say: if you can't afford an F-35 or are banned from buying an F-35 we've got an alternative," Robinson said.

Southeast Asian defence officials crowded Chinese military and aerospace booths, underscoring Beijing’s growing pull as it aggressively markets hardware across the region.

The show of strength landed at a politically sensitive moment, with Southeast Asian governments increasingly uneasy about U.S. security commitments amid a more isolationist Washington under Trump, analysts and Western officials said.

"We see the same delegations as before but the conversation has changed," said a senior official at a Western arms company.

Industry-watchers are cautious about any sudden switch of arms trade but agree the backdrop reflects the new power politics and the diversification of supply chains.

"The Chinese arms companies may think that, if other countries have lost confidence in buying American, there's an opportunity for China," said China defence specialist Bradley Perrett.

"But most of the U.S.' customers, if they want to look elsewhere, will look at European, South Korean and Japanese equipment."

Asia's arms spending is growing apace as countries respond to a sustained build-up from an increasingly assertive China.

China's efforts to penetrate the airliner market, grabbing share from Airbus (AIR.PA) , opens new tab and Boeing (BA.N) , opens new tab , are proceeding slowly due in part to the lengthy process of winning European certification .

But state-owned planemaker COMAC again flew the C919 narrowbody jet and advertised the future C929 wide-body in model form at the show. That is now progressing through detailed design as a Chinese project after initially exploring a joint development with Russia.

Chinese delegates said that given the Singapore venue, COMAC was prioritising potential clients from Southeast Asia, and Indonesian attendees were among those inquiring about aircraft.

China's efforts to rival Airbus and Boeing are a national priority though Western analysts say it will take years if not decades to establish the global footprint and marketing support that helps the industry leaders maintain entrenched positions.

But delegates noted a broadening commercial assault at the show including the market for alternative third-party spare parts, tapping into airline concerns about shortages at a time when supplies are strained across the globe.</description><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 07:50:07 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/COAMNCIHOVM3VIYJEI2W6TWUDY.jpg?auth=33fce97965bef8e389ebfed471ff69145f99c5990af99e0e586ce3be78043e16&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Clashes intensify in remote east Congo, challenging US mediation</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/clashes-intensify-remote-east-congo-challenging-us-mediation-2026-02-06/</link><description>Feb 6 (Reuters) - Nurses at the general hospital in Fizi, a town ringed by steep highlands in eastern Congo’s South Kivu province, hurried the wounded soldier into surgery after he was brought in slumped on the back of a motorbike.

He was shot in both legs on the front line in the mountains north of town, where clashes between the army and rebel groups have surged in recent weeks.

The fighting, unfolding away from urban areas and largely overlooked by international mediators, is drawing in more forces from all sides in the war in eastern Congo, with the potential to further complicate efforts by the Trump administration to bring peace and Western minerals investments to the region.

Earlier this week, the AFC/M23 rebel group invoked the fighting as justification for a drone attack on Kisangani airport, hundreds of kilometres from the front lines, calling it retaliation for government aerial attacks on South Kivu villages. Congo's army has not commented on the drone strike or on the rebels' claims that it attacked villages.

Meanwhile, the casualties continue to mount.

The hospital in Fizi, supported by the International Committee of the Red Cross, was caring for 115 wounded patients when a Reuters journalist visited at the end of January, more than four times its 25-bed capacity.

"Most of our patients have injuries in their upper or lower limbs, they often arrive with wounds that are already infected because of limited facilities on the frontline," Richard Lwandja, a surgeon, said.

AFC/M23 staged a lightning advance early last year and in February 2025 seized Bukavu, the capital of South Kivu, before advancing southward again in December to briefly take Uvira on the border with Burundi.

The rebels withdrew a few days later under pressure from the United States , which brokered a peace accord between Congo and Rwanda in June.

The United Nations and Western powers say Rwanda backs AFC/M23, even exercising command and control over the group, though Rwanda denies this.

The recent fighting has centred on the highlands around Minembwe in Fizi territory, where the army has launched an operation against AFC/M23 and its local ally, the Twirwaneho, a group formed by Congolese Tutsi known as Banyamulenge.

"The highlands around Uvira are highly strategic: whoever controls them has access to major towns in the lowlands," said Regan Miviri, an analyst at the Ebuteli research institute in Kinshasa. "And because the area is so remote, the fighting there draws less attention and less diplomatic pressure."

The government's priority, he said, was to secure Uvira and stop the conflict from extending towards Tanganyika and Katanga, areas that include some of Congo's most important mining centres.

AFC/M23 has framed its presence in South Kivu's highlands as an effort to protect the Banyamulenge, while Kinshasa has accused the coalition of exploiting long-running tensions between communities over land, cattle and local representation.

The escalation in fighting comes as Congo and AFC/M23 agreed in Doha this week to activate a Qatari-mediated ceasefire monitoring mechanism. A U.N. team is expected to deploy to Uvira in the coming days.

At Fizi's hospital, staff say the flow of wounded shows no sign of easing, and they worry they will not be able to cope much longer.

"Roads are often impassable and supplies run out," said Robert Zoubda, a Red Cross nurse. "If this continues, we'll have to install more tents."</description><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 08:42:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/3LL25LCWV5L23NH7XM3XOZUM5U.jpg?auth=b6836a349642d8baa237900f2ee33edf1016c4c7ddc4e92c3a3b6eca7e742ac7&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Exclusive: Scammers' abandoned Cambodia compound exposes brutality and banality of fraud</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/scammers-abandoned-cambodia-compound-exposes-brutality-banality-fraud-2026-02-06/</link><description>O'SMACH, Cambodia, Feb 6 (Reuters) - In a Cambodian compound with rooms designed to look like Singapore and Australia police offices, papers were strewn across desks and floors: the detritus of a fraud factory abandoned in haste.

Among the documents were profiles of a 73-year-old Japanese retiree, complete with his phone number and bank account balance, and an American woman who disclosed that she was a victim of domestic abuse. Nearby were scripts to commit love scams and impersonate police, as well as a room set up to resemble a Vietnamese bank office.

This is what Reuters reporters found on Monday inside a bombed-out compound near the Thai-Cambodian border, which offers one of the clearest windows yet into the industrial-scale fraud that has fleeced billions of dollars from victims globally.

Police raids and military air strikes have forced criminal gangs to flee scores of scam compounds in Cambodia in recent weeks. The visit to the site, known as Royal Hill, was facilitated by the Thai military, which bombed it during a brief border conflict in December and has since occupied the surrounding area.

Reuters is the first news organization to authenticate some of the papers, which document the sophisticated manner in which the scams are carried out.

The news agency verified one of the documents by contacting the Japanese retiree, who said he had received a call late last year from someone claiming to be from an electricity company and who warned his power would be cut off if he did not provide the scammer with his bank details.

The target did not send any money, but disclosed personal information during the call, including details found in the log seen by Reuters. “If the power was cut off, that would be a real problem as I live up in the mountains," he said. "I let (details) slip out without thinking and later thought that was a bad idea."

Reuters could not establish what entity had ultimate control of the Royal Hill compound in Cambodia, where land records are not readily accessible.

Chinese-language documents found at the site outlined that the complex's unidentified management had leased out space to different scamming groups. A person named Zhang who was identified in the documents as a tenant did not respond to calls seeking comment.

The Cambodian government said in a statement on Wednesday that the compound was a hotel that Thailand had occupied by force.

Interior Ministry spokesperson Touch Sokhak separately said in response to questions about Royal Hill that the government "has the will" to crack down on scam centers and repeated a government pledge to eliminate cyber fraud by April.

Southeast Asia has emerged in recent years as an epicenter of the global cyberfraud industry. Compounds which are mostly run by Chinese criminal gangs and staffed partly by trafficking victims living in brutal conditions have proliferated across Cambodia, Laos, the Philippines, and lawless areas of the Myanmar-Thai border.

Many of these countries have been pressured to crack down by foreign governments like the United States, which estimates that Americans lost $10 billion to Southeast Asian scam centers in 2024.

The December strikes by Thailand - whose military said the centers were also being used to stage drone attacks during the border conflict - and a crackdown by the Cambodian government have led to an exodus of more than 100,000 people from compounds across the country.

Many have lined up outside embassies in the capital, Phnom Penh, seeking help and funds to return home in what Amnesty International has called a "humanitarian crisis."

Japan’s National Police Agency and the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok did not respond to requests for comment about the documents that appeared to show their citizens being targeted.

The compound visited by Reuters is located in the border town of O’Smach, which the U.S. State Department's annual Trafficking in Persons Report highlighted in 2024 as a hub for abuses.

Files found in a part of the compound that the Thai military said appeared to be used by the site's managers show the extent to which criminal gangs go to protect their operations.

One document showed how bosses demanded military-style anti-riot and emergency drills, while another included orders to security guards to stop people “loitering” nearby.

A property management notice also barred the use of food delivery services that could bring outsiders on-site. Other documents prohibited unspecified "illegal activity," forbade workers from walking around shirtless, and demanded "civilized" behavior.

Reuters also found financial statements that outlined how the unidentified managers of the scam compound charged tenants several thousands of dollars a month in rent. Some of the criminal gangs were overdue on their rent, the statements show.

The news agency also discovered details about a cryptocurrency wallet in one of the documents. Nick Smart of blockchain-analysis firm Crystal Intelligence, which reviewed the wallet at Reuters' request, said it had interactions with "many known high-risk services," including gambling sites and cash-conversion locations.

At least some of the businesses in Royal Hill faced occasional struggles carrying out fraud, according to one of the documents, an October 2025 entry in a notebook.

That day, workers making calls faced “only abuse and scam answers” from their targets, the note read.

One former worker of another scam compound next to Royal Hill told Reuters that the conditions Reuters observed were reflective of what he experienced.

The worker, a Madagascar citizen who said he was a trafficking victim, spoke on condition of anonymity due to fear of retribution.

He said he was allowed by captors, who he did not identify, to leave the compound a few days after Thailand started bombing the area. The military action prompted the compound's managers to return his passport, which they had seized, he said.

Scammers targeted by raids often relocate and reconstitute themselves into smaller operations, said Delphine Schantz, the regional representative for the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. Her agency shares expertise with national law enforcement agencies.

"We see those scam centers now kind of mushrooming all over the world in different places, along the same model as what we've seen in Southeast Asia," she said.</description><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 08:42:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HSKTK32ZQZLM3OEGGU4O5PXC54.jpg?auth=405232ace5ac16846522e3fe951c1a5d1f88ecb0e27e3af141fe4190115c6a4b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Grieving parents protest at Swiss handling of autopsies for bar fire victims</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/grieving-parents-protest-swiss-handling-autopsies-bar-fire-victims-2026-02-06/</link><description>PULLY, Switzerland, Feb 6 (Reuters) - As the parents of 17-year-old Trystan Pidoux, who died in the bar fire at the Swiss ski resort of Crans-Montana, prepared to bury their son, they waited for prosecutors to act on their request for an autopsy.

When they heard nothing, Vinciane Stucky and Christian Pidoux proceeded with plans to lay to rest their second child, who went to celebrate New Year's Eve at Le Constellation Bar with friends and never returned.

But on the eve of the burial, medics arrived during the mother's last vigil to take his body, forcing the family to cancel it and leave the pre-adorned grave empty, the parents and family lawyer told Reuters.

"It was like they were still stabbing us when we were already dead," said his mother, Stucky, at their home in Pully, Western Switzerland, a short distance from where Trystan was buried three days later on January 16 alongside his best friend.

Prosecutors from the Valais canton declined to respond when approached by Reuters for comment on the family's case, saying they only communicated through press releases.

Due to his family's request, Trystan was one of just a few of the victims - many of them teenagers on holiday - to undergo autopsies and only after Swiss authorities released the bodies, six sources following the case told Reuters.

Some of the relatives of the 41 people who died, and their legal representatives, say the fact prosecutors did not order autopsies of all the victims has shaken their confidence in the investigation.

Switzerland — already grappling with safety concerns over the fire — must now confront growing local and international doubts about its justice system.

The Swiss justice ministry declined comment, directing questions to prosecutors. Officials have stressed that the judiciary is independent and called for patience with the investigation into one of the country's worst modern tragedies.

The Valais prosecutors, who are investigating crimes including negligent homicide , have previously defended their probe, saying they are expanding their team and have ordered searches, secured evidence and seized assets.

Romain Jordan, a lawyer for more than 20 victims' families, said some were now weighing requesting exhumations.

"When my clients recovered their child's body, they believed that everything had been done. It is extremely disturbing and shocking to learn that, in reality, not everything was done and they may now have to exhume their child," he said.

Italy, which has criticised the Swiss investigation , carried out its own post-mortem examinations on the six Italian victims because it had not been done before their bodies were repatriated, a source in Rome's prosecutor's office said.

Autopsies are normally carried out in all cases of violent, suspicious or sudden deaths at the request of prosecutors, according to Swiss forensic institute URMF.

"You have to ask: how did he die? Is it from burns? From smoke? Did people trample him?" said Christian Pidoux, who has since received a preliminary autopsy report via prosecutors but does not yet know exactly how his son died.

The fire - set off by sparklers carried by a bar worker sitting on the shoulders of a colleague - spread within seconds.

Some of the victims were found collapsed next to a locked rear exit, according to police transcripts reviewed by Reuters.

Others were piled together near the main exit, which became a fatal chokepoint, while others died in the basement before they could flee, according to the transcripts and photographs from the case files.

Four people are under investigation, bar owners Jacques and Jessica Moretti and a former and a current local official. The Morettis and the town's mayor, who admitted missed inspections, have expressed regret.

Christophe de Galembert, Pidoux's lawyer, said he had "very strong doubts about whether it will be possible to gather all the evidence now," citing other missed opportunities to secure proof quickly, including only seizing the bar owners' phones nine days after the fire.

But there's a problem. There is no very deep hole, and the stockpile of some 100,000 tons of radioactive waste being stored temporarily at nuclear plants and other sites across the United States keeps getting bigger.

To resolve this quandary, the U.S. administration is now dangling a radioactive carrot.

States are being asked to volunteer to host a permanent geological repository for spent fuel as part of a campus of facilities including new nuclear reactors, waste reprocessing, uranium enrichment and data centers, according to a proposal published by the Department of Energy (DOE) last week.

Its request for information (RFI) marks a big shift in policy. The plan to boost nuclear energy is now combined with a requirement to find a permanent home for waste and puts decisions in the hands of local communities - decisions worth tens of billions of dollars in investment and thousands of jobs, according to a spokesperson for the DOE's Office of Nuclear Energy.

"By combining this all together in a package, it's a matter of big carrots being placed alongside a waste facility which is less desirable," said Lake Barrett, a former official at the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and the DOE. States including Utah and Tennessee have already expressed interest in nuclear energy investments, he said.

The nuclear office said the request had generated interest but did not comment on individual states, which have 60 days to respond. Officials in Utah and Tennessee did not respond to requests for comment.

President Donald Trump wants to quadruple U.S. nuclear power capacity , opens new tab to 400 gigawatts by 2050 as electricity demand surges for the first time in decades thanks to the boom in data centers driving artificial intelligence and the electrification of transport.

In 2025, the DOE picked 11 new advanced nuclear test reactor designs for fast-track licensing and aims to have three pilots built by July 4 this year.

However, public acceptance of nuclear energy hinges partly on the promise of burying nuclear waste deep underground, according to studies by the U.S. and British governments as well as the European Commission.

"A complete nuclear strategy must include safe, durable pathways for final disposition, and that remains a required element of the RFI," the Office of Nuclear Energy spokesperson said.

Previous efforts to find a solution have run into strong local opposition.

The DOE started looking for a permanent waste facility in 1983 and settled on Nevada's Yucca Mountain in 1987. But former President Barack Obama halted funding in 2010 due to opposition from Nevada lawmakers worried about safety and the effect on casinos and hotels - with nearly $15 billion already spent.

To accelerate the deployment of nuclear power, countries including the United States, Britain, Canada, China and Sweden are championing so-called small modular reactors (SMRs).

The appeal of SMRs lies in the idea they can be mostly prefabricated in factories, making them faster and cheaper to assemble than the larger reactors already in use.

But none of the new SMR designs are expected to solve the waste problem. Experts say designers are not compelled to consider waste at inception, beyond a plan for how it will be managed.

"This rush to create new designs without thinking about the full system bodes really poorly for effective regulatory oversight and having a well-run, safe, and reliable waste management program over the long term," said Seth Tuler, associate professor at the Worcester Polytechnic Institute and previously on the U.S. Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board.

Most of the new SMRs are expected to produce similar volumes of waste, or even more, per unit of electricity than today's large reactors, according to a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in 2022.

SMRs can also be sited in areas lacking the infrastructure needed for larger plants, raising the prospect of many more nuclear sites which could become interim waste dumps too. And in the United States, "interim" can mean more than century after a reactor closes, according to the U.S. nuclear power regulator.

Reuters contacted the nine companies behind the 11 SMR designs backed by the DOE's fast-track programme. Some said nuclear waste was an issue for the operators of the reactors, and the government.

Others said they hoped technological advances in the coming decades would improve prospects for reprocessing fuel, although they agreed a permanent repository was still needed.

The prospect of a new wave of nuclear reactors, has rekindled interest in reprocessing spent fuel whereby uranium and plutonium are separated out and, in some instances, reused.

"Modern technologies, particularly advanced recycling and reprocessing, can dramatically shrink the volume of nuclear material requiring disposal," the spokesperson for the nuclear energy office said. "At the same time, reprocessing does not eliminate the requirement for permanent disposal."

Nuclear security experts, however, questioned whether reprocessing would be included in any of the new campuses.

"Every time it's been attempted, it's failed, it creates security and proliferation risks, the costs are enormous, and it complicates waste management," said former DOE official Ross Matzkin-Bridger. He said the few countries reprocessing fuel were recycling between zero to 2%, far below the 90% promised.

For now, most waste in the United States, Canada, Europe, and Britain is stored on site indefinitely, first in spent fuel pools to cool and then in concrete and steel casks. France sends spent fuel to La Hague in Normandy for reprocessing.

The more than 90 nuclear reactors operating in the United States - the world's biggest nuclear power producer ahead of China and France - add about 2,000 tons of waste a year to existing stockpiles, according to the DOE.

Office of Nuclear Energy data shows that as of the end of 2024, U.S. taxpayers have paid utility companies $11.1 billion to compensate them for storing spent fuel, some of which can remain harmful to humans for hundreds of thousands of years.

Scotland's Dounreay site, where the last reactor closed in 1994, has repeatedly extended its decommissioning period and budget due to complications handling waste, according to the British government, in an early sign of the issues the industry faces as older plants shut down.

Vast vaults are being stocked with low-level radioactive waste in large metal containers as Dounreay, once at the cutting edge of Britain's nuclear industry, is dismantled.

Ever since the first commercial nuclear plant went online 70 years ago in England, the consensus has been that burying the most toxic waste deep underground is the safest option but there is still no repository in operation anywhere in the world.

Getting a repository up and running is a slow process. Governments need community buy-in and geological studies are required to determine the flow of groundwater and the stability of the rock up to 1,000 metres (1,090 yards) underground.

Finland has made the most progress and is close to opening the world's first permanent nuclear repository in Olkiluoto - having also kicked off the process way back in 1983.

Posiva, the Finnish company behind the project, began transferring test canisters more than four hundred meters below ground in 2024. It told Reuters its goal is to start commercial operations this year, though it is waiting for the Finnish Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority to approve the operating licence, which will be followed by technical checks.

Once up and running, separate underground tunnels will be filled with canisters made of copper and iron housing the waste, and then sealed forever.

Sweden began constructing its permanent repository in January 2025 , aiming to have it running by the late 2030s. Canada has agreed a site in Ontario which it aims to be operational by the late 2040s. Switzerland and France have chosen sites too and hope to have their repositories open from about 2050. Britain is shooting for the late 2050s, but has yet to settle on a location.

Pending the construction of a permanent repository somewhere in the country, high-level waste from nuclear sites such as Dounreay is sent for storage at Sellafield in England.

Some decommissioned nuclear sites, including Dounreay, are also being promoted as locations for data centers, as they're hooked up to the power grid already and won't need to wait for a connection.

But the clean-up there has a way to go. Irradiated nuclear fuel was flushed into the sea decades ago and a "minor" radioactive fragment was found on a local beach as recently as January.

The last "significant" particle was found in April and fishing is banned within a 2 kilometer (1.25 mile) radius of Dounreay's outlet pipe because of radioactive particles on the seabed.

Last year, Britain extended the time frame for the Dounreay clean-up from 2033 to the 2070s.</description><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 08:43:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/DK3PJ4KAYFET5CNIRSP7P62PCI.jpg?auth=9cc8963a234ff5ba5b163376c422a97fc08178297367379e5bc18eaaf5e866e4&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Norway's security service sees stepped-up Russian espionage in Arctic</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/norways-security-service-sees-stepped-up-russian-espionage-arctic-2026-02-06/</link><description>OSLO, Feb 6 (Reuters) - Russia is expected to step up spying in Norway this year, focusing increasingly on the country's Arctic mainland and the Svalbard archipelago, the Norwegian domestic security service PST said on Friday, also warning of sabotage risks.

Norway, an ally of Ukraine and Europe's top supplier of pipeline gas, has been increasingly concerned that Russian intelligence agencies could target its energy infrastructure, either physically or via cyber attacks.

"We expect Russian intelligence services to increase their activity in Norway in 2026, with a continued focus on military targets and allied exercises, Norway's support for Ukraine, and operations in the High North and the Arctic region," PST said in its annual threat assessment report.

"The northernmost counties and Svalbard are of particular interest and therefore especially exposed to intelligence and influence activities," it added.

PST said Russia is likely to continue surveillance along the rugged Norwegian coastline and mapping its critical infrastructure with the use of civilian vessels.

Norway, a NATO member that shares an Arctic border with Russia, monitors Russian military activity in the North Atlantic and the Kola Peninsula, the base of Russia's Northern Fleet and some two-thirds of Russia's second-strike capability - its ability to answer a nuclear attack with its own.

Last August, PST pinned a cyber attack on a hydropower dam that briefly took control of its operations on Russia-linked hackers, accusing Moscow of becoming a more dangerous threat.

The Russian Embassy in Oslo said such accusations were "unfounded and politically motivated".

PST repeated its warning about such risks on Friday.

"Russian intelligence may see benefit in carrying out sabotage operations on targets in Norway in 2026," it said.

The most likely targets are property and logistics infrastructure associated with support for Ukraine against Russia's 2022 full-scale invasion , but civilian infrastructure may also be affected, it added.

PST also said that Russian services are increasingly trying to recruit Ukrainian refugees in Norway to gather intelligence or carry out sabotage.

Refugees with family or property in Russian‑occupied areas of Ukraine are especially vulnerable to coercion, it added.

With roughly 100,000 Ukrainian refugees in Norway, such recruitment efforts pose "a major challenge", PST said.

There has been a wave of arson, sabotage and cyberattacks in Poland and other European nations since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022.</description><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 08:43:49 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LMBHGC7VT5JEBAIC3MKFA6LJQU.jpg?auth=3ee6b26351950b1f441d4d7d53c31c36c7ef97e0809e049755c0b22083cf6d49&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China says open to communicating with Lithuania after apparent change in Taiwan stance</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/china-says-open-communicating-with-lithuania-after-apparent-change-taiwan-stance-2026-02-06/</link><description>BEIJING, Feb 6 (Reuters) - China said on Friday it was open to dialogue with Lithuania after the Baltic nation's prime minister described as a "mistake" its 2021 decision to let Taiwan set up a de facto embassy in the capital of Vilnius.

Lithuania had begun taking "small first steps" to restore ties, Inga Ruginiene, who became prime minister last September, told Baltic News Service on Tuesday.

"The door for communication between China and Lithuania remains open," Lin Jian, a spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry, told a regular news conference.

"We hope Lithuania will translate its willingness to improve bilateral relations into concrete actions, and promptly rectify its error," he said.

China downgraded relations with Lithuania in late 2021 after the nation of 2.9 million let Taiwan open a "Taiwanese" representative office on its soil.

Beijing views Taiwan as a Chinese province with no right to set up such offices in countries with which China has formal ties.

In contrast to Lithuania, countries such as Australia, Britain and the United States host offices that are usually known as "Taipei" representative offices, which avoids the implication of statehood and sovereignty.

Since the breakdown, Lithuania has recalled its ambassador in China and other diplomats. In late 2024, it expelled three Chinese diplomats in the country's Office of the Charge d'Affaires.

Last year, China banned Lithuanian banks UAB Urbo Bankas and AB Mano Bankas from transactions and cooperation with domestic organisations and individuals.

"I think Lithuania really jumped in front of a train and lost," Ruginiene told the news service in an interview.

Taiwan and Lithuania are important partners with shared values of freedom and democracy, and both sides agreed the name of the office, the foreign ministry in Taipei said on Thursday.

"Since the office was established, Taiwan and the Lithuanian government have continued to promote mutually beneficial, substantive cooperation," it said.

Taiwan would keep up close coordination and communication to deepen ties with Lithuania, it added.</description><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 08:44:10 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CJBCNNXITFPXNCZD72B45JUCRI.jpg?auth=20fb89d28df41f133ce22782aa4cf869f3d9ceb065fdc3c18a1df33f164179fb&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Taiwan to seek extension of arms deals with US amid budget stand-off</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/taiwan-seek-extension-arms-deals-with-us-amid-budget-stand-off-2026-02-06/</link><description>TAIPEI, Feb 6 (Reuters) - Taiwan will seek an extension to the date by which an agreement must be signed with the United States for a batch of weapons deliveries given an ongoing standoff in parliament about defence spending, the island's defence ministry said on Friday.

Taiwan President Lai Ching-te last year proposed a $40 billion special defence budget to counter a rising threat from China, which views the island as its own territory, but the opposition-controlled parliament has instead advanced its own, less expensive proposals which only fund some U.S. weapons.

Taiwan's defence ministry has urged the opposition to approve the spending proposal, warning that any delay could postpone much-needed weapons deliveries, as orders from other countries could move ahead in the queue.

The ministry said it had received from the U.S. government draft Letters of Offer and Acceptance (LOA) price proposals valid until March 15 of this year for TOW anti-tank missiles, Lockheed Martin-made (LMT.N) , opens new tab Javelin anti-armour missiles and M109A7 self-propelled howitzers.

The first instalment must be paid by March 31, but parliament has not sent the government's defence spending proposal to committee for review, it added.

"The Ministry of National Defence will actively seek an extension from the U.S. side for the LOA signing validity period to avoid the entire case being cancelled due to a failure to sign within the deadline," it said.

LOAs are the legal instrument the U.S. government uses to sell weapons abroad.

The ministry said that it has already coordinated with the U.S. on what weapons it wants under the spending plans and confirming key factors such as willingness to sell, production lines, and delivery timelines.

Parliament should complete its review as soon as possible so that the armed forces can "build up capabilities and prepare for combat, deter aggression, and safeguard national security", it added.

Taiwan's main opposition party the Kuomintang (KMT), which sent a delegation to Beijing this week, says it supports defence spending but has a duty to scrutinise the plans and will not sign "blank cheques".

The U.S. says that it supports Taiwan's efforts to boost spending, something the Trump administration has been asking of all U.S. allies.

"As the State Department and AIT have repeatedly stated publicly, and we've made clear to Taiwan counterparts, we welcome Taiwan's announcement of a $40 billion special defence procurement budget," a State Department spokesperson said in a statement to Reuters.

Lang said earlier this week he had been unaware of Epstein’s 2008 sex-offence conviction when they met in around 2012, describing the financier as an acquaintance interested in art and cinema introduced to him by U.S. film-maker Woody Allen.

The 86-year-old former minister, head of the Arab World Institute since 2013, has not been accused of wrongdoing. Lang told BFMTV on Wednesday that Epstein was not a friend, that he knew little about the convicted sex offender, but had found him to be "passionate about art, culture and cinema."

But files released by the U.S. Department of Justice last week raise questions about Lang's characterisation of his relationship with Epstein.

They show Epstein and Lang corresponding intermittently between 2012 and the financier's 2019 death by suicide in jail.

In an email sent by Lang to Epstein on April 7, 2017, nearly a decade after the financier was convicted of soliciting prostitution from an underage girl, he thanked Epstein for a "splendid time" the previous day.

"Your friendship, the amazing pl=ne (sic)m and your extraordinary generosity really touched us," Lang wrote.

Lang, who served multiple terms as culture and education minister between 1981 and 2002, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

A source close to President Emmanuel Macron said the presidency and prime minister's office had asked relevant ministers to summon Lang and encourage him to "think about the institution." The foreign ministry said it had summoned Lang to a meeting on Sunday.

The Arab World Institute is a cultural and research institution that promotes understanding of the Arab world and is located in Paris on the banks of the Seine river.

Lang's name appears over 600 times in the Epstein files, according to a Reuters review of the documents.

"I fear nothing, and I am clean as a whistle," Lang told French radio RTL on Wednesday.

The files dump has heightened scrutiny of Epstein's global connections with public figures, including Britain's A ndrew Mountbatten-Windsor, the younger brother of King Charles, and Peter Mandelson , the former UK ambassador to the United States.

On Monday, Lang's daughter Caroline resigned as head of France's Independent Production Union after her own links to Epstein surfaced.

Both father and daughter deny wrongdoing, with Caroline telling BFMTV on Thursday she only knew about Epstein's 2008 conviction after he told her to look him up on Google in 2014.</description><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 09:44:03 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BMWE2KRGMBKFDIQETZNBZAFMNU.jpg?auth=508d6c3be379e3a4fd35258c3fc98291cdb89cf425603f6fd99e0933aa1afb41&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russian military intel deputy chief wounded in Moscow in apparent assassination attempt</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260206-russian-military-intel-deputy-chief-wounded-moscow-apparent-assassination-attempt</link><description>A senior Russian ⁠officer, Lieutenant General Vladimir Alekseyev, was rushed to hospital after being shot several times in an apartment building in Moscow on Friday, officials ​said, in the latest apparent assassination attempt of a top Russian military figure.

"The victim has been hospitalised," the agency added in a statement.

Several high-ranking military officials have been killed since Moscow launched its full-scale offensive on Ukraine in February 2022.

The most recent officer to be killed was the head of the General Staff's army training directorate, Lieutenant General Fanil Sarvarov, who was killed ‍by a bomb under his car on December 22.

Kyiv has claimed responsibility for some of the assassinations.

A career military officer, Alekseyev is the first deputy chief of the Russian general staff, according to his online biography.

He led intelligence operations during the Russian intervention in Syria to support the now-ousted leader Bashar al-Assad .

And he was also dispatched to negotiate with Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin during his attempted mutiny against Russian military top brass in 2023.

"Investigative actions and operational search measures are being carried out to identify the person or persons involved in committing the aforementioned crime," Investigative Committee spokesperson Svetlana Petrenko said in a statement.

Last month a Russian court sentenced an Uzbek man to life in prison for the 2024 killing of the head of the Russian army's radiological, chemical and biological defence forces.

The general, Igor Kirillov, was killed when a booby-trapped scooter exploded as he left an apartment block in Moscow, in an attack Kyiv said it had orchestrated.</description><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 09:46:26 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/99e9677e-0337-11f1-b954-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-02-05T104232Z-93859066-RC2LFJA46OKU-RTRMADP-3-RUSSIA-CITYSCAPE.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Top Russian general is shot and rushed to hospital in Moscow</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-military-official-hospitalised-after-being-shot-agencies-report-2026-02-06/</link><description>MOSCOW, Feb 6 (Reuters) - A senior Russian military officer, Lieutenant General Vladimir Alexeyev, was rushed to hospital after being shot in Moscow on Friday, investigators said, in the latest of a series of attacks on top military officials.

Alexeyev is deputy head of the GRU, Russia's military intelligence. His boss, Igor Kostyukov, has been leading Russia's delegation in negotiations with Ukraine in Abu Dhabi on security-related aspects of a potential peace deal.

The Moscow prosecutor's office said Alexeyev, who was born in Soviet Ukraine, had been shot several times at a residential building in northwest Moscow by an unknown assailant who fled the scene.

Several senior Russian officers have been assassinated since the start of the war in Ukraine, with Moscow blaming the attacks on Kyiv. In some cases, Ukrainian military intelligence has claimed responsibility.

Since December 2024, three other officials of the same rank as Alexeyev, lieutenant general, have been killed in or near Moscow.

The attacks have angered Russia's influential war bloggers, prompting questions about why such senior people have lacked adequate protection. In at least two cases, the targets were killed right outside their homes.

The head of the General Staff's army training directorate, Lieutenant General Fanil Sarvarov, was killed by a bomb placed under his car on December 22.

Alexeyev was responsible for relations between the Defence Ministry and the Wagner mercenary group, led by Yevgeny Prigozhin, which fought in some of the fiercest battles in the early stages of the war in Ukraine.

Prigozhin was fiercely critical of the defence establishment and staged a mutiny in June 2023, when Alexeyev was one of the top officials sent to negotiate with him. The mutiny fizzled out, and Prigozhin died in a plane crash two months later.</description><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 10:40:22 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/MNBIGQIDVFKRDCA5UUJ77AJXHM.jpg?auth=f1f26e63644ac66851d6fec4d237e6f374dd77a712bbb95c863601bc185f3a65&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US calls for new multilateral arms control agreement following new START expiry</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/trump-has-been-clear-wanting-new-nuclear-arms-control-treaty-says-us-official-2026-02-06/</link><description>GENEVA, Feb 6 (Reuters) - The United States on Friday called for a new arms control agreement after the treaty that set caps on Russian and U.S. strategic nuclear weapons deployments expired on Thursday .

Russia had suggested both sides voluntarily extend the terms of the agreement for a year to provide time to discuss a successor treaty, but U.S. President Donald Trump said in a social media post on Thursday that there should be a new treaty.

U.S. Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security Thomas DiNanno told a Disarmament Conference in Geneva that extending new START - which set limits on the two biggest nuclear powers - would not benefit the U.S. or the world, as it was flawed and did not include China.

"Today, the United States faces threats from multiple nuclear powers. In short, a bilateral treaty with only one nuclear power is simply inappropriate in 2026 and going forward," said DiNanno.

Earlier DiNanno told reporters that Trump had been clear that he wants a new treaty on nuclear arms controls.

Trump, who spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Wednesday, wants China brought into a nuclear reduction deal.

China's ambassador on disarmament, Shen Jian, said on Friday his country would not participate in new negotiations with Moscow and Washington. Previously Beijing has highlighted that it has a fraction of their warhead numbers - an estimated 600, compared to around 4,000 each for Russia and the U.S.

DiNanno told delegates that the U.S. was aware that China had conducted nuclear explosive tests, which it had sought to conceal.

"China remains on track to have over 1,000 nuclear warheads by 2030," DiNanno said, adding that Russia was supporting its buildup.

The Russian ambassador for disarmament in Geneva, Gennady Gatilov, told members that it was regrettable that the U.S. did not follow up on attempts to extend New START, but added that Moscow remains open to discussions.

"Ir there are serious talks about multilateral negotiations on nuclear weapons control or reductions then Russia in principle would be involved in such a process if the UK and France are also involved."</description><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 10:40:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/RGLJLBXRNNOCTABQA6UX3EX6UY.jpg?auth=d922a5c35ca84b9aa4a041a98df6d3168b14f04cc65acbaeee12f47fbb175386&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>More storms coming as Leonardo swells rivers, bursts aquifers in Spain and Portugal</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/land-use-biodiversity/more-storms-coming-leonardo-swells-rivers-bursts-aquifers-spain-portugal-2026-02-06/</link><description>GRAZALEMA, Spain, Feb 6 (Reuters) - Authorities in southern Spain have evacuated residential areas out of fear a major river could overflow and warned of landslides caused by bursting aquifers on Friday after Storm Leonardo swept over the Iberian Peninsula.

Over 7,000 people have been forced to leave their homes in the Andalusia region so far amid a so-called "storm train" in which several consecutive storms have pounded Portugal and Spain with torrential rains and strong winds over the past weeks.

State weather agency AEMET warned that another storm, Marta, would hit the peninsula on Saturday, bringing more abundant rainfall.

Several residential areas near the Guadalquivir riverbed in Cordoba province were evacuated overnight due to the dramatic rise in water levels.

Also evacuated were the approximately 1,500 residents of Grazalema, a mountain village popular with hikers, as water seeped through the walls of houses and cascaded along steep cobbled streets.

Andalusia's regional leader, Juan Manuel Moreno, told radio station SER that aquifers in the Grazalema mountains were full and could provoke landslides due to pent-up pressure.

"This could cause large holes or ditches. If this happens under a house or street, the result could be dramatic," Moreno said.

He added geologists were assessing the situation in Grazalema to determine when residents would be able to return to their homes.

The heavy rains are also impacting the olive harvest. Francisco Elvira, who leads farmers' association COAG in Jaen province, estimated losses worth 200 million euros ($236 million) so far.

In Portugal's second-biggest city Porto, the River Douro overflowed in the early hours on Friday, causing minor flooding at riverside cafe terraces. In the country's south, large parts of the town of Alcacer do Sal by the River Sado remained semi-submerged for the third straight day.

Prime Minister Luis Montenegro said late on Thursday his government had extended a state of calamity in 69 municipalities until mid-February, adding "unprecedented" rainfall and flood risks threatened several regions.

The commander of Portugal's ANEPC civil protection service, Mario Silvestre, said six rivers - including the Tagus - were at risk of significant flooding.

The Tagus river basin was placed on red alert on Thursday due to the abrupt rise in water flow.

Pandji Pragiwaksono's show appeared on Netflix on December 27 and included satirical comments on Indonesian politics and democracy, including the 2024 election.

The election was won by former military general Prabowo Subianto, who has now become president of the world's most populous Muslim-majority country.

Pragiwaksono also criticised Indonesia's two largest Muslim organisations, Nahdlatul Ulama and Muhammadiyah, for receiving a mining concession from the government when Joko Widodo, known as Jokowi, was still president. Jokowi's son was Prabowo's running mate, and went on to become vice president.

The nearly two-and-a-half-hour show has divided opinion in Indonesia. Some have accused the comedian of insulting religious entities and state institutions, while democracy activists have defended him.

"Yes, today we are clarifying several things based on five police reports," Andaru Rahutomo, spokesperson for Jakarta police, told Reuters, confirming that Pragiwaksono was in their custody. Pragiwaksono has not been formally charged.

Two of the five police reports were filed by members of the youth wings of Nahdlatul Ulama and Muhammadiyah, complaining that the comedian had committed blasphemy and defamed their organisations.

Both organisations denied affiliation with the people who filed the police reports.

"We came here for clarification... He (Pragiwaksono) is already here, perhaps he can share his version of the story with the police," Haris Azhar, Pragiwaksono's lawyer, said before the hour-long interrogation began.</description><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 10:41:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/2IPLA3SAZ5OCFBRSMEZH4EHVHY.jpg?auth=63d6b8ad97707fb982c9de918bac28ffdf3ed205ee5313590cde00861af74aa0&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UN Security Council to exempt sanctions on humanitarian aid for North Korea, source says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/un-security-council-exempt-sanctions-humanitarian-aid-north-korea-source-says-2026-02-06/</link><description>SEOUL, Feb 6 (Reuters) - A United Nations committee has approved exemptions from wide-reaching sanctions against North Korea to allow fresh humanitarian aid to reach the country, a diplomatic source said on Friday, amid a push by Seoul and Washington to engage Pyongyang.

The members of the UN Security Council Sanctions Committee on North Korea unanimously agreed on Thursday to exempt sanctions on 17 humanitarian projects for North Korea, the source told Reuters on the condition of anonymity as the person was not authorized to speak publicly.

There has not been an official announcement yet by the Security Council or the sanctions committee. The U.N. could not be immediately reached for comment.

The projects, all of which are undertaken by international bodies like UNICEF and non-government organisations based in South Korea, the United States and other countries, had been pending since the first half of 2025, the source said.

The U.N. Security Council adopted Resolution 1718 in 2006 following North Korea's sixth nuclear test in violation of earlier sanctions, banning the transfer of arms, fuel and other items that had been included in the aid packages.

North Korea has labelled U.N. and other international sanctions against it as signs of hostility orchestrated by the United States that infringed on its sovereign right to develop nuclear arms and ballistic missiles.

South Korea's DongA Ilbo newspaper reported , opens new tab U.S. President Donald Trump gave his approval for backing the exemption, which required unanimous agreement in the committee where the United States is a member.

Kim has remained silent despite overtures by Trump and South Korea to resume dialogue, instead pushing ahead with arms development and solidifying ties with Russia and China.</description><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 10:42:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/TYWFW5MWX5JSZAB3O726PQ6XSU.jpg?auth=06f821d3581c3fdc2095e15c33a3792bcff96dc383c9de46c9cfff7fe9438554&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Brazil signals new openness to Mercosur-China talks as Beijing seeks deeper ties</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/brazil-signals-new-openness-mercosur-china-talks-beijing-seeks-deeper-ties-2026-02-06/</link><description>BRASILIA/MONTEVIDEO, Feb 6 (Reuters) - Brazil is considering pushing for a partial trade agreement between the Mercosur bloc and China for the first time, senior Brazilian government officials said, in what would be a major shift for Latin America's largest economy.

Brazil has long vetoed formal negotiations with Beijing to protect domestic manufacturers from a surge in Chinese imports. But as Beijing has sought deeper commercial ties and Washington has imposed waves of tariffs, the government of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva is now reconsidering that stance.

A joint statement issued during Uruguayan President Yamandu Orsi's visit to Beijing to meet with President Xi Jinping this week said they hoped free trade negotiations between China and Mercosur could begin "as soon as possible." Mercosur includes Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay, with Bolivia poised to become a full member.

While a formal, comprehensive trade pact remains distant, two Brazilian government officials said a partial Mercosur-China deal is now viewed as a plausible longer-term outcome, spurred by U.S. tariffs on goods from trading partners that have disrupted global commerce and reshaped trade alliances.

China's foreign and commerce ministries did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Brazil's evolving stance reflects what one of the officials, who asked not to be identified due to the sensitivity of the talks, called a "new global scenario."

"We have to diversify our partners," the official said. "China has the advantage that we can work with a partial agreement, only in some tariff lines," the official added.

Another Brazilian official directly involved in internal Mercosur negotiations said the bloc could advance on non-tariff barriers such as import quotas, customs procedures and health and safety regulations, which alone would create meaningful openings in the Chinese market.

The official said it was too early to specify which business sectors might be discussed, describing the issue as "highly complex."

Brazil has previously been wary of a broader pact out of concern that China's vast industrial output could overwhelm domestic manufacturers.

Chinese investment in production in Brazil has, however, grown in recent years - an expansion Brasilia is keen to maintain.

U.S. President Donald Trump's economic policies, which have included pressuring Latin American governments to curb ties with China, are likely pushing Beijing to tie down new trade agreements in the region, said Ignacio Bartesaghi, a foreign policy expert at the Catholic University of Uruguay.

"There is a new dynamic in the region when it comes to commerce that Trump is primarily driving," Bartesaghi said.

"Ideas that before seemed entirely stuck, could now advance," he added.

However, any Mercosur deal would require consensus from all its members, raising a number of significant challenges.

Paraguay is one of just 12 countries worldwide that maintain formal diplomatic relations with Chinese‑claimed Taiwan , a factor that complicates - though does not necessarily rule out - any agreement with Beijing, the Brazilian officials said.

Paraguay imported goods from China worth $6.12 billion in 2025 and has been included in Mercosur-China discussions, signaling that dialogue remains possible. Paraguayan President Santiago Pena has said he does not oppose a Mercosur-China pact, provided Paraguay's right to maintain diplomatic ties with Taiwan is respected.

"If there is one bloc today that can negotiate with any country or bloc, it is Mercosur," Pena said in a July interview with Argentine media.

Argentina, Latin America's third-largest economy, could also make it difficult to reach a consensus. It has moved closer to Washington under President Javier Milei, who took office in 2023. Milei has prioritized strengthening U.S. ties, including a $20 billion currency swap framework with the U.S. Treasury.

China remains a key creditor and major buyer of Argentina's agricultural exports.

But Buenos Aires could be reluctant to support China‑led talks within Mercosur, at least in the near term, experts such as Bartesaghi said, particularly if such talks could undermine Milei's efforts to secure U.S. backing for economic reforms and financing.

Argentina's foreign ministry said it would not comment on "hypotheticals" when asked by Reuters about Mercosur-China talks.

"Argentina maintains cordial relations with China - they're just not very visible," said Florencia Rubiolo, director of Argentine think tank Insight 21.

Elevating ties through a Mercosur-wide agreement would bring that relationship into clearer view, she said.

"If this is about diplomatic gestures, it seems unlikely the government would support such an agreement," she added.</description><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 10:42:10 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Several killed in Islamabad mosque explosion, say police</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/explosion-rocks-shiite-muslim-mosque-islamabad-casualties-feared-say-police-2026-02-06/</link><description>ISLAMABAD, Feb 6 (Reuters) - A suicide bomber killed at least 12 people during Friday prayers in a Shi'ite Muslim mosque in Pakistan's capital city of Islamabad, two police officials said.

Images from the site showed bloodied bodies lying on the carpeted mosque floor surrounded by shards of glass, debris and panicked worshippers.

Dozens more wounded were lying in the garden outside the mosque as people called for help. Bombings are rare in the heavily-guarded capital, although Pakistan has been hit by a rising wave of militancy in the past few years.

The explosion hit the mosque during Friday prayers, police official Zafar Iqbal said. "I can't say how many are dead at this moment, but yes, people have died."

Two police officials said the attacker was stopped at the gate of the mosque before detonating the bomb. They asked not to be identified as they were not authorised to speak to the media.

A suicide bombing on November 11 killed 12 people in Islamabad and wounded 27 others in an attack Pakistan said was carried out by an Afghan national. No group claimed responsibility for the attack.

Shi'ites, who are in the minority in the predominantly Sunni Muslim nation of 241 million, have been targeted in sectarian violence in the past, including by the Sunni Islamist militant group Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, which considers them heretics.</description><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 10:42:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>France's former culture minister Jack Lang summoned over Epstein links</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260206-france-former-culture-minister-jack-lang-summoned-over-epstein-links</link><description>Pressure rose on Friday on former French culture minister Jack Lang to resign as president of Paris's Arab World Institute over his ties to late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein , after ​the foreign ministry summoned him to discuss the matter.

Lang, ​who served multiple terms as culture and education minister between 1981 and 2002, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

A source close to President Emmanuel Macron said the presidency and prime minister's ‌office had asked relevant ministers to summon Lang and encourage him to "think about the institution". The foreign ministry said it had summoned Lang to a meeting on Sunday.

The Arab World Institute is a ‍cultural and research institution that promotes understanding of the Arab world and is located in Paris on the banks of the Seine river.

Lang's name appears over 600 times in the Epstein files, according to a Reuters review of the documents.

"I fear nothing, and I am clean as a whistle," Lang told French radio RTL on Wednesday.

The files dump has heightened scrutiny of Epstein's global connections with public figures, including Britain's Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, the younger brother of King Charles, and Peter Mandelson , the former UK ambassador to the United States.

On Monday, ‍Lang's daughter Caroline resigned as head of France's Independent Production Union after her own links to Epstein surfaced.

Caroline Lang told French investigative website Mediapart that she and Epstein had agreed to set up a company together to buy artworks but she did not invest any money in it.

Both father and daughter deny wrongdoing, with ‌Caroline telling BFMTV on Thursday ​she only knew about Epstein's 2008 conviction after he told her to look him up on Google in 2014.</description><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 10:43:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/5c9338ce-0336-11f1-8aba-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/000-94XA2WE-1.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Who from France's political and cultural elite are named in the Epstein files?</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260206-who-from-france-political-cultural-elite-named-epstein-files</link><description>Several French personalities have been mentioned in the latest trove of files to be released from the probe into late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein .

A mere mention in the documents in no way implies any wrongdoing.

But one French film producer has resigned after allegations she owned shares in a company with Epstein.

Others – who appear to have been in touch with Epstein after he pleaded guilty in 2008 to procuring a child for prostitution and served 13 months of an 18-month sentence – have said they had no idea about his history and were in no way involved in any crime.

Here are some of them:

Fresh documents released by the US Justice Department last week contained emails between prominent figures and the disgraced financier, who was found dead in prison in 2019 while in prison facing charges of sex trafficking underage girls. His death was ruled a suicide .

Some have revealed warm relations, financial dealings and private images.

An AFP review of part of the emails showed former high-profile French culture minister Jack Lang, now 86, once tried to sell Epstein a friend's property in the Moroccan region of Marrakesh.

"He prefers that we speak about it directly," an email screenshot shows him as having written in March 2015, then quoting the price as "5,400,000 euros, offshore".

Lang, who spent nearly 20 years as culture minister and education minister in different governments, on Wednesday said he would not step down from his current position as president of the Paris-based Arab World Institute.

A source close to President Emmanuel Macron said on Friday that the presidency and prime minister's ‌office had asked relevant ministers to summon Lang and encourage him to "think about the institution". The foreign ministry said it had summoned Lang to a meeting on Sunday.

Lang said on Monday that he first met Epstein through acclaimed US filmmaker Woody Allen – who never shook allegations that he molested his adopted daughter in 1992 – "about 15 years ago".

He said he was "completely shocked" when he discovered Epstein's crimes.

But his daughter Caroline Lang, a film producer, resigned on Monday as head of the Independent Production Union.

French investigative website Mediapart reported earlier in the day that Epstein had in 2016 founded a company based in the US Virgin Islands, half of whose shares were owned by Caroline Lang.

She said Epstein was an "acquaintance" and a "generous sponsor", and they had planned to set up a fund to buy artworks, but that she had not received any money from the fund.

Frederic Chaslin, an orchestra conductor who is now 63, in an email dated September 2013 told Epstein he had found him a girl.

"I found a great girl for your next stay in Paris. Student in philosophy. 21," he wrote, then adding in a second email she was "of course perfectly fluent" in French, English and Spanish.

But Chaslin has categorically refuted as false what he called "insinuations" he was associated to Epstein's crimes.

"He had asked me to recommend an interpreter to accompany him on visits to Parisian museums," he wrote on Facebook earlier this week.

Businessman Olivier Colom, an adviser from 2007 to 2012 to right-wing president Nicolas Sarkozy , regularly corresponded with Epstein from 2013 to 2018 when the Frenchman was working at a bank.

Colom sought to facilitate political networking and organised a 2013 meeting between his boss at the bank and Epstein. But in more personal conversations, they at times joked in a sexist or racist tone. Epstein in one exchange in June 2013 compared women to "shrimp", saying "you throw away the head and keep the body".

AFP was not immediately able to reach Colom, 56, for comment.

An initial search of the new archive showed no direct correspondence between Epstein and Sarkozy.

Michel Hazanavicius met Epstein for the first time a month after his film "The Artist" was awarded at the Oscars in 2012, at a dinner that the financier held in March that year in Paris , also attended by film director Allen, according to email exchanges in the files seen by AFP.

They corresponded directly until January 2014. In these emails, Epstein suggested they meet up in Paris or New York , but the director often said he was too busy.

Hazanavicius told AFP he "twice met the guy", who he said was introduced as a friend of Allen.

But his partner, "The Artist" female lead Berenice Bejo, soon advised him to stay away.

"At one point he asked me if I knew a nice, smart girl – and that's when Berenice told me 'never again, you have to run away from that guy'," he said.

They decided not to see him again – though he had "no idea who he was", Hazanavicius added.</description><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 10:43:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/ec332998-006c-11f1-a38a-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26032807748579.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Family pleas for information on news anchor's missing mother in case gripping US</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260206-family-of-us-news-anchor-s-missing-mother-pleas-with-kidnappers-to-contact-them</link><description>The family of the kidnapped mother of a top US TV news anchor made a new plea for information from her captors on Thursday, after investigators said they believed the 84-year-old was still alive.

Nancy Guthrie, mother of NBC News "Today" co-host Savannah Guthrie, is believed to have been kidnapped from her home in Tucson, Arizona, some time on Saturday night or Sunday morning, sparking a massive hunt in a case that has gripped America.

"Whoever is out there holding our mother, we want to hear from you," the missing woman's son, Camron Guthrie, said in a video posted on Instagram.

"We haven't heard anything directly. We need you to reach out and we need a way to communicate with you so we can move forward. But first we have to know that you have our mom."

Savannah Guthrie had tearfully pleaded with kidnappers to share proof of life earlier this week.

The family's renewed call came after the FBI disclosed that a first deadline of 5pm on Thursday was made in a ransom letter, without providing a time zone.

FBI Special Agent in Charge Heith Janke told a press conference that a second demand of a payment by Monday was given in the letter.

"If a transfer wasn't made, I think a second demand was for next Monday," he said, declining to provide any information about what was threatened if the deadline was not met.

"The ransom note that was sent out there ... every lead in this case we are taking extremely serious," Janke added, saying the letter called for an undisclosed amount of money.

Authorities have made one arrest over a fake ransom demand, Janke said.

Nancy Guthrie's disappearance has garnered wall-to-wall coverage in US media, with dozens of reporters and camera crews descending on the quiet Arizona suburb where she lives.

Authorities said they believed the missing woman was still alive, and said blood discovered on her doorstep belonged to her.

"Right now, we believe Nancy is still out there. We want her home," Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos told reporters on Thursday.

But law enforcement was no closer to finding out who was responsible for the woman's abduction.

"Everybody's still a suspect in our eyes," Nanos said.

The FBI's Janke called on whoever was responsible to hand themselves in or establish communication with the family.

"In a normal case there would be contact by now," he said.

Action taken on any proposed ransom would be "taken by the family" only, he added.

President Donald Trump said Wednesday he had ordered "ALL Federal Law Enforcement to be at the family's, and Local Law Enforcement's, complete disposal, IMMEDIATELY."

On Thursday, his press spokeswoman said Trump spoke to Savannah Guthrie and told her "the federal government is here to help".

Nanos – who earlier this week said he was not used to the kind of national scrutiny that comes with a case like this – gave the first detailed timeline of events after Guthrie was dropped off at her home at 9:48pm Saturday.

At "that time we assume that Nancy's home and going to bed," he said.

"At 1:47am the doorbell camera disconnects.

"2:12am, software detects a person on a camera, but there's no video available.

"2:28am, Nancy's pacemaker app shows that it was a disconnect from the phone."

At that point, the trail went cold, Nanos said.

Janke announced a $50,000 reward for information leading to Guthrie's rescue or the arrest of those responsible for her disappearance. He said FBI Director Kash Patel was receiving updates on the case.

Nanos said time was of the essence.

"She is in need of daily medication," he said.

"It's day four or five, and we don't know that she's getting her medication."

"That could, in itself, prove fatal."</description><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 10:43:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/c010d93c-0323-11f1-a92f-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/1af4280ff67532fa61a48b70fb03221cd9e8ec69.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Death toll in Pakistan's Islamabad mosque suicide bombing rises to 31</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/death-toll-pakistans-islamabad-mosque-suicide-bombing-rises-31-2026-02-06/</link><description>ISLAMABAD, Feb 6 (Reuters) - At least 31 people were killed and 169 wounded in a suicide bombing at a Shi'ite Muslim mosque in Pakistan's capital city of Islamabad on Friday, a government official said.

Economy Minister Luis Caputo acknowledged that the departure of INDEC head Marco Lavagna stemmed from a disagreement over the Milei government's decision to delay an update to the methodology used to calculate inflation - a sensitive move in a country scarred by past data manipulation scandals.

Argentina was reprimanded by the International Monetary Fund in 2013 for under-reporting its numbers.

Opposition lawmakers seized on Lavagna's resignation to accuse the government of trying to protect Milei’s political standing.

“It’s a trick,” congresswoman Julia Strada told Reuters, saying reducing inflation has been Milei’s "primary tool" to boost popularity.

Lavagna's resignation set off a broader debate over trust and transparency just as Milei touts a dramatic reduction of what was once double‑digit level monthly inflation to now under 3%.

While the INDEC chief is appointed by the executive branch, the role has traditionally operated without political interference, making the incident a red flag, according to Marcelo Garcia of consultancy Horizon Engage.

“What surprises me was how vehemently obvious the government was in saying he resigned because the president did not agree with a policy that this institute, which should be autonomous to make these professional decisions, was launching,” Garcia said.

Milei has pledged to bring monthly inflation below 1% by August.

The INDEC previously said the new methodology would be implemented for January's data. The current methodology is based on a 2004 household spending survey.

Caputo told a local radio station the vision with Milei was to not implement the change "until the process of disinflation has been consolidated." He did not provide a new timeline.

Five market sources told Reuters that the updated formula would likely have shown at least a slightly higher inflation rate.

Argentina's economy ministry declined to comment.

The credibility of Argentina’s official inflation data was dented under the leftist Peronist government of former President Nestor Kirchner and his wife and former President Cristina Kirchner, when authorities were accused of systematically understating price growth.

The controversy began in 2007, after Nestor Kirchner replaced staff at INDEC. In subsequent years, official inflation readings were often less than half those estimated by private economists. That meant Argentina was paying less interest on inflation‑linked bonds.

The distorted data scared off foreign investors and complicated Argentina’s return to international credit markets after its 2001 default.

“Not only did investors lose their compass of what was happening in Argentina but they were scammed,” said Aldo Abram of local think tank Liberty and Progress Foundation.

Today, government inflation figures generally align with independent economists' forecasts.

Argentina is notorious for cycles of high inflation, which in the past drove people to spend their pesos before they lost value amid often-daily price fluctuations.

While Milei has been applauded by investors and the IMF for taming inflation, the true economic indicator for some Argentines is how far their pesos stretch.

Ailen Menta, 31, who works at an insurance brokerage, said that her purchasing power has declined under Milei.

Half of her income goes toward rent now, up from about 30% previously, since his administration slashed rent controls. (Many other renters, however, have seen a decline in prices since landlords have not needed to set high initial rents to counter inflation risk.)

Lavagna’s resignation plunged her trust in the statistics agency to “zero.”

“There’s something that the government doesn’t want us to know,” Menta said.

Many people are still feeling the pain from a sharp surge in inflation, driven by a devaluation of the peso, and Milei's cuts to gas and electricity subsidies in 2024, according to economist Laura Caullo.

The situation stabilized in 2025, "but no one returns to you what you lost before,” Caullo said.

The shakeup at the INDEC, though, hasn't rattled Milei's staunch supporters, who have cheered him for stabilizing the economy.

"I'm calm," said Roberto Colliard, 58, a pharmacy worker. "In a few days the markets will recover, everything will continue as normal and we're going to forget about this."</description><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 11:36:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KJPTHH3GAZNQTLM44KUQRF6QKI.jpg?auth=0eeff6f72fa81b3c3330d103a88b5d5779321ad1ae28fc9add3867853988fa6f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Turkey edges towards curbing social media access to minors amid global push</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/society-equity/turkey-edges-towards-curbing-social-media-access-minors-amid-global-push-2026-02-06/</link><description>ISTANBUL, Feb 6 (Reuters) - Turkey is laying the groundwork to restrict social media access for minors with a parliamentary report this week calling for broad measures including age verification and content filtering, joining a growing list of countries seeking tighter controls.

President Tayyip Erdogan's ruling AK Party is expected to submit a draft law on the issue soon and Family and Social Services Minister Mahinur Ozdemir Goktas told reporters after a cabinet meeting last month that the bill would include a social media ban for minors and compel service providers to build content-filtering systems.

The wide-ranging recommendations in this week's commission report also include the removal of content without notice and the monitoring of kids' video games or toys with AI functionality for harmful content.

Australia in December the world's first country to ban social media for children under 16, blocking them from platforms including TikTok, Alphabet's GOOGL.O , opens new tab YouTube and Meta's META.O , opens new tab Instagram and Facebook.

Spain wants to prohibit social media for under-16s, while Greece and Slovenia are working on a similar ban amid mounting concerns over its impact on children's health and safety. France, Britain and Germany are also considering restrictions for minors.

The Turkish parliamentary report further recommends night-time internet restrictions for devices used by minors under 18, mandatory content filtration on social media until aged 18 and a social media ban until aged 16.

"We need to protect our kids from moral erosion. We aim to protect our children from all types of addictions, including digital ones," Harun Mertoglu, senior AKP lawmaker and a member of parliament's human rights enquiry committee, told Reuters.

Some parents echo the sentiment. Shopkeeper Belma Kececioglu said her 10-year-old spends hours on social media and playing games.

"It is like all the kids are social media addicts. We are already troubled by this and it gets even worse with harmful content," Kececioglu said, as her son played a game on his phone after school.

Social media companies have warned that bans on minors risk being undermined by weak age‑verification technology and could push children onto unregulated platforms.

Turkey already regulates social media companies heavily and is quick to impose takedowns and access bans. It currently bans access to 1.2 million web pages and social media posts as of end-2024, according to a report by local censorship watchdog IFOD.

Current regulations require companies to process official or user requests within two days, leaving little room for due process, and compel operators to conform to almost all takedown requests. Social media companies that don't conform to regulations may face advertisement bans, bandwidth reduction and fines up to 3% of global revenues.

The U.S. State Department said last week that several federal agencies, including ICE, would help protect the visiting Americans, a decision that immediately triggered protests in Milan.

On Friday, Italian authorities ordered schools in central Milan to remain shut and they blocked access to some areas of the city to bolster security around the ceremony and ease traffic disruptions.

Protesters - mostly students with signs reading "ICE out" - assembled in Piazzale Leonardo da Vinci, in front of a building of the Politecnico University in the eastern part of the city.

A banner criticising the presence of ICE, U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio was carried at the front of the march.

They also oppose shutting down parts of the city for what they see as an unsustainable Olympics while housing prices remain unaffordable and social spaces are scarce.

People will have to prove that they have moved to the centres, or risk losing their benefits, and also agree to travel restrictions, Migration Minister Johan Forssell told reporters.

Successive governments have tightened immigration policies since 2015 when around 160,000 asylum seekers sought refuge in Sweden. The issue has driven the rise of anti-immigration parties across Europe and is likely to be a key factor in Sweden's parliamentary elections in September.

"People who are in the system will have to live with the Migration Agency ... I want to stress that these aren't prisons," Forssell said.

He said the current law, which allows asylum seekers to choose their own living arrangements, had led to problems with overcrowding, social exclusion and made it easier for people to stay in Sweden illegally.

The number of asylum applications had dropped to around 10,000 by 2024.

But the current minority coalition, backed by the anti-immigration Sweden Democrats, says even more needs to be done to cut numbers coming to Sweden.

It has blamed decades of what it sees as unrestricted immigration for a surge in gang crime in recent years.

Under the new proposal, which the government hopes will come into force in October, asylum seekers who fail to comply could also have their applications automatically withdrawn.

People whose cases have been rejected would also have to register their whereabouts on a regular basis to prevent them going underground.</description><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 11:38:16 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/EELNIXXFQVKJ5CKZQVNZ2RJE5U.jpg?auth=9b5d298c7000688c321b7451784d501502e9fa3a7c8db9cab0e41666676500cb&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>In Argentina, inflation data row kindles fears of political meddling</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/argentina-inflation-data-row-kindles-fears-political-meddling-2026-02-06/</link><description>BUENOS AIRES, Feb 6 (Reuters) - Argentina’s inflation data has become a political flashpoint after the abrupt resignation this week of the head of the national statistics agency exposed tensions at the heart of President Javier Milei’s economic strategy.

"We need to protect our kids from moral erosion. We aim to protect our children from all types of addictions, including digital ones," Harun Mertoglu, senior AKP lawmaker and a member of parliament's human rights enquiry committee, told Reuters.

Some parents echo the sentiment. Shopkeeper Belma Kececioglu said her 10-year-old spends hours on social media and playing games.

"It is like all the kids are social media addicts. We are already troubled by this and it gets even worse with harmful content," Kececioglu said, as her son played a game on his phone after school.

Social media companies have warned that bans on minors risk being undermined by weak age‑verification technology and could push children onto unregulated platforms.

Turkey already regulates social media companies heavily and is quick to impose takedowns and access bans. It currently bans access to 1.2 million web pages and social media posts as of end-2024, according to a report by local censorship watchdog IFOD.

Current regulations require companies to process official or user requests within two days, leaving little room for due process, and compel operators to conform to almost all takedown requests. Social media companies that don't conform to regulations may face advertisement bans, bandwidth reduction and fines up to 3% of global revenues.

The U.S. State Department said last week that several federal agencies, including ICE, would help protect the visiting Americans, a decision that immediately triggered protests in Milan.

On Friday, Italian authorities ordered schools in central Milan to remain shut and they blocked access to some areas of the city to bolster security around the ceremony and ease traffic disruptions.

Protesters - mostly students with signs reading "ICE out" - assembled in Piazzale Leonardo da Vinci, in front of a building of the Politecnico University in the eastern part of the city.

A banner criticising the presence of ICE, U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio was carried at the front of the march.

They also oppose shutting down parts of the city for what they see as an unsustainable Olympics while housing prices remain unaffordable and social spaces are scarce.

On Thursday morning, environmental group Greenpeace staged a protest in front of the cathedral, protesting the role of Italian oil major Eni (ENI.MI) , opens new tab as a sponsor of the Games.

Later on Friday a torchlit march organised by the Committee Against the Olympics is expected in an area close to the site of the opening ceremony.</description><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 11:39:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/26VZW5ZA4JKTDIMTAZFTE4EUZU.jpg?auth=b73b007de6b5983519da83377228166f20a6fea07917a1ef8ed4cf932774d01c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Kremlin says it hopes US-Iran talks in Oman will yield results</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/kremlin-says-it-hopes-us-iran-talks-oman-will-yield-results-2026-02-06/</link><description>MOSCOW, Feb 6 (Reuters) - The Kremlin said on Friday that it hoped that negotiations between Iran and the United States in Oman would yield results and lead to a de-escalation and urged all sides to show restraint in the meantime.

The release of an enormous cache of new files last week has revealed a host of new Epstein connections with politicians, royals and the ultra-rich.

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer's future is looking increasingly uncertain over his decision last year to name Peter Mandelson, who had a close friendship with Epstein, as ambassador to Washington.

The king's brother, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, had already been forced to relinquish his royal title and lavish residence, and pressure is now growing on him to testify in the U.S.

In Slovakia, Prime Minister Robert Fico's national security adviser has resigned after emails were revealed in which he discussed young women with Epstein.

And former French culture minister Jack Lang is being urged to resign as president of the Arab World Institute.

But Norway, home of the Nobel Peace Prize and often a fulcrum of international diplomacy, seems to have more than its share of fallout.

Public figures including Crown Princess Mette-Marit and former prime minister and foreign minister Thorbjoern Jagland are all under fresh scrutiny.

So are former foreign minister Boerge Brende , now leader of the World Economic Forum; Mona Juul, ambassador to Jordan and Iraq; and her husband Terje Roed-Larsen.

Jagland is also a former chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee. Juul and Roed-Larsen helped set up the secret channel for contacts between the Palestine Liberation Organization and the Israeli government that led to the 1993-1995 Oslo Accords.

All were known to have had ties to Epstein, but the new files have offered much more detail.

A majority of parties in Norway's parliament appear ready to support an independent inquiry into the foreign ministry, Norwegian media reported.

Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere prefers that parliament's highest control organ, the standing committee on Scrutiny and Constitutional Affairs, rather than an independent group, conducts the probe, daily VG reported on Friday.

Norway's economic crime police unit said on Thursday it was investigating Jagland on suspicion of aggravated corruption. Jagland's lawyer said his client was confident of demonstrating his innocence and would cooperate.

The foreign ministry said it would seek to lift the diplomatic immunity Jagland enjoys as ex-head of the Council of Europe, from 2009 to 2019.

The Council of Europe said it had conducted an internal inquiry into the matter in December 2025 and January 2026, prompted by Epstein files released in November.

"We are closely following new developments and further action will be decided as needed," said a spokesperson.

Neither Roed-Larsen nor Juul immediately answered requests for comment sent respectively to his lawyer and the ministry, which has suspended Juul while she addresses an internal probe.

Brende has said he was unaware of Epstein's past and criminal activities before first meeting him in 2018, and that he regrets not having investigated him more thoroughly.

The files published by the U.S. Justice Department showed extensive email correspondence between Epstein and the Norwegian crown princess, even after he was found guilty of child sex crimes in 2008. Mette-Marit has apologised.

Norway's royal family is already dealing with several challenges. Marius, Mette-Marit's son from a relationship predating her marriage to Crown Prince Haakon, is currently on trial for rape and domestic violence.</description><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 13:02:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/SDJFIQCZXBPC7IJ4BZGZESDUMU.jpg?auth=033ef687ca237f4aa9506cceb3634cf860083f95750161c1da2a9cc5c5941afa&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US animal rights activist can be extradited from UK over 2003 bombings</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/us-animal-rights-activist-can-be-extradited-uk-over-2003-bombings-2026-02-06/</link><description>LONDON, Feb 6 (Reuters) - An alleged animal rights extremist can be extradited from Britain to the U.S. to stand trial over bombings linked to animal testing more than two decades ago, a London court ruled on Friday.

U.S. citizen Daniel San Diego, 47, is accused in relation to bombings in California in 2003, with the so-called Revolutionary Cells of the Animal Liberation Brigade claiming responsibility. No one was injured in either of the incidents.

San Diego was found in Wales in November 2024, having been on the FBI's most-wanted terrorist list since 2009 – the first domestic terrorist on the list, alongside the likes of late al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.

His lawyers argued last year that he could not receive a fair trial if extradited, citing "the political capture of the criminal justice system" and the U.S. Department of Justice under President Donald Trump.

Judge Samuel Goozee ruled San Diego could be extradited, saying in his ruling there was "no evidence of any improper political involvement in (San Diego's) case or any evidence of any presidential interference in (San Diego's) case, now or in the future".

The first bombing San Diego is charged with targeted biotechnology firm Chiron Inc. near Oakland, California, in August 2003. Authorities responding to the blast found a second bomb, which the FBI said may have targeted first responders.

The Animal Liberation Brigade said in a statement at the time: "This is the endgame for the animal killers and if you choose to stand with them you will be dealt with accordingly."

A month later, a nail bomb detonated outside nutritional products company Shaklee, in an attack also claimed by the Animal Liberation Brigade.

Lawyers representing U.S. authorities said the companies targeted had links to British firm Huntingdon Life Sciences, which was long the focus of both lawful and criminal protests for testing pharmaceuticals, chemicals and dyes on animals.</description><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 13:02:49 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>EU tells TikTok to change 'addictive' design or risk heavy fines</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260206-eu-tells-tiktok-to-change-addictive-design-or-risk-heavy-fines</link><description>The EU said Friday that it had told TikTok it needs to change its "addictive design" or risk heavy fines, after the Chinese-owned platform was found in breach of the bloc's digital content rules.

The European Commission , announcing preliminary conclusions of a probe opened two years ago, said it found TikTok was not taking effective steps to address negative impacts from some of its features, especially for young people and children.

It said TikTok was believed to be "in breach of the Digital Services Act for its addictive design", including through features such as infinite scroll, autoplay, push notifications, and a highly personalised recommender system.

The commission said its probe so far indicated that TikTok did too little to "assess how these addictive features could harm the physical and mental wellbeing of its users, including minors and vulnerable adults".

To address the concerns – and avoid the risk of hefty fines – EU tech chief Henna Virkkunen told reporters that "TikTok has to take actions, they have to change the design of their service in Europe to protect our minors and their wellbeing".

The commission gave examples of what the platform could alter, such as:

TikTok on Friday vowed to challenge what it called the European Commission's "false" findings.

"The commission's preliminary findings present a categorically false and entirely meritless depiction of our platform," a TikTok spokesperson said in a statement.

"We will take whatever steps are necessary to challenge these findings through every means available to us," they said.

The February 2024 investigation was the first opened into TikTok under the DSA, the bloc's powerful content moderation law that has faced the wrath of the US administration under President Donald Trump .

The DSA is part of a bolstered legal armoury adopted by the EU in recent years to curb Big Tech's excesses, and officials have said TikTok has been cooperating with the bloc's digital regulators so far.

The commission findings raised concerns about TikTok design features that "fuel the urge to keep scrolling".

Brussels accused TikTok of disregarding "important indicators of compulsive use of the app" such as the time spent on the platform by children at night.

It also said TikTok had not implemented effective measures to mitigate risks, taking particular aim at screen time management and parental control tools.

The commission found that TikTok's time management tools were "easy to dismiss" including for young users, while parental controls required "additional time and skills from parents to introduce" them.

The findings come as several European countries move to curb access to social media for younger teenagers – with officials weighing whether it is time to follow suit at EU level.

Briefing reporters Friday, Virkkunen said her priority was to make platforms safe for all users, children included.

" Social media should be so safe by design that we shouldn't have that kind of very high age restriction," she said.

TikTok may now access the EU's files and defend itself against the claims.

If the regulator's views are confirmed, the commission can impose a fine of up to six percent of the company's total worldwide annual turnover.

The EU began a separate probe into TikTok in December 2024 on alleged foreign interference during the Romanian presidential elections.

EU digital affairs spokesman Thomas Régnier said Wednesday that TikTok had been "extremely cooperative" with regulators during that investigation and had been taking measures to address the commission's concerns.

Regnier added that while the probe remained open, regulators could monitor how TikTok behaves during other elections.</description><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 13:03:52 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/fe070cc0-034b-11f1-97db-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/7a30634e22d1a7e59692907e3c576d3d705f9493.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump administration launches TrumpRx website for access to discounted drugs</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260206-trump-administration-launches-trumprx-website-for-access-to-discounted-drugs</link><description>The Trump administration on Thursday launched TrumpRx, a website it says will help patients buy prescription drugs directly at a discounted rate at a time when health care and the cost of living are growing concerns for Americans.

“You’re going to save a fortune,” President Donald Trump said at the site’s unveiling. “And this is also so good for overall health care.”

The government-hosted website is not a platform for buying medications. Instead, it's set up as a facilitator, pointing Americans to drugmakers’ direct-to-consumer websites, where they can make purchases. It also provides coupons to use at pharmacies. The site launches with over 40 medications, including weight-loss drugs such as Ozempic and Wegovy.

The site is part of a larger effort by the Trump administration to show it is tackling the challenges of high costs. Affordability has emerged as a political vulnerability for Trump and his Republican allies going into November's midterm elections , as Americans remain worried about the cost of housing, groceries, utilities and other staples of middle-class identity.

Trump stressed that the lower prices were made possible by his pressuring of pharmaceutical companies on prices, saying he demanded that they charge the same costs in the US as in other nations. He said prescription drug costs will increase in foreign countries as a result.

“We're tired of subsidising the world,” Trump said at the evening event on the White House campus that lasted roughly 20 minutes.

The administration is touting substantial discounts, though it's unclear just how much impact the changes will have for family budgets. The site includes the disclaimer that prices “may be even lower” for people with insurance, as it lists the “out-of-pocket price”. Also, some consumers might be able to use available generics that cost less than brand-name medications.

Still, Dr Mehmet Oz , administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, hyped the website as being transformative. He said the lower prices for Ozempic and Wegovy would cause the country to collectively lose 100 million pounds this year. He suggested that lower prices for the fertility drug Gonal-F would trigger pregnancies nationwide.

“We’re going to have a lot of Trump babies with these costs,” Oz said.

The president first teased TrumpRx in September while announcing the first of his more than 15 deals with pharmaceutical companies to lower drug prices to match the lowest price offered in other developed nations. He said in December the website would provide “massive discounts to all consumers" – though it's unclear whether the prices available on drugmakers' websites will routinely be any lower than what many consumers could get through their insurance coverage.

The website's Thursday release came after it faced multiple delays, for reasons the administration has not publicly shared. Last fall, Oz told Trump the site would share prices for consumers before the end of the year. An expected launch in late January was also pushed back.

The president has spent the past several months seeking to spotlight his efforts to lower drug prices for Americans. He has done that through deals with major pharmaceutical companies, including some of the biggest drugmakers like Pfizer, Eli Lilly and Merck, which have agreed to lower prices of their Medicaid drugs to so-called “most favoured nations” pricing. As part of the deals, many of the companies' new drugs are also to be launched at discounted rates for consumer markets through TrumpRx.

Many of the details of Trump's deals with manufacturers remain unclear, and drug prices for patients in the US can depend on many factors, including the competition a treatment faces and insurance coverage. Most people have coverage through work, the individual insurance market or government programmes like Medicaid and Medicare, which shield them from much of the cost.

Trump’s administration also has negotiated lower prices for several prescription drugs for Medicare enrollees, through a direct negotiation programme created by a 2022 law.</description><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 13:04:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/8d5e573e-0306-11f1-af32-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26037004772424.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>No food, no shelter, no money: the daily fight for survival in Gaza</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260206-no-food-no-shelter-no-money-daily-fight-for-survival-gaza</link><description>Since the ceasefire began on October 10 , life in Gaza feels like “coming back from a horrible nightmare”, says 48-year-old Heba.

She feels it is a miracle that she survived last the two years of war and is now trying to rebuild some semblance of normal life with her family, despite her constant anxiety.

“We don’t feel safe. Today we were able to get food, but tomorrow? Nothing is guaranteed, the war could come back, and we are constantly on high alert,” she says.

Despite the ceasefire, only small amounts of humanitarian aid are trickling into the Palestinian enclave, and the Israeli strikes have not completely stopped .

At least 556 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli strikes since the truce began according to figures from the Gaza Health Ministry released on February 6.

Little has changed in Gaza in the four months since Israel ceased the massive bombardments that killed more than 71,000 people – a death toll the Israeli Defense Forces have largely validated .

Due to ongoing Israeli military operations and imposed buffer zones, most of the enclave’s two million inhabitants are still confined to living in coastal areas in the south and centre, which make up less than 40 percent of Gaza’s total territory.

More than one million people are in need of emergency shelter assistance according to the United Nations. Most are living under tarpaulins or in tents provided by the organisation.

Among them are Salma* and her family, who were forced in April to flee their home situated on Israel’s yellow line which separates the territory into an area controlled by the Israeli army and another where Gazans are permitted to live.

They moved to an overcrowded camp in the central town of Al-Zawaida, which is sorely lacking in resources. Salma now charges her phone in a neighbouring café.

“There are a lot of families here, and those who can’t find space are living on the beach,” she says. “Food, water, medicine… we lack everything and every day is a challenge.”

In an attempt to escape cold winter temperatures, wind and heavy rains that have caused flooding in many camps , some Gazans have taken to living in damaged buildings.

Doing so brings its own risks: at least 25 Palestinians were killed by collapsing buildings in December and January, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.

Sobhi has carried on living in a damaged building anyway. “Life in the tents is not a life. We live surrounded by pollution and rubble – abandoned,” he says. “Our children don’t go to school . There are no words to describe this reality.”

After the ceasefire, the 30-year-old left the camp with his family and returned to their house in Sheikh Radwan, northern Gaza – one of the zones most badly affected by Israeli strikes.

“Our neighbour nearly died two weeks ago when her house collapsed,” Sobhi says. “She needed metal reinforcements and she tried to raise the alarm but couldn’t find any help. We are living in the same conditions. There is nothing here. Every day we have to find water to survive.”

In Gaza city, where more than two thirds of buildings were destroyed by Israeli strikes, it is still possible to rent rare apartments that are more or less habitable – but at exorbitant prices.

“For 1,500 shekels a month [€480] you can rent an apartment that is partially damaged, sometimes without windows and normally without electricity or water,” says Heba. “Apartments that are undamaged and fully functional cost three times as much.”

Heba has been able to find an apartment for her family because she is a humanitarian worker for the French organisation Médecins du Monde, but for most Gazans accommodation has become an unaffordable luxury.

Since the ceasefire came into effect some supermarkets and open air markets have reopened selling products almost exclusively imported via the Kerem Shalom and Erez checkpoints, which are strictly controlled by Israel .

Although the Rafah crossing reopened on February 2, it is currently limited to foot traffic.

Food prices, which skyrocketed at the height of the conflict, have fallen sharply. A box of eggs now costs six times less, at around 25 shekels (€6.8), and rice is ten times cheaper at 10 shekels a kilo (€2.75).

But even these lower prices are out of reach for many Gazans who, without income, have become entirely reliant on humanitarian organisations.

Almost all agricultural land has been destroyed by strikes , as have more than half of all wells. On top of this, there is a money crisis as cash has become a rare commodity.

" Some banks have reopened but only for administrative tasks and ATMs don’t work,” says Heba. “The only money in circulation is from before the war. Not everybody has a bank account, and some people lost their savings during the strikes and have been left with nothing.”

"The economy in Gaza has collapsed. We have no money or work. Nothing has changed for us since the ceasefire,” adds Salma.

After two years of being displaced across Gaza, following evacuation orders from the Israeli army, Heba has now been able to resume her full-time job at Médecins du Monde.

She coordinates seven first aid clinics, all overrun with patients many of whom have contracted infectious diseases due to living in overcrowded, unsanitary conditions.

"I see my work as a mission,” she says. “I have survived this atrocity, and I must continue to help my people. Nobody can imagine the level of violence we have lived through, even in Gaza where life was already difficult."

Near the end of a one-minute-long video posted on Trump's Truth Social platform, the Obamas are shown with their faces on the bodies of monkeys for about one second.

The song "The Lion Sleeps Tonight" plays in the background when the Obamas appear.

The video repeats false allegations that ballot-counting company Dominion Voting Systems helped steal the 2020 election from Trump.

As of early Friday morning, the video had been liked several thousand times on the president's social media platform.

The office of California Governor Gavin Newsom , a potential 2028 Democratic presidential candidate and a prominent Trump critic, slammed the post.

"Disgusting behavior by the President. Every single Republican must denounce this. Now," Newsom's press office account posted on X.

Ben Rhodes, a former top national security advisor and close confidant to Barack Obama, also condemned the imagery.

"Let it haunt Trump and his racist followers that future Americans will embrace the Obamas as beloved figures while studying him as a stain on our history," he wrote on X.

The White House however dismissed the condemnations as "fake outrage".

"This is from an internet meme video depicting President Trump as the King of the Jungle and Democrats as characters from the Lion King. Please stop the fake outrage and report on something today that actually matters to the American public," Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement to AFP.

Obama is the only Black president in American history and backed Trump's opponent Kamala Harris on the campaign trail in the 2024 presidential election.

Trump has a long history of intensely personal criticism of the Obamas and of using incendiary, sometimes racist, rhetoric.

When Obama was in the White House, Trump advanced the false claims that the 44th president, who was born in Hawaii, was born in Kenya and was constitutionally ineligible to serve.

Obama eventually released his Hawaii records. Trump finally acknowledged during his 2016 campaign, after having won the Republican nomination, that Obama was born in Hawaii.

In the first year of his second term in the White House, Trump ramped up his use of hyper-realistic but fabricated visuals on Truth Social and other platforms, often glorifying himself while lampooning his critics.

He has used the provocative posts to rally his conservative base.

Last year, Trump posted a video generated by artificial intelligence showing Barack Obama being arrested in the Oval Office and appearing behind bars in an orange jumpsuit.

Later, he posted an AI clip of House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries – who is Black – wearing a fake moustache and a sombrero.

Jeffries called the image racist.

Since returning to the White House, Trump has drawn criticism from his opponents for leading a crusade against diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programmes.

One of Trump's first acts was to terminate all federal government DEI programmes, including related policies in the military.

The drive to rid the armed forces of what Trump has derided as "woke" initiatives has also seen the removal from some military academy bookshelves of scores of books that cover the US's history of discrimination.

US federal anti-discrimination programs were born of the 1960s civil rights struggle, mainly led by Black Americans, for equality and justice after hundreds of years of slavery, whose abolition in 1865 saw other institutional forms of racism enforced.</description><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 15:08:27 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/099e59e4-0365-11f1-81d6-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/000-KF7VQ.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US arrests ‘key participant’ in deadly 2012 Benghazi consulate attack</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260206-us-arrests-key-participant-in-deadly-2012-benghazi-consulate-attack</link><description>A key participant in the deadly 2012 attack on the US compound in Benghazi, Libya , that killed four Americans has been taken into custody and will be prosecuted in their deaths, Attorney General Pam Bondi said Friday

Bondi said in a news conference that Zubayr Al-Bakoush had landed at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland at 3am local time on Friday.

“We have never stopped seeking justice for that crime against our nation,” Bondi said.

US Attorney Jeanine Pirro said that an eight-count indictment charged Al-Bakoush with crimes including the murders of Ambassador Chris Stevens and State Department employee Sean Smith. It was unclear if Al-Bakoush had an attorney representing him.

The 2012 attack on the US compound immediately emerged as a divisive political issue as Republicans challenged president Barack Obama and then-secretary of state Hillary Clinton on security at the facility, the military response to the violence and the administration’s changing narrative about who was responsible and why.

A final report by a Republican-led congressional panel faulted the Obama administration for security deficiencies at the Libyan outpost and a slow response to the attacs. The report, however, found no wrongdoing by Clinton.

Clinton dismissed the report as an echo of previous probes with no new discoveries, saying it was “time to move on”. Other Democrats denounced the Republicans’ report as “a conspiracy theory on steroids".

On the night of September 11, 2012, US officials have said, at least 20 militants armed with AK-47s and grenade launchers breached the gate of the consulate compound and set buildings on fire.

The fire led to the deaths of Stevens and Smith. Other State Department personnel escaped to a nearby US facility known as the annex.

A large group assembled for an attack on the annex. That attack, including a precision mortar barrage, resulted in the deaths of security officers Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty.

A Libyan militant suspected of being a mastermind of the attacks, Ahmed Abu Khattala, was captured by US special forces in 2014 and was brought to Washington for prosecution. He was convicted and is serving a prison sentence. His attorneys argued that the evidence was inconclusive and that he was singled out because of his ultra-conservative Muslim beliefs.</description><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 16:04:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/fef0213a-036e-11f1-a7d0-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26037539591995.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Thousands attend Gaddafi son’s funeral, highlighting Libya’s divided loyalties</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/africa/20260206-thousands-attend-burial-of-slain-son-of-libya-s-gaddafi</link><description>Thousands turned out on Friday for the burial of the slain son of former Libyan ruler Muammar Gaddafi in a town that still holds allegiance to the late longtime leader.

Saif al-Islam Gaddafi , once seen by some as Libya 's heir apparent, was shot dead in his home in the northwestern city of Zintan on Tuesday.

His burial in the town of Bani Walid, some 175 kilometres (110 miles) south of Tripoli, brought together thousands of Gaddafi loyalists, nearly 15 years after the ruler was toppled and killed in a 2011 NATO-backed uprising.

Libya has struggled to recover from chaos that erupted since. It remains split between Prime Minister Abdelhamid Dbeibah's UN-backed government based in Tripoli and an eastern administration backed by Khalifa Haftar .

Dbeibah condemned the killing, saying that "assassinations never provide stability... but rather deepen division".

His interior ministry had announced that it would "ensure the security of the funeral" in the town of some 100,000 people.

Each year, Bani Walid celebrates the anniversary of a 1969 coup that brought Gaddafi to power, with people parading through the streets with portraits of the ex-leader and Libya's green flag from before the Arab Spring uprising.

Ahead of the burial on Friday, locals also carried those portraits and flags while chanting pro-Gaddafi slogans and declaring that "the martyrs' blood will not be shed in vain".

Marcel Ceccaldi, a French lawyer who had been representing Seif al-Islam, told AFP a "four-man commando" killed him.

Authorities said they were probing his death as the assailants remained at large.

Saadi Gaddafi, Saif al-Islam's younger brother, said his dead sibling would be buried "next to his brother Khamis Gaddafi", who was killed during the 2011 unrest.

Under his father's iron-fisted 40-year rule, Seif al-Islam was described as the de facto prime minister, cultivating an image of moderation and reform despite holding no official position.

But that reputation soon collapsed when he promised "rivers of blood" in retaliation for the 2011 uprising.

He was arrested that year on a warrant issued by the International Criminal Court for alleged crimes against humanity, and a Tripoli court sentenced him to death, although he was later granted amnesty.

In 2021 he announced he would run for president but the elections were indefinitely postponed.</description><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 17:12:22 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/f50d7eda-0376-11f1-9c18-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/000-96F39XR.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Port dispute thrusts Panama Canal back into heart of US-China rivalry</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260206-port-dispute-thrusts-panama-canal-back-into-heart-of-us-china-rivalry</link><description>Panama’s president pushed back against Beijing this week after the country’s top court annulled a Hong Kong-backed firm’s right to operate key terminals on the Panama Canal, prompting sharp criticism from China .

The decision by Panama's Supreme Court thrust the strategic waterway back into the spotlight, a year after US President Donald Trump vowed in his inauguration speech to “take it back”.

In a post on X on Wednesday, Panama’s President Jose Raul Mulino responded to criticism from China, stating that the Central American country is “governed by the rule of law and respects the decisions of the judiciary, which is independent of the central government”.

The Supreme Court ruled last week that a concession held by a subsidiary of Hong Kong’s CK Hutchison Holdings to operate terminals in the Panama Canal was unconstitutional . The court cited legal irregularities in the awarding and oversight of the contract.

The decision effectively strips CK Hutchison of its long-standing management role at the key terminals, halting its operations in the canal zone.

Analysts say the ruling carries broader geopolitical implications given China’s strategic interests in the waterway, aligning with US efforts to curb Chinese influence in the region.

Beijing has reacted with strong rhetoric , describing the Panamanian decision as "political backstabbing" and a "legal absurdity”, while hinting at political and economic consequences.

The canal, a vital artery for global trade, has become a geopolitical focal point, highlighting the intensifying US-China struggle for influence in Latin America. The waterway links the Pacific and Atlantic oceans and is crucial for shipping.

For China, it is a strategic “hot spot,” according to Rodrigo Martin, a China–Latin America relations expert at the University of Salamanca. The canal allows Chinese shipping to reach Atlantic markets without circumnavigating South America. “China doesn’t want to lose the influence it has [there],” Martin said, underlining the potential strategic cost.

For the United States, the canal remains no less significant. Around 40 percent of American trade passes through the waterway, and Washington has historically regarded the region as within its sphere of influence. “The Panama Canal Zone… until very recently, 25 years ago, was controlled by the United States. It was a dominion, so to speak. So (China's presence) doesn’t go down very well with the American way of thinking,” explained Amalendu Misra, professor of international politics at Lancaster University.

China’s presence in Panama has largely been commercial, with private firms like CK Hutchison operating key port terminals. The Supreme Court ruling strips China of previously “uncontested access” to the canal, weakening its geostrategic and economic leverage in the region, Misra said.

The verdict also sends a clear message to other Latin American countries that US scrutiny is unavoidable. China cannot expect “any other Latin American country to come to its aid because geographically they are in the backyard of the United States, but not China”, he added.

The decision is also a warning to Chinese companies. “They would come to realize with the Panamanian Supreme Court verdict that there is nothing that China can do if your investment goes down the drain,” Misra said, highlighting the political risks that now outweigh purely economic considerations.

Panama is not unique. Mario Esteban, a regional expert and professor at the Autonomous University of Madrid, recalled a Chinese-German consortium that won a contract to manage Chilean passports in 2021. He noted that US political pressure played a decisive role in the Chilean authorities ultimately cancelling the contract, even though the official reason given was technical. The Panama case may now serve as a blueprint for other countries.

Misra warned that the ruling could trigger wider regional shifts: “Many Latin American and Central American countries are going to become stronger now by taking this example, by saying no to Chinese control of their resources, their ports and other things.” Mexico, where Chinese investment is significant, could be the next focus of scrutiny.

Tabita Rosendal, a specialist on China's political and economic influence at Lund University, said Beijing is balancing a dual strategy: signalling strength to its regional partners while avoiding escalation with the United States. She added that China “might respond in terms of trade and investment pressure”, but also wants stability in its relationship with the US, particularly ahead of the state visit by Trump scheduled for April.

Martin echoed this caution, suggesting that China’s immediate options are likely limited to symbolic measures, such as slowing infrastructure projects or reviewing trade agreements, with any response shaped by how the US approaches the upcoming visit to China.

Esteban suggested that Panama's Supreme Court ruling may be just the first move in a broader tussle for influence between the US and China, potentially prompting Beijing to launch a diplomatic offensive to present itself as a reliable partner for Latin American nations, in contrast to what it sees as an increasingly assertive United States.

At the same time, Misra emphasised that the ruling significantly limits China’s leverage in the region. He concluded that the decision “neuters China’s power and influence in Central America and Latin America”, adding that “this is the beginning of the end for Chinese economic supremacy in Latin America”.

With an American naval group led by an aircraft carrier in Middle Eastern waters, US and Iranian delegations held talks in Muscat mediated by the Gulf sultanate without publicly meeting face-to-face.

Shortly after the talks concluded, the US announced new sanctions against shipping entities and vessels, aimed at curbing Iran's oil exports. But it was not clear if the move was linked to the talks.

The talks were the first between the two foes since the United States joined Israel's war with Iran in June with strikes on nuclear sites.

They also come just under a month after Iranian authorities launched a crackdown on protests that left thousands dead, according to rights groups.

Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, who led Iran's delegation in Muscat, said talks "focused exclusively" on the Iranian nuclear programme, which the West believes is aimed at making an atomic bomb but Tehran insists is peaceful.

The US delegation, led by Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and President Donald Trump 's influential son-in-law Jared Kushner , had also wanted Tehran's backing for militant groups, its ballistic missile programme and treatment of protesters on the agenda.

According to US news website Axios, the talks featured a direct meeting between Witkoff, Kushner and Araghchi, but there was no official confirmation from either side.

"In a very positive atmosphere, our arguments were exchanged and the views of the other side were shared with us," Araghchi told Iranian state TV, adding that the two sides had "agreed to continue negotiations, but we will decide on the modalities and timing at a later date".

Speaking to the official IRNA news agency, he expressed hope that Washington would refrain from "threats and pressure" so that "the talks can continue".

There was no immediate comment from the American delegation in Muscat.

In a symbol of the potential for US military action, Admiral Brad Cooper, the commander of US Central Command, whose area of responsibility includes the Middle East, was present at the talks, according to images published by the Oman News Agency.

Multiple sessions of talks in the morning and afternoon saw both sides shuttling to and from the residence of Omani Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi, who said on X "we aim to reconvene in due course".

The foreign ministry of US ally Qatar expressed hope the talks would "lead to a comprehensive agreement that serves the interests of both parties and enhances security and stability in the region".

The White House has made clear it wants the talks to rein in Tehran's ability to make a nuclear bomb, an ambition the Islamic republic has always denied.

French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot said on Friday that Iran should stop being a "destabilising power", citing its nuclear programme and support for "terrorist" groups.

Barrot also called on "groups supported by Iran" to exert "the utmost restraint" in the event of any military escalation involving the Islamic republic.

Trump initially threatened military action against Tehran over its crackdown on protesters last month and even told demonstrators "help is on its way".

Regional powers including Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar urged the United States not to intervene, calling on Washington and Tehran to instead return to talks.

The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency said that according to its latest toll 6,495 protesters were confirmed to have been killed, as well as 214 members of the security forces and 61 bystanders.

But it and other rights groups warn that the final toll risks being far higher, with the magnitude of the crackdown masked by the blanket internet shutdown imposed by the authorities for a fortnight.

Almost 51,000 people are also confirmed to have been arrested, according to HRANA.

But Trump's rhetoric in recent days has focused on reining in the Iranian nuclear programme and the US has manoeuvered a naval group led by aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln into the region.

Iran has repeatedly vowed it will hit back at US bases in the region if attacked.

The new sanctions to curb Iran's oil exports come with Trump "committed to driving down the Iranian regime's illicit oil and petrochemical exports under the administration's maximum pressure campaign", State Department spokesman Tommy Pigott said in a statement.</description><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 22:24:21 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/86648eac-039d-11f1-b22c-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26037271316592.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Live: Trump hails ‘very good’ Iran talks, says negotiations will continue early next week</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260207-live-trump-hails-very-good-iran-talks-says-negotiations-will-continue-early-next-week</link><description>US President Donald Trump said Washington held "very good talks" on Iran after the two sides held an indirect dialogue in Oman.

"We likewise had very good talks on Iran," Trump told reporters on board Air Force One en route to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, adding, "we're going to meet again early next week".

But Trump also reiterated his earlier threats of new military action against Iran.

"If they don't make a deal, the consequences are very steep," he said.

Iran for its part said it expected to hold more negotiations with the United States, hailing a "positive atmosphere" during a day of talks in the Gulf sultanate.

US President Donald Trump signed ​an ‍executive order that may ​impose a 25 percent tariff on countries that do business with Iran.

The levies "may be imposed on goods imported into the United States that are products of any country that directly or indirectly purchases, imports, or otherwise acquires any goods or services from Iran", the order said.

The rate is to be determined by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, although the order specifies that it could be "for example" 25 percent, the level first mentioned by the US president in mid-January.

Tariffs would affect trade with a number of countries including Russia, Germany, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates.

More than a quarter of Iran's trade is with China, with $18 billion in imports and $14.5 billion in exports in 2024, according to World Trade Organization data.

Negotiators from Iran and the US held indirect talks in Oman for the first time since Washington bombed sites linked to Iran's nuclear programme during the Israel-Iran war last June.

Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said that indirect talks between Tehran and Washington had "focused exclusively" on Iran's nuclear programme. US envoys had also wanted Tehran's backing for militant groups around the region, its ballistic missile programme and brutal crackdown on nationwide protests on the agenda.

Ukrainian officials have accused Moscow of deliberately targeting energy infrastructure , causing outages that have left hundreds of thousands of people without lighting or heating in temperatures well below zero.

Ukraine's Energy Minister Denys Shmyhal said Kyiv had requested emergency assistance from Poland after Russia hit the Burshtynska and Dobrotvirska power plants in western Ukraine.

"Russia is carrying out another massive attack on the Ukrainian power grid facilities," grid operator Ukrenergo said on Saturday.

"Due to the damage caused by the enemy, emergency outages have been applied in most regions," it said in a statement on Telegram.

"Currently, the attack is still ongoing. Restoration work will begin as soon as the security situation allows."

Two airports in southeastern Poland ⁠were suspended from operations as a precaution due to the strikes, Polish authorities said on Saturday.

"In ​connection with the need to ensure the ‍possibility of the free operation of military aviation, the airports in Rzeszow and ​Lublin have temporarily suspended flight operations," Polish Air Navigation ​Services Agency posted on X.

Both cities are close to the country's border with Ukraine, with Rzeszow being NATO 's main hub for arms supplies to Ukraine.

Ukraine and Russia have held two rounds of US-mediated negotiations in Abu Dhabi since January.

Kyiv and Moscow have agreed to a major prisoner swap but have made no breakthrough on the issue of territory, a key sticking point in negotiations.

Moscow has accused Ukraine of orchestrating the shooting of a top military intelligence general in the Russian capital on Friday, leaving him wounded.

Funerals will take place on Saturday for some of the victims.

The blast was the deadliest in Islamabad since the 2008 Marriott hotel bombing.

City officials said 31 people died and another 169 were wounded in the explosion at the Imam Bargah Qasr-e-Khadijatul Kubra mosque on the city's outskirts. The death toll was expected to rise.

The blast occurred during Friday prayers, when mosques are packed with worshippers.

"The attacker was stopped at the gate and detonated himself," a security source said.

Muhammad Kazim, 52, said an "extremely powerful" explosion ripped through the building as prayers were just starting.

Another worshipper, Imran Mahmood, said there was a gunfight between the bomber and volunteer security personnel at the mosque.

"The suicide attacker was trying to move forward, but one of our injured volunteers fired at him from behind, hitting him in the thigh," he said.

He then "detonated the explosives", Mahmood added.

Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif vowed that those behind the blast would be found and brought to justice.

Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar branded the attack "a heinous crime against humanity and a blatant violation of Islamic principles".

The Sunni Muslim Islamic State group emerged in Iraq and Syria and quickly created a "caliphate", declaring its rule over all Muslims and largely displacing al Qaeda .

After being ousted ​from its bases in the Syrian city of Raqqa and the Iraqi city of Mosul , the group took refuge in the hinterlands of the two fractured countries.

It retains a significant presence in Syria and Iraq, parts of Africa including the Sahel region, and in Afghanistan and Pakistan.

But the group has adopted new tactics since the collapse of its forces and a string of other setbacks in the Middle East.

While IS militants operating across several regions share an ideology, there are no signs that they exchange weapons or financing.

The Islamabad bombing comes as Pakistan's security forces battle intensifying insurgencies in southern and northern provinces that border Afghanistan.

Pakistan is a Sunni-majority nation, but Shiites make up between 10 and 15 percent of the population and have been targeted in attacks throughout the region in the past.

The last major attack in Islamabad took place in November when a suicide blast outside a court killed 12 people and wounded dozens, the first such incident to hit the capital in nearly three years.

In Balochistan, attacks claimed by separatist insurgents last week killed 36 civilians and 22 security personnel, prompting a wave of counter-operations in which authorities said security forces killed almost 200 militants.

Friday's attack was the deadliest in the Pakistani capital since September 2008, when 60 people were killed in a suicide truck bomb blast that destroyed part of the five-star Marriott hotel.</description><pubDate>Sat, 07 Feb 2026 07:51:47 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/c87b37c4-03f1-11f1-8bab-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-02-06T142408Z-159109686-RC2CGJAO62DY-RTRMADP-3-PAKISTAN-BLAST.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>France opens financial probe into ex-minister Jack Lang after Epstein revelations</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260207-france-opens-financial-probe-into-ex-minister-jack-lang-after-epstein-revelations</link><description>France 's financial crimes prosecutors told AFP Friday they had opened a preliminary investigation into influential former culture and education minister Jack Lang and his daughter Caroline after revelations in the Epstein files.

The pair will be investigated for "laundering of aggravated tax-fraud proceeds" over their suspected financial ties with late US financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein , the office said.

Lang, a prominent figure who has held a series of ministerial roles in previous governments, is facing pressure to resign from his current post as head of a leading French cultural institute over his links to Epstein.

France's foreign minister said Friday he had summoned the 86-year-old ex-minister to a weekend meeting.

Lang is the most high-profile French figure caught up in the latest US release of documents linked to the financier, who US authorities say killed himself in 2019 while in prison facing charges of sex trafficking underage girls.

A mere mention in the files does not imply wrongdoing.

French media reports said Lang, who heads the Arab World Institute (IMA) in Paris , repeatedly appealed to Epstein for funds or favours, while his daughter's name appears in the company files of an offshore company co-owned with the disgraced US tycoon.

Caroline Lang, a film producer, resigned on Monday as head of the Independent Production Union.

French investigative website Mediapart on Monday reported that Epstein in 2016 founded a company based in the US Virgin Islands, half of whose shares were owned by Caroline.

But it said no files it reviewed suggested either father or daughter had been implicated in Epstein's sexual crimes.

Caroline Lang told Mediapart that the US financier told her he wanted to "invest in young French and international artists".

She said his lawyers set up the company called Prytanée LLC, but that she did not invest any money in it. An email in the Epstein files suggests she instead contributed her knowledge of the art world, Mediapart reported.

She told the investigative website she had been "incredibly naive".

Jack Lang, who spent nearly 20 years as culture minister and education minister in different governments, has denied any knowledge of Epstein's crimes, despite the financier's conviction in 2008 for soliciting a minor for prostitution .

On Wednesday, Lang refused to step down as president of the IMA, a cultural hub focused on the Arabic-speaking world.

Pressure has increased however and the foreign ministry – which provides half of the institute's budget – has ordered him to a meeting.

"He has been summoned by the ministry and will be received on Sunday," Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot told AFP on a visit to Erbil in Iraqi Kurdistan .

Speaking later from Beirut , Barrot added: "The first elements emerging from these files are new and extremely serious" and would require in-depth examination.

But his priority, he said, was to ensure the proper running of the institute.

The IMA receives 12.3 million euros ($14.5 million) from the foreign ministry every year.

The financial crimes investigation will now increase the pressure on Lang.

Lang did not immediately respond to an AFP request for comment, but his lawyer Laurent Merlet said Sunday's meeting with Barrot was merely one with his supervisory authority.

"The purpose is to understand his side of the story," he said, rejecting the notion that the Epstein files proved any "close bonds of friendship".

A source in Lang's circle said he was in the Moroccan city of Marrakesh on Friday.

Politicians – even within Lang's Socialist ranks – have said he should step down.

Socialist party leader Olivier Faure urged Lang to "think about resigning to protect the institution he presides".

A source in the president's office said Lang should be "thinking about the institution" he has headed since 2013.

The IMA's board of directors – made up in equal measure of ambassadors from Arab countries and figures chosen by the foreign ministry – appointed him and has renewed his tenure three times.</description><pubDate>Sat, 07 Feb 2026 08:32:39 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/b6ba4874-0390-11f1-bc19-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/f995f4712de941b40a1394c99426a444ea976788.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Cuba adopts urgent measures to protect essential services as US threatens fuel supply</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260207-cuba-adopts-urgent-measures-to-protect-essential-services-as-us-threatens-fuel-supply</link><description>The Cuban government on Friday announced emergency measures to address a crippling energy crisis worsened by US sanctions , including the adoption of a four-day work week for state-owned companies and fuel sale restrictions.

Deputy Prime Minister Oscar Perez-Oliva Fraga told Cuban television the government would "implement a series of decisions, first and foremost to guarantee the vitality of our country and essential services, without giving up on development".

"Fuel will be used to protect essential services for the population and indispensable economic activities," he said.

The rationing measures ​are the first to be announced since President Donald Trump threatened to slap ‍tariffs on the US-bound products of any country exporting fuel to Cuba and suggested hard times ahead for Cubans already suffering ​severe shortages of food, fuel and medicine.

Among the new measures are the reduction of the working week in state-owned companies to four days, from Monday to Thursday; restrictions on fuel sales; a reduction in bus and train services between provinces; and the closure of certain tourist establishments.

School days will also be made shorter and universities will reduce the requirement of in-person attendance.

These measures are intended to save fuel in order to promote "food and electricity production" and enable "the preservation of fundamental activities that generate foreign currency", Perez-Oliva Fraga said.

The island of 9.6 million inhabitants, under US economic embargo since 1962, has been mired in a severe economic crisis for six years.

The United States has recently moved to cut off critical oil supplies to Cuba, including deliveries from Havana's key ally Venezuela following the armed seizure of President Nicolas Maduro and his wife by the US military in early January.

Trump also signed an executive order last week allowing his country to impose tariffs on countries selling oil to Havana.

Trump said that Mexico , which has been supplying Cuba with oil since 2023, would stop doing so – under threat of US tariffs.

The oil shortages have threatened to plunge Cuba into complete darkness, with power plants struggling to keep the lights on.

Washington has long sought to overthrow or weaken the communist-led Cuban government.

Havana has said that Trump wants to "strangle" the island's economy, where power cuts and fuel shortages, already recurrent in recent years, have become even more acute.

This week, Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel said his country was willing to hold talks with the United States , but not under pressure.

He said any talks must take place "from a position of equals, with respect for our sovereignty, our independence and our self-determination" and without "interference in our internal affairs".</description><pubDate>Sat, 07 Feb 2026 09:31:52 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/8116c81e-03cc-11f1-b020-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/05729289dc04e952f84bd0c0f9a6c702235a2350.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>The demise of the French ‘tabac’: How bar closures are fuelling Le Pen’s far right</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260207-france-how-bar-tabac-closures-are-fuelling-le-pen-far-right-pubs</link><description>Known for their zinc counters, lottery tickets and iconic carrot-shaped tobacconist signs, French “bars-tabacs” have long served as focal points for local communities, playing a similar role to the traditional English pub .

And just like pubs in the UK, bars-tabacs – often just known as ‘tabacs’ – have been closing by the thousands in towns and villages across France , stripping communities of a critical social lifeline – and fuelling isolation, resentment and a broader sense of decline.

This, in turn, is feeding support for populist right-wing parties, argues Hugo Subtil, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Zurich and author of a study linking the disappearance of bars-tabacs with a rise in support for Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally (RN).

From around 200,000 in 1960, the once ubiquitous establishments have slumped to fewer than 40,000 today. This haemorrhage has attracted relatively little media coverage, says Subtil, for whom the decline of the bar-tabac has “opened up a void in local social interactions that has a long-term impact on the National Rally vote”.

Analysing electoral data between 2002 and 2022, his study found that the RN vote rose by an extra 1.3%-3.6% in districts that had recently lost a bar-tabac, with the biggest increase occurring in rural areas already stripped of other venues for socialisation.

With the ascendant National Rally eyeing another breakthrough in municipal elections in March, such seemingly small margins could translate into sizeable swings up and down the country.

Typically located on village squares, main roads or outside train stations, France’s bars-tabacs are no ordinary businesses. They’re part of the social fabric, where workers down coffees and croissants at the counter and pensioners play cards or try their luck on lottery scratchcards.

Some in smaller communities have come to sell a lot more than drinks and cigarettes, making up for shop closures by offering newspapers, sim cards and local specialties.

Crucially, they serve as conversation hubs “where people exchange with neighbours and develop a sense of belonging”, writes Subtil, adding that their “disappearance profoundly transforms the way people relate and socialise”.

Social scientists have long pointed to links between high street decline and growing support for the far right . Subtil’s study argues that the closure of “social venues” likes bars and restaurants has a greater impact than that of purely “transactional venues” like bakeries and groceries where customers do not linger.

“When the bar-tabac closes, it is often the last venue for social interaction to disappear,” the study notes, stressing the “relational void” left behind. This is especially the case in rural areas, where Subtil found that the impact on support for the far right is three times higher than in urban areas.

The effect on voting patterns is not as sudden or clear-cut as when a factory suddenly shuts down, causing mass layoffs and triggering an immediate protest vote, the researcher cautions.

“It is not the (bar) closure itself that immediately affects electoral behaviour, but the slow accumulation of its consequences: the scarcity of everyday interactions, the impoverishment of collective discourse, and the gradual shaping of a narrative of decline that can (...) ultimately find expression at the ballot box,” Subtil writes.

As people fall back on a smaller pool of like-minded friends and family, they’re also increasingly exposed to television pundits offering simplistic answers to their problems, like scapegoating immigrants, a regular far-right talking point.

“When there is no longer any place to talk to each other, politics becomes a face-off between the isolated individual and the grand narratives of the media – and in this face-off, discourses that offer simple answers have a structural advantage,” the study adds.

Subtil’s findings echo recent research on the decline of Britain’s iconic pubs and its impact on community cohesion and voting patterns.

In a 2021 study published by online journal Comparative Political Studies, French researcher Diane Bolet found that people living in areas that suffered pub closures were more likely to support the UK Independence Party ( UKIP ), a Eurosceptic, far-right party that was most influential in the run-up to Brexit – and has since been eclipsed by Reform UK.

“The closure of cherished pubs seems to be contributing to the wider sense of marginalisation that has propelled parties like UKIP to the mainstream,” Bolet wrote in a subsequent article on The Conversation.

The “disappearance (of pubs) increases social isolation and affects a community’s self-esteem”, she added, arguing that far-right parties “attract isolated people who have lost trust in others and in institutions”.

Bolet’s research focused on what she describes as “community pubs” catering largely to a working-class constituency, much as bars-tabacs do. She said their disappearance “makes white working-class voters susceptible to ‘left-behind’ narratives that radical-right parties use to garner support”.

Talk of France’s “left behind” is also a staple of Le Pen’s RN party.

Analysing some 2.19 million statements made in the French parliament between 2007 and 2014, Subtil found that RN lawmakers made no greater mention of France’s stricken constituencies than other parties, but that the language they used to frame the debate was markedly different.

Where centrist lawmakers offered technical remedies, the far right spoke of France’s “forgotten” or “abandoned” territories, terms more likely to strike a chord with constituents who feel left behind, the author explains.

The closing chapter to his study stresses the power of public policy in addressing the grievances of constituencies stripped of their bars-tabacs and other services and social venues.

Subtil found that where new bars-tabacs open, the National Rally vote tends to go down – a trend he says underscores the potential to reverse the cycle of social decline and far-right support through public investment.

“The erosion of social ties is not irreversible,” he writes. “Public policies aimed at preserving or recreating places for socialising can have a lasting impact on electoral trends.”</description><pubDate>Sat, 07 Feb 2026 10:27:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/fbc43dd2-01ea-11f1-a14d-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/StAubin-Chateauneuf-bar-tabac-08.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Live: US wants Ukraine and Russia to end war by June, Zelensky says</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260207-live-us-wants-ukraine-russia-end-war-by-june-zelensky-says</link><description>Ukrainian ‍nuclear ​power ⁠plants reduced output as ‍renewed ​military activity affected electrical ​substations and disconnected some power lines, ‍the International ​Atomic Energy Agency said in ‌an X ‍post.

Ukraine's power grid came under a renewed assault by Russia overnight, causing widespread power outages.

Two ​suspects in ⁠the attempted assassination of top Russian ​military ‍intelligence general Vladimir ​Alekseyev "will soon be ​interrogated," the Russian newspaper Kommersant reported on Saturday, citing a ‍source close to ​the investigation.

After interrogation, the suspects will ‌be charged, the newspaper ‍reported.

Russia has not officially reported the detention of ‍the suspects.

A "massive attack" by Russian forces on Ukraine's energy infrastructure has caused power outages across the country, the state grid operator said on Saturday.

Ukrainian officials have accused Moscow of deliberately targeting energy infrastructure, causing outages that have left hundreds of thousands of people without lighting or heating in temperatures well below zero.

Ukraine will not accept the United States making deals with Russia about Ukrainian sovereignty unless Kyiv is also involved, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said.

"Ukraine will not support even such possible agreements between the parties about us without us," Zelensky said in remarks embargoed until early Saturday.

The US has given Ukraine and Russia a June deadline to reach an agreement to end the nearly four-year war, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told reporters.

If the June deadline is not met, the Trump administration will likely put pressure on both sides to meet it, he added.

“The Americans are proposing the parties end the war by the beginning of this summer and will probably put pressure on the parties precisely according to this schedule,” Zelensky said, speaking to reporters on Friday. Zelenskyy’s comments were embargoed until Saturday morning.

“And they say that they want to do everything by June. And they will do everything to end the war. And they want a clear schedule of all events,” he said.</description><pubDate>Sat, 07 Feb 2026 10:27:08 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/28cff6b2-0408-11f1-882a-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26018664268676.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Tiny Bermudan snail 'back from the brink' of extinction, UK zoo says</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260207-tiny-bermudan-snail-back-from-brink-extinction-uk-zoo-says</link><description>A tiny snail once thought to have disappeared from the face of the Earth has been brought back from the edge of extinction , a British zoo said Saturday.

The greater Bermuda land snail had not been spotted for years until a cluster of shells was caught slowly slithering through an alleyway in the capital Hamilton in 2014.

Some were flown to Chester Zoo, where experts spent years building up the population before they released thousands back into the wild in 2019.

Unique to Bermuda , this type of snail traces its lineage back more than a million years – a relic of the island's ancient ecosystem.

Now "we can officially say the species is back from the brink", Chester Zoo said in a statement.

The snail "once thought lost has officially been saved from extinction by experts in Chester Zoo, London Zoo and Bermuda", it said.

They confirmed this after a study in the Oryx biodiversity conservation journal found that six colonies of the re-wilded snails had settled successfully on the archipelago.

"The fact that the snails are firmly established in six areas is massive," said Gerardo Garcia, animal and plant director at Chester Zoo.

From specially designed pods in northwest England, they are now breeding and roaming freely in Bermuda, he said.

"Being able to say that the snails are now safe from extinction is amazing ... and something that conservationists might get to say once or maybe twice in their whole career."

At one point, keeper Katie Kelton said the zoo housed around 60,000 snails.

It was "a lot of snails to look after ... a lot of chopping lettuce, sweet potato and carrot", she said.

The snails faced many threats, including habitat loss, pesticide use and the cannibalistic "wolf snail".

They were rescued in a process Garcia described as "a war game" with growing numbers tracked by flags pinned across a map of Bermuda.

While they cannot say the species is safe forever, he noted they now knew how to rebuild the population quickly and effectively.

But long-term recovery, he said, would go hand in hand with nature regeneration projects carried out by the Bermudian government.

Chester Zoo has now turned its attention to the lesser Bermuda land snail – even smaller and much harder to breed.

These snails, which can reach about 23 millimetres in length, may now be extinct in the wild.

"We're considering things like seasonality, how long it takes a colony to establish and the complexity of their environments," said expert Iri Gill.

But their experience with the greater Bermuda snail should point them "in the right direction", she said.

"These snails are tiny, but this has been one of the biggest success stories in conservation."</description><pubDate>Sat, 07 Feb 2026 10:27:16 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/80298a46-0402-11f1-a7b8-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/000-94UV4A2.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Saudi Arabia to invest billions of dollars in Syria, including joint airline and telecom project</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260207-saudi-arabia-invest-billions-dollars-syria-including-joint-airline-telecom-project</link><description>Syria and Saudi Arabia signed deals Saturday that include a joint airline and a $1-billion project to develop telecommunications, officials said, as Syria seeks to rebuild after years of war.

Saudi Arabia has been a major backer of Syria’s Islamist authorities who took power after toppling longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad in December 2024.

The new authorities in Damascus have worked to attract investment and have signed major agreements with several companies and governments, including Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states.

Syrian Investment Authority chief Talal al-Hilali announced a series of deals including “a low-cost Syrian-Saudi airline aimed at strengthening regional and international air links”.

The agreement also includes the development of a new international airport in the northern city of Aleppo , and redeveloping the existing facility.

Hilali also announced an agreement for a project called SilkLink to develop Syria’s “telecommunications infrastructure and digital connectivity”.

Syrian Telecommunications Minister Abdulsalam Haykal told the signing ceremony that the project would be implemented “with an investment of around $1 billion”.

For decades, Syria was unable to secure significant investments because of Assad-era sanctions .

But the United States fully removed its remaining sanctions on Damascus late last year, paving the way for the full return of investments.

Syria and Saudi Arabia also inked an agreement on water desalination and development cooperation on Saturday.

At the ceremony, Saudi Investment Minister Khalid Al-Falih announced the launch of an investment fund for “major projects in Syria with the participation of the (Saudi) private sector”.

The deals are part of “building a strategic partnership” between the two countries, he said.

Syria’s Hilali said the agreements targeted “vital sectors that impact people’s lives and form essential pillars for rebuilding the Syrian economy”.

Syria has begun the mammoth task of trying to rebuild its shattered infrastructure and economy.

In July last year, Riyadh signed investment and partnership deals with Damascus valued at $6.4 billion to help rebuild the country’s infrastructure, telecommunications and other major sectors.

A month later, Syria signed agreements worth more than $14 billion, including investments in Damascus airport and other transport and real estate projects.

This week, Syria signed a preliminary deal with US energy giant Chevron and Qatari firm Power International to explore for oil and gas offshore.</description><pubDate>Sat, 07 Feb 2026 16:31:08 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/247f5f0a-043d-11f1-a51b-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-02-07T141924Z-736059655-RC2CUAAR8SR8-RTRMADP-3-SYRIA-ECONOMY-SAUDI.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>France’s former minister Jack Lang ‘offers’ to resign from Arab World Institute over Epstein links</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260207-france-former-culture-minister-jack-lang-offers-resign-arab-world-institute-jeffrey-epstein-links-caroline</link><description>Former French culture minister Jack Lang offered his resignation Saturday from his role as head of a Paris cultural centre over his links to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein , in a letter to the foreign minister seen by AFP.

US-led efforts to end Europe’s deadliest conflict since World War II have stepped up a gear in recent weeks, but Moscow and Kyiv remain at odds over the key issue of territory.

Russia, which occupies around 20 percent of its neighbour, is pushing for full control of Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region as part of any deal and has threatened to take it by force if talks fail.

But Ukraine says ceding ground will embolden Moscow and has signalled it will not sign an agreement that fails to deter Russia from invading again.

“The United States has proposed for the first time that the two negotiating teams—Ukraine and Russia—meet in the United States, probably in Miami, in a week’s time,” Zelensky told reporters in comments made public early Saturday.

“They say that they want to do everything by June,” he added.

The US has mediated two rounds of negotiation between the two sides in Abu Dhabi since January, brokering a major prisoner exchange but failing to reach a breakthrough on territory.

Both Moscow and Kyiv say talks have been difficult.

Zelensky has repeatedly expressed frustration that his country is being asked to make disproportionate compromises compared to Russia.

Ukraine has proposed freezing the conflict along the current front lines.

But Russia has rejected this, and Washington has pushed for Kyiv to convert the land it currently controls in the Donetsk region into a “free economic zone” where neither side has military control.

“Even if we come to the creation of a free economic zone, we will need fair and reliable rules,” Zelensky said.

The two sides have also failed to reach a “common understanding” on the issue of control over the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Zelensky said.

Russian forces seized the plant, the largest in Europe, at the start of the conflict and have held onto it since.

Ukraine will not tolerate Russia and the United States making deals about Ukraine behind its back, Zelensky added.

Throughout the negotiating progress Russia has launched waves of deadly strikes on Ukraine that have cut heating and power to millions during freezing temperatures.

Russian attacks earlier Saturday forced Ukraine’s three operating nuclear power plants to throttle their generation capacity, “creating a direct risk of a nuclear incident”, Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiga said.

The UN’s atomic energy watchdog issued a statement calling for “restraint”.

Russia, which denies targeting civilians, accused Ukraine on Friday of orchestrating the shooting of a top military intelligence general in Moscow, leaving him wounded. Kyiv has yet to comment.

Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, describing it as a “special military operation” to prevent the expansion of NATO , a war aim that Kyiv has called a pretext for an illegal land grab.

The conflict has resulted in a massive wave of destruction that has left entire cities in ruins and killed tens of thousands of soldiers and civilians, while forcing millions to flee their homes.</description><pubDate>Sat, 07 Feb 2026 20:54:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/4cf0a04c-041b-11f1-ae3f-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/8674fbfbebf87bf42d1aa195c8d0cceba1c9188f.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Haiti’s transitional council transfers power to US-backed prime minister Fils-Aimé</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260207-haiti-transitional-council-transfers-power-prime-minister-fils-aim%C3%A9-us-gang-violence</link><description>Haiti’s presidential transitional council, which has run the impoverished Caribbean nation for nearly two years, on Saturday handed power to US-backed Prime Minister Alix Didier Fils-Aimé, after failing to rein in rampant gang violence .

The transfer of power between the nine-member council, created in April 2024, and 54-year-old businessman Fils-Aimé took place under tight security, given Haiti’s unstable political climate.

“Our watchwords are clear: security, political dialogue, elections, stability. Mr prime minister, in this historic moment, I know that you are gauging the depth of the responsibility you are taking on for the country,” council president Laurent Saint-Cyr told Fils-Aimé.

Fils-Aimé is now the country’s only politician with executive power.

He faces the daunting task of organising elections with the backing of a polarised political establishment.

For years, Haiti—the poorest country in the Americas—has been in the throes of deadly gang violence, with frequent murders, rapes and kidnappings.

Elections have not taken place since 2016, and the country has not had a president since Jovenel Moise was assassinated in July 2021.

Gangs now control 90 percent of the capital Port-au-Prince, and they killed nearly 6,000 people in 2025, according to the United Nations.

About 1.4 million people, or 10 percent of the population, have been displaced by the violence, and nearly half of all Haitians face acute food insecurity, including 1.2 million children under the age of five.

Amid fears of a political vacuum, the United States—which sent three warships to Haiti this week—threw its support behind Fils-Aimé.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has stressed “the importance of his continued tenure as Haiti’s prime minister to combat terrorist gangs and stabilise the island.”

Washington also sanctioned two council members and a minister, accusing them of supporting gangs.

For several weeks, Haitian police have been conducting a large-scale offensive against gangs in central Port-au-Prince, destroying one home belonging to notorious gang leader Jimmy Cherizier, also known as “Barbecue.”</description><pubDate>Sat, 07 Feb 2026 21:27:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/1b5e4c8e-0469-11f1-ac10-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26038714062046.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Thailand votes in three-way race as country struggles with sluggish economic growth</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260207-thailand-votes-in-three-way-race-as-country-struggles-with-sluggish-economic-growth</link><description>Thais voted Sunday in an election pitting the popular reformists who came first last time against the conservative who ended up as prime minister , with ex-leader Thaksin Shinawatra looming large from his prison cell.

The Southeast Asian nation's next government will need to contend with anaemic economic growth – the tourism sector vital but arrivals yet to return to their pre-pandemic highs.

Multibillion-dollar transnational cyberscam networks operate from several neighbouring countries, and a longstanding border dispute with Cambodia erupted into deadly fighting twice last year.

"We need a strong leader who can protect our sovereignty," said Yuernyong Loonboot, 64, the first voter to cast his ballot at a polling station in Buriram, the hometown of incumbent prime minister Anutin Charnvirakul .

"Living here, the border conflict has made me anxious. War was never something we used to think about."

No party is forecast to win an outright majority, and coalition negotiations are expected to follow the results, expected late Sunday.

The progressive People's Party was the runaway leader in opinion polls ahead of the vote.

But while its previous incarnation, Move Forward, won the most seats at the last poll three years ago, its candidate was blocked from the premiership and the party was later dissolved.

Party leader Natthaphong Ruengpanyawut said after casting his ballot in Bangkok that he expected to "get the mandate from the people".

"We promise to the people that we'll form the people's government to bring policies that benefit all, not the few in the country," he added.

But ahead of voting day, political scientist Thitinan Pongsudhirak cautioned: "There are forces beyond the political arena in Thailand that call the final shots.

"It's not about the election, it's about the dissolutions."

Thaksin's Pheu Thai party came second in 2023 and formed a coalition with the third-placed conservatives Bhumjaithai, only to have its prime minister removed by court order.

He was succeeded by Thaksin's daughter Paetongtarn Shinawatra , who was judicially ousted in turn before parliament anointed Bhumjaithai leader Anutin in September – the country's third prime minister in two years.

Thailand's political history is replete with military coups, bloody street protests and judicial bans on prime ministers and parties.

The last coup in 2014 was followed by five years of junta rule and a military-drafted constitution that gives significant power to institutions appointed by the senate, which is not directly elected.

"People who are elected have been able to be undermined by people who are not elected," political scientist Napon Jatusripitak said.

"That's not necessarily a good thing for a country where democratic experience has been turbulent."

Move Forward was dissolved after the constitutional court ruled its pledge to reform the strict royal insult law amounted to an attempt to overthrow the constitutional monarchy .

The issue has not featured in the People's Party campaign this time.

Anutin's Bhumjaithai is second in the polls and analysts anticipate the conservative leader, who championed the legalisation of cannabis, could retain the premiership by again allying with Pheu Thai, now ranked third.

Thailand's most successful political party of modern times, Pheu Thai trades on populist policies spearheaded by the Thai Rak Thai party that Thaksin founded and which held power from 2001 until 2006, when it was ousted by a military coup.

Thaksin-backed parties staged repeated electoral comebacks, only to be ousted by conservative-leaning courts and state watchdog agencies. It softened its politics enough by the 2023 election to be returned to power after being judged by the previously hostile royalist-military establishment as an acceptable alternative to the more progressive Move Forward party.

The conservative court system rounded on it anyway – ousting two of its prime ministers over two years and ordering Thaksin imprisoned on old charges. The party now campaigns on economic revival and populist pledges like cash handouts, nominating Thaksin’s nephew, Yodchanan Wongsawat, as its lead candidate for prime minister.

Yodchanan said Sunday that "Thailand must change", but pollster NIDA puts the party on just 16 percent, a far cry from its heyday.

While Bhumjaithai touts its national defence credentials, especially after last year's clashes with Cambodia, the People's Party is advocating ending conscription and cutting the number of generals.

All three major parties offer various populist handouts and socioeconomic policies, including Pheu Thai's pledge to award nine daily prizes of one million baht ($31,000) each to boost the economy.

A referendum ballot on Sunday also gives voters a chance to voice whether they want constitutional reform in principle, but with no specific measures on the table.</description><pubDate>Sun, 08 Feb 2026 07:12:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/0d578fec-04a5-11f1-a484-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/12552dc196dc2395ede1b8dcc89f1b5e357950da.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Japan’s Takaichi hopes for strong majority in snow-hit snap elections</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260207-japan-s-takaichi-hopes-for-strong-majority-in-snow-hit-snap-elections</link><description>Japan voted in snow-hit snap elections Sunday with Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi hoping to turn a honeymoon start into a resounding ballot box victory that could rile China and rattle financial markets.

Opinion polls suggest that Takaichi's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which has governed almost non-stop for decades, will easily win more than the 233 seats needed to regain a majority in the powerful 465-member lower house.

Heavy snowfall blanketed many parts of the country on election day, including Tokyo and other regions that rarely see winter snow.

"I think it's important to come, so that we can properly take part in politics as well," a 50-year-old woman, who only disclosed her surname as Kondo, told AFP near a voting station in Tokyo.

"Even if it snows more than it does now, I still plan to go," she added.

"I struggled to find a way to the ballot box as snow was accumulating around it, and it was a pain to arrive here with bad road conditions," a man in his 70s in Aomori in northern Japan told public broadcaster NHK.

"I wish the election was held in a snowless season," he said. It is the first time in decades that Japan holds a general election in snowy February.

Pollsters even suggest – with some caution due to undecided voters and wintry weather – that the LDP and its coalition partner could secure 310 seats needed for a handy two-thirds majority.

This would be the best result for the LDP since 2017 when Takaichi's mentor, the late ex-premier Shinzo Abe , achieved a similar result.

Takaichi was a heavy metal drummer in her youth, an admirer of Britain's "Iron Lady" Margaret Thatcher , and on the ultra-conservative fringe of the LDP when she became leader in October.

She has defied pessimists to be a hit with voters, especially young ones, with fans lapping up everything from her handbag to her jamming to a K-pop song with South Korea 's president.

Takaichi has however not had everything her own way, in particular with regard to worries about her stewardship of the public finances of Asia's number-two economy.

She followed up a $135-billion stimulus package aimed at easing the pain of inflation – a big cause of voter discontent – with a campaign promise to suspend a consumption tax on food.

Takaichi's promise to suspend the 8 percent sales tax on food for two years to help households cope with rising prices has spooked investors concerned about how the nation with the heaviest debt burden among advanced economies will fund the plan.

Japan's debts are more than twice the size of the entire economy, and in recent weeks yields on long-dated bonds have hit record highs while the yen has seesawed.

Niigata resident Mineko Mori, 74, padding through the snow with her ‍dog early on Sunday, said she worried that Takaichi's tax cuts could saddle future generations with an even bigger burden.

Mori planned to vote for Sanseito, a small far-right party that broke through in a 2025 upper house ballot with promises to crack down on ​badly behaved foreigners and control immigration .

Takaichi "always talks about taking responsibility through expansionary fiscal policy, and I don’t know whether that will actually lead us in a better direction", Chika Sakamoto, 50, said as she visited a voting station in Tokyo.

"Still, I wanted to see what would happen if they pursued aggressive fiscal spending," hoping that it would ease impact of rising prices on household income, she said.

Barely two weeks in office, Takaichi – seen before assuming the premiership as a China hawk – suggested that Japan could intervene militarily if Beijing sought to take self-ruled Taiwan by force.

China regards the island as part of its territory and has not ruled out using force to "reunify" it with the mainland.

With Takaichi having days earlier pulled out all the stops to welcome US President Donald Trump , Beijing's reaction to her unscripted remarks was furious.

It summoned Tokyo's ambassador, warned its citizens against visiting Japan and conducted joint air drills with Russia . Last month, Japan's last two pandas were even returned to China.

Trump has not publicly weighed in on the spat but last week endorsed Takaichi as a "strong, powerful, and wise Leader, and one that truly loves her Country".

Margarita Estevez-Abe, associate professor of political science at Syracuse University, said that the China episode raised Takaichi's popularity even more.

"Now she doesn't have to worry about any elections until 2028, when the next upper house elections will take place," Estevez-Abe told AFP.

"So the best scenario for Japan is that Takaichi kind of takes a deep breath and focuses on amending the relationship with China."

Voting stations were due to close at 8pm (1100 GMT) with media predictions based on partial results expected soon afterwards.</description><pubDate>Sun, 08 Feb 2026 07:12:43 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/ef981518-04a3-11f1-8884-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/d083ce0c969a62b1602fa40f14c98a3ed7a95eb7.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Portugal chooses between centre-left Socialist and far-right firebrand in presidential runoff</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260208-portugal-chooses-between-centre-left-socialist-and-far-right-firebrand-in-presidential-runoff</link><description>Centre-left Socialist candidate Antonio Jose Seguro is favoured to defeat far-right populist Andre Ventura in Portugal’s runoff presidential election Sunday in a vote that will test the depth of support for Ventura's brash style of politics.

Recent opinion polls say Seguro will collect twice as many votes as Ventura in the head-to-head between the two top candidates in last month’s first round of voting, when none of the runners captured the more than 50 percent of the vote required for victory.

But making it through to the runoff is already a milestone for former TV sports commentator Ventura and his Chega (Enough) party, which has quickly grown into a significant force in Portuguese politics during a wider European shift to the right.

Seguro, a longstanding Socialist politician, has positioned himself as a moderate candidate who will cooperate with Portugal’s centre-right minority government, repudiating Ventura’s anti-establishment and anti-immigrant tirades.

In Portugal , the president is largely a figurehead with no executive power. Traditionally, the head of state stands above the political fray, mediating disputes and defusing tensions.

But the president is an influential voice and possesses some powerful tools, being able to veto legislation from parliament, although the veto can be overturned. The head of state also possesses what in Portuguese political jargon is called an “atomic bomb”, the power to dissolve parliament and call early elections.

Ventura has said that, if elected on Sunday, he would seek constitutional changes to expand the president's limited powers and would be a more "interventionist" head of state.

Despite winning 23.5 percent of the vote against Seguro's 31.1 percent in last month's first round, Ventura has failed to realise his stated ambition to unite ‍the right for the runoff.

Conservatives, including former ​President Anibal Cavaco Silva and some ministers in the current centre-right government, as well as ​most first-round candidates, have backed Seguro against what they see as Ventura's authoritarian tendencies.

Centre-right Prime Minister Luis Montenegro has declined to support either candidate.

In May, Portugal held its third general election in three years in the country's worst bout of political instability for decades, and steadying the ship is a key challenge for the next president.

Ventura, an eloquent and theatrical politician, has rejected political accommodation in favor of a more combative stance. One of his main targets has been what he calls excessive immigration , as foreign workers have become more conspicuous in Portugal in recent years.

“Portugal is ours,” he said.

During the campaign, Ventura put up billboards across the country saying, “This isn’t Bangladesh” and “Immigrants shouldn’t be allowed to live on welfare”.

Although he founded his party less than seven years ago, its surge in public support made it the second-largest party in Portugal’s parliament in the May 18 general election.

As in much of Europe, the far right 's influence has already swayed government policies, particularly on immigration, towards a more ‌restrictive stance.

In March, the winner will replace centre-right President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, who has served the limit of two five-year terms.</description><pubDate>Sun, 08 Feb 2026 07:55:52 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/9ce3e558-04b3-11f1-8126-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/000-96E46NR.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Live: Military pressure 'does not scare' Iran, FM says after US envoys visit aircraft carrier</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260208-live-military-pressure-does-not-scare-iran-fm-says-after-us-envoys-visit-aircraft-carrier</link><description>Iran's foreign minister said that his country was not intimidated by the US naval deployment in the Gulf.

"Their military deployment in the region does not scare us," Abbas Araghchi said.

US President Donald Trump's lead Iran negotiators Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner on Saturday visited the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea.

The nuclear-powered aircraft carrier arrived in the Middle East in January as Trump ramped up threats of war against Iran over its crackdown on widespread anti-government protests.

Iran will never surrender the right to enrich uranium, even if war "is imposed on us", its foreign minister said.

"Iran has paid a very heavy price for its peaceful nuclear programme and for uranium enrichment," Abbas Araghchi told a forum in Tehran.

"Why do we insist so much on enrichment and refuse to give it up even if a war is imposed on us? Because no one has the right to dictate our behaviour," he said, two days after the latest round of indirect talks with US envoy Steve Witkoff in Oman.</description><pubDate>Sun, 08 Feb 2026 08:35:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/b1e7f818-04c2-11f1-87ec-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-02-08T072657Z-1622899185-RC2VGJA4N6LH-RTRMADP-3-IRAN-CRISIS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Farmers report 'catastrophic' crop damage as Storm Marta sweeps Spain and Portugal</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260208-farmers-report-catastrophic-crop-damage-as-storm-marta-sweeps-spain-and-portugal</link><description>Farmers in ⁠Spain warned on Saturday that torrential rains and high winds had left fields submerged and caused millions of euros worth of damage to crops, as Spain and Portugal braced for more extreme weather.

The Iberian Peninsula has already experienced a succession of storms in recent weeks, bringing ​heavy rain, thunder, snow and strong gales before the arrival of Storm Marta on Saturday.

A snowplow driver died on Saturday ‍when his vehicle plunged 20 metres down a slope in the El Pico mountain pass, in Avila in northern Spain, where it had been snowing heavily, emergency services said.

Earlier the ​same day, a 46-year-old man drowned in a river at Campo Maior, in the central Portalegre area of ​Portugal, emergency services said on Saturday. Five people have been killed since Storm Leonardo's arrival last week .

More than 11,000 people have been forced to leave their homes in Spain's southern Andalusia region, while nearly 170 roads have been closed across Spain and rail services have been disrupted in Portugal.

Portugal’s agriculture ministry said on Friday that preliminary estimates put losses in the agricultural and forestry sectors at around 750 million euros ($890 million) because of the storms, which are expected to intensify in the coming days.

Spanish state weather agency AEMET warned on Saturday that Storm Marta would bring snow and hazardous coastal conditions, as well as more rain. ‍Authorities issued an orange weather warning, the second highest after red.

Miguel Angel Perez, of the farmers organisation COAG in Andalusia's Cadiz province, told Spanish television TVE on Saturday: "It is raining without stopping. Crops like broccoli, carrots and cauliflowers are under water. Thousands of hectares inundated. We have a real natural catastrophe."

Perez ‌said the storm had caused millions of euros of damage to this year's crop and farmers would seek government help to recover.

Waterlogging has also raised fears of structural shifts including landslides.

Residents of several towns ‍in the Serrania de Ronda mountain range in Malaga, which had been battered by Storm Leonardo this week, said on Saturday the ground had trembled for days.

The council of one town in the area, Cortes de la Frontera, said in a post on social media on Saturday that there was "no danger" from the tremors which have also been felt in nearby towns of Benaojan, Gaucin and Jimera de Libar.

Specialists from the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) were deployed in the area to monitor the situation.

Several residential areas near the Guadalquivir River in Andalusia's Cordoba province were evacuated on Friday due ‍to the dramatic rise in water levels.

Spain's Deputy Prime Minister Maria Jesus Montero warned that the river was expected to reach its peak level on Saturday or Sunday.</description><pubDate>Sun, 08 Feb 2026 09:31:03 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/e5090f98-04b8-11f1-922f-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-02-07T140635Z-1260663768-RC2ZGJAX62PE-RTRMADP-3-EUROPE-WEATHER-SPAIN.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Japan's ruling party regains lower-house majority in election, media projections show</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260208-japan-s-ruling-party-regains-lower-house-majority-in-election-media-projections-show</link><description>Japan 's right-wing ruling party is set to regain a majority in lower house elections , media projections showed on Sunday in what would be a big victory for ultraconservative Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi .

The man in his 60s was "arrested and handed over to Russia " after fleeing to the United Arab Emirates , while a suspected accomplice was arrested in Moscow and another escaped to Ukraine , Russian media quoted the FSB as saying.

Several high-ranking military officials have been assassinated in Russia and in Moscow-controlled Ukrainian territory since Russia launched its full-scale military offensive against its neighbour in February 2022.

Alekseyev, the deputy head of Russia's GRU military intelligence service, was shot in a Moscow apartment on Friday and admitted to hospital.

He is under Western sanctions for his alleged role in cyberattacks and the organisation of a nerve agent attack on Russian defector Sergei Skripal in Britain in 2018.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has accused Ukraine of masterminding the shooting.

Kyiv, which has claimed responsibility for the killing of several high-ranking Russian military officials since the start of the war, has not commented in this case.

A Ukrainian-born Russian citizen has been extradited to Moscow from Dubai on suspicion of gravely injuring one of Russia's most senior military intelligence officers, Russian security officials and investigators said on Sunday.</description><pubDate>Sun, 08 Feb 2026 14:55:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/ddd243fa-035c-11f1-8be3-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-02-06T095506Z-957008641-RC29GJAG8DOG-RTRMADP-3-UKRAINE-CRISIS-RUSSIA-SHOOTING.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Latest Epstein files reveal disgraced financier's Silicon Valley connections</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/latest-epstein-files-reveal-disgraced-financier-s-silicon-valley-connections</link><description>The trove of documents, which includes emails, calendars and internal correspondence, shows that the late Epstein cultivated relationships with leading tech leaders and executives throughout the early to mid-2010s.

Names appearing in the records include Elon Musk, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, LinkedIn's Reid Hoffman, PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and more.

None have been accused of participating in Epstein’s abuse or the trafficking of minors, but the material provides unprecedented detail about how Epstein embedded himself in elite tech circles - through introductions, scheduling, group emails and investment activity.

The New York Times reported Thursday that Epstein wasn’t just socialising with tech executives but invested alongside them, including millions in early crypto exchange Coinbase and tens of millions through funds linked to Thiel, even after his 2008 sex crime conviction.

Emails also showed Musk asking about visiting Epstein’s private island in 2012 and 2013, despite later saying he refused invitations. Musk and Hoffman have since publicly clashed on the SpaceX CEO's platform X over their past associations.

Meanwhile, Bill Gates has voiced regret over "every minute" spent with Epstein, even as the Microsoft co-founder's former wife, Melinda, said he still had questions to answer over his relationship with the disgraced financier.</description><pubDate>Sun, 08 Feb 2026 15:51:42 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/ccb90b54-04ff-11f1-962c-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/Anglais-2026-02-08T14-10-48-074Z.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UK PM Starmer’s chief of staff quits over Mandelson links to Epstein</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260208-uk-pm-starmer-s-chief-of-staff-quits-over-mandelson-links-to-epstein</link><description>Embattled British Prime Minister Keir Starmer 's chief of staff resigned on Sunday over the appointment of Peter Mandelson as ambassador to Washington despite links to convicted US sex offender Jeffrey Epstein .

"After careful reflection, I have decided to resign from the government. The decision to appoint Peter Mandelson was wrong. He has damaged our party, our country and trust in politics itself," Morgan McSweeney, Downing Street's chief of staff, said in a statement.

"I advised the Prime Minister to make that appointment, and I take full responsibility for that advice," he added.

The resignation came as the foreign ministry said it was reviewing an exit payment to Mandelson, who was sacked by the Labour premier last September over his friendship with the late Epstein .

Mandelson, a pivotal figure in British politics and the Labour Party for decades, received an estimated payout of between £38,750 and £55,000 ($52,000 to $74,000) after only seven months in the job, according to a report in the Sunday Times.

Documents released on January 30 by the US Justice Department appear to show that Mandelson allegedly leaked confidential UK government information to financier Epstein when he was a British minister, including during the 2008 financial crisis .

The revelation has placed intense pressure on Starmer and triggered a police investigation into Mandelson, 72, for alleged misconduct in a public office.

The Foreign Office said in a statement it had launched a review into Mandelson's severance payment "in light of further information that has now been revealed and the ongoing police investigation".

Cabinet minister Pat McFadden earlier insisted Starmer should remain in office despite his "terrible mistake" in appointing Mandelson.

The close Starmer ally told broadcasters the party should stick with the prime minister.

"He (Starmer) should be realistic and accept that this has been a terrible story, that this appointment was a terrible mistake," McFadden, the Work and Pensions Secretary, told BBC television.

He said the real blame lay "squarely with Peter Mandelson", who put himself forward for the job despite knowing the extent of his relationship with Epstein.

Starmer's deputy, David Lammy, became the first cabinet minister to appear to distance himself from the premier, according to a report in the Sunday Telegraph.

The deputy prime minister had not been in favour of appointing Mandelson, a pivotal figure in British politics for decades, due to his known links to Epstein, the report quoted friends of Lammy as saying.

Starmer's Labour Party took power just over 18 months ago in a landslide election victory.

But it has been trailing Nigel Farage 's anti-immigrant Reform UK as the government has come under fire over immigration, economic growth and the cost of living crisis.

Reform UK has led by double-digit figures in the polls for the past year.

Mandelson, also a former European Union trade commissioner, stood down from parliament's unelected upper chamber, the House of Lords, earlier this week.

The ex-envoy was one of numerous prominent figures further embarrassed by last week's latest revelations of ties to financier Epstein, who died in jail in 2019 while facing charges of alleged sex trafficking.

US officials ruled Epstein's death a suicide.

A spokesperson for law firm Mishcon de Reya, representing Mandelson, said he "regrets, and will regret until his dying day, that he believed Epstein's lies about his criminality".

"Lord Mandelson did not discover the truth about Epstein until after his death in 2019. He is profoundly sorry that powerless and vulnerable women and girls were not given the protection they deserved," the law firm said.

Starmer paid tribute to McSweeney in a statement. It was "largely thanks to his dedication, loyalty and leadership that we won a landslide majority" in the 2024 election, he said.

"Our party and I owe him a debt of gratitude, and I thank him for his service," he added.</description><pubDate>Sun, 08 Feb 2026 16:31:31 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/4796794e-0503-11f1-aeaa-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26036440795144.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Thailand PM Anutin’s party leads snap election, rejects coalition bid</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260208-thailand-pm-anutin-s-party-leads-snap-election-rejects-coalition-bid</link><description>Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul 's party was far ahead in Sunday's general election , leading a three-way race with a commanding margin that could make it easier to form a coalition and reduce the ​risk of further political instability.

Anutin set the stage for the snap election in mid-December during a border conflict between ‍Thailand and Cambodia, a move political analysts said appeared to be timed by the conservative leader to cash in on surging nationalism.

At that point, he had been in power ​for less than 100 days, taking over after the ouster of Premier Paetongtarn Shinawatra of the populist Pheu ​Thai Party over the Cambodian crisis.

With nearly 80% of polling stations reporting, preliminary results released by the election commission showed Anutin's Bhumjaithai Party with a sizeable lead over the progressive People's Party in second place, followed by the Pheu Thai Party.

People's Party leader Natthaphong Rueangpanyawut said that while votes remained to be counted, his party did not look likely to win.

Natthaphong said the party would not join a Bhumjaithai-led government but would also not form a competing coalition. "If Bhumjaithai can form a government, then we have to be the opposition," Natthaphong told ‍a press conference.

With a message of structural change and reforms to Southeast Asia's second-largest economy, the People's Party had led most opinion polls during the campaign season.

But in a ​survey conducted during the campaign's final week and released on Sunday, the National Institute for Development

Administration projected that Bhumjaithai would be the winner with between 140 and 150 seats in the 500-member House of Representatives, ahead of 125-135 for the People's ‌Party.

"We have done everything that we can," Anutin told reporters after casting his vote in Bhumjaithai's stronghold of Buriram city, northeast of the capital, Bangkok. "We hope the people will have confidence in us."

Thai voters ‍were also asked during the vote to decide if a new constitution should replace a 2017 charter, a military-backed document that critics say concentrated power in undemocratic institutions, including a powerful senate that is chosen through an indirect selection process with limited public participation.

The election commission's early count showed voters backing the referendum by a margin of nearly two to one. Thailand has had 20 constitutions since the end of absolute monarchy in 1932, with most of the changes following military coups.

If voters back the drafting of a new national charter, the new government and lawmakers can ‍start the amendment process in parliament with two more referendums required to adopt a new constitution.

"I believe that the party that wins in the next election will ‌have an outsized influence ​on the direction of constitutional reform, whether we move away from the junta-drafted constitution or not," said Napon Jatusripitak of the Bangkok-based Thailand Future think tank.</description><pubDate>Sun, 08 Feb 2026 17:26:21 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/632ebbbe-0510-11f1-93bc-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26039569318072.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Betting on catastrophe: the dizzying rise of prediction markets</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/economy/20260208-betting-catastrophe-dizzying-rise-prediction-markets</link><description>Only a handful of people in the world knew what was going to happen in the early hours of January 3, before ‘Operation Absolute Resolve’ was launched. The extraordinary two-hour-and-twenty-minute military intervention by air, land and sea culminated in the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife. It was a top-secret operation, which stunned the world.

But a hint of what was to occur emerged in the online, crypto-based prediction market portal Polymarket, where anonymous users bet on real world events. User 0x31a56e wagered $32,537 that Maduro would be out of power by the end of January when the odds of that happening on the afternoon of January 2 were placed at just 6.5% . By midnight, those odds jumped to 11% and surged just before the operation was executed. The suspiciously timed bet paid off – anonymous user 0x31a56e made a neat profit upwards of $436,000 in just one night . The account has since vanished .

This odd incident pushed the online prediction market – which was growing but still fairly niche – into the mainstream spotlight. These are platforms where people can bet on the outcome of an enormous variety of future events – from the common (who will win the Super Bowl) to the bizarre (will Jesus be resurrected in 2026). These companies insist that they are not gambling portals, but legitimate financial markets, a chimera of a stock exchange and a crypto platform (though some watchdogs disagree ).

Two players, Kalshi and Polymarket, have dominated the space in recent years. Of a total volume of $44 billion in prediction markets in 2025, Kalshi and Polymarket were responsible for a combined total of $38 billion: one of the fastest growing financial markets is one that most people ignore, or don’t know about.

Trades on these websites are not to be confused with polls, insists Polymarket’s precocious founder Shayne Coplan, in an interview with 60 Minutes . Coplan, who founded the company in 2020 when he was just 21 years old, said that Polymarket tries to predict actual outcomes – "You make money if you're right. You lose money if you're wrong. And as a result it creates this information that's useful for people."

Some people have profited from making informed wagers – including a prolific, successful Polymarket trader who goes by the name Domer and features in the same 60 Minutes report. The former professional poker player moved to Polymarket because it was ‘more exciting’. He won over $100,000 predicting an American Pope , and even more after he picked JD Vance to be Donald Trump 's presidential running mate. Domer went against the odds because he believed US President Donald Trump likes one syllable names because “he (Trump) is very into marketing”.

Even established media outlets like CNN and CNBC have struck deals to incorporate Kalshi prediction markets into coverage.

But prediction markets do not come without an enormous share of criticism. Polymarket, specifically, has been at the root of controversy because it relies on cryptocurrency and blockchain to run.

Users like 0x31a56e, who predicted Maduro’s capture, can trade anonymously, without being traced. While it is possible that they just got very lucky, analysts say it’s far more likely that someone with inside information realised they could make a quick buck. On crypto-native platforms, there’s no real way of knowing.

It’s because of this reason that in most of Europe, where a patchwork of rules must be adhered to, Polymarket is not legal or easily accessible . Some countries treat prediction markets as gambling, and the ones that do not still require licensing. Regulators are wary, with good reason.

Prediction markets were also heavily regulated under the Biden administration, but under President Trump, these sites have profited from deregulation and a huge boom in power.

But critics are concerned about the platforms commodifying real world events and encouraging people to bet on political, military and diplomatic events that have real-world consequences.

Maduro is only one example of a litany of shady trades made on prediction markets. Hours before the announcement of Nobel Peace Prize winner María Corina Machado, one user bet thousands in her favour: the likelihood of her winning leapt from 3.75 percent to nearly 73 percent within two hours – prompting authorities in Norway to open an investigation.

Similarly, in early January, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt ended her briefing after 64 minutes and 30 seconds. Her abrupt exit left traders wondering whether Leavitt had deliberately stopped before the 65-minute mark to turn a profit. Polymarket had predicted at 98 percent odds that the briefing would run past 65 minutes.

Alex Goldenberg, an intelligence analyst and fellow at the Miller Center on Policing and Community Resilience at Rutgers University, says the signs are clear: “Across these cases, a consistent pattern emerges: new accounts with no trading history taking high-conviction, low-probability positions hours before those events occur. These aren't gradual market movements reflecting evolving public information. They bear the textbook signatures of insider trading in traditional financial markets.”

The point of these markets is to reward people with superior information i.e., those who collect the right data and analyse accurately could stand to make money. There’s nothing inherently wrong with that, he says, but there’s a fine line between analysis and inside information. “Scale that logic to domains governed by secrecy: military operations, covert action, diplomatic negotiations. In those domains, ‘superior information’ means access to classified or non-public knowledge. The platform architecture doesn't distinguish between a well-informed analyst and someone with a security clearance who just walked out of a briefing.”

Prediction markets’ blurry lines can also create serious problems for national security.

One account, originally named RicoSauve666 and later Rundeep, bet on several operations connected to Israeli military action with extremely consistent outcomes . Israel Defense Forces and the Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet ) ultimately opened an investigation into the user.

“The high-conviction, low-probability trades we saw before the Venezuela operation and Israeli strikes bear the hallmarks of someone with access monetizing what they know,” says Goldenberg. “That's privatizing state secrets. Diplomats, military personnel, intelligence analysts, contractors, and anyone in the national security apparatus now has a potential avenue to monetize non-public, sensitive information for personal profit.”

Dangerous biases can occur when an outcome is presumed – Goldenberg presents a hypothesis: “Suppose the US is about to carry out an operation against Iran and multiple high-conviction, low-probability bets suddenly appear on a prediction market that it's going to happen tomorrow,” he posits. “You've potentially given an adversary advance notice of an operation through publicly visible market activity.

"An adversary placing large bets on specific military outcomes can create a situation where we ask ourselves, does someone know something? That alone sows confusion and distorts decision-making."

The predictions on these platforms are visible to anyone. Diplomatic, geopolitical and military decisions could potentially be made on assumed outcomes – which could be particularly dangerous if these markets can be manipulated.

“When a prediction market shows odds on a US strike suddenly jumping, that movement could become news. Media reports it, policymakers see it. The market doesn't just predict. It shapes perception.”

This is a far greater risk on crypto native platforms like Polymarket, where trades take place anonymously, often in offshore jurisdictions. They are extremely difficult to trace back to an individual.  “Who investigates? Which jurisdiction applies?” asks Goldenberg. “Today, the honest answer is that in many cases, they wouldn't be caught. Several countries, including France , have already concluded these platforms can't be adequately regulated and banned them outright.”

There’s also the important question of who runs the market themselves: the US president's son Donald Trump Jr. is an adviser to both Kalshi and Polymarket . His venture capital firm 1789 invested an undisclosed “double-digit millions of dollars” into Polymarket in 2025. Polymarket’s founder sees this as a positive – saying in an interview , “This admin is very pro-innovation, and pro-crypto, and pro-Polymarket, which is amazing… I'm a young entrepreneur. If I have people who believe in what I do, who understand how politics works and can help me… there's nothing wrong about that.”

Furthermore, Trump Media and Technology Group, the owner of the president’s social-media platform, Truth Social, has announced its own platform, Truth Predict .

There are real, human consequences of turning the world into one big casino where serious events with real repercussions are being reduced to a set of numbers. “When you're looking at a screen that says 'Will Country X invade Country Y by March 31? Yes/No', you're interacting with an abstraction. But the underlying event involves air strikes, casualties, displaced populations. The platform strips away human reality and replaces it with a contract and a price,” says Goldenberg.

“It fundamentally changes civic discourse. Instead of asking ‘should we strike’, which is a moral and strategic question, we're asking ‘what are the odds we strike’. We've taken events with real human consequences and made them feel like any other financial instrument. That normalization is worth paying attention to."</description><pubDate>Sun, 08 Feb 2026 17:26:22 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/2d77159e-0389-11f1-a5b3-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25308629933285.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran sentences Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi to six years in prison</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260208-iran-sentences-nobel-peace-prize-laureate-narges-mohammadi-to-six-years-in-prison</link><description>An Iranian court sentenced Nobel Peace Prize winner Narges Mohammadi to a six-year prison term, her lawyer told AFP on Sunday.

"She has been sentenced to six years in prison for gathering and collusion to commit crimes," lawyer Mostafa Nili said, adding that she had also received a two-year ban on leaving the country.

Mohammadi was also handed a one-and-a-half-year prison sentence for propaganda activities and is to be exiled for two years to the city of Khosf in the eastern province of South Khorasan, the lawyer stated.

Under Iranian law, jail sentences run concurrently.

Nili expressed hope that due to Mohammadi's health issues, she could be temporarily "released on bail to receive treatment". Nili, who was able to speak briefly with his client for the very first time nearly two months after her arrest, "was not informed that this unfair trial was taking place," said her lawyer in France, Chirinne Ardakani.

He added that the verdict issued was not final and could be appealed.

Over the past quarter-century, Mohammadi, 53, has been repeatedly tried and jailed for her vocal campaigning against Iran 's use of capital punishment and the mandatory dress code for women.

Mohammadi has spent much of the past decade behind bars and has not seen her twin children, who live in Paris, since 2015.

In December 2024, she was released on medical grounds, initially for three weeks, due to "her physical condition after the removal of a tumour and a bone graft", according to her lawyer.

However, she ultimately spent much of last year outside of custody, continuing to make statements in spite of her lawyers' fears she could be sent back to prison any time.

On December 12, Mohammadi was arrested in the northeastern city of Mashhad with other activists after speaking at a ceremony honouring a lawyer who had been found dead.

Even behind bars, the Nobel laureate has not been silent, staging protests in the prison yard and going on hunger strikes.

Born in the northwestern city of Zanjan in 1972, Mohammadi studied physics and pursued a career in engineering alongside work as a journalist for several reformist media outlets.

In the 2000s, she joined the Defenders of Human Rights Center set up by 2003 Nobel Peace Prize winner Shirin Ebadi, an organisation of which Mohammadi remains vice president.

She was jailed from May 2015 to October 2020 for "forming and leading an illegal group", campaigning for the abolition of the death penalty in Iran.

Mohammadi won the peace prize in 2023, primarily for her advocacy against capital punishment. Her children collected the award on her behalf, as she was in prison at the time.

Polls by the country’s three main broadcasters suggested the moderate Seguro won a five-year term in Lisbon’s riverside “pink palace” with around 70% of the votes, compared with about 30% for Ventura. Most official results were expected by 11 p.m.

The ballot was an opportunity to test the depth of support for Ventura’s brash style, which has struck a chord with voters and helped make his Chega (Enough) party the second-biggest in the Portuguese parliament, as well as gauge the public appetite for Europe’s increasing shift to the right in recent years.

Seguro, a longstanding Socialist politician, positioned himself as a moderate candidate who will cooperate with Portugal’s centre-right minority government, repudiating Ventura’s anti-establishment and anti-immigrant tirades.

He won the backing of other mainstream politicians on the left and right who want to halt the rising populist tide.

In Portugal , the president is largely a figurehead with no executive power. Traditionally, the head of state stands above the political fray, mediating disputes and defusing tensions.

However, the president is an influential voice and possesses some powerful tools, being able to veto legislation from parliament, although the veto can be overturned. The head of state also possesses what in Portuguese political jargon is called an “atomic bomb,” the power to dissolve parliament and call early elections .

In May, Portugal held its third general election in three years in the country's worst bout of political instability for decades, and steadying the ship is a key challenge for the next president.

Ventura, an eloquent and theatrical politician, has rejected political accommodation in favour of a more combative stance.

Making it through to the runoff was already a milestone for Ventura and his party, which have recalibrated Portuguese politics.

One of Ventura's main targets has been what he calls excessive immigration, as foreign workers have become more conspicuous in Portugal in recent years.

“Portugal is ours,” he said.

During the campaign, Ventura put up billboards across the country saying, “This isn’t Bangladesh” and “Immigrants shouldn’t be allowed to live on welfare.”

Although he founded his party less than seven years ago, its surge in public support made it the second-largest party in Portugal’s parliament in the May 18 general election.

In March, the winner will replace centre-right President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, who has served the constitutional limit of two five-year terms.</description><pubDate>Sun, 08 Feb 2026 20:54:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/08352b80-052e-11f1-a996-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-02-06T224605Z-790890318-RC2LGJAK03E3-RTRMADP-3-PORTUGAL-ELECTION-PRESIDENT.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Flash floods sweep northern Morocco, killing at least four including toddler</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/africa/20260208-flash-floods-sweep-northern-morocco-killing-at-least-four-including-toddler</link><description>Four people including a two-year-old child died after being swept away by floods in northern Morocco , authorities said on Sunday, adding that a fifth person was missing.

The Moroccan authorities had, until this point, not reported any casualties, but said they had evacuated over 150,000 people since the flooding started.

The four dead were in a car in Tetouan when the vehicle was caught in "sudden flooding" on a road near a major river, officials said in a statement.

Search teams first recovered the bodies of a 14-year-old girl and the two-year-old child on Saturday night, the statement said.

Two more bodies, those of a 12-year-old boy and a man in this thirties, were found on Sunday morning.

The search for the fifth person was ongoing, the statement added.

Anticipation was high for the 31-year-old's set, amid rampant speculation about whether he would use his platform to renew his criticism of the Trump administration's immigration crackdown in front of tens of millions of viewers.

But the wildly popular musician, whose real name is Benito Antonio Martinez Ocasio, instead made good on his pre-game promise to joyously share his culture – and largely avoided overt political statements in favor of subtle messaging through symbols.

In a set featuring a sugar cane plantation, a traditional "piragua" cart selling treats, and even a wedding, he opened with "Titi Me Pregunto" and feminist anthem "Yo Perreo Sola," with a cast of dancers fueling the party atmosphere.

Actors Pedro Pascal and Jessica Alba, and rapper Cardi B were among the guest stars vibing in his familiar "La Casita" backdrop, representing a home in Puerto Rico .

Bad Bunny wore an all-white ensemble, with a football jersey featuring the number "64" and "Ocasio," before donning a classy suit jacket.

He delved into more political territory with "El Apagon" (Blackout), which touches on the displacement of Puerto Ricans on their own island, and the constant problems caused by the unreliable power grid. He carried a Puerto Rican flag at one point.

The performance also included a young boy watching the Grammys on an old television set. Bad Bunny, who won the Album of the Year prize a week ago, presented the child – perhaps a younger version of himself – with a golden gramophone.

The internet went wild with unverified rumors that the child was Liam Conejo Ramos, a five-year-old Ecuadoran boy recently detained by US immigration agents in Minnesota.

An NFL spokesman confirmed to AFP that the boy was an actor, and an Instagram post seemingly from the child in question, Lincoln Fox, was hashtagged #youngbadbunny.

Surprise musical guests included Lady Gaga, who sang a Latin-inflected version of her hit "Die with a Smile" – the only English lyrics in the show – and Puerto Rican singer Ricky Martin.

At the Grammys, Bad Bunny made a searing statement about Trump's sweeping immigration crackdown, earning cheers for saying "ICE out" from the stage.

But on Sunday, he did not call out the Republican president.

At the end of the set, after listing Latin American countries, Puerto Rico, the United States and Canada, Bad Bunny spiked a football that said "Together, we are America."

A giant screen in the stadium read: "The only thing more powerful than hate is love."

Trump nevertheless quickly took issue with the performance, saying: "Nobody understands a word this guy is saying" – even though government data shows more than 41 million Americans speak Spanish.

Posting on his Truth Social account, he called the show "an affront to the Greatness of America."

Bad Bunny has been Spotify's most-streamed artist in the world four separate times, including last year, and won Album of the Year at the Grammys with "Debi Tirar Mas Fotos" – the first Spanish-language work to win music's highest accolade.

But the decision to showcase his work at the Super Bowl in California was met with conservative outrage – specifically about the idea that he would not sing in English.

The NFL entered into an agreement in 2019 with Jay-Z's entertainment company Roc Nation, which leads the league's entertainment strategy.

Since that time, the list of Super Bowl headliners included Jennifer Lopez and Shakira (with a guest spot for Bad Bunny), but the duo did not perform exclusively in Spanish, leaving Bad Bunny to set that benchmark.

Bad Bunny grew up in Vega Baja, a small municipality near Puerto Rico's capital San Juan.

He was working at a supermarket bagging groceries when he got a call from a label over his viral plays on the DIY platform SoundCloud.

Thus began the reggaeton star's rapid explosion to the top of global music.

Late last year, Bad Bunny released "Debi Tirar Mas Fotos," a history lesson in Puerto Rican music that he promoted with a hometown concert residency in San Juan and a world tour.

In Puerto Rico, a US territory since 1898, there was nothing but pride for the island's native son.

"For someone from here to be at one of the most important events in the United States is a source of pride for every Puerto Rican," Olvin Reyes, 39, told AFP.</description><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 06:07:02 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/75e93c28-055d-11f1-bfbc-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/76a4a2dfd576befa1c969cbfe1f39e8037472874.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Hong Kong sentences pro-democracy mogul Jimmy Lai to 20 years in jail</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260208-hong-kong-sentences-pro-democracy-mogul-jimmy-lai-to-20-years-in-jail</link><description>A Hong Kong court sentenced pro-democracy media mogul Jimmy Lai to 20 years in prison on Monday for national security crimes, a punishment rights groups condemned as "effectively a death sentence" and a symbol of the city's shrivelling press freedoms.

The 78-year-old founder of the now-defunct Apple Daily newspaper was found guilty in December on two counts of foreign collusion under a sweeping national security law imposed by Beijing , as well as one count of seditious publication.

His sentence is by far the harshest handed out under the national security law, surpassing the previous record of 10 years given to legal scholar Benny Tai in 2024.

A summary document from the judges said they had settled on 20 years' imprisonment "after considering the serious and grave criminal conduct of Lai".

Two of those years will overlap with Lai's existing prison term, meaning that he will serve an additional 18 years, the judges wrote.

Lai, who has been behind bars since 2020, sat impassively in the dock as his sentence was read out, an AFP journalist in the court saw.

As he was led away, he waved solemnly to people in the public gallery, including his wife Teresa, former Hong Kong bishop Cardinal Joseph Zen, and former Apple Daily reporters.

His defence lawyer Robert Pang declined to comment on whether Lai would lodge an appeal, which can be done in the next 28 days.

Asked if the sentence was in line with expectations, Pang told AFP: "In these times I don't know what to expect."

Teresa Lai was grim-faced during the hearing and made no comment as she left the court, but their children, who live abroad, condemned the sentence in a statement.

"Sentencing my father to this draconian prison sentence is devastating for our family and life-threatening for my father," Lai's son Sebastien said.

His daughter Claire called it "a heartbreakingly cruel sentence" given his declining health in prison, and if carried out, "he will die a martyr behind bars".

Rights groups also said Lai's punishment amounted to a grave injustice.

"The harsh 20-year sentence against 78-year-old Jimmy Lai is effectively a death sentence. A sentence of this magnitude is both cruel and profoundly unjust," Elaine Pearson, Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement.

Amnesty International called the case "another grim milestone in Hong Kong's transformation from a city governed by the rule of law to one ruled by fear".

Jodie Ginsberg, the CEO of the Committee to Protect Journalists, said "today's egregious decision is the final nail in the coffin for freedom of the press in Hong Kong".

Britain's Keir Starmer previously said he had raised the issue of Lai, a British citizen, during his meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Beijing last month, while US President Donald Trump has also called for his release.

Taiwan said Lai's sentencing created a "chilling effect" across borders and "tramples on freedom of speech".

Under the national security law, the self-ruled island's Mainland Affairs Council added, Hong Kong's judiciary "has been reduced to a tool for political suppression and the purging of dissent".

Beijing has dismissed critics as smearing Hong Kong's judicial system, while Hong Kong authorities say Lai's case "has nothing to do with freedom of speech and of the press".

National security police welcomed the 20-year sentence, telling reporters it indicated the "very serious nature" of Lai's case and was "well-deserved".

Dozens of former Apple Daily employees and others braved the cold to queue overnight outside the West Kowloon court for a spot in court, while journalists gathered outside the building's entrance.

The mood was tense as police deployed dozens of officers, an armoured car and a bomb disposal van to the area.

"I think this is equivalent to sentencing Lai to life imprisonment," Lam Ying-kit, a former history teacher in his 50s, told AFP.

Lai's supporters, children, lawyers and rights groups have all raised concerns about his deteriorating health in prison.

Lai was kept in solitary confinement at his own request to avoid harassment, according to prosecutors, while authorities maintain he receives "adequate" care.

Long a thorn in Beijing's side, Lai was prosecuted under the national security law imposed by China on Hong Kong in 2020, following huge pro-democracy protests.

Apple Daily was forced to close in 2021 following police raids.

Eight other defendants, including six Apple Daily executives, are due to be sentenced alongside Lai on Monday, all of whom pleaded guilty.

As of the start of the month, Hong Kong had arrested a total of 386 people for various national security crimes, with 176 of them being convicted.</description><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 06:07:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/9a38bc14-3c38-11eb-b27b-005056bf18d4/w:1280/p:16x9/d4101a6e66cc19a370ccddd5cfc17bf9aeb6d9ad.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Live: Russia pummels Ukraine's Odesa and Kharkiv with deadly drone strikes</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260209-live-russia-pummels-ukraine-odesa-kharkiv-deadly-drone-strikes</link><description>Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) has accused the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) of ordering the attempted assassination of General Vladimir Alexeyev in Moscow last week, the Interfax news agency reports.

A Ukrainian-born Russian citizen has been extradited to Moscow from Dubai on suspicion of gravely injuring Alexeyev, Russian security officials said on Sunday.

In the northeastern Kharkiv region, state emergency services said they recovered the bodies of a woman and a 10-year-old boy after a Russian drone attack.

"Three more people were wounded," the services added in a post on Telegram.

Farther south in Odesa, local officials said drone attacks killed a 35-year-old man and injured two others.

Overnight Russian strikes on Odesa and Kharkiv killed at least three people, Ukrainian officials said early Monday.

The attacks come days after Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky said US President Donald Trump had given the warring sides until June to find a deal on ending the conflict triggered by Russia's invasion in 2022.

Her claim about the former National Assembly vice president Juan Pablo Guanipa's kidnap came after his release from prison on Sunday along with two other opposition figures.

The alleged incident comes as lawmakers prepare to vote Tuesday on a historic amnesty law covering charges used to lock up dissidents during almost three decades of socialist rule.

"A few minutes ago, Juan Pablo Guanipa was kidnapped in the Los Chorros neighborhood of Caracas. Heavily armed men dressed in civilian clothes arrived in four vehicles and took him away by force," she posted on social media platform X shortly after midnight on Monday.

"We demand his immediate release."

Guanipa had appeared earlier on Sunday in a video posted on his X account, showing what looked like his release papers.

"Here we are, being released," Guanipa said in the video, adding that he had spent "10 months in hiding, almost nine months detained here" in Caracas.

Speaking to AFP later on Sunday, he had called on the government to respect the 2024 presidential election, which opposition candidate Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia was widely considered to have won. Maduro claimed victory and remained in power till January.

"Let's respect it. That's the basic thing, that's the logical thing. Oh, you don't want to respect it? Then let's go to an electoral process," Guanipa said.

The opposition ally of Machado was arrested in May 2025, in connection with an alleged conspiracy to undermine legislative and regional elections that were boycotted by the opposition.

He was charged with terrorism, money laundering and incitement to violence and hatred.

Guanipa had been in hiding prior to his arrest. He was last seen in public in January 2025, when he accompanied Machado to an anti-Maduro rally.

Following Maduro's capture by US special forces on January 3, authorities have started to slowly release political prisoners. Rights groups estimate that around 700 people are still waiting to be freed.

A former Machado legal advisor, Perkins Rocha, was also freed on Sunday. So was Freddy Superlano, who once won a gubernatorial election in Barinas, a city that is the home turf of the iconic late socialist leader Hugo Chavez.

"We hugged at home," Rocha's wife Maria Constanza Cipriani wrote on X, with a photo of them.

Machado, who was awarded the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize for her efforts to advance democracy in Venezuela, had initially celebrated Guanipa's release.

"My dear Juan Pablo, counting down the minutes until I can hug you! You are a hero, and history will ALWAYS recognize it. Freedom for ALL political prisoners!!" she wrote on X on Sunday.

NGO Foro Penal said it had confirmed the release of 35 prisoners on Sunday. It said that since January 8 nearly 400 people arrested for political reasons have been freed thus far.

Lawmakers gave their initial backing to a draft amnesty last week which covered the types of crimes used to lock up dissidents during 27 years of socialist rule.

But Venezuela's largest opposition coalition denounced "serious omissions" in the proposed amnesty measures on Friday.

Meanwhile, relatives of prisoners are growing increasingly impatient for their loved ones to be freed.

Acting President Delcy Rodriguez , who was Maduro's vice president, is pushing the amnesty bill as a milestone on the path to reconciliation.

Rodriguez took power in Venezuela with the blessing of US President Donald Trump , who is eyeing American access to what are the world's largest proven oil reserves.

As part of its reforms, Rodriguez's government has taken steps towards opening up the oil industry and restoring diplomatic ties with Washington, which were severed by Maduro in 2019.</description><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 07:38:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/52c6e31a-0523-11f1-8498-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/96ff5642646aac44834fbdff55d984164331f2a1.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'Curtain falls on Hong Kong press freedom': Jimmy Lai prison sentence sparks outcry</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260209-curtain-falls-on-hong-kong-press-freedom-jimmy-lai-prison-sentence-sparks-outcry</link><description>Hong Kong pro-democracy media tycoon Jimmy Lai was sentenced on Monday to 20 years in prison for foreign collusion and sedition, the harshest penalty yet under a Beijing-imposed national security law .

The 78-year-old founder of the now-defunct Apple Daily newspaper has been behind bars since 2020.

Here are some key reactions:

Jimmy Lai's son Sebastien said in a statement: "Sentencing my father to this draconian prison sentence is devastating for our family and life-threatening for my father."

His daughter Claire added: "This is a heartbreakingly cruel sentence. Over the last five years, I have watched my father's health deteriorate dramatically and the conditions he's kept in go from bad to worse. If this sentence is carried out, he will die a martyr behind bars."

Hong Kong leader John Lee said Lai's crimes were "heinous and evil in the extreme".

"(Lai's) heavy sentence of 20 years' imprisonment demonstrates the rule of law, upholds justice and is deeply gratifying," Lee said in a statement.

Lin Jian, spokesperson of China's foreign ministry, said Lai was a Chinese citizen and was "a key planner and participant in a series of anti-China and disruptive activities in Hong Kong".

"This is reasonable, legitimate, and legal; there is no room for argument," Lin said at a press briefing.

Britain's Foreign Minister Yvette Cooper said Lai's penalty was "tantamount to a life sentence" and reiterated calls for the tycoon's release on humanitarian grounds.

"Following today's sentencing we will rapidly engage further on Mr Lai's case. We stand with the people of Hong Kong," Cooper added.

The European Union said it "deplores" Lai's sentencing and called for his "immediate and unconditional release".

"The EU calls on the Hong Kong authorities to restore confidence in press freedom in Hong Kong... and to stop prosecuting journalists," EU foreign affairs spokesperson Anitta Hipper said.

Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong urged China to "cease suppression of freedoms" and repeal Hong Kong's national security law.

"The Australian Government is gravely concerned by the sentences handed down to Jimmy Lai and his co-defendants in Hong Kong today.

"We continue to call on China to ​cease suppression of freedoms of expression, assembly, media and civil society, consistent with UN Human Rights Committee recommendations, and to call for the repeal of ​the national security law in Hong Kong."

Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council said in a statement that China and Hong Kong "have brought media influence and international connections within the scope of national security measures, aiming to create a chilling effect across sectors and borders".

Thibaut Bruttin, director general of Reporters Without Borders (RSF), said Lai's case was "nothing more than a sham".

"Today, the curtain falls on press freedom in Hong Kong. We are outraged by the harsh sentences handed down to Jimmy Lai," Bruttin said in a statement.

"Democracies, such as the UK and the US, must stop prioritising the normalisation of relations with China and instead exert pressure on the Chinese regime and Hong Kong authorities to ensure that Jimmy Lai and all other journalists are released from prison," he added.

Lai's 20-year jail term is tantamount to a death sentence, said Elaine Pearson, Asia Director at Human Rights Watch (HRW).

"The harsh 20-year sentence against 78-year-old Jimmy Lai is effectively a death sentence. A sentence of this magnitude is both cruel and profoundly unjust.

"Lai’s years of persecution show the Chinese government’s determination to crush independent journalism and silence anyone who dares to criticise the Communist Party."

Simon Young, a law professor at the University of Hong Kong, said the parts of Lai's sentencing related to foreign collusion "appear to be on the high side".

"I think the Court is wrong to say that (pre-national security law) conduct can be considered in assessing the gravity of the offences," Young told AFP.

Lai's legal team should consider an appeal of sentence, he added.</description><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 10:03:43 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/85b683b0-0597-11f1-9e57-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25349696240875.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ghislaine Maxwell to testify before US Congress in Epstein investigation</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260209-ghislaine-maxwell-testify-before-us-congress-in-epstein-investigation</link><description>Jeffrey Epstein 's accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell will be questioned behind closed doors by the US Congress on Monday, though she's expected to invoke her right to not answer questions.

Maxwell, currently serving 20 years in prison for trafficking girls to the disgraced financier Epstein, will face questions from prison via video-link, in a deposition by the House of Representatives' Oversight Committee.

Though no new US prosecutions are expected after the latest dump of government files on Epstein, numerous political and business leaders have fallen into scandal or resigned as their ties to the convicted sex criminal were revealed.

The Republican-led House Oversight Committee is probing Epstein's connections to powerful figures and how information about his crimes was handled.

Maxwell, however, is expected to invoke her right to not incriminate herself, guaranteed in the Fifth Amendment of the US Constitution.

Epstein was convicted in 2008 of soliciting a minor. His extensive ties to the world's rich and powerful, especially after he was released in 2009, have become politically explosive across the globe.

He died in prison in 2019 while awaiting trial for trafficking children in what was ruled a suicide.

Maxwell's lawyers have pushed for Congress to grant her legal immunity in order to testify in the deposition, but lawmakers refused.

Without that, her legal team said she would invoke her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.

"Proceeding under these circumstances would serve no other purpose than pure political theater," her lawyers said in a letter.

Though the deposition will occur behind closed doors, Representative Ro Khanna, a Democrat, published a letter of the questions he intended to ask Maxwell even if she refuses to answer.

Some touch on Trump's ties to Epstein and Maxwell.

Others focus on four "co-conspirators" as well as 25 other men who allegedly "sexually abused minors at Epstein's island".

One of the questions asks: "Why do you believe they were not indicted?"

Another question claims that it is "well documented" that Maxwell, Epstein and US President Donald Trump had a "social relationship", citing several photographs of the trio together.

It further probes whether she or Epstein ever "arranged, facilitated or provided access to underage girls" to Trump.

Beyond the trafficking charges, Maxwell will also be asked if she had any knowledge of Epstein sharing "information" with "foreign governments or intelligence services" with Russia and Israel used as examples.

As Maxwell prepares for the closed-door discussion, scrutiny of the Trump administration's handling of her case has again come under fire.

Last year Maxwell was moved to a minimum-security prison in Texas after meeting twice with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, who previously served as US President Donald Trump's personal lawyer.

Trump himself was a longtime Epstein associate, but has not been called to testify by the Oversight Committee, which is led by members of his Republican Party.

Trump has not been accused of criminal wrongdoing related to Epstein's activities.

Also expected to be deposed by the committee are former president Bill Clinton and his wife, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton , both Democrats.

The Clintons have called for their depositions to be held publicly to prevent Republicans from politicizing their testimony.</description><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 11:24:54 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/0ec4af60-05a2-11f1-8d84-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26034758403175.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Super Bowl 2026: Cultural takeaways and what it says about the USA today</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260209-super-bowl-2026-cultural-takeaways-and-what-it-says-about-the-usa-today</link><description>Super Bowl , the USA’s biggest annual sporting event, kicked off to a boring start, with NFL fans moaning about a defensive struggle between the Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots, which saw not a single touchdown in the first half of the game.

But if there was little excitement in the game, there were plenty outside the playing field. America’s most-watched television event is not just about sports, it’s about culture , and the 2026 Super Bowl once again captured the country’s zeitgeist.

Here are some of the non-sporting highlights of the world superpower’s one-night ode to competition, capitalism and entertainment.

The top Super Bowl cultural moment is never a rabbit-out-of-a-hat act, and this year, it was a pre-announced big bunny.

Puerto Rican superstar Benito Antonio Martinez Ocasio, aka “Bad Bunny”, took the stage at the Levi’s Stadium on Sunday exactly a week after he delivered his searing Grammy-winning speech blasting ICE and the Trump administration’s immigration policies.

But at the Super Bowl, the 31-year-old superstar opted for far more subtle messaging. Instead of calling out the Republican president’s xenophobia, Bad Bunny delivered a triumphant celebration of diversity, love and above all, a tribute to his self-governed Caribbean home that is part of US “commonwealth” territory.

Politics of subtility was on full display as Bad Bunny belted out "El Apagon" (Blackout), a song that underscored the hypocrisy of the term “commonwealth” since Puerto Ricans still face Third World problems of an unreliable energy grid – which powers their displacement to the mainland.

On Sunday, Bad Bunny’s surprise star guests included Lady Gaga, whose Latin-inflected version of her hit "Die with a Smile" featured the only English lyrics in the show.

The historic all-Spanish act earned President Donald Trump’s ire. "Nobody understands a word this guy is saying," said Trump on his Truth Social account, putting himself at odds with more than 41 million Americans who speak Spanish. The show, he noted, was “an affront to the Greatness of America".

California punk-pop vets Green Day took the pre-game stage this year to render a tribute to the Super Bowl's 60th edition.

Green Day lead singer and guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong has been around since the 1980s and is not one to mince his political words. The expectations were high, particularly since Armstrong, at a San Francisco event just days before the Super Bowl, called on ICE agents to “quit their shitty jobs”.

But on Sunday, Green Day opted to omit their political hard-hitters – much to the delight of Fox News . “Trump critics take issue with Green Day's Super Bowl LX performance,” read a Fox headline above an explanatory, “Trump critics wanted Green Day to criticize the president on the Super Bowl stage".

When the group launched into “Holiday”, Trump opponents were on alert for the group’s most political bridge, which begins with the line “Sieg Heil to the President Gasman”, a dig at former President George W. Bush , who was president when the song was released in 2004.

But on Sunday, the band just skipped the controversial bridge and wrapped up the song.

“Disappointing show,” said one fan on X . “Pretty cowardly if you ask me. I expected real protest from them.”

For those outside the US awaiting a mass national mobilisation against Trump – and watching the rollover of much of corporate America instead – it was a fitting statement of the current times in the land of the free.

The second Sunday of February draws millions of Americans to their TV sets to watch the ads, an important part of the Super Bowl cultural package. In 2025, a record 127.7 million US viewers watched the game across television and streaming platforms, which means advertisers are willing to cough up millions for a Super Bowl spot.

This year's Super Bowl ads cost an average of $8 million per 30-second unit, but a handful of spots sold for a record $10 million-plus, Peter Lazarus, who leads advertising and partnerships for NBC Sports, told AP.

Super Bowl ads generate headlines, data, expert commentary as well as debates about what they say about consumers and markets today.

The business pundits were in agreement even before kick-off on Sunday: Artificial Intelligence (AI) would dominate this year’s Super Bowl.

They were not wrong.

Super Bowl 2026 sparked an AI advertising war when Anthropic aired a pair of commercials pointing out that Claude, its chatbot, doesn't have ads.

Humour and wit are important components of American ads and the Anthropic commercial ticked all the boxes in its 30-second spot. The ad features a nerdy young man struggling with pull-ups while a muscular bystander watches. The sweating young man asks the brawny man about achieving “six-pack abs”. But the bystander instead delivers a plug for a product – delivered in soulless, robotic style and content.

The skinny man looks disappointed with the reply before the kicker line fills the screen: “Ads are coming to AI. But not to Claude”.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, the whiz behind ChatGPT , hit back at his competitor. In a long post on X, Altman said Anthropic was "clearly dishonest" and employed “doublespeak to use a deceptive ad to critique theoretical deceptive ads”.

Altman’s objections, alas, were not well received, with commentators on X noting that the Anthropic boss didn’t like the taste of his “ own medicine ” and that his reaction was “the digital equivalent of a toddler throwing a tantrum ".

Amazon this year struck a nerve with an ad starring actor Chris Hemsworth that pokes fun of people's fears of AI.  The ad ticked all the Super Bowl boxes, including a celebrity poking fun at technological anxiety.

But it didn’t go down well since it came days after Amazon founder Jeff Bezos fired journalists at the Washington Post, which he also owns, in addition to laying off 16,000 corporate workers, some of whom may be replaced with AI.

“I suspect this is meant to be funny,” Tim Calkins, a clinical professor of marketing at Northwestern University, told AP. “But it might reinforce some people’s very real concerns about AI.”</description><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 13:53:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/20c13178-0559-11f1-ad47-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-02-09T013651Z-1535292428-MT1USATODAY28190507-RTRMADP-3-NFL-SUPER-BOWL-LX-SEATTLE-SEAHAWKS-AT-NEW-ENGLAND-PATRIOTS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Japan's Takaichi vows 'major policy shift' after resounding election victory</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260209-japan-s-takaichi-vows-major-policy-shift-after-resounding-election-victory</link><description>Japanese premier Sanae Takaichi said Monday that the public saw an "urgent need" for major reform after a historic election landslide , pledging to boost the country's defences in order to protect its territory.

Sunday's snap vote saw Takaichi's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) win a two-thirds majority in the lower house for the first time in its history, capitalising on her strong popularity since taking office in October.

The outcome allows Japan 's first woman prime minister to stamp her mark on the country of 123 million people over the next four years, having pledged to boost the economy and get tough on immigration.

"This is the start of a heavy, heavy responsibility to make Japan stronger, more prosperous," Takaichi, 64, told a news conference on Monday.

"We believe that the public has shown understanding and sympathy regarding our appeals concerning the urgent need for a major policy shift," she said.

The admirer of "Iron Lady" Margaret Thatcher also said she would bolster Japan's defences, including through creating a new intelligence bureau and revising key security policy documents.

"No one will come to the aid of a nation that lacks the resolve to defend itself with its own hands," Takaichi said.

"We will steadfastly protect our nation's peace and independence, our territory, territorial waters, airspace, and the lives and safety of our citizens," she added.

Such comments are likely to go down badly in China – which has territorial disputes with Japan and others around the region – especially after Takaichi suggested in November that Japan could intervene militarily if Beijing sought to take Taiwan by force.

China, which regards the democratic island as part of its territory and has not ruled out force to annex it, was furious.

On Monday, a spokesman for China's foreign ministry again urged Japan to retract the comments.

Beijing warned Tokyo that "reckless" actions would be met with a "resolute response from the international community".

"Our nation is open to various dialogues with China. We already have exchanges of views. We will continue the exchanges of views. But we will deal with them in calm and appropriate ways," Takaichi said.

Capitalising on her honeymoon start after becoming Japan's fifth premier in as many years in October, Takaichi called the snap election last month.

The gamble paid off, with the LDP winning around 316 of the 465 seats contested, according to Japanese media.

That takes the party past the 310-seat threshold needed for a two-thirds majority for the first time in its history and may prompt the government to try and make changes to the country's constitution.

US President Donald Trump – who is due to host Takaichi in Washington next month – congratulated her after an earlier endorsement.

"I wish you Great Success in passing your Conservative, Peace Through Strength Agenda," Trump wrote on Truth Social.

Takaichi said that the talks on March 19 will "reaffirm the unshakeable unity between Japan and the United States".

A heavy metal drummer in her youth, Takaichi was on the ultra-conservative fringe of the LDP when she became party chief.

Despite being her country's first woman premier, Takaichi has shown little appetite for framing her leadership around gender in male-dominated Japanese politics.

She has been a hit with voters, especially young ones, with fans lapping up everything from her handbag to her jamming to a K-pop song with South Korea 's president.

But she will have to deliver on the economy to remain popular.

"With prices rising like this, what matters most to me is what policies they'll adopt to deal with inflation," voter Chika Sakamoto, 50, told AFP on Sunday.

But helping households could make markets jittery about Japan's colossal debts, which are more than twice the size of the economy.

This was shown by yields on long-dated Japanese bonds hitting record highs during the election campaign after Takaichi floated suspending a food tax.

Tokyo's Nikkei index of stocks jumped more than five percent early Monday and closed 3.9 percent higher.

Takaichi reiterated on Sunday her mantra of having a "responsible" fiscal policy but added that she wanted "to build a strong and resilient economy."

"In reality, the policies of a Takaichi administration are unlikely to curb the inflation that voters expect her to address," said Tetsuo Kotani at the Japan Institute of International Affairs.

"An income tax hike linked to increased defence spending will also be unavoidable. If these policies lead to a triple decline in stocks, the yen, and government bonds, people's lives will become even more difficult," Kotani told AFP.</description><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 13:53:32 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/a7bd7d5c-05a5-11f1-9db8-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-02-09T093017Z-929402302-RC29IJAY1A38-RTRMADP-3-JAPAN-POLITICS-TAKAICHI.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran ready to dilute its enriched uranium if 'all sanctions are lifted'</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/iran-ready-dilute-enriched-uranium-all-us-sanctions-lifted-mohammad-eslami</link><description>Iran is prepared to dilute its highly enriched uranium if the US lifts all sanctions on the country, the head of its atomic energy agency said Monday after talks resumed with Washington .

"In conclusion, in response to a question about the possibility of diluting 60 percent enriched uranium ... the head of the Atomic Energy Agency said that this depends on whether all sanctions would be lifted in return," the official IRNA news agency reported, referring to agency chief Mohammad Eslami, without specifying whether this included all sanctions on Iran or only those imposed by the US.

Diluting uranium means mixing it with blend material to reduce the enrichment level, so that the final product does not exceed a given enrichment threshold.

Before US and Israeli strikes on its nuclear facilities in June last year, Iran had been enriching uranium to 60 percent, far exceeding the 3.67 percent limit allowed under a now-defunct nuclear agreement reached with world powers in 2015.

Western countries, led by the US, suspect Tehran is seeking to develop nuclear weapons , a claim denied by Iran.

According to the UN's nuclear watchdog, Iran is the only non-nuclear-weapons state enriching uranium to 60 percent.

It is also unknown where more than 400kg of highly enriched uranium that Iran possessed prior to the war has ended up, with UN inspectors last recording its location on June 10.

Such a stockpile could allow Iran to build more than nine nuclear bombs if enrichment reached 90 percent.

US President Donald Trump has repeatedly called for Iran to be subject to a total ban on enrichment, a condition unacceptable to Tehran and far less favourable than the 2015 agreement.

Iran maintains it has a right to a civilian nuclear programme under the provisions of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, to which it and 190 other countries are signatories.</description><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 14:52:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/424445b2-05bb-11f1-b60e-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/2025-11-10T083620Z-1430781414-MT1ZUMA0007CPK8Q-RTRMADP-3-ZUMA.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Vance becomes first sitting US VP to visit Armenia in push to advance Azerbaijan peace deal</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260209-vance-becomes-first-sitting-us-vp-visit-armenia-push-advance-azerbaijan-peace-deal</link><description>US Vice President JD Vance landed in Armenia on Monday – a country that no sitting US vice president or president has visited before – as the Trump administration looks to advance a US-brokered deal aimed at ending a decades-long conflict with Azerbaijan .

Vance and Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan signed an agreement to push forward negotiations on a civil nuclear energy deal, and Vance said the US was ready to export advanced computer chips and surveillance drones to Armenia and invest in the country's infrastructure.

The visit comes after Pashinyan signed a deal at the White House in August with Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev where the leaders signed agreements reaffirming their commitment to signing a peace treaty. The text of the treaty was initialed by foreign ministers, which indicates preliminary approval. But the leaders have yet to sign the treaty and parliaments have yet to ratify it.

“Peace is not made by cautious people,” said Vance, who plans to travel to Azerbaijan on Tuesday. “Peace is not made by people who are too focused on the past. Peace is made by people who are focused on the future.”

The August deal between the two former Soviet republics calls for the creation of a major transit corridor dubbed the Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity . It is expected to connect Azerbaijan and its autonomous Nakhchivan exclave, which are separated by a 32-kilometre-wide (20-mile-wide) patch of Armenian territory.

The land bridge had been a sticking point in resolving a conflict that lasted for nearly four decades over control of the Karabakh region, known internationally as Nagorno-Karabakh . The region had been under the control of ethnic Armenian forces backed by Armenia since 1994. A six-week war in 2020 resulted in Azerbaijan regaining control of parts of the region and the surrounding areas. In September 2023, Azerbaijan launched a blitz that forced the separatist authorities to capitulate. After Azerbaijan regained full control of Karabakh, most of its 120,000 Armenian residents fled to Armenia .

Vance said that the Armenian prime minister had his endorsement in upcoming elections and he emphasised that the country was among the oldest to have identified as Christian.

Pashinyan expressed his gratitude toward President Donald Trump and Vance, noting that he had accepted an invitation to participate in the first meeting of Trump's Board of Peace on February 19 in Washington. The group, founded by Trump, is overseeing the ceasefire plan in Gaza.

He said Vance's visit was “of truly historic and symbolic importance” and it “reflects the depth of the strong and strategic partnership forged between the Republic of Armenia and the United States of America”.

The vice president and his wife, Usha, arrived in Yerevan after spending four days in Milan at the Winter Olympics with their family. They were greeted with a red carpet, an honour guard and a delegation of officials. Armenian and American flags hung from poles from as the delegation drove to the vice president’s meeting, with some demonstrators on the side of the road, including one with a sign that said, “Does Trump support Devils?”</description><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 18:10:32 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/23d7579a-05d4-11f1-a00b-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26040498083703.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Arab states condemn Israel as it expands control over occupied West Bank</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260209-arab-states-condemn-israel-expands-control-over-occupied-west-bank</link><description>Saudi Arabia , Jordan and the United Arab Emirates led regional states on Monday in condemning Israel's move to ease settlement expansion and widen its powers in the West Bank , a step critics said went in the direction of annexing occupied land.

Sunday's decisions by Israel 's security cabinet will make it easier for Jewish settlers to buy land ​in the West Bank and give Israeli authorities more power to act in areas supposedly under full Palestinian control, two senior Israeli ministers said.

One of them, ‍ultra-nationalist Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich , said in announcing the decisions that the government would "continue to kill the idea of a Palestinian state".

A joint statement by foreign ministers of Middle Eastern and some other Muslim countries, including Egypt and ​ Turkey , denounced the decisions as a violation of international law that would undermine the vision of a two-state solution as well ​as stability in the region.

They said the moves meant to entrench Israeli settlement of the West Bank, displacing Palestinians and imposing unlawful Israeli sovereignty there. Annexing the territory has long been a priority of far-right parties in Netanyahu's coalition .

Jordan, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Turkey all have diplomatic relations with Israel. Saudi Arabia has said it will not establish such relations until the formation of a Palestinian state.

Most nations have long backed the creation of a Palestinian state alongside Israel as the best way to resolve the generations-old conflict and see the West Bank, which Israel has occupied since 1967, as the largest part of that future state.

Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz and Smotrich issued a joint statement explaining the decisions of ‍the five-member security cabinet, which were not published in full.

The security cabinet decided to repeal a law dating from Jordan's control of the West Bank before 1967 to make land registries public rather than confidential, and to remove ​a requirement for a permit from a civil administration office.

They said these moves would make it easier for Jews to purchase land in the West Bank. Hagit Ofran from the Israeli settlement watchdog group Peace Now said the decision was barred by international law and represented a step towards annexation of the West ‌Bank.

"The decision to allow every Israeli the right to buy land in the West Bank without government approval, without inspection, is also another way of saying it's normal life. It's not occupied territories, it's like part of Israel," she said.

Annexation is opposed by US President Donald Trump , who last year said he would not allow Israel to carry out such a step.

"It's not going to happen," Trump, who is expecting Netanyahu at the White House for a meeting on Wednesday, said in September.

Katz and Smotrich also said the government had decided to expand monitoring and enforcement actions regarding water offences, damage to archaeological sites and environmental hazards to areas A and B of the West Bank.

Under the Oslo interim peace accords of 1993, Area A was designated as under security control of the Palestinian Authority and Area B as under joint control with Israel. Most of the West Bank became Area C under full Israeli security control.

Those changes could allow the Israeli military to carry out demolitions of Palestinian ‍property and prevent Palestinian development not only in Area C but throughout the West Bank, Peace Now said in a statement.

In Hebron, a West Bank city with extensive archaeological remains and a significant ‌Israeli settler community, Palestinians voiced dismay ​at the decisions.

"It becomes easier to confiscate land, easier and faster to expand settlements and easier to demolish Palestinian homes," said Issa Amr, who heads an organisation in Hebron called Youth Against Settlements.</description><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 18:10:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/355de0ba-0548-11f1-8ccb-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-02-08T163436Z-723218502-RC2P7JA6BDJI-RTRMADP-3-ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Cuba implements emergency measures to save fuel under US pressure</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260209-cuba-implements-emergency-measures-save-fuel-under-us-pressure</link><description>Havana 's streets were eerily quiet Monday as emergency measures to conserve Cuba 's fast-dwindling fuel supplies kicked in to counteract the paralysing effects of economic pressure from US President Donald Trump .

With oil supplies in a US stranglehold, the communist government has had to cut the work week for state-owned companies and reduce in-person school and university hours as it limited fuel sales.

Cuba warned ​international airlines that jet fuel will no longer be available on ‍the island beginning Tuesday. Air Canada said it was suspending service to the island starting Monday.

The government also announced the closure of certain hotels with low occupancy rates and the consolidation of tourists in other hotels.

“Hotels are being closed in Varadero,” Cuba's flagship beach resort, located 150km from Havana , “and in other provinces”, a professional in the sector who did not wish to give her name confirmed to AFP.

The few Cubans who were out and about in the capital Monday said they were worried.

"One wonders how long a country can live under such conditions," nurse Rosa Ramos, 37, said, adding the fuel-saving measures were creating "a lot of uncertainty".

With public transport also cut back, Ramos had been waiting for over an hour for a taxi or bus to get to work.

Users of private taxis noted that fares had shot up overnight from about 200 pesos (40 US cents) to 350 pesos.

The island of 9.6 million inhabitants, under a US trade embargo since 1962, has for years been mired in a severe economic crisis marked by extended power cuts and shortages of fuel, medicine and food.

It has now also been cut off from critical oil supplies from Venezuela, whose leader Nicolas Maduro was toppled in a deadly US military strike last month.

Trump has also threatened to impose tariffs on any country that provides oil to the island nation he has said is "ready to fall".

The resulting shortages have threatened to plunge Cuba into complete darkness, with power plants struggling to keep the lights on.

On Sunday, it was announced long-haul flights will not be able to refuel on the island for at least a month.

Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio , the Miami-born son of Cuban immigrants, have made no secret of their desire to bring about regime change in Havana.

Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez on Monday denounced the "cruel aggression" of the United States, which he said was aimed at "breaking the political will of the Cuban people".

"The situation is tough and will demand great sacrifice," said Rodriguez, reiterating Cuba's "willingness to engage in dialogue", though on its own terms .

On Sunday, Deputy Prime Minster Oscar Perez-Oliva Fraga announced a set of emergency measures to ration whatever fuel is left to "protect essential services for the population and indispensable economic activities".

He said these included food and electricity production and "fundamental activities that generate foreign currency".

The president of Mexico , which used to be Cuba's second-biggest oil provider after Venezuela, said Monday that sanctions that harm the people of Cuba were "not right".

"We will continue supporting them and taking all necessary diplomatic actions to restore oil shipments" to Cuba, Claudia Sheinbaum told reporters.

"You cannot strangle a people like this – it's very unfair, very unfair."

Sheinbaum had previously warned of a humanitarian crisis in Cuba, but is keen to avoid putting her own country at risk of tariffs from the United States, Mexico's main trading partner.

Mexico is seeking an agreement with Washington that would allow it to resume oil exports to Havana. On Sunday, it sent two ships with over 800 tons of humanitarian aid .

The Kremlin , too, accused Washington on Monday of using "suffocating measures" against Cuba.

"We are discussing possible solutions with our Cuban friends, at least to provide whatever assistance we can," spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.</description><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 19:45:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/38d02d0e-05e1-11f1-ab99-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/000-96QL6UU.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Sanae Takaichi: Japan’s ‘Iron Maiden’ PM rises – again</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260209-sanae-takaichi-japan-iron-maiden-pm-rises-again</link><description>When Japan ’s first female prime minister staged a surprise drum session with visiting South Korean President Lee Jae-myung last month, it created ripples across the Sea of Japan, marking a new rhythm in Tokyo’s diplomacy.

Wearing matching blue shirts, Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi and Lee banged out K-pop hits as the cameras caught Japan’s 64-year-old leader bobbing her head to the beat with a face-splitting smile. As the video clip went viral in both countries, international news outlets gushed about a new “ drumstick diplomacy ” turning into a “ cymbal of unity ”.

Before becoming prime minister in October, Takaichi was a regular visitor to Japan’s Yasukuni Shrine, which honours convicted war criminals along with 2.5 million war dead and is viewed as a potent symbol of the country’s militarist past.

More than a decade ago, when Takaichi’s political mentor, then prime minister Shinzo Abe , visited the shrine, it sparked furious reactions from China and South Korea , where memories of Japanese colonialism and Tokyo’s refusal to acknowledge the atrocities of the early 20 th century have left festering wounds.

Takaichi’s rise to the pinnacle of power in a deeply patriarchal country may have been enabled by Abe, Japan’s longest-serving prime minister who was assassinated in 2022 . But in style, if not substance, Takaichi as prime minister has taken things more cautiously. Since taking office, she has avoided a visit to the Yasukuni Shrine.

That was before she led her party to a thumping supermajority victory in Sunday’s snap poll. With her conservative Liberal Democratic Paty (LDP) sweeping more than two-thirds of parliamentary seats in the lower house, Takaichi now has the ability to give her hawkish instincts a free rein.

During an interview with Fuji Television on Sunday, Takaichi said she wanted to create an environment to allow a Yasukuni visit that can be understood by neighbouring countries.

But China, Japan’s largest trading partner, is unlikely to be understanding. Barely two weeks after taking office in October, Takaichi ignited a diplomatic storm when she was asked in parliament about her position if China used military force against Taiwan . That would constitute a “survival-threatening situation” for Japan, Takaichi replied, breaking a tradition for Tokyo, which is typically more circumspect on Taiwan issues.

Her reply, which suggested that Japan could intervene militarily if China sought to seize the self-ruled island, sparked a war of words and massive Chinese military exercises in December that were aimed to showcase Beijing's ability to cut off Taiwan from outside support.

Takaichi is known to be a China hawk, which has alarmed some of Japan’s doves. The results of Sunday’s vote, however, show that the majority of Japanese voters are ready for a more muscular foreign policy to contain Beijing’s territorial ambitions.

In Japan, Takaichi has a formidable reputation with monikers to match. An admirer of Margaret Thatcher , Takaichi is also famous for having carried several drum sticks during her heavy-metal days, as she would break them during intense performances. When she became Japan’s first female prime minister, headlines proclaimed the “Iron Maiden” had risen to “Iron Lady”.

It was an unlikely rise for the daughter of working-class parents in the ancient imperial capital of Nara.

Born in Nara on March 7, 1961, Takaichi was raised by conservative parents who taught her prewar moral values. Her mother was a police officer and her father worked at a machinery maker.

As a child, she enjoyed listening to her parents recite an 1890 imperial document praising paternalistic family values and loyalty to the government, Takaichi said in 2012.

After graduating from high school, she was accepted by a number of prestigious Tokyo universities, but she wasn’t allowed to enroll in any of the schools in the capital. Her parents made her attend Kobe University while living at home, which was normal in those days for unmarried daughters of conservative families.

In 1987, she won a sponsorship that enabled her to go to the US to work as congressional fellow for then Democratic congresswoman Pat Schroeder. Takaichi returned to Japan two years later with lessons learned by observing Schroeder, who was the first female representative elected from Colorado.

After returning to Japan from the US, a young Takaichi worked as a television personality, an author and a critic.

“She has a very unique upbringing for a politician in the sense that she comes from a working-class family,” said Kristi Govella from the Nissan Institute of Japanese Studies in an interview with FRANCE 24. “She was a heavy metal drummer. She's an avid motorcyclist and she’s just not in the mold of the typical LDP politician that many voters have become quite tired of in recent years. She has come onto the scene despite possible doubts about her ability to lead because she wasn’t a huge figure on the national scene. And she's really made a splash.”

But her rise in the patriarchal world of Japanese politics was not an easy one. Takaichi was first elected to parliament in 1993 after defying her parents’ opposition. Some voters insulted her as “a little girl”, she said in 2023, recalling her first campaign.

“In those days, women who were not considered old enough were unwelcome,” she said. She also faced groundless allegations of being a mistress of a senior politician, and criticism – often from women – for wearing heels, flashy jewellery and short skirts.

“I am who I am,” Takaichi said. “The only way to prove myself is with the work I do.”

Her work ethic has sometimes been at odds with the national mood. Takaichi’s vow, before she took office in October, that she would “work, work, work, work, and work” drew criticism from mental health workers and several ordinary Japanese in a country notorious for its long working hours. Lawyers representing people who died from overwork described her comments as unhelpful, and reports of her calling meetings at 3am raised alarm bells about her health in some quarters.

Responding to the criticisms, Takaichi said her comments had been misinterpreted. “I had no intention of encouraging people to overwork or suggesting that working long hours is a virtue,” she said, adding she was simply trying to communicate her determination to be an effective leader.

With her short, cropped hair and her passion for heavy metal and motorcycles, it’s easy to view Takaichi as a daring non-conformist. But that would be a misjudgment, according to Japan experts.

Takaichi supports the imperial family’s male-only succession and opposes same-sex marriage as well as amending the 19th-century law requiring married couples to have the same surname, under which most women are pressured into abandoning theirs.

“She tends to have quite socially conservative views,” said Govella. But the prime minister also has a political nose for issues that resonate with the electorate. “The interesting thing is that we haven't heard a lot of emphasis on that social conservatism. Since she's come to be prime minister, she seems to be trying to weigh the different concerns of voters across issues, and she seems to be accurately gauging that what voters really want to see is a response on the economic side, more than her pushing forward on any specific social issues.”

Takaichi may look up to Thatcher, but economic policies do not mirror those of the fiscally conservative former British leader. As an Abe protégé, Japan’s prime minister advocates boosting government spending while also promoting a sales tax cut.

This alarms conservative economists, who warn that Japan must trim its national debt.

But when it comes to defence spending, Takaichi has an ally in US President Donald Trump , who welcomed her pledge to push Japan’s annual defense budget to double 2022 levels – to 2 percent of its gross domestic product – by March.

Takaichi is set to visit Washington to meet with Trump at the White House on March 19. The US president announced the trip on social media as he endorsed the prime minister ahead of Sunday’s election.</description><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 20:39:03 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/1e61bc8c-04e0-11f1-99c6-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-02-07T220235Z-979292584-RC2DFJAJFDAL-RTRMADP-3-JAPAN-ELECTION.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Rubio to visit Hungary and Slovakia after Trump backs right-wing leader Orban</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260209-rubio-to-visit-hungary-and-slovakia-after-trump-backs-orban</link><description>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio will travel next week to Hungary, the State Department said Monday, after President Donald Trump endorsed its right-wing leader Viktor Orban , who is trailing in polls ahead of April elections.

Rubio will travel to Hungary and Slovakia, also led by a right-wing ally of Trump, after addressing the Munich Security Conference, where last year Vice President JD Vance berated the European Union and championed the continent's far-right .

The trip comes as tensions again rise between the United States and the European Union after Trump mused about seizing Greenland from Denmark, a NATO ally.

In Budapest on Sunday and Monday, Rubio "will meet with key Hungarian officials to bolster our shared bilateral and regional interests, including our commitment to peace processes to resolve global conflicts and to the US-Hungary energy partnership," State Department spokesman Tommy Pigott said.

Orban is the rare European Union leader to enjoy warm relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin and has often resisted EU initiatives to support Ukraine.

Orban had planned a summit last year between Trump and Putin which was scrapped as US officials became convinced that Russia was unlikely to compromise on Ukraine .

Last week Trump endorsed Orban in a social-media posting, calling the European Union's longest-serving national leader "a true friend, fighter, and WINNER."

But Orban is facing an unprecedented challenge in his quest for a fifth straight term on April 12, with polls showing him trailing the party of Peter Magyar, a former government insider turned critic.

Orban became a hero to many Trump supporters for his hostility to migration during the Syrian refugee crisis a decade ago.

When Orban visited the White House last year, Trump granted Hungary an exemption of sanction on Russian oil and gas imports.

Former president Joe Biden had a much more hostile relationship with Orban, whom he accused of "looking for dictatorship" in part by muzzling independent media and campaigning against LGBTQ rights.

Rubio will travel Sunday to Slovakia where Prime Minister Robert Fico has also found common cause with Trump.

Fico's recent visit to see Trump in Florida caused a stir when Politico, citing unnamed European diplomats, said that Fico had voiced concern about Trump's mental state. Both countries denied the account.

Rubio, often seen as the more civil face of the Trump administration, will represent the United States at Munich this year instead of Vance.</description><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 23:37:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/2312a3ec-fc73-11f0-851f-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-28T160028Z-1922629124-RC2FAJAB8W9L-RTRMADP-3-USA-VENEZUELA-RUBIO.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US forces board sanctioned tanker after globe-spanning pursuit</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260210-us-forces-board-sanctioned-tanker</link><description>US military forces boarded a sanctioned tanker in the Indian Ocean after tracking the ship from the Caribbean Sea as part of an oil quarantine meant to squeeze Venezuela , Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said on Monday.

Venezuela had faced US sanctions on its oil and relied on a shadow fleet of falsely flagged tankers to smuggle crude into global supply chains. Following the US raid to apprehend then-President Nicolás Maduro in early January, several tankers fled the Venezuelan coast, including the ship that was boarded in the Indian Ocean overnight.

Hegseth vowed to eventually capture all those ships, telling a group of shipyard workers in Maine on Monday that “the only guidance I gave to my military commanders is none of those are getting away”.

“I don’t care if we’ve got to go around the globe to get them; we’re going to get them,” he added.

Later on Monday, the US military said it had carried out another deadly strike on a vessel accused of trafficking drugs in the eastern Pacific Ocean.

US Southern Command said the strike killed two people, while one person survived. Southern Command said it had notified the US Coast Guard to activate its search and rescue system for the survivor. A video linked to the post shows a boat moving through the water before exploding in flames.

Monday’s attack raises the death toll from the Trump administration’s strikes on alleged drug boats to 130 people.

The Trump administration has seized seven tankers as part of its broader efforts to take control of the South American country’s oil. Unlike those previous actions, the Aquila II has not been formally seized and placed under US control, a defence official said.

Instead, the ship is being held while its ultimate fate is decided by the US, according to the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing decision-making.

The Aquila II is a Panamanian-flagged tanker under US sanctions related to the shipment of illicit Russian oil. Owned by a company with a listed address in Hong Kong, ship-tracking data show it has spent much of the past year with its radio transponder turned off, a practice known as “running dark” commonly employed by smugglers to hide their location.

It was one of at least 16 tankers that fled the Venezuelan coast last month, according to Samir Madani, co-founder of TankerTrackers.com, who said his organisation used satellite imagery and surface-level photos to document the ship’s movements. According to data transmitted from the ship on Monday, it is not currently laden with a cargo of crude oil.

The Pentagon ’s post on X said the military “conducted a right-of-visit, maritime interdiction” on the ship.

“The Aquila II was operating in defiance of President Trump’s established quarantine of sanctioned vessels in the Caribbean,” the Pentagon said. “It ran, and we followed.”

A Navy official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss military operations, would not say what forces were used in the operation but confirmed the destroyers USS Pinckney and USS John Finn , as well as the mobile base ship USS Miguel Keith , were operating in the Indian Ocean.

In videos the Pentagon posted to social media, uniformed forces can be seen boarding a Navy helicopter that takes off from a ship matching the profile of the Miguel Keith . Video and photos of the tanker shot from inside a helicopter also show a Navy destroyer sailing alongside the ship.

Since the US ouster of Maduro in a surprise nighttime raid on January 3, the Trump administration has set out to control the production, refining and global distribution of Venezuela’s petroleum products. Officials in President Donald Trump ’s Republican administration have made it clear they see seizing the tankers as a way to generate cash as they seek to rebuild Venezuela’s battered oil industry and restore its economy.

Trump has also been trying to restrict the flow of oil to Cuba, which faces strict economic sanctions by the US and relies heavily on oil shipments from allies such as Mexico, Russia and Venezuela.

Since the Venezuela operation, Trump has said no more Venezuelan oil will go to Cuba and that the Cuban government is ready to fall. Trump also recently signed an executive order that would impose a tariff on any goods from countries that sell or provide oil to Cuba, primarily pressuring Mexico because it has acted as an oil lifeline for Cuba.</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 02:28:56 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/82cc56f6-ebda-11f0-84d5-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/000-89WN2PR.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UN waits for clarity on US payments as financial crisis looms</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260210-un-waits-for-clarity-on-us-payments-as-financial-crisis-looms</link><description>The United Nations said on Monday it is waiting to find out how much of the nearly $4 billion the United States owes the world organisation the Trump administration intends to pay, and when the money will arrive.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned last week that the world body faces an “imminent financial collapse” unless its financial rules are overhauled or all 193 member nations pay their dues, a message clearly directed at the United States .

The US owes $2.196 billion to the UN’s regular operating budget, including $767 million for this year, according to a UN official. The US also owes $1.8 billion for the separate budget for the UN’s far-flung peacekeeping operations, a figure that is also expected to rise.

The US Mission to the United Nations confirmed that US Ambassador Mike Waltz said the Trump administration planned to make a significant down payment on its arrears within weeks, with the final amount still to be determined. His comments were first reported by Reuters.

UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters on Monday that Guterres has been in touch with Waltz “for quite some time”, and that the UN’s controller has also been in contact with US officials.

“We’re waiting to see exactly when payments will be made and in what amount,” Dujarric said.

Guterres said in a letter to all member nations last week that cash for the UN’s regular operating budget could run out by July, which could dramatically affect its operations.

President Donald Trump has said the United Nations has not lived up to its potential. His administration did not pay anything to the United Nations in 2025, and has withdrawn from UN organisations including the World Health Organization and the cultural agency UNESCO , while pulling funding from dozens of others.

UN officials have said 95% of the arrears to the UN’s regular budget are owed by the United States.

The country second on the list for failing to pay its mandatory regular dues is Venezuela , which owes $38 million, the UN official said. The South American nation, whose economy was struggling before a US military raid in January that deposed then president Nicolás Maduro , has lost its right to vote in the General Assembly for being two years in arrears.

Nearly 60 countries paid their annual dues by the Feb 8 deadline.</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 02:28:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/e55dc4ce-eaec-11f0-b95c-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25175745805083.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran escalates crackdown on protestors amid potential US nuclear talks</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260210-iran-escalates-crackdown-on-protestors-amid-potential-us-nuclear-talks</link><description>Iran stepped up its crackdown on Monday after recent protests , making more arrests while holding the door open to Washington for further nuclear negotiations.

The arrests – including that of Javad Emam, the spokesperson for the main reformist coalition – came after Iranian and US officials held talks in Oman that both sides described as positive.

On Saturday, Iran added more jail time to Nobel Peace Prize winner Narges Mohammadi, and on Monday arrested Hossein Karoubi, the son of prominent dissident Mehdi Karoubi.

Weeks after repressing a wave of protests, one of the greatest challenges to the government since it came to power in the 1979 Islamic Revolution, Tehran has taken a two-track approach.

It is rounding up and jailing perceived critics, while at the same time pursuing a potential diplomatic opening with US President Donald Trump ’s administration.

A spokesperson for the Reformist Front coalition told local media on Monday that Iran’s Revolutionary Guards had arrested the group’s spokesman, Emam.

Emam was one of at least five Reformist Front figures to be detained, as were several activists and filmmakers who co-signed a protest statement.

Iran’s government has branded the protests “riots” fuelled by its arch-foes Israel and the United States .

On Monday, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei called on the nation to show “resolve” against foreign pressure.

“National power is less about missiles and aircraft and more about the will and resolve of the people,” Khamenei said, adding: “Show it again and frustrate the enemy.”

Alongside its defiant pronouncements, Iran has signalled it could come to some kind of deal to dial back its nuclear programme to avoid further conflict with Washington.

The official IRNA news agency reported that Iranian atomic agency chief Mohammad Eslami had said Tehran could dilute its highly enriched uranium in return for sanctions relief.

“In response to a question about the possibility of diluting 60 per cent enriched uranium,” IRNA reported, Eslami “said this depends on whether all sanctions would be lifted in return”.

The report did not specify whether such an agreement would include only nuclear sanctions imposed on Iran by the United States, or all international economic measures targeting the Islamic Republic.

Diluting, or “downblending”, uranium means mixing it with other substances to reduce the enrichment level, so the final product does not exceed a given threshold – thus extending the amount of time it would take Iran to create sufficient nuclear material for a bomb.

Tehran adamantly insists it has never planned to build a nuclear weapon and that enrichment for civilian research and energy is its sovereign right, but the US, Israel and most Western capitals do not believe this.

At the talks in Oman last week, the US and Iran agreed to discuss Tehran’s nuclear programme , though Washington and Israel also want to put its ballistic missiles and support for regional militant groups on the agenda.

In separate calls with his Egyptian, Saudi and Turkish counterparts, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi “described the talks as a good start while emphasising the need to dispel mistrust about the American side’s intentions and objectives”, state television reported.

While Trump had initially threatened to intervene over Iran’s repression of last month’s protests, since the latest talks began the United States has not given any sign that the crackdown on Tehran’s domestic critics is a major concern.

On Saturday, Iranian Nobel Peace Prize winner Narges Mohammadi was sentenced to six years in prison on charges of harming national security.

She was also given a one-and-a-half-year prison sentence for “propaganda” against Iran’s Islamic system, her foundation said in a statement.

Already incarcerated for much of the past decade as a result of her campaigning against capital punishment and the mandatory dress code for women, she now faces up to 17 more years behind bars and 154 lashes.

The arrest of Reformist Front spokesman Emam followed those on Sunday of three other figures, including Azar Mansouri, who has led the coalition since 2023. Another reformist lawmaker was arrested on Monday.

The reformist camp largely backed incumbent President Masoud Pezeshkian in the 2024 presidential election.

Separately, Hossein Karoubi was also taken into custody. Karoubi’s father, Mehdi Karoubi, was a figure in the 2009 Green Movement protests and has been under house arrest more or less ever since.

The authorities in Iran have acknowledged that 3,117 people were killed during the protests, publishing a list of 2,986 names, most of whom they say were members of the security forces and innocent bystanders.

International organisations have put the toll far higher.

The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency says it has verified 6,964 deaths, mostly protesters, and has another 11,730 cases under investigation.

It has also counted more than 51,000 arrests.</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 04:53:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/1ae47b2e-0631-11f1-a4d5-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26040508512079.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump threatens to block opening of Ontario-Michigan bridge financed by Canada</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260210-trump-threatens-to-block-opening-of-ontario-michigan-bridge-financed-by-canada</link><description>President Donald Trump threatened Monday to stop the opening of a new bridge between the United States and Canada , in a fresh salvo against the country he has suggested should become the 51st US state .

Trump said the United States should own "at least half" of the still under-construction Gordie Howe International Bridge that links the Canadian province of Ontario with the US state of Michigan.

Work on the $4.7-billion bridge – named after the late Canadian-born National Hockey League great Gordie Howe – started in 2018 and it is due to open later this year.

"I will not allow this bridge to open until the United States is fully compensated for everything we have given them, and also, importantly, Canada treats the United States with the Fairness and Respect that we deserve," Trump posted on Truth Social.

"We will start negotiations, IMMEDIATELY."

The 79-year-old Republican complained that Canada owned both sides of the bridge and used "virtually" no US products to build it.

According to a factsheet issued by the Windsor-Detroit Bridge Authority, the bridge was financed entirely by Canada and will be jointly owned by the governments of Canada and the state of Michigan.

"And now, on top of everything else, Prime Minister (Mark) Carney wants to make a deal with China – which will eat Canada alive. We'll just get the leftovers! I don't think so," Trump added.

Washington threatened to slap 100 percent tariffs on Canada after Carney visited Beijing last month and sealed a preliminary trade deal with China.

The US leader meanwhile repeated the outlandish claim that Beijing would "terminate ALL Ice Hockey being played in Canada".

Trump has clashed with Canada over trade since returning to office in January 2025. He previously called for the United States to annex Canada but has largely dropped that claim in recent months.

Carney for his part warned at the Davos forum last month that the US-led global system of governance is enduring "a rupture", in a thinly veiled reference to Trump's disruption, and argued for mid-level powers to group together.</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 07:38:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/ea1d5568-0650-11f1-ba6f-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP5805076774309242.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Live: Russia's Lavrov plays down hopes of a breakthrough in Ukraine talks</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260210-live-ukraine-long-way-to-go-in-talks-russia-lavrov-zelensky</link><description>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has defended a Winter Olympian's right to wear a helmet featuring athletes killed during the war with Russia after skeleton racer Vladyslav Heraskevych said the IOC banned it at the Games.

Heraskevych wore the helmet during a training session in Cortina and had intended to use the Games in Italy to help maintain international pressure on Russia.

The 27-year-old said in a social media post on Monday that the International Olympic Committee had banned his custom helmet -- which has portraits of Ukrainian athletes killed since Russia's 2022 invasion -- from training and competition.

The IOC has yet to publicly confirm that.

Pyongyang accused Seoul of flying a drone into Kaesong in January, releasing images that purported to show debris from the downed aircraft.

Seoul initially denied the government was involved, with President Lee Jae-myung saying it would be akin to "firing a shot into the North".

But authorities said on Tuesday they were investigating three active-duty soldiers and one spy agency employee.

Investigators from a joint military-police task force raided 18 locations of interest, including the Defense Intelligence Command and the National Intelligence Service.

"The task force said it will thoroughly establish the truth behind the drone incident through analysis of seized materials and a rigorous investigation of the suspects," a statement read.

Three civilians have already been charged for their alleged role in the drone scandal.

One of them has publicly claimed responsibility, saying he acted to detect radiation levels from North Korea's Pyongsan uranium processing facility.

Disgraced ex-president Yoon Suk Yeol is currently standing trial on charges he illegally sent drones into North Korea to help create the pretext for declaring martial law in late 2024.

His attempt to overturn civilian rule failed, and Yoon was impeached and ousted from office in April last year.

Prosecutors have accused Yoon of instructing Seoul's military to fly drones over Pyongyang and distribute anti-North leaflets in an attempt to provoke a response.

They said Yoon and others "conspired to create conditions that would allow the declaration of emergency martial law".

North Korea said last year it had proven that the South flew drones to drop propaganda leaflets over its capital.

Lee said in December that he felt an apology was due to North Korea over his predecessor's alleged order to send drones.

"I feel I should apologise, but I hesitate to say it out loud," he said at the time.

"I worry that if I do, it could be used as fodder for ideological battles or accusations of being pro-North," he added.

Lee has taken steps to ease tensions since taking office, including removing propaganda loudspeakers along the border.

Pyongyang unveiled new attack drones in August 2024, with experts saying the capability may be attributable to the country's budding alliance with Moscow.

North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un at the time ordered the "mass production" of attack drones, with analysts saying they may be designed to carry explosives and deliberately crash into enemy targets.

North Korea has previously sent trash-filled balloons over the South in what it called retaliation for activists in the South floating anti-regime propaganda missives northwards.</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 07:38:19 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/bc27ae14-0633-11f1-90d6-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/3bfe4a1dcb3ef7327c690b372a86916fce035da9.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>French left calls for Epstein inquiry as Macron says scandal 'mainly concerns' US</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260210-france-epstein-inquiry-macron-says-scandal-mainly-concerns-usa</link><description>French National Assembly President Yaël Braun-Pivet said Tuesday she was opposed to the creation of a parliamentary inquiry into the scandal involving late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein , warning that such a move would "compete with the justice system".

Braun-Pivet, an ally of French President Emmanuel Macron , was responding to calls by the left-wing La France insoumise (LFI) party for the establishment of a cross-party inquiry to investigate Epstein's French ties .

"The matter must be referred to the courts" to "shed light" on possible "French ramifications" to the Epstein revelations, Braun-Pivet told Europe 1.

LFI argued last week that a parliamentary inquiry was necessary to investigate possible "interference" or "funding" of political parties after more French public figures were named in files related to Epstein.

Former French minister Jack Lang on Saturday resigned from his longtime post as head of the Arab World Institute (IMA) in Paris over his links to the late sex offender, becoming the most high-profile French public figure to be caught up in the politically explosive scandal .

French prosecutors have opened a preliminary tax fraud probe into Lang and his daughter Caroline after they were mentioned in the Epstein files.

Braun-Pivet described the revelations as "terrifying", even as she praised "the quality of Jack Lang's commitment and work as a minister".

"I no longer want to see politicians taking advantage of the generosity of private individuals," she said. "These politicians who take advantage of private jets and have their holidays paid for are unacceptable."

Braun-Pivet's comments came a day after Macron sought to distance France from the Epstein affair, saying it was "a matter that mainly concerns the United States".

"The justice system there must do its job, and that's all," Macron said, adding that he did not want to "take part" in a public debate on the Epstein affair.

The French president also called for "real journalism", noting that the dump of US government files on Epstein had created "fuel for conspiracy theories".

When asked about Lang's decision to resign, Macron said he had taken note of it, adding the choice was made "in good conscience".

Lang, 86,  has denied any wrongdoing , saying he was "shocked" that his name appeared in the statutes of an offshore company that Epstein founded in 2016, and had only appealed to Epstein as a philanthropist.

His daughter Caroline, who allegedly owned half the shares in the company, resigned Monday from the board of the Fondation Le Refuge, dedicated to housing and supporting LGBTQ youth who have been estranged from their families.

She had previously resigned from her job as head of the Union of Independent Producers (SPI), which represents independent film producers in France.

A mere mention in the files does not imply wrongdoing.

Top US prosecutor Todd Blanche said on February 1 that authorities would not bring any more charges after the release of more than 3 million items made available at the end of January.</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 11:28:32 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/934697f6-02d4-11f1-9b42-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/000-94XA2WE.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'Bodega cats': New York seeks rights for corner shops' furry little helpers</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260210-bodega-cats-new-york-seeks-rights-for-corner-shops-furry-little-helpers</link><description>Simba, a large cat with thick ginger and white fur, is one of thousands of felines that live in New York 's corner shops known as "bodegas" – even if their presence is illegal.

Praised for warding off pests, so-called bodega cats are also a cultural fixture for New Yorkers , some of whom are now pushing to enshrine legal rights for the little store helpers.

"Simba is very important to us because he keeps the shop clean of the mice," Austin Moreno, a shopkeeper in Manhattan, told AFP from behind his till.

The fluffy inhabitant also helps to entice customers.

"People, very often, they come to visit to ask, what is his name? The other day, some girls saw him for the first time and now they come every day," said Moreno.

Around a third of the city's roughly 10,000 bodegas are thought to have a resident cat despite being liable to fines of $200-$350 for keeping animals in a store selling food, according to Dan Rimada, founder of Bodega Cats of New York.

Rimada photographs the felines for his social media followers and last year launched a petition to legalize bodega cats, which drew nearly 14,000 signatures.

"These cats are woven into the fabric of New York City, and that's an important story to tell," he said.

Inspired by Rimada's petition, New York City council member Keith Powers has proposed a measure to shield the owners of bodega cats from penalties.

His legislation would also provide free vaccinations and spay or neuter services to the felines.

But animal shelters and rights groups say this wouldn't go far enough.

While Simba can nap in the corner of his shop with kibble within paw's reach, many of his fellow cats are locked in basements, deprived of food or proper care, and abandoned when they grow old or fall ill.

Becky Wisdom, who rescues cats in New York, warned that lifting the threat of fines could remove "leverage" to encourage bodega owners to better care for the animals.

She also opposes public funds being given to business owners rather than low-income families who want their cats spayed or neutered.

The latter is a big issue in New York, where the stray cat population is estimated at around half a million.

Regardless of what the city decides, it is the state of New York that has authority over business rules, said Allie Taylor, president of Voters for Animal Rights.

Taylor said she backs another initiative proposed by state assembly member Linda Rosenthal, a prominent animal welfare advocate, who proposes allowing cats in bodegas under certain conditions.

These would include vet visits, mandatory spaying or neutering, and ensuring the cats have sufficient food, water and a safe place to sleep.

Beyond the specific case of bodega cats, Taylor is pushing for a more radical overhaul of animal protection in New York.

"Instead of focusing on one subset of cats, we need the city to make serious investments, meaning tens of millions of dollars per year into free or low cost spay, neuter and veterinary care," she said.</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 11:28:42 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/624521e2-0624-11f1-8bb4-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/ea04aa757d40185220bbc71015276561bc90515c.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>France calls for witnesses after 79-year-old charged with sexual abuse of 89 minors, two murders</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260210-france-calls-witnesses-after-79-year-old-charged-with-sexual-abuse-of-89-minors-two-murders</link><description>A French prosecutor on Tuesday appealed for further testimony in a mass abuse case across nine countries, after charging a 79-year-old former educator with rape and sexual assault of 89 minors since the 1960s.

Prosecutor Etienne Manteaux spoke to reporters in the southeastern city of Grenoble to publicise the case of the former teacher, who had also confessed to killing his terminally ill mother and his elderly aunt.

In an unusual move, French authorities named the suspect, Jacques Leveugle, who was born in 1946 in Annecy, an Alpine town an hour's drive away from Grenoble.

"This name must be known because the aim is to enable potential victims to come forward," the prosecutor said.

When asked why prosecutors did not reveal the information when Leveugle was placed under investigation, Manteaux said that it was a "somewhat unusual case, and we wanted to first ensure the veracity of the facts".

Then "it became essential to allow victims who could not be identified and who were not going to be heard to come forward", he added.

Leveugle, who is accused of committing sexual crimes against minors between 1967 and 2022, has been in custody since his indictment in 2024, the prosecutor said.

In May last year, a French court sentenced retired doctor Joel Le Scouarnec to 20 years in prison after he confessed to sexually abusing or raping 298 patients between 1989 and 2014.

Of those, more than 250 victims were under 15 years old.

Victims and child rights advocates say that case highlighted systemic flaws that allowed Le Scouarnec to repeatedly commit sexual crimes.

Leveugle allegedly committed the crimes against minors in Germany , Switzerland , Morocco , Niger , Algeria , the Philippines , India , Colombia , and the French overseas territory of New Caledonia , where he worked as a freelance teacher and instructor, said the prosecutor.

His varied roles included instructor of speleology, or the study of caves, and French teacher.

"He travelled to these different countries and in each of these places where he settled to provide tutoring and teach, he would meet young people and have sexual relations with them," according to the prosecutor.

The number of victims was established from writings compiled on a USB drive by the man, which refer to "sexual relations" with minors aged 13 to 17.

The USB stick on which the documents were stored by the man was discovered by his nephew, who was "questioning his uncle's emotional and sexual life", Manteaux added.

It "contains 15 tomes of very dense material, and investigators will review and read all of these writings and identify 89 minors", he said.

During the investigation, the man also confessed to suffocating his mother – a terminally ill cancer patient – with a pillow in the 1970s, according to the prosecutor.

He also suffocated his 92-year-old aunt, also with a pillow, in the 1990s, the prosecutor said.

Leveugle had to travel and the aunt "begged him not to go".

"He decided to kill her too, so while she was asleep, he took a pillow and suffocated her," the prosecutor said.

In his "memoirs", the man had written that he had "killed two people", Manteaux said.

A separate murder investigation has been launched.

The suspect "justifies his actions by saying that he would like someone to do the same for him if he found himself in this end-of-life situation", the prosecutor said.</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 15:11:47 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/627c4c1a-068a-11f1-bf68-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/000-96UD8G3.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Kenya FM slams Russia's use of its citizens as 'cannon fodder', announces visit to Moscow</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/africa/20260210-kenya-slams-russia-use-citizens-lured-to-ukraine-as-cannon-fodder</link><description>Kenya on Tuesday condemned as "unacceptable" recruiters luring Kenyans to Russia with promises of lucrative jobs, only to send them to Ukraine's front lines as "cannon fodder".

In recent weeks, mounting reports indicate that Kenyans deceived into travelling for high-paying work in Russia are dying on the battlefield, with others sustaining serious wounds.

An AFP investigation published this week revealed the web of deception into which four men with no military background fell – forced to sign contracts with the Russian army and swiftly sent to the front lines in Ukraine.

"It's unacceptable for them to be participants in this conflict," junior foreign minister Korir Sing'Oei said.

The four, three of whom returned wounded, were given contracts written in Russian.

One had expected to work as a salesman, two as security guards and the fourth as a high-level athlete.

"These individuals are used as cannon fodder on the war front," Sing'Oei said.

"No Kenyan would voluntarily enter into that kind of engagement."

Foreign Minister Musalia Mudavadi announced he would travel to Moscow for talks aimed at "conclusively resolving the matter and identifying sustainable solutions".

"We have seen loss of lives, and I am planning to make a visit to Moscow so that we can emphasise that this is something that needs to be arrested," Mudavadi said in a statement to the media.

He said he would also pursue the release of Kenyans held as prisoners of war in Ukraine and "verify" the condition of those hospitalised.

Mudavadi said more than 30 Kenyans had been evacuated from Russia over the past two months and unscrupulous recruitment agencies in the east African country had been shut down.</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 16:38:42 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/d9e26f50-0694-11f1-9288-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/000-94L82PW.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>NASA delays rocket launch to ISS over weather conditions</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/science/20260210-nasa-delays-rocket-launch-iss-over-weather-conditions</link><description>NASA is now aiming to launch four astronauts to the International Space Station (ISS) on Friday, in another delay over weather conditions, the US agency announced Tuesday.

It is targeting February 13 for the lift-off of Crew-12's mission aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, with a window opening at 5:15am local time (10:15am GMT).

"Mission teams completed a weather review Tuesday morning and have waived off the Thursday, February 12, launch opportunity due to forecast weather conditions along Crew-12's flight path," NASA said in a statement.

Weather at the site in Florida has been in fact favourable, NASA officials told a briefing Monday, but higher winds forecast across the rest of the East Coast are to blame for the delays.

These winds could complicate any potential emergency maneuvers, like an early splashdown of the spacecraft carrying the astronauts, for example.

If Friday's launch goes as planned, the astronauts should arrive at the space station by approximately 3:15pm on Saturday.

Crew-12 is composed of Americans Jessica Meir and Jack Hathaway, along with French astronaut Sophie Adenot and Russian cosmonaut Andrey Fedyaev.

They remain in quarantine in NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida , waiting to blast off.

The travelers will replace Crew-11, which returned to Earth in January a month earlier than planned in the first medical evacuation in the space station's history.

ISS, a scientific laboratory orbiting 250 miles (400 kilometers) above Earth, has since been staffed by a skeleton crew of three.

Continuously inhabited for the last quarter-century, the ageing ISS is scheduled to be de-orbited and crashed into an isolated spot in the Pacific Ocean in 2030.</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 18:02:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/93f96d0e-0261-11f1-809f-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/47c854a29c0361af6453fe5789114374cf263fda.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'Democracy loses out': France sinks to new low in annual global corruption index</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260210-france-sinks-new-low-in-annual-global-corruption-index-democracy</link><description>France dropped on Tuesday to an all-time low in Transparency International ’s annual corruption perceptions index, with the organisation warning of “democratic danger” if politicians fail to act.

The Corruption Perceptions Index is compiled by experts and businesspeople who rank 182 countries on their perceived corruption levels in the public sector based on data from institutions including the World Bank and the World Economic Forum .

Countries score between zero, for those seen as highly corrupt, and 100, for those seen as very clean. In the 2025 edition released on Tuesday, Denmark ranked top with 89 points and South Sudan lowest with a score of 9.

France was given a score of 66 points, one point lower than 2024, and slipped down in the overall rankings to 27th place – its worst performance since the index, which was created in 1995, implemented its current methodology in 2012.

France’s poor score comes on the back of three high-profile corruption cases that dominated headlines last year.

A Senate report released in May found that the French government covered up consumer fraud by food giant Nestle, allowing the company to use prohibited treatments to produce "natural" mineral waters, including Perrier.

Ex-president Nicolas Sarkozy was imprisoned for 20 days in October after being found guilty of illegally seeking funding for his successful presidential campaign from former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi .

And, in an ongoing scandal, far-right leader Marine Le Pen and others from her National Rally party were found guilty in March of embezzling European Parliament funds.

Le Pen appeared in a Paris court this week to appeal the verdict which, if upheld, will ban her for running in the 2027 presidential elections.

These notable cases have “contributed to the deterioration in the perception of corruption”, said Florent Clouet, chief executive of Transparency International France.

But beyond the headline-grabbing scandals, the organisation has identified several key factors in France allowing an increase in the perception of corruption.

“The most significant problem, in our view, is the lack of political will – there is absolutely no political leadership in the fight against corruption,” Clouet said.

A recent plan to strengthen anti-corruption measures has not been championed by any MPs or presented at the weekly Council of Ministers chaired by President Emmanuel Macron , and accusations of corruption at the heart of government seem increasingly common.

Paris mayoral hopeful and current Culture Minister Rachida Dati is the latest in a series of serving ministers to face corruption charges .

The lack of political support for anti-corruption measures is compounded by under-resourced investigation and prosecution bodies.

The National Financial Prosecutor's Office ( Le parquet national financier ) is overrun, with “each pair of magistrates ... dealing with 80 cases, when the original plan was for them to handle eight cases”, Clouet said.

There is also a chronic lack of personnel at leading financial investigation agencies the central anti-corruption office ( l’Office central de lutte contre la corruption et les infractions financières et fiscales) and the High Authority for Transparency in Public Life .

“As a result, we find ourselves in a situation where, basically, they are unable to properly carry out the missions for which they were created,” Clouet said.

The president of the High Authority for Transparency in Public life in April called on the government to increase its budget , saying that of 13,000 declarations made by public officials in 2024, it only had capacity to verify 5,000.

While these organisations were set up to monitor high-ranking officials and public servants, an additional issue is the lack of oversight at lower levels of government.

“There is great difficulty detecting and combating what is known as 'low-intensity corruption', involving relatively small amounts of money that slip under the radar of prevention and detection mechanisms,” Clouet added.

Rather than being an outlier, Transparency International found the issues in France are part of a “worrying trend” of “backsliding scores in traditionally well-performing democracies” including Canada , New Zealand , Sweden and the UK .

Globally, more than two thirds of all countries surveyed received a score lower than 50 and “the vast majority of countries are failing to keep corruption under control", the report found.

Over the past decade, progress has “stalled” in Western Europe and “been deteriorating” in the US, which dropped to a new low of 64, it added.

Indeed, US President Donald Trump ’s dismantling of decades-old measures to fight corruption seem to have inspired other countries to loosen their own laws.

“In the current geopolitical climate, Europe should be raising, not lowering, its anti-corruption ambitions. Corruption is not inevitable,” said Flora Cresswell, regional adviser for Western Europe at Transparency International.

But “that's not what's happening. Europe tends to follow the United States’ lead,” Clouet said.

The degradation in the public's perception of corruption comes with serious consequences, he warned, causing disenchanted citizens "to abstain from politics" as well as driving "social anger, which can fuel illiberal political forces. In all cases, it's democracy that really loses out.”

A survey released on Monday by the Cevipof research institute found that just 22 percent of people in France say they have confidence in politics – a four percent drop on the previous year.</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 18:02:26 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/efd20604-f61d-11f0-ba0a-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-20T161325Z-1705529737-RC245JA65JXM-RTRMADP-3-FRANCE-POLITICS-BUDGET.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Democrats introduce 'Virginia's law' named for Epstein accuser to end shield for sex traffickers</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260210-democrats-introduce-virginia-law-named-epstein-accuser-end-shield-sex-traffickers</link><description>Congressional ​ Democrats introduced legislation on Tuesday that they said would eliminate the statute of limitations that has shielded sex ⁠traffickers such as the late financier Jeffrey Epstein .

Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and Representative Teresa Leger Fernandez announced the proposal alongside Epstein victims and Virginia Giuffre 's family. The proposal – Virginia's Law – is named after Giuffre, ​one of Epstein's most prominent accusers, who died by suicide last year .

The bill's fate ‍in the Senate and House of Representatives, which are both controlled by Republicans, is unclear.

However, a bipartisan effort was successful last ​year to compel the Department of Justice to release all unclassified files in its Epstein ​investigation .

"Virginia's dream was to inspire and empower survivors to come forward in a world that too often turns away from abuse and pushes it into the shadows. She wanted to bring light," said Sky Roberts, Giuffre's brother.

A teary-eyed Roberts, speaking at a press conference in the US Capitol, was asked about a photograph that has been made public showing former UK prince Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor with his arm around Giuffre.

"I think he should show up in front of ‍our Congress," Roberts responded, adding, "He has a lot of questions he needs to answer."

The Democrats' new bill would end the statute of ​limitations for adult victims or their survivors bringing civil suits, which would include many of Epstein's alleged victims. It broadens victims' legal recourse in additional ways, including covering applicable sex crimes occurring beyond US ‌soil if a US court has jurisdiction.

Though Epstein died in 2019, transparency and accountability for victims of his abuse have led to oversight investigations and passage of ‍the Epstein files law.

DOJ said it has released nearly 3.5 million pages of documents, though some files are heavily redacted. Members of Congress began reviewing unredacted files on Monday . Schumer has been calling for all the unreleased files, which he said number in the millions, to also be made public.

The House Oversight Committee interviewed Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell virtually on Monday in a private deposition.
