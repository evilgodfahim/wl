Farmers from the Coordination Rurale union had called for protests in Paris amid anger against a free trade agreement between the European Union and South American bloc Mercosur , which they fear may flood the country with cheap food imports, and the way the government is handling a cattle disease.

"We are between resentment and despair. We have a feeling of abandonment, like with Mercosur. We have been abandoned in favour of a space shuttle, an Airbus, or a car," Stéphane Pelletier, the deputy president of the union in Vienne, in central France, told Reuters.

The protest comes days after the European Commission proposed making 45 billion euros of EU funding available earlier to farmers and agreed to cut import duties on some fertilizers in a bid to win over countries wavering in their support of Mercosur.

The deal is backed by countries such as Germany and Spain and the Commission appeared to have won Italy's backing , meaning it would have the votes needed to approve the trade accord with or without French support. A vote on the deal is expected on Friday.

Farmers are also demanding an end to cow culling prompted by a series of highly contagious lumpy skin disease, which they consider excessive and advocate for vaccination instead.

A U.S. immigration agent shot and killed a 37-year-old woman in her car in Minneapolis on Wednesday during an immigration enforcement surge, according to local and federal officials, the latest violence in President Donald Trump's nationwide crackdown on migrants.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey adamantly rejected the Trump administration's assertion that the agent fired in self-defense, saying video of the shooting directly contradicted what he called the government's "garbage narrative."

"They're already trying to spin this as an action of self-defense," a visibly angry Frey said at a press conference. "Having seen the video myself, I want to tell everybody directly - that is bullshit."

Frey blamed federal immigration agents for sowing chaos in the city, telling ICE: "Get the fuck out of Minneapolis." But he also urged residents to remain calm, as Democratic leaders in Minnesota, Washington and elsewhere called the ICE operation an unnecessary provocation that resulted in tragedy.

The Minnesota City Council identified the dead woman as Renee Nicole Good and said she was "out caring for her neighbors this morning and her life was taken today at the hands of the federal government." The council statement also demanded that ICE leave the city immediately.

As night fell, a crowd that appeared thousands strong gathered at the site of the shooting in a residential area of the city's Central neighborhood, aerial TV images showed. Candles placed at the site lighted up the winter night. Earlier, some protesters were met by heavily armed federal agents wearing gas masks who fired chemical irritants.

Opponents of Trump called for protests in several American cities, raising the risk that the killing could become a national flashpoint over his deployment of federal officers to Democratic-led cities and states.

Kristi Noem, secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, told a press conference that Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers were responding to a vehicle stuck in the snow when they were harassed by a "mob of agitators."

One of the protesters, later identified as Good, followed agents all day, Noem said. Good blocked their vehicle and refused orders to move out of the way, she said.

"She then proceeded to weaponize her vehicle, and she attempted to run a law enforcement officer over," Noem told a news conference, saying the car struck the officer.

She characterized that as domestic terrorism and said the act was under investigation by the FBI. State officials said they would launch their own investigation.

Videos of the shooting posted on social media and verified by Reuters raised doubts about the government's account. One widely shared video showed a maroon Honda SUV partially blocking the road. As the clip begins, the driver inches forward before stopping to let another car pass.

The driver, with the window down, then appears to gesture to an approaching pickup truck to go ahead as well. Instead, the truck stops, and two officers exit and approach the car on foot.

As one of the officers orders the driver out of the SUV and grabs at the door handle, the vehicle reverses briefly, and a third agent moves to the front of the car from the passenger side.

The driver then advances, steering to the right in what appears to be an effort to drive away from the officers. The agent in front of the car pulls his weapon, steps back and fires as the moving car's left front bumper comes close to his legs.

He fires three shots, with at least one shot after the car's front bumper had passed him. It was not clear from the video whether the car made contact with the officer, who stayed on his feet throughout the encounter.

After the shots, the car accelerates and crashes into parked cars and a utility pole.

Noem said the officer was experienced and "followed his training." He was treated by a doctor at a hospital and released.

Good's mother told the Minnesota Star Tribune that her daughter was "extremely compassionate," and she said Good was not the type of person to confront ICE agents.

"She's taken care of people all her life," her mother, Donna Ganger, told the newspaper. "She was loving, forgiving and affectionate."

The police chief said Good, who was married, was not a target of immigration operations. A witness whose home is nearby told CNN that Good lived in the neighborhood.

The Department of Homeland Security has said it is conducting the "largest DHS operation ever" in Minnesota with 2,000 officers deployed to arrest "fraudsters, murderers, rapists, and gang members." The surge follows allegations of wide-scale welfare fraud involving Somali immigrants, whom Trump has called "garbage." Noem said authorities had arrested 1,500 people in recent weeks.

Democratic Governor Tim Walz, who ran for U.S. vice president in the 2024 election won by Trump, also rejected the federal government's account and placed the blame for the shooting on the Trump administration. He told a press conference that he had put the National Guard on alert for possible deployment.

"What we are seeing is the consequences of governance designed to generate fear, headlines and conflict," Walz said. "...Today that recklessness cost someone their life."

In a social media post, Trump said the video showed the woman "violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer, who seems to have shot her in self defense."

The competing narratives highlighted U.S. political polarization, in which Trump's supporters enthusiastically endorse his version of events while opponents contend his assertions are often provably false.

Venus de Mars, a 65-year-old who lives near the site of the shooting, described seeing paramedics perform CPR on a woman collapsed next to a snowbank near the crashed car.

"There's been lots of ICE activity but nothing like this," de Mars said. "I'm so angry. I'm so angry, and I feel helpless."

The fraud allegations date to 2020 against some nonprofit groups in the Somali community that administer childcare and other social services programs.

At least 56 people have pleaded guilty since federal prosecutors started to bring charges in 2022 under Trump's Democratic predecessor, Joe Biden. Walz announced this week he would not seek a third term as governor, saying he did not have time both to address the fraud scandal and to campaign.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 07:45:42 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/L56UZZIG7BJ4ZD4SZJ33QPFUPI.jpg?auth=ca1a52392d84204a32a23b1197ae072bbdcf3ceabb814d74d633ec56bc08b2e8&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China against 'political disinformation' about US government email breach</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-against-political-disinformation-about-us-government-email-breach-2026-01-08/</link><description>BEIJING, Jan 8 (Reuters) - China on Thursday said it was against "politically motivated disinformation" in relation to reports of Chinese hackers targeting staff in United States congressional committees in an email breach.

Shahin Dehghan, a member of the police force in Malard county west of Tehran, "was martyred a few hours ago after being stabbed during efforts to control unrest", Fars news agency reported, adding that efforts to identify the perpetrators are underway.

Unrest broke out in Iran on December 28 after merchants in Tehran staged a protest against rising prices and the collapse of the rial, triggering a wave of similar actions in other cities.

The demonstrations have spread to 25 of Iran's 31 provinces, according to an AFP tally based on official statements and local media, and left dozens killed including from security forces.

It is the most serious protest movement in the Islamic republic since the 2022-2023 nationwide rallies sparked by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini , who was arrested for allegedly violating the strict dress code for women.

The demonstrations have yet to reach the scale of the 2022-2023 movement, let alone that of mass 2009 street protests that followed disputed elections.

But they have presented a new challenge for Iran's leadership against the backdrop of a biting economic crisis and on the heels of the 12-day war with Israel last June.

Several Iraq-based Iranian Kurdish opposition parties have called for a general strike on Thursday in Iran in support of the protests, one of the exiled parties told AFP.

The Komala party, an exiled Iraq-based Iranian Kurdish separatist group that Tehran considers a terrorist organisation, announced the strike on Wednesday.

"Seven Kurdish opposition parties have called for a general strike tomorrow Thursday," said Komala central committee member Hassan Rahmanpanah.

"The aim of this call is to demonstrate the unified support of the Kurdish people for the struggle and protests being waged by the Iranian people against the Islamic republic," he told AFP.

Rahmanpanah also accused the Iranian authorities of "brutal and criminal attacks" against demonstrators.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 07:47:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/a79c9282-eb37-11f0-b067-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/f6ac7cbadb34583479d554d2cad827ebc263e250.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China says it will release more details about extradition case from Cambodia</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-says-it-will-release-more-details-about-extradition-case-cambodia-2026-01-08/</link><description>BEIJING, Jan 8 (Reuters) - China said on Thursday it will release more information related to the extradition of an individual named Chen Zhi from Cambodia, without confirming the person's whereabouts or if he is the same person sanctioned by the U.S. and Britain, accused of operating large online scam centres.

The relevant authorities in China will release information about the specific situation, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said when asked about the case.

"China is willing to strengthen law enforcement cooperation with neighbouring countries, including Cambodia, to safeguard the security of people's lives and property ... and cooperation between countries in the region," Mao told a regular press conference.

Cambodia said on Wednesday it had extradited three people to China, including an individual named Chen Zhi, after a joint investigation into transnational crime, amid international probes into sprawling "scam centres".</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 08:32:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/M2LAQ2T46FJH7INWA66ME7EMC4.jpg?auth=c4947396423bd3f503fd38a39f130e88d3b6ed528f9937f510c18de912c1adec&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Thirty-nine dead in Gambia migrant boat sinking, officials say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/thirty-nine-dead-gambia-migrant-boat-sinking-officials-say-2026-01-08/</link><description>BANJUL, Jan 8 (Reuters) - The death toll after a boat carrying Europe-bound migrants capsized off Gambia's coast on New Year's Eve has risen to 39, two government officials told Reuters, as survivors described the vessel as "overcrowded and dilapidated".

Gambia's defence ministry last week put the death toll at seven and said more than 200 people could have been on board.

A total of 112 people had been rescued as of Wednesday, said Sima Lowe, public relations officer for Gambia's Immigration Department, and a senior defence ministry official who asked not to be named as he was not authorised to speak to press.

The migration route used by West Africans trying to reach Spain via the Canary Islands is one of the world's deadliest.

Survivors interviewed by Reuters after being released from hospital in Gambia this week said the boat had been heading for Europe.

Their stories highlight the risks and challenges faced by would-be migrants from West Africa who are often fleeing poverty, unemployment and lack of opportunities in their home countries.

"It's ... desperation driving me to risk my life, seeking better opportunities in Europe due to poverty and lack of prospects at home," said Sadibou Fatty, who described the journey as "traumatic".

"I survived the tragedy but lost friends and fellow passengers," he said, adding that, unlike many others on board, he knew how to swim.

Of the 39 dead, 24 were recovered in Gambian territory, while 15 were recovered in Senegalese territory, the defence official said.

Passengers on board included citizens of Gambia, Senegal, Guinea, Mali, Ivory Coast, Burkina Faso and Sierra Leone, the official said.

"My friends in Europe inspired me to take the 'back way,'" said Kajali Camara, another survivor, referring to irregular immigration routes via small boats.

"They're supporting their families back home, and I wanted a better life too," he said.

Gambia's government said it intercepted more than 2,700 would-be migrants in 2025.

During the first 11 months of 2025, irregular migration into the European Union along the West African route fell 60%, according to the EU's border agency Frontex.

The drop is largely due to stronger prevention efforts by departure countries working with EU member states, Frontex has said.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 08:32:04 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump says US oversight of Venezuela could last years, NYT reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/trump-says-us-oversight-venezuela-could-last-years-nyt-reports-2026-01-08/</link><description>Jan 8 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said that "only time will tell" how long the United States will maintain oversight of Venezuela in an interview published by the New York Times early on Thursday.

When asked by the Times if it would be three months, six months, a year or longer, Trump said: "I would say much longer."

"We will rebuild it in a very profitable way," Trump said of Venezuela , adding, "we're going to be using oil, and we're going to be taking oil. We're getting oil prices down, and we're going to be giving money to Venezuela, which they desperately need."

Trump added the U.S. was "getting along very well" with the interim president Delcy Rodriguez's government in Venezuela right now, according to the Times.

Trump on Tuesday unveiled a plan to refine and sell up to 50 million barrels of Venezuelan oil that had been stuck in Venezuela under U.S. blockade, in a further sign that Washington is coordinating with the Venezuelan government since capturing President Nicolas Maduro in a raid last weekend.

“They’re giving us everything that we feel is necessary,” Trump said, referring to the Venezuelan government.

Dual-use items are goods, software or technologies that have both civilian and military applications. They include certain rare earth magnets that power motors in car parts such as side mirrors, speakers and oil pumps. They play an even bigger role in EVs.

"Civilian users will not be affected," He Yadong, a commerce ministry spokesperson, told reporters. "China has always been committed to the stability and security of global production and supply chains," he added.

He did not say whether rare earth elements were covered by the restrictions, and did not comment when asked about reports by state media that the commerce ministry was weighing whether to further tighten rare‑earth export licences to Japan.

China has an export control list of around 1,100 dual-use items and technologies that manufacturers require a licence for to ship overseas, wherever the end user may be. That list contains at least seven categories of medium and heavy rare earths. It has, however, not specified which items may be affected by the ban on exports to Japan.

Ties between Beijing and Tokyo have deteriorated since Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said in November that a Chinese attack on Taiwan threatening Japan's survival could trigger a military response, a remark that Beijing said was "provocative".

"Exports to Japan for military purposes, that could find a military application, and all other end-uses contributing to the enhancement of Japan's military capabilities are prohibited," He said.

"The objective of halting Japan's re-militarisation and nuclear ambitions is entirely legitimate, justified and lawful," he added.

Japan's foreign ministry on Tuesday, the day Beijing announced the ban, said it strongly protested the measures and demanded that China withdraw them.

Last month, Japan's cabinet approved a record spending package for the fiscal year starting in April that includes a 3.8% increase in the country's annual military budget to 9 trillion yen ($58 billion).</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 09:30:08 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/MIS3J3ZQRJKV7NQ7AVJ5DOXA3Q.jpg?auth=01fac781bdd2ff1e49f2d0eac3c004dc17e60256993583cfbdedc7b5f15657f7&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Turkey ready to help end conflict in Syria's Aleppo, parliament speaker says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/turkey-ready-help-end-conflict-syrias-aleppo-parliament-speaker-says-2026-01-08/</link><description>ANKARA, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Turkey said on Thursday it is ready to help Syria if asked after the Syrian army independently launched a "counter-terrorism" operation in Aleppo, where fierce fighting broke out in recent days between government forces and Kurdish fighters.

Turkey's Defence Ministry said at a briefing that the Aleppo operation was "carried out entirely by the Syrian army," implying no Turkish involvement.

The clashes in the northern Syrian city on Tuesday and Wednesday killed at least four people and drove thousands of civilians from their homes, with Washington reported to be mediating a de-escalation.

Ankara is the strongest foreign backer of the interim administration in Damascus and maintains a substantial military presence in northern Syria.

"If Syria requests assistance, Turkey will provide the necessary support," the ministry said.

The violence - and statements trading blame over who started it - signaled that a stalemate between Damascus and Kurdish authorities that have resisted into the central government was deepening and growing deadlier.

Turkey deems the Kurdish fighters terrorists and has threatened a military operation if they do not integrate with Syrian authorities.

"We are following the developments in Syria hour by hour. It is an extremely fragile environment," Turkish Parliament Speaker Numan Kurtulmus said at a separate briefing in parliament in Ankara.

"We are ready to provide all kinds of support for the immediate end of the clashes in Aleppo and the establishment of peace and stability," he said.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 09:31:02 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russian strikes on Ukraine's Dnipropetrovsk leave one million without water and heat</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260108-russian-strikes-on-ukraine-s-dnipropetrovsk-leave-one-million-without-water-and-heat</link><description>Russian strikes on Ukraine overnight left more than one million people in the Dnipropetrovsk region without water supplies or heating, a Ukrainian minister said Thursday, as temperatures dipped below freezing.

As in previous winters, Russia has intensified its strikes on Ukraine's energy sites , leading to heating and water outages in what Kyiv and its allies call a deliberate strategy to wear down the civilian population.

The large-scale Russian drone attack also knocked out power in the Zaporizhzhia region, leaving thousands without electricity or heating, the state grid operator Ukrenergo said late Wednesday.

"Repair work continues in Dnipropetrovsk region to restore heat and water supply for over a million subscribers," Restoration Minister Oleksiy Kuleba wrote on social media.

The Ukrainian air force said Russia attacked with 97 drones, with 70 downed by air defence systems but 27 striking various locations, without elaborating.

Dnipropetrovsk's critical energy infrastructure was damaged in the attack, according to its military head Vladyslav Gaivanenko.

"The situation is difficult. However, as soon as the security situation allows, energy workers will begin restoration work," he posted on Telegram.

In Zaporizhzhia, the electricity supply was restored to "key facilities" but most consumers were still without power, according to its governor, Ivan Fedorov.

Kyiv has responded to the long-running targeting of its energy grid with strikes on Russian oil depots and refineries, seeking to cut off Moscow's vital energy exports and trigger fuel shortages.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 09:32:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/82680770-ec6e-11f0-a20f-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-07T215622Z-2080856433-RC2KWIAIRL67-RTRMADP-3-UKRAINE-CRISIS-ATTACK-POWER-ZAPORIZHZHIA.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Colombian President Petro defends national security in the face of Trump's threats</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/colombian-president-petro-defends-national-security-in-the-face-of-trump-s-threats</link><description /><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 09:52:32 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/843565ba-ec74-11f0-bf8b-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260108-090954-091151-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UK helped US military to seize sentenced oil tanker on way to Russia</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/uk-helped-us-military-to-seize-sentenced-oil-tanker-on-way-to-russia</link><description /><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 09:52:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/2e41c054-ec74-11f0-82e9-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260108-090718-090920-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'Very challenging: Lack of stability, security' amid decade-long civil war in Yemen</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/very-challenging-lack-of-stability-security-amid-decade-long-civil-war-in-yemen</link><description /><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 09:52:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/72f77514-ec73-11f0-8d12-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260108-080638-081309-CS-01.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>American plans for Venezuelan oil</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/american-plans-for-venezuelan-oil</link><description /><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 09:52:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/845d2740-ec73-11f0-9566-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260108-090453-090654-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>ICE officer kills a woman in Minneapolis</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/ice-officer-kills-a-woman-in-minneapolis</link><description /><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 09:52:39 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/04e53afc-ec73-11f0-9ace-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260108-090223-090419-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>ICE fatal shooting of Minnesota woman puts US on edge</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/ice-fatal-shooting-minnesota-woman-puts-us-edge-2026-01-08/</link><description>MINNEAPOLIS, Jan 8 (Reuters) - The fatal shooting of a 37-year-old Minnesota mother by a U.S. immigration agent has put the city of Minneapolis and much of the United States on edge, with the potential of becoming another flashpoint in a polarized country.

State and federal officials offered starkly different accounts of the shooting, in which an unidentified officer killed U.S. citizen Renee Nicole Good in her car on Wednesday while immigration officers were carrying out what federal officials have called the "largest DHS operation ever" by the Department of Homeland Security.

With 2,000 federal officers deployed across the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and Saint Paul, thousands of people gathered in Minneapolis to protest the shooting, while demonstrations were called in New York, Chicago, Seattle, Phoenix, Orlando, and Columbus, Ohio.

The Minnesota operation, which includes U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, is part of Republican President Donald Trump's nationwide crackdown on migrants and a politically charged investigation into fraud allegations against some Minnesota nonprofit groups in the Somali community.

At least 56 people have pleaded guilty since federal prosecutors under the previous Democratic administration of Joe Biden, started investigating childcare and other social service programs in the Somali community.

Trump's DHS secretary, Kristi Noem, labeled Wednesday's incident as an act of domestic terrorism, saying an experienced officer followed his training with an act of self-defense.

Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, both Democrats, immediately disputed the federal government's account and blamed Trump for what they called an unnecessary provocation by deploying federal law enforcement.

"It was not 'domestic terrorism.' It was state sanctioned violence. A family will forever live with the pain caused by the admin's reckless and deadly actions," Democratic U.S. Representative Ilhan Omar, a Somali-American representing Minneapolis and a frequent target of Trump's political barbs, said on X.

The competing narratives highlight the political polarization of the U.S., where Trump's supporters enthusiastically endorse his version of events and opponents contend his assertions are often provably false.

Video showed masked officers approaching Good's car, which was stopped at an unusual angle on a Minneapolis street. The car then backs up and pulls away, briefly driving in the direction of the officer who opened fire at close range.

The video did not appear to show contact or any sign that the officer was wounded, though Noem said he was treated at a hospital and released, while Trump said on social media the woman "ran over the ICE Officer."

Trump administration officials called the incident part of a pattern of anti-Trump demonstrators endangering ICE officers, but critics say they saw a woman attempting to evade masked and armed men and the vehicle's front wheels turned away from the shooter.

While Trump and Noem drew immediate conclusions that the officer was the subject of an intentional attack, border czar Tom Homan was more cautious.

"It would be unprofessional to comment on what I think happened in that situation. Let the investigation play out and hold people accountable based on the investigation," Homan told CBS News.

The FBI and Minnesota state officials are investigating.

The ICE officer would be protected from being charged by local prosecutors if he was acting within the scope of his official federal duties, and any legal case would likely come down to whether he reasonably feared for his life, said Caren Morrison, a law professor at Georgia State College of Law. She said cases involving vehicles tended to favor officers because a car could be considered a deadly weapon.

Minnesota law allows the use of deadly force by an officer only if an objectively reasonable officer would believe that doing so was necessary to protect the officer or others from immediate death or serious harm. Federal law has a similar standard.

Minnesota civil rights attorney Paul Applebaum said it was unclear who, if anyone, would prosecute the officer. “The possibility of the officer being prosecuted by Pam Bondi are slim to none,” Applebaum said of the U.S. attorney general, a Trump loyalist. He said if state officials tried to charge the officer it would set up a constitutional conflict between state and federal government.

Federal agents are generally immune from state prosecution for actions taken as part of their official duties.

Courts have increasingly narrowed the ability to sue federal officers for damages for civil rights violations to the point it was “almost an empty exercise,” Applebaum said.

The Minneapolis City Council identified the dead woman as Good and said she was "out caring for her neighbors this morning and her life was taken today at the hands of the federal government."

She was the mother of a 6-year-old boy, the Minnesota Star Tribune reported, citing the boy's grandfather.

Good's mother told the Minnesota Star Tribune that her daughter was "extremely compassionate," and she said Good was not the type of person to confront ICE agents.

"She's taken care of people all her life," her mother, Donna Ganger, told the Star Tribune. "She was loving, forgiving and affectionate."</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 10:26:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/FQF3ZLXKY5IOBM6EFT5Z4X47GU.jpg?auth=ea8bede7c292dfb5c9151a83cdf2dc87ef36228899c29a08aaf1974e635ec893&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Swiss families file legal complaint over New Year's bar fire</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/swiss-families-file-legal-complaint-over-new-years-bar-fire-2026-01-08/</link><description>GENEVA, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Families of those who died or were injured in a New Year's Eve fire in the bar of a Swiss ski resort have filed a legal complaint to the Swiss prosecutor's office, a lawyer for a group of victims confirmed to Reuters on Thursday.

"Each family filed a complaint and joined the proceedings as a plaintiff. These applications were accepted (by prosecutors)," Romain Jordan, a Geneva-based lawyer, said in response to emailed questions.

He did not specify the target of the legal complaint, adding only that it was "against all those responsible, without exception".

The criminal investigation into the Crans-Montana fire only includes the bar's owners who are suspected of crimes including homicide by negligence. Questions remain about the fire and the safety procedures in place.

Moscow has intensified its attacks on Ukraine's energy system as Ukrainian forces fend off Russian advances on the battlefield and Kyiv faces U.S. pressure to secure a peace deal .

Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Oleksiy Kuleba said repairs were still ongoing to return heat and water supplies to more than 1 million consumers in the industrialised region of Dnipropetrovsk.

The energy ministry said nearly 800,000 consumers in the region remained without electricity early on Thursday but that power had been restored to the other affected region, Zaporizhzhia.

Zaporizhzhia governor Ivan Fedorov said it was the first time in "recent years" that his region had faced a total blackout, but that officials had been quick to respond.

"A difficult night for the region. But 'light' always wins," he wrote on Telegram on Thursday.

Ukraine's energy ministry said eight mines across the Dnipropetrovsk region had faced blackouts, but that workers had been evacuated.

Water supplies to the strategic city of Pavlohrad and nearby areas could take up to a day to repair, said Mykola Lukashuk, head of the Dnipropetrovsk regional council.

Ukraine is facing an impending cold snap this week, with Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko warning late on Tuesday that it would likely compound disruptions to power and heating.

The energy ministry added on Wednesday that weather conditions had already cut power to some settlements in at least four regions.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 10:26:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5Y6UQGQ47FJCRJM775BJA2DFQE.jpg?auth=628f0617e75ee9f9a5e536ad67d7263b926c3b06b4f8e31c61144147068ad0c9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran warns suppliers against overpricing or hoarding goods</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-warns-suppliers-against-overpricing-or-hoarding-goods-2026-01-08/</link><description>DUBAI, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Iran's president warned domestic suppliers against hoarding or overpricing goods, state media reported on Thursday, as Tehran rolls out high-stakes subsidy reforms during nationwide protests against economic hardship.

"People should not feel any shortage in terms of goods' supply and distribution," Masoud Pezeshkian said, calling upon his government to ensure adequate supply of goods and monitoring of prices across the country.

Iran's subsidy reform is meant to favour consumers over importers by removing preferential currency exchange rates that allowed importers to access foreign currency at rates cheaper than those available to ordinary Iranians.

According to the policy, Iranians will be given about $7 a month to purchase basic goods in select grocery stores. The price of some basic goods such as cooking oil or eggs has significantly increased since the policy was announced.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 10:27:03 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/FNAFQ57A7NNMHOK3AXWWVVUG6U.jpg?auth=f31b80f332b45e87a9a6a80270b80ac6d65a33a466d96773c79191c68efe0820&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Pope Leo urges Catholic cardinals to create more inclusive Church</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/pope-leo-urges-catholic-cardinals-create-more-inclusive-church-2026-01-08/</link><description>VATICAN CITY, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Pope Leo met on Thursday with the world's Catholic cardinals as part of a two-day summit, urging the senior clerics to shun divisions in the 1.4-billion-member Church and focus on attracting new believers.

Leo also signalled a desire to press ahead with the reforms of the late Pope Francis, who battled with conservative cardinals while trying to make Catholicism more inclusive by welcoming gay Catholics and discussing women's ordination .

Beginning the closed-door summit on Wednesday, Leo said the Church would only grow if it could attract people with a message of God's love for everyone, according to remarks released by the Vatican.

"Only love is trustworthy; only love is credible," said the pope. "While unity attracts, division scatters."

Massimo Faggioli, an Italian academic at Trinity College Dublin, who follows the Vatican, said Leo was "working to convince the cardinals that they need to work collectively together to do what the Catholic people want them to do".

"Leo is cautious, but I think he will continue on Pope Francis' trajectories," said Faggioli. "I don't think he will go back."

Francis, who led the Church for 12 years, died in April . Leo, formerly the U.S. Cardinal Robert Prevost, was elected the new pope in May.

One hundred and seventy of the world's 245 cardinals were attending the summit, which ends on Thursday, the Vatican said.

The clerics have been asked to refrain from publicly discussing their meetings in order to allow for frank conversations, spokesman Matteo Bruni said.

Leo, opening his first full year as Church leader, asked the cardinals on Wednesday for advice on what priorities he should focus on for the next two years.

British Cardinal Timothy Radcliffe urged his peers to shun divisions. If they quarrel with one another, he said, "we shall be of no use to the Holy Father".</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 10:27:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/VEI2F6KRMJNHVLFLGCSCT6W6U4.jpg?auth=e56df8bf5246a2490839f0bbbed242220623b181b6ff615ea0d3f92fabe80b64&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israeli military says it hit Gaza launch site following failed rocket fire</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-military-says-it-hit-gaza-launch-site-following-failed-rocket-fire-2026-01-08/</link><description>Jan 8 (Reuters) - Israel's military said on Thursday it had carried out a targeted strike on a rocket launch site near Gaza City after identifying a failed launch, as questions mount over when the next phase of the Gaza ceasefire will begin.

The military said the projectile did not cross into Israeli territory and that the launch site was struck shortly after the attempt was detected.

It accused Hamas of violating the ceasefire twice in the past 24 hours. A source from the Palestinian militant group told Reuters it was checking the allegation.

Israel is awaiting the handover of the final body due under the current stage of the truce. An Israeli official close to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel will not move to the next phase of the ceasefire until Hamas returns the remains of the last Israeli hostage still held in Gaza.

Israel has yet to open the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt, which is another condition of the U.S.-backed plan, saying it will only do so once the remains are returned.

Despite the ceasefire, Israel has continued to carry out air strikes and targeted operations across Gaza. The Israeli military said it views "with utmost severity" any attempts by militant groups in Gaza to attack Israel.

Israel and Hamas have accused each other of major breaches of the deal and remain far apart on the more difficult steps envisaged for the next phase.

Hamas has refused to disarm and has been reasserting its control as Israeli troops remain entrenched in about half the territory. Israel has said it would resume military action if Hamas is not disarmed peacefully.

Israel and Palestinian armed groups have been engaged in repeated rounds of fighting since the war erupted in October 2023.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 10:27:47 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>ICE fatal shooting of Minnesota woman puts US on edge</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/ice-fatal-shooting-minnesota-woman-puts-us-edge-2026-01-08/</link><description /><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 10:28:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Israel strikes Gaza launch site after failed rocket fire</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-military-says-it-hit-gaza-launch-site-following-failed-rocket-fire-2026-01-08/</link><description /><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 10:29:02 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Trump says US oversight of Venezuela could last years</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/trump-says-us-oversight-venezuela-could-last-years-2026-01-08/</link><description>Jan 8 (Reuters) - The United States could oversee Venezuela and control its oil revenue for years, President Donald Trump said in an interview published on Thursday.

During what the New York Times described as a wide-ranging, two-hour interview, the paper said Trump also appeared to lift a threat to take military action against Venezuela's neighbour Colombia. Trump invited Colombia's leftist leader, whom he had previously called a "sick man", to visit Washington.

"Only time will tell" how long the United States will oversee Venezuela, Trump said. When asked by the newspaper if it would be three months, six months, a year or longer, Trump said: "I would say much longer."

"We will rebuild it in a very profitable way," Trump said of Venezuela , where he sent troops to seize President Nicolas Maduro in a night raid on January 3.

"We're going to be using oil, and we're going to be taking oil. We're getting oil prices down, and we're going to be giving money to Venezuela, which they desperately need."

Trump added that the U.S. was "getting along very well" with the government of the interim president, Delcy Rodriguez, a longstanding Maduro loyalist who had served as the ousted leader's vice president.

The Times said Trump declined to answer questions about why he had decided not to give power in Venezuela instead to the opposition, which Washington had previously considered the legitimate winner of an election in 2024.

Trump on Tuesday unveiled a plan to refine and sell up to 50 million barrels of Venezuelan oil that had been stuck in Venezuela under U.S. blockade.

"They’re giving us everything that we feel is necessary," Trump said, referring to the Venezuelan government.

He declined to comment when asked if he had personally spoken to Rodríguez.

"But Marco speaks to her all the time," he said, referring to Secretary of State Marco Rubio. "I will tell you that we are in constant communication with her and the administration."

The Times said its reporters were permitted to sit in during a phone call between Trump and Colombia's President Gustavo Petro, provided the contents of the call were off the record.

In a post on social media, Trump said: "It was a great honor to speak with the President of Colombia, Gustavo Petro, who called to explain the situation of drugs and other disagreements that we have had. I appreciated his call and tone, and look forward to meeting him in the near future."

Petro described the call, his first with Trump, as cordial.

On Sunday Trump had threatened to carry out military action against Colombia, calling Petro "a sick man who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States, and he's not going to be doing it very long".

The Times said Trump's phone call with Petro lasted about an hour and "appeared to dissipate any immediate threat of U.S. military action".

Trump has said the United States intends to "run" Venezuela. U.S. officials have indicated their plan for now is to exert influence without a military occupation.

Venezuela, with the world's biggest proven oil reserves, has become impoverished in recent decades, with eight million people fleeing abroad in one of the world's biggest migration crises.

Washington and the Venezuelan opposition have long blamed corruption, mismanagement and brutality by the ruling Socialist Party. Maduro blamed the economic damage on U.S. sanctions.

Several senior U.S. officials said on Wednesday that the United States needs to control Venezuela's oil sales and revenues indefinitely in order to restore the country's oil industry and rebuild its economy.

Trump is scheduled to meet with the heads of major oil companies at the White House on Friday to discuss ways of raising Venezuela's oil production. Representatives from the top three U.S. oil companies, Exxon Mobil, ConocoPhillips and Chevron (XOM.N) , opens new tab , (COP.N) , opens new tab , (CVX.N) , opens new tab , would be present, according to a source familiar with the planning.

The companies, all of which have experience in Venezuela, have declined to comment.

U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in an interview with CNBC on Wednesday that he spoke with the CEOs of all three companies immediately after Maduro was seized, and expected them to engage in rehabilitating Venezuela's oil sector.

"Are they going to put billions of dollars into building new infrastructure in Venezuela next week? Of course not," he said. "But they want to be productive advisers and helpers in that process."</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 10:50:48 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/T54AVALDRNIMZFDNJ6KPMGCJ24.jpg?auth=fc5d007ff3e252575cd716eed4f5ef4a431a30e119a27f0ad8658ef255441f64&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>German president says US is destroying world order</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/german-president-says-us-is-destroying-world-order-2026-01-08/</link><description>BERLIN, Jan 8 (Reuters) - German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier has strongly criticised the U.S. foreign policy under President Donald Trump and urged the world not to let the world order disintegrate into a "den of robbers" where the unscrupulous take what they want.

In unusually strong remarks, which appeared to refer to actions such as the ousting of Venezuela 's President Nicolas Maduro at the weekend, the former foreign minister said global democracy was being attacked as never before.

Although the German president's role is largely ceremonial, his words carry some weight and he has more freedom to express views than politicians.

Describing Russia's annexation of Crimea and the full-scale invasion of Ukraine as a watershed, Steinmeier said the U.S. behaviour represented a second historic rupture.

"Then there is the breakdown of values by our most important partner, the USA, which helped build this world order," Steinmeier said in remarks at a symposium late on Wednesday.

"It is about preventing the world from turning into a den of robbers, where the most unscrupulous take whatever they want, where regions or entire countries are treated as the property of a few great powers," he said.

Active intervention was needed in threatening situations and countries such as Brazil and India must be convinced to protect the world order, he said.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 10:51:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/Q5JTRRPIOJPCFI37QN5N5B2NLE.jpg?auth=27ba10d809b9d9ed3bbfa6b4ba63668261e4300fe6995603ba408225d24148cc&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US Senate to vote on reining in Trump on Venezuela</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/us-senate-vote-reining-trump-venezuela-2026-01-08/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 8 (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate is due to consider a resolution on Thursday that would block President Donald Trump from taking further military action against Venezuela without congressional authorization, and backers said the measure could pass in a close vote.

Days after U.S. forces captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro in a dramatic military raid in Caracas, senators will vote on the latest in a series of war powers measures introduced since the administration ramped up military pressure on the country with attacks on boats off its coast in September.

Republicans have blocked all of the measures, but the last vote was just 49-51 , as two senators from Trump's party joined Democrats in backing a resolution in November. Administration officials had told lawmakers at that time that they did not plan regime change or strikes on Venezuelan territory.

After Maduro's capture, some lawmakers have accused the administration of misleading Congress, including Democrats publicly and some Republicans behind the scenes.

"I spoke to at least two Republicans today who did not vote for this resolution previously who are thinking about it," Senator Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican who is co-sponsoring the resolution, told a news conference ahead of the vote.

"I can't guarantee you how they vote, but at least two are thinking about it, and some of them are talking publicly about their misgivings over this," Paul said, speaking beside Democratic Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, another leader of the resolution.

He did not identify the Republicans. Trump's party holds a 53-47-seat majority in the Senate.

Senate passage would be a significant victory for the lawmakers who have been pushing the war powers issue.

But to become law, the resolution would have to pass the Republican-led House of Representatives and survive an expected Trump veto, which would require two-thirds majorities in both chambers.

The lawmakers acknowledged the hurdles, but said some Republicans may be wary of a prolonged and expensive campaign of regime change in Venezuela. Trump on Wednesday said on his Truth Social website that he wanted the U.S. military budget to increase to $1.5 trillion from $1 trillion.

Kaine noted that U.S. forces have been striking Venezuelan boats for months, and mentioned Trump's statement that the U.S. would "run" Venezuela as well as the seizures of Venezuelan oil, saying: "This is not a surgical arrest operation by any stretch."

The U.S. Constitution requires any president to obtain Congress' approval before launching a prolonged military operation.

Senators who oppose the war powers resolution say the seizure of Maduro is a law enforcement operation, not a military action. Maduro faces trial in a U.S. court on drug and guns charges, to which he has pleaded not guilty. They also say that Trump is within his rights as commander-in-chief to launch limited military actions he feels are necessary for national security.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 11:21:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LCNWMLPW75KJHGKXPFW5EONUGY.jpg?auth=76b63496e007cd2635eb9c8495ee78d1896960e83442a82477618fc63903a39d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Cubans brace for more hardship as US pressure on Venezuela chokes off oil</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/cubans-brace-more-hardship-us-pressure-venezuela-chokes-off-oil-2026-01-08/</link><description>MATANZAS, Cuba, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Cubans braced for a deepening economic crisis after the United States seized two more Venezuela-linked oil tankers on Wednesday, a move that threatens to sever a critical energy lifeline for the Communist-run island just days after U.S. forces captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro .

In the port of Matanzas where oil tankers dock, shuttered gas stations and long fuel lines reflected mounting supply shortages. The latest U.S. action is stoking fears that already-frequent, hours-long power cuts will worsen.

"Now I think that with this situation, things will get worse, because now they won't let oil come," William Gonzalez, a Matanzas resident, told Reuters. "Before oil came from Venezuela and Russia, now it will only come from Russia...So that's one less source of oil, so the country must get a little worse."

In a dramatic escalation of its pressure campaign, the U.S. military on Wednesday seized the Russian-flagged tanker 'Marinera' in the Atlantic near Iceland after a two-week pursuit, U.S. officials said.

The seizure, which a senior Russian lawmaker decried as "outright piracy," marks the fourth such interception since Washington imposed a blockade on all sanctioned vessels going in and out of Venezuelan waters in mid-December.

Earlier on Wednesday, the U.S. Coast Guard had intercepted another Venezuela-linked tanker, the 'M Sophia,' northeast of South America.

For Cuba, the loss of Venezuelan oil is devastating. Between January and November of last year, Venezuela sent an average of 27,000 barrels per day (bpd) to the island, covering roughly 50% of Cuba's oil deficit, according to shipping data and documents from Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA.

"The repercussions are not going to be very good. Venezuela was one of the countries that helped us the most with energy and fuel," said Mario Valverde, a business owner in Havana.

While Mexico has become an "important supplier," President Claudia Sheinbaum said on Wednesday that Mexico is not sending more oil to Cuba than it has historically.

The aggressive U.S. posture has been met with a mix of anger and grim determination by some Cubans.

"We are very dissatisfied with (U.S. President Donald) Trump's attitude toward Maduro, because that is forcing a country to submit by force," said resident Manuel Rodriguez. "If there are more blackouts, we will have to endure the blackouts as Cubans and resist until the end."</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 11:23:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/APO3O2NMRJINFHRAY5FN67JNYU.jpg?auth=17d76a6878461e375c4139e75707eecfe0aa35cf14f1e572da3c813803010b87&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Malaysian prosecutors end graft case against country's deputy prime minister</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/malaysian-prosecutors-end-graft-case-against-countrys-deputy-prime-minister-2026-01-08/</link><description>KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Malaysian prosecutors said on Thursday that they have put an end to their corruption case against Deputy Prime Minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, saying that there was insufficient evidence to continue.

The move by the Attorney General's Chambers came more than two years after graft charges against Ahmad Zahid, the leader of a key partner in Malaysia's ruling coalition, were dropped to allow prosecutors to conduct further investigations.

The Kuala Lumpur High Court in September 2023 granted Ahmad Zahid a discharge not amounting to an acquittal on 47 charges involving criminal breach of trust, corruption, and money laundering related to funds connected to his charitable foundation.

The 2023 decision raised questions about the government's commitment to fighting corruption cases, with Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim's party dependent on the support of Ahmad Zahid's United Malays National Organisation to maintain its parliamentary majority.

The AGC said on Thursday that it has decided that no further action will be taken in relation to the case, adding that the decision was in line with the power and authority of the Attorney General under the Federal Constitution and related laws.

"After examining all the materials and new evidence obtained from the results of the further investigations and research, the AGC, based on the assessment and consideration of the prosecution, found that the available evidence is insufficient to support continuation of the prosecution for all the charges in question," it said in a statement.

The decision was made "taking into account the interests of justice, integrity of the prosecution process, as well as the need to ensure certainty and accuracy in the criminal justice system," it added.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 11:23:17 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/Y2TAMNY5SVLMHLFCZJ7G43OEBE.jpg?auth=8df7daa056ee28bbcddde0346a419c5ac109397ee17d0231713a181eb7517886&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Prince Group founder linked to online scams extradited to China, says CCTV</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/china-extradited-prince-group-founder-chen-zhi-state-media-reports-2026-01-08/</link><description>BEIJING, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Prince Group founder Chen Zhi, a Chinese national, has been extradited from Cambodia to China, where he is wanted on suspicion of fraud and operating illegal casinos, Chinese national broadcaster CCTV reported on Thursday.

China has been actively cooperating with countries such as Cambodia to effectively combat cross-border telecom and fraudulent phone scams, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning told reporters on Thursday.

"China is willing to strengthen law enforcement cooperation with neighbouring countries, including Cambodia, to safeguard the safety of people's lives and property... and cooperation among regional countries," she said, when asked about the extradition case. She did not name Chen directly.

China will release a wanted list of key members of the "Chen Zhi criminal group" and urges fugitives to surrender at once, CCTV said.

Cambodia's Interior Ministry said on Wednesday that it had extradited three Chinese nationals , including Chen, to China.

Cambodia said the extraditions were in response to a request from Beijing and reflected cooperation "in combating transnational crime".

The Cambodian ministry statement did not provide details on Chen or the alleged crimes but said his Cambodian citizenship had been revoked.

Chen was seen on footage released by CCTV being escorted off a China Southern Airlines plane by three Chinese SWAT officers, handcuffed and dressed in blue with his head covered in a black cloth, a video released by CCTV showed.

An officer removed the cloth to identify him before he was escorted off the tarmac with his head bowed, the clip showed.

Beijing's Public Security Bureau had set up a special task force to investigate individuals involved with Cambodia's Prince Group in 2020, calling the group a "mega cross-border online gambling syndicate", a Chinese court document released in 2022 showed.

The ministry had also instructed other local authorities to make arrests in collaboration with the task force from Beijing, according to the document.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 11:23:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump faces rare Republican opposition in Congress</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/trump-faces-rare-republican-opposition-congress-2026-01-08/</link><description /><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 11:24:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>US Senate to vote on reining in Trump on Venezuela</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/us-senate-vote-reining-trump-venezuela-2026-01-08/</link><description /><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 11:24:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Trump faces rare Republican opposition in Congress</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/trump-faces-rare-republican-opposition-congress-2026-01-08/</link><description /><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 11:24:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>How do shadow fleets work?

Deadly clashes erupted this week between Syrian government forces and the Kurdish-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) after the two sides failed to reach a year-end deadline to merge the Kurdish fighters into the main Damascus military.

"Turkey supports Syria's fight against terrorist organisations," the official told reporters, saying Ankara was "closely monitoring" developments in the north.

"Should Syria request assistance, Turkey will provide the necessary support," he said, echoing a long-standing offer by Ankara to extend military support to its allies in Damascus's new Islamist government.

Turkey has long been hostile to the Kurdish SDF that controls swathes of northeastern Syria, seeing it as an extension of the banned Kurdish militant group PKK, seeing it as a major threat along its southern border.

It has repeatedly pushed for implementation of a March 2025 deal under which the Kurds' semi-autonomous administration and military would be integrated into the Syrian military and security apparatus.

The Kurds are pushing for decentralised rule, an idea which Syria's new authorities have rejected, blocking the deal's implementation causing tensions that have occasionally erupted into clashes.

On Wednesday, the Syrian military began shelling two neighbourhoods in Aleppo after ordering all Kurdish fighters to leave the area following clashes that forced thousands of civilians to flee.

Parliamentary speaker Numan Kurtulmus said Turkey wanted to help end the clashes.

"Our aim is to bring an immediate end to the kind of clashes currently seen in Aleppo ... and for a truly pluralistic, democratic regime that meets the needs of Syria's people to be established rapidly. Turkey is ready to provide all necessary support for this," he told reporters.

He also warned against any involvement by Israel in the ongoing dispute between Damascus and the SDF, echoing frequent concerns expressed by Turkish officials that Israel could exploit the unrest to further its own interests.

Israel on Thursday denounced Damascus's operation "against the Kurdish minority in Aleppo", describing it as "grave and dangerous" for Syria's minorities, hiking concern it could weigh.

"Let me be very clear: Israel does not love the Sunni Arabs in Syria, nor does Israel love the Kurds of Syria," Kurtulmus said.

"We know the fundamental aim of some countries in the region is to fragment and divide this region further, to turn people against each other on ethnic, religious, and sectarian grounds and even turn them into enemies."</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 11:25:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/5853a4b2-ec7d-11f0-bd25-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26007608951129.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iranians protest for 12th day as Kurdish opposition calls for general strike</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/iranians-protest-for-12th-day-as-kurdish-opposition-calls-for-general-strike</link><description /><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 11:25:16 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/b0a91bca-ec77-11f0-9f16-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260108-091220-091420-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Greenland should hold talks with the US without Denmark, opposition leader says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/greenland-should-hold-talks-with-us-without-denmark-opposition-leader-says-2026-01-08/</link><description>COPENHAGEN, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Greenland should hold direct talks with the U.S. government without Denmark, a Greenlandic opposition leader told Reuters, as the Arctic island weighs how to respond to President Donald Trump's renewed push to bring it under U.S. control.

Trump has recently stepped up threats to take over Greenland, reviving an idea he first floated in 2019 during his first term in office.

Greenland is strategically located between Europe and North America, making it a critical site for the U.S. ballistic missile defence system. Its rich mineral resources also fit Washington's goal of reducing dependence on China.

The island is an autonomous territory of the Kingdom of Denmark. It has its own parliament and government, but Copenhagen retains authority over foreign affairs and defence.

"We encourage our current (Greenlandic) government actually to have a dialogue with the U.S. government without Denmark," said Pele Broberg, the leader of Naleraq , the largest opposition party and the most prominent political voice for Greenland's independence.

"Because Denmark is antagonising both Greenland and the U.S. with their mediation."

Naleraq, which strongly advocates a rapid move to full independence, doubled its seats to eight in last year's election, winning 25% of the vote in the nation of just 57,000.

Although excluded from the governing coalition, the party has said it wants a defence agreement with Washington and could pursue a "free association" arrangement - under which Greenland would receive U.S. support and protection in exchange for military rights, without becoming a U.S. territory.

All Greenlandic parties want independence but differ on how, and when, to achieve it.

Greenlandic Foreign Minister Vivian Motzfeldt said Greenland could not conduct direct talks with the U.S. without Denmark because it is not legally allowed to do so.

"We must respect the law, and we have rules for how to resolve issues in the Kingdom," she told Sermitsiaq daily late on Wednesday.

The Danish and Greenlandic governments did not immediately reply to requests for comment on Broberg's remarks.

The comments come ahead of a planned meeting between the Danish and Greenlandic foreign ministers and U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio next week to address tensions between NATO allies.

Motzfeldt said it was important to set Greenland's relationship with Washington on a steady course.

"My greatest hope is that the meeting will lead to a normalisation of our relationship," she told Sermitsiaq.

Rubio appears not to favour a military operation, according to France's foreign minister . But others in the Trump administration say the option is on the table.

"We are going to make sure we defend America's interests," U.S. Vice President JD Vance told Fox News in an interview aired late on Wednesday. "And I think the president is willing to go as far as he has to make sure he does that."</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 11:43:03 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/U7YOFTT6MRJU3EJX7RUW2IFXAM.jpg?auth=59819779d169eaa6cb73524cd8a28f6a4d34613d01ea39369f61c694cbf140b1&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Can the ICE agent who shot a Minneapolis woman be prosecuted?</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/can-ice-agent-who-shot-minneapolis-woman-be-prosecuted-2026-01-08/</link><description>NEW YORK, Jan 8 (Reuters) - A U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent shot and killed a 37-year-old woman in her car in Minneapolis on Wednesday amid President Donald Trump's federal crackdown.

Local officials rejected the Trump administration's explanation that it was self-defense.

Here is a look at the potential legal repercussions.

The officer fired "defensive shots" after a "violent rioter" attempted to run over officers, a spokeswoman of the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement, adding that the officer had feared for his life.

Online videos of the shooting verified by Reuters cast doubt on the government's narrative, however.

One video showed an officer approach an SUV and order the driver out and grab at the door handle while another officer appeared in front of the car.

The driver moves forward while turning away from the officers, and the one in front pulls his weapon, steps back and fires three shots.

It was not clear if the car made contact with the officer, and he fired at least one shot after it had already passed him.

Minnesota’s use-of-force law permits state police to use deadly force only if reasonable officers would believe doing so was necessary to protect themselves, or others, from death or serious harm.

Federal law has a similar standard, permitting use of deadly force when a reasonable officer would have probable cause to believe a person posed an immediate threat of death or serious injury.

Federal agents are generally immune from state prosecution for actions taken as part of their official duties. Immunity only applies when an officer's actions were authorized under federal law and were necessary and proper.

If Minnesota charged the agent, he could seek to move the case to federal court and argue he is immune from prosecution.

To prevail, the state would have to show the actions were outside his official duties or were objectively unreasonable or clearly unlawful.

If a judge ruled the officer was immune, the case would be dismissed and the state would not be able to charge him again.

Federal prosecutors can charge law enforcement officers for fatal shootings, but the bar is very high and charges are rare.

Prosecutors would need to show the officer knew his conduct was unlawful or acted with reckless disregard for the constitutional limits of his authority, which is difficult to prove in court.

The Trump administration has so far defended the officer's actions.

In addition to federal immunity, the agent could argue that his actions were reasonable under the Constitution, that he acted in self-defense or that he did not act with intent to harm or kill the woman.

Federal officers are immune from civil lawsuits unless their conduct clearly violated a clear constitutional right.

This legal standard, known as qualified immunity, has become a highly effective tool for shielding police officers accused of using excessive force, a series of Reuters investigative stories found in 2020.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 11:43:17 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/2NCQXLZ32JLXLCNB22W3EJIDNI.jpg?auth=b959dc526cfc37950aea3546c45f2a259962484896af61f514384eea59477d22&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'Any great power can do as it pleases': US operation in Venezuela 'a clear violation of int'l law'</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/any-great-power-can-do-as-it-pleases-us-operation-in-venezuela-a-clear-violation-of-int-l-law</link><description /><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 11:43:48 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/88308bc4-ec81-11f0-a6f8-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260104-175959-185611-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Live: Macron sets out foreign policy priorities in speech to French ambassadors</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260108-live-macron-sets-out-foreign-policy-priorities-speech-french-ambassadors</link><description>The French president 's address to ambassadors is expected to dwell at length on ongoing efforts to secure a ceasefire in Russia's war on Ukraine, days after Macron pledged to put French boots on the ground to safeguard Ukraine's security in the event of a peace deal.

A Russian Foreign Ministry statement said "militaristic declarations" by a coalition of pro-Ukraine Western governments were becoming increasingly dangerous.

Russia was responding for the first time to a meeting of the "coalition of the willing" in Paris on Tuesday at which Britain and France signed a declaration of intent on the future deployment.

French President Emmanuel Macron said it could involve sending thousands of French troops. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said it paved the way for a legal framework whereby "British, French and partner forces could operate on Ukrainian soil, securing Ukraine's skies and seas and regenerating Ukraine's armed forces for the future".

Russia "warns that the deployment of Western military units, military facilities, depots and other infrastructure on Ukrainian territory will be classified as foreign intervention, posing a direct threat to the security of not only Russia but also other European countries," the statement from Moscow said.

"All such units and facilities will be considered legitimate combat targets of the Russian Armed Forces."

It added: "The fresh militaristic declarations of the so-called coalition of the willing and the Kyiv regime constitute a veritable 'axis of war'.

"The plans of these participants are becoming increasingly dangerous and destructive for the future of the European continent and its inhabitants, who are also being forced by Western politicians to finance these aspirations out of their own pockets."

Russia, which staged a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, says it was forced to intervene in order to prevent Ukraine from being absorbed into NATO and used as a launchpad to threaten Russia. It has consistently said it will never accept the stationing of Western forces there.

Ukraine and its allies accuse Moscow of waging an imperial-style war aimed at seizing the territory of its neighbour, of which it now holds nearly 20%. They say Ukraine needs firm security guarantees as part of any peace settlement in order to prevent another Russian invasion in future.

The United States has ruled out sending its own troops to Ukraine, but its special envoy Steve Witkoff said at Tuesday's meeting in Paris that President Donald Trump "strongly stands behind" security protocols aimed at deterring future attacks on Ukraine.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 12:48:21 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/Y4OP2TMAKVODFCVMBYCPWVJ6SQ.jpg?auth=e02ddabef9a05c04ffd8c74c83aa3d68eb7ae8ef12321a03d91913eeb6e2691b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Syrian army orders evacuations as heavy fighting grips Aleppo's Kurdish areas</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/syrian-army-orders-evacuations-heavy-fighting-grips-aleppos-kurdish-areas-2026-01-08/</link><description>Jan 8 (Reuters) - The Syrian army clashed with fighters from the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in parts of Aleppo on Thursday and ordered residents to evacuate, accusing the SDF of using Kurdish-majority areas to launch attacks, according to Syrian state media.

The army released more than seven maps identifying areas it said would be targeted in strikes, urging residents to leave immediately for their safety. Its operations command announced a curfew in the neighbourhoods of Sheikh Maqsoud and Ashrafieh from 3 p.m. (1200 GMT).

The fighting, which erupted on Tuesday , has driven thousands of civilians from their homes and killed and wounded several people, state media reported.

SDF said their fighters were engaged in intense clashes with Damascus-aligned factions and auxiliaries near Aleppo's Syriac neighbourhood, adding that they had inflicted what they described as heavy losses.

The violence and competing claims over responsibility highlight a deepening and increasingly deadly standoff between Damascus and Kurdish authorities who have resisted integrating into the central government.

The Kurdistan Regional Government's Prime Minister Masrour Barzani said he was deeply concerned by attacks on Kurdish neighbourhoods in Aleppo, warning that targeting civilians and attempts to alter the area's demography amounted to what he described as ethnic cleansing.

Barzani called on all sides to exercise restraint, protect civilians and pursue dialogue.

The SDF accused Damascus-aligned factions of threatening unlawful attacks on civilian areas, saying public warnings of shelling could amount to forced displacement and war crimes under international humanitarian law.

More residents were seen leaving Sheikh Maqsoud and Ashrafieh through designated safe corridors.

The SDF are a U.S.-backed alliance that controls much of northeastern Syria and has been Washington's main local partner in the fight against Islamic State.

Kurdish-led authorities established a semi-autonomous administration in those areas and parts of Aleppo during Syria's 14-year war and have resisted fully integrating into the Islamist-led government that took power after former President Bashar al-Assad was ousted in late 2024.

Damascus reached a deal with the SDF last year that envisaged full integration by the end of 2025, but progress has been limited, with both sides accusing the other of stalling.

The United States has sought to mediate, holding meetings as recently as Sunday, though those talks ended without tangible results.

Diplomats warn that failure to integrate the SDF into Syria's army risks further violence and could draw in Turkey, which has threatened military action against Kurdish fighters it regards as terrorists.

Turkey said on Thursday it is ready to help Syria if asked after the Syrian army independently launched what it called a "counter-terrorism" operation in Aleppo.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 12:48:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/3MXPRLEHKJMYPA7CL4PS3KMMSU.jpg?auth=e1d9dc291c599f47005ddfe981d6419f66319d396013bd717fda1c13ea6f0113&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Spanish Catholic Church to compensate sex abuse victims under agreement with government</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/spanish-catholic-church-compensate-sex-abuse-victims-under-agreement-with-2026-01-08/</link><description>MADRID, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Spain's Catholic Church, reeling from a clergy sexual abuse scandal, agreed with the government on Thursday to compensate victims of abuse whose cases have expired under the statute of limitations or where the perpetrator has died.

"Today we are settling a debt and doing justice to the victims. We are moving from decades of silence and oblivion to fair reparation paid by the Church," Justice Minister Félix Bolaños said of the deal signed by his ministry and the Church.

The abuse scandal surfaced after an investigation by El Pais newspaper in 2021 uncovered more than 1,200 alleged cases, echoing similar scandals in the Catholic Church in the United States, Ireland and France.

A 2023 report by Spain's human rights ombudsman estimated hundreds of thousands of victims over decades, based on a survey of 8,000 people. It urged the creation of a state fund and accused the Church of failing to cooperate and trying to "minimise the phenomenon." More than 700 people shared their cases with the ombudsman up to 2024.

An investigation commissioned by the Spanish Catholic Church identified around 2,000 victims by the end of 2023.

Under the agreement signed on Thursday, the ombudsman will review each case and propose compensation — financial, moral, psychological or restorative — based on the victim's request, Bolaños said.

Previously, victims could apply directly to the Church, but many were reluctant. The Church said Thursday it had already paid around 2 million euros ($2.34 million) to victims.

The new process is for victims who do not want to apply directly to the Church. Reparations proposed by the ombudsman must be agreed upon by both the victim and the Church’s Assessment Commission.

"American dominance in the Western Hemisphere will never be questioned again," US President Donald Trump told reporters shortly after the raid.

He underscored the point with a reference to the Monroe Doctrine, a 19th-century creed that put world powers of the time – notably European colonists – on notice to respect American hegemony in the region.

But the message may have been most pointedly directed at China , which for more than two decades has been developing close ties with Latin American countries – including billions invested in the Venezuelan oil sector.

The US raid came just days after China conducted two days of live-fire drills near Taiwan in a massive show of force. But a TV report broadcast in the week before Christmas hinted that China may also be weighing its military options in South America.

China’s CCTV state television aired a December 19 segment on wargames, simulated military engagements for training purposes. One scene depicted theoretical confrontations in Latin America, including simulated battles near Mexico, Cuba and the Caribbean Sea.

China currently has a minimal military presence in the region, which is far removed from Beijing's traditional sphere of influence in Asia. But several observers wondered if these conflict scenarios signaled that its global ambitions are evolving.

Venezuela has historically served as China’s “gateway into Latin America”, says Amalendu Misra, a specialist in international relations and the Global South at Lancaster University. With Maduro's ouster, Beijing has lost its key ally in the Latin American country where it has invested the most, which Misra says came as a “shockwave” to Beijing.

China has loaned more than $100 billion to Venezuela since the early 2000s. “That’s nearly 39% of all the loans Beijing allocated to the region,” Misra points out.

Former Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez lauded the deals he made with China back in 2006, describing them as a “ Great Wall ” against US hegemony in the region.

The close relations between Beijing and Caracas persisted even after Chavez’s death in 2013 . One of the last people Maduro saw, just hours before being ousted by US forces, was none other than China’s special envoy to Venezuela, Qiu Xiaoqi, who was on a visit to reaffirm the strength of ties between the two countries.

The fate of their $100 billion Venezuelan investment must now be worrying Chinese leaders, although a large portion of the debt has already been repaid in raw materials. China’s dealings with Venezuela are modelled on the “Angola system” – that is, countries receive funding and are repaid in commodities but namely oil, says Mario Esteban, director of the Centre for East Asian Studies at the Autonomous University of Madrid.

While precise figures are not publicly available, the Belgian think tank Beyond Horizon estimates that Caracas still owed Beijing more than $12 billion as of December.

As the United States looks to capitalise on – and possibly even administer – Venezuela’s vast oil resources, it may find itself negotiating with China.

Beijing will need to have “a seat at the table” when decisions are being made about how and when to repay Venezuela’s creditors, says Günther Maihold, a Latin America specialist at the Free University of Berlin.

Trump has said that American oil companies will be able to continue selling Venezuelan oil – including to China – once they have rebuilt the country’s oil sector. But Beijing may not agree to this arrangement, says Carlotta Rinaudo, a China specialist at the International Team for the Study of Security Verona. “I wouldn't be so sure, to be honest, that China would buy oil sold by US oil giants,” she says.

Beijing also had its sights set on other resources: Venezuela possesses the world's largest untapped reserves of gold as well as oil. The China National Petroleum Corporation, for example, had already established several joint ventures with local companies to explore Venezuela's subsoil.

Sino-Venezuelan cooperation on vast infrastructure projects has also led to some 400,000 Chinese to settle in Venezuela, working primarily in the restaurant sector.

From the Chinese perspective, Rinaudo says, a longtime partner is now essentially defunct. And after investing so much, “they cannot afford to lose all that money".

The United States is unlikely to want to share Venezuelan resources with rival China, which Rinaudo says may create a new source of competition – and friction – between the two countries.

Beijing has reason to be wary. The US operation in Venezuela represents a newly aggressive version of the Monroe Doctrine adapted to the Trump era – namely, the desire to rid Latin America of all other foreign influences. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated as much after Maduro’s ouster, saying the United States would not allow the oil industry in Venezuela to be controlled by “adversaries”, namely Russia, China or Iran.

“This is the Western Hemisphere. This is where we live. And we’re not going to allow the Western Hemisphere to be a base of operations for adversaries, competitors, and rivals of the United States, simple as that,” he said .

And Esteban is not convinced that China’s recent wargaming indicates any kind of real shift in global focus, saying it is unlikely that Beijing would be willing to commit troops to a theatre so far away. He says the CCTV report was primarily aimed at a domestic audience, to demonstrate that China thinks like a global military power.

But Venezuela might just be the first of China's headaches in Latin America, with the United States already exerting pressure on Colombia and Cuba as well as Mexico.

This pressure could be one way “to discourage them from doing business with China”, notes Esteban.

While Colombia and Cuba are not economically important to Beijing, Mexico is a different story: Beijing has already invested heavily in Mexican supply chains as well as its transport infrastructure.

“All the ports are owned by the Chinese. Most of the roads are owned by the Chinese,” Misra says.

The automobile industry gets a lot of its supplies from China, especially for cars and trucks, which are then mainly exported to the United States, Maihold adds.

Realistically, China has limited options for protecting its interests in the region. By removing Maduro, Washington also managed to signal to other Latin American powers that China cannot protect them if they choose Beijing over Washington.

On the ground, Maduro’s capture was a failure of Chinese intelligence, Rinaudo says, noting that China “had no idea" of the US plans.

But it was also a failure of matériel, with Beijing’s air-defence system proving ineffective. “Its missile system didn't work. All the radars that the Chinese had installed are in Venezuela – didn't work," Misra says.

If China were to respond to US actions aggressively, Esteban predicts that cyber-attacks would be the weapon of choice. But he says the most likely scenario is that Beijing will launch a vast diplomatic charm offensive in the region.

It would be easy to play on bitter memories of past US actions in Latin America by “emphasising sovereignty, emphasising the UN charter – emphasising these core principles” of international law, Esteban says.

“They know their history … and there is a very long history of US intervention."</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 12:50:33 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/c3ab4b44-eb19-11f0-95f7-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/060126-maduro-xi-jinping-m.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Zelenskiy says US security guarantees document set to be finalised with Trump</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/zelenskiy-says-us-security-guarantees-document-set-be-finalised-with-trump-2026-01-08/</link><description>KYIV, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Thursday the text of a bilateral security guarantee between Kyiv and Washington was "essentially ready" to be finalised with U.S. President Donald Trump.

As a cornerstone of any post-war settlement, Ukraine has sought strong guarantees which commit the U.S. and other Western allies to come to Ukraine's aid if Russia invades again.

Ukrainian and U.S. envoys, joined by a coalition of Ukraine's allies, have been negotiating in Paris this week to iron out remaining disagreements in a peace framework Washington is seeking to thrash out with Kyiv before presenting it to Russia. On Tuesday, the U.S. endorsed the idea of providing security guarantees for Ukraine for the first time.

"The bilateral document on security guarantees for Ukraine is now essentially ready for finalisation at the highest level with the president (Trump)," Zelenskiy said in a post on X.

He said Wednesday's meetings of Ukrainian and U.S. representatives in Paris addressed "complex issues" from the framework under discussion to end the nearly four-year war , and that Kyiv had presented its solutions for these.

The Ukrainian president called for more pressure on Russia after further Russian missile attacks on energy infrastructure on Wednesday, arguing that the credibility of future security guarantees must be demonstrated by a response at this stage.

Under Trump, Washington has shifted its position from an outright supporter of Kyiv to a broker leaning on both sides to agree a peace, and will try to get Moscow to sign up to the deal it negotiates with Ukraine.

Zelenskiy has said that while the framework is 90% agreed, thorny issues remain around control of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant as well as Russian demands on Kyiv to cede a strategically significant slice of territory in eastern Ukraine that Moscow has been unable to capture in almost four years of war.

"We understand that the American side will engage with Russia, and we expect feedback on whether the aggressor is genuinely willing to end the war," Zelenskiy wrote on X.

He said the teams also discussed documents dealing with Ukraine's post-war recovery and economic development.

The World Bank last year estimated the cost of Ukraine's reconstruction and recovery at $524 billion, while the Trump administration has sought to leverage economic benefits and privileged post-war access for the U.S. in Ukraine.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 13:41:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WYXZ2WLANRPRPIHN3FHOSU2VUA.jpg?auth=31449e188ae40985121faf78dbbf44ba82dcce1da52aff9589a47ccf2cf6e92a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russian-bound tanker hit by drone in Black Sea, maritime sources say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/russian-bound-tanker-hit-by-drone-black-sea-maritime-sources-say-2026-01-08/</link><description>ISTANBUL, Jan 8 (Reuters) - A Russia-bound oil tanker suffered a drone attack in the Black Sea that prompted it to request Turkish coastguard assistance and divert from its course, according to a notice by Lloyd's List Intelligence and a separate maritime security source on Thursday.

Maritime data specialist Lloyd's List Intelligence said the Palau-flagged Elbus vessel "experienced an unmanned marine-vehicle and drone attack" on Wednesday targeting its engine room, and that no injuries were reported among the 25 crew, nor any pollution.

The security source described it as a drone attack, based on an assessment. It was unclear who or what was behind the incident.

In late November, shipping insurance rates rose after Ukrainian naval drones hit two Russia-bound tankers in the Black Sea, incidents that prompted Moscow to threaten retaliation and Ankara to urge calm. Another vessel, Russian-flagged, said in early December that it too was attacked in the sea, but Kyiv denied any role in that incident.

The Security Service of Ukraine did not respond when asked about the incident involving Elbus.

Turkey's transport ministry was not immediately available to comment. The Russian embassy in Ankara was not immediately available to comment.

The Black Sea is crucial for grain, oil and oil products shipping and its waters are shared by Turkey, Russia, Ukraine, Bulgaria, Georgia and Romania.

The vessel was headed on Wednesday to the Russian port of Novorossiysk from Singapore, the Lloyd's notice said.

Marinetraffic data showed the Elbus had settled a few kilometres off the northern Turkish port of Inebolu on Thursday, after having diverted from its earlier eastward course across the Black Sea.

It dropped anchor at Inebolu anchorage under its own power, Lloyd's said.

Calls to the Inebolu harbour master did not get through.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 13:43:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>France releases Russian man wanted in US for cyberhacking, lawyer says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/france-releases-russian-man-wanted-us-cyberhacking-lawyer-says-2026-01-08/</link><description>MOSCOW, Jan 8 (Reuters) - A Russian basketball player who was arrested in France last year and threatened with extradition to the United States has been released and flown back to Moscow, his lawyer was quoted as saying on Thursday.

Daniil Kasatkin was detained at a Paris airport on June 21 at the request of the U.S., which suspected him of being part of a hacking network using ransomware against U.S. companies and federal institutions. He denied the accusation.

Russian state news agency RIA quoted his lawyer, Frederic Belot, as saying Kasatkin had been released late on Wednesday and was already back in Moscow. Belot has previously said that Kasatkin had no computer expertise and that his device had been hacked by cybercriminals.

Kasatkin's release came two weeks after the Kremlin said Russia was in contact with France over the case of Laurent Vinatier , a French researcher who was sentenced in 2024 to three years in a Russian prison for violating the country's "foreign agent" laws.

A French journalist raised Vinatier's case with Russian President Vladimir Putin at a press conference last month, and Putin said he would look into it.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov later said that Moscow had made an unspecified "offer" to Paris, and the ball was in France's court.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 13:43:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Lebanon central bank seeks to recuperate embezzled funds to bolster liquidity, governor says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/lebanon-central-bank-seeks-recuperate-embezzled-funds-bolster-liquidity-governor-2026-01-08/</link><description>BEIRUT, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Lebanon's central bank will seek the repayment of public funds embezzled by at least one former central bank official and by lawyers and commercial bankers, to help guarantee its liquidity, Central Bank Governor Karim Souaid said on Thursday.

Souaid did not name Riad Salameh , the former central bank governor whose 30-year term ended in disgrace amid investigations into whether he embezzled more than $300 million between 2002 and 2015.

Instead Souaid told reporters that the central bank had filed a criminal complaint against an unnamed former official of the central bank, a former banker and a lawyer over alleged illicit enrichment through misuse of public funds. He said the operations were carried out through four offshore shell companies in the Cayman Islands that he did not name.

Souaid said the bank would become a primary plaintiff in the state's investigation against Forry Associates, suspected of receiving commissions from commercial banks and transferring them out of the country. Forry is controlled by Salameh's brother, Raja. Both Raja and Riad Salameh deny wrongdoing.

The pair are under investigation in France, Germany, Switzerland and other countries over the alleged embezzlement. Souaid said he would travel to France to meet with the investigators this month "to exchange highly sensitive information held by the French authorities."

Souaid would not say how many people in total were suspected of involvement in the scheme or the full sum now thought to have been embezzled.

"Our mission is to pursue these individuals and entities, seek their conviction, and seize their movable and immovable assets and the proceeds of their illicit activities to ensure liquidity for the rightful owners, first and foremost the depositors," he said.

A Lebanese source familiar with the central bank's new measures said they were prompted by lots of evidence - both new material uncovered in the central bank's records and other evidence made available from external investigators. The source said the bank's leadership suspected Salameh was aided in his scheme by other members of the institution.

Salameh was detained for nearly 13 months over the alleged financial crimes committed during his tenure, and was released last September after posting a record bail of more than $14 million. He remains in Lebanon under a travel ban.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 14:26:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WHLA24SHVFNSPB2L3AWW7LZBOU.jpg?auth=295396e00a0bca96dafbc265a6bd7c7c373c107bc2c6afcbea8c6b454315879a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Explainer: Why are French farmers driving their tractors into Paris?</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/why-are-french-farmers-driving-their-tractors-into-paris-2026-01-08/</link><description>PARIS, Jan 8 (Reuters) - French farmers have brought tractors to central Paris and blocked roads across the country to demand government action to address numerous grievances.

Here are some of the issues that have prompted the protest movement and initial responses at government and European Union levels.

Farmers in France, the EU's biggest agricultural producer, say they struggle to make a profit due to high costs and excessive red tape while facing unfair competition from countries within and outside the EU that do not have to meet the same strict production standards.

A proposed trade deal between the EU and the South American bloc Mercosur has been a focus of discontent among farmers in France and across Europe. They say the arrangement would lead to cheap imports of South American commodities, notably beef, ethanol and sugar, that do not meet EU standards.

The agreement , which could be signed next week, includes a significant section on agriculture with the establishment of import quotas for certain farm products from Mercosur countries - Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay - either duty free or at reduced levies.

On the other hand, the deal would also give EU farmers increased access to South American markets, which could boost exports of products such as wine, cheese and olive oil.

Even though Paris has won significant last-minute concessions, including safeguard measures on sensitive farm products such as beef and sugar, the government and farmers still oppose the deal, claiming imports should be produced with the same standards as EU produce.

French Agriculture Minister Annie Genevard said France would continue to fight against the deal in the European Parliament, where it also needs to be approved.

Some French farmers, mainly in the south of the country, also blame the government for its handling of the lumpy skin disease affecting cattle, including the culling of entire herds when the highly contagious virus is detected.

Lumpy skin disease, mainly spread by biting insects, causes fever and painful skin lumps, weakens animals and reduces milk output.

The government, which said that the disease could wipe out about 10% of the national herd if left unchecked, has launched a campaign to vaccinate all cattle in affected regions.

On the environment, farmers take issue both with EU subsidy rules and what they see as France's overcomplicated implementation of EU policy.

They say France applies tougher restrictions than other EU member states, including a ban on a pesticide for sugar beets and taking a highly bureaucratic approach to water use and fertiliser pollution.

Green policies are seen as contradicting goals to become more self-sufficient in the production of food and other essential goods in the light of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and amid trade tensions with the United States and China.

Farmers see an excessive regulatory burden as contributing to a decline in French agricultural output, exports and income.

France may post its first annual trade deficit for food and farm goods in nearly 50 years in 2025.

Grain growers, previously the wealthiest producers in French farming, have lost money in the past three years as ample global supply has depressed prices while costs for energy and fertilisers have risen.

Pushed by France, the EU on Wednesday agreed to cut duties on imported fertilisers and exempt them from a carbon tax scheme to avert more cost rises.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 14:27:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/OBBPU35U2FONTBCZSVJLC4CBHY.jpg?auth=2d8bc2736a418f3ad0cab7dc3952b5a4c4e68c64ccab42feb63f6211b4d55464&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Mexico's daily murder rate down 40% under Sheinbaum, president says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/mexico-murder-rate-down-40-under-sheinbaum-president-says-2026-01-08/</link><description>MEXICO CITY, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Mexico's daily murder rate has fallen nearly 40% from where it was when Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum took office, government officials said on Thursday, citing preliminary statistics.

The daily homicide average in December 2025 was 52.4, down from 86.9 in September 2024, the month before Sheinbaum took office.

"It is the lowest number since 2016," Sheinbaum said at her morning press conference alongside security officials.

For the full year, Mexico's national murder rate per 100,000 people was 17.5 in 2025, the lowest since 2015, according to a presentation by the head of Mexico's National Public Security System.

Sheinbaum said the numbers showed her government's security strategy was producing results and credited close collaboration between security and justice officials and state governors.

Homicide numbers are usually revised, often upwards, when they are formally released by the national statistics agency INEGI after going through a process of revisions, checks and adjustments.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 14:27:56 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/M7QWRWNG3FPB7EFFMLT4Y4QRYE.jpg?auth=0db44db2b7eafc9b6b13aa3cc2cd2c2ce47972dc8994b3ca0caed9d7016ae213&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Europe discusses response to US threat on Greenland, EU's Kallas says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe-discusses-response-us-threat-greenland-eus-kallas-says-2026-01-08/</link><description>BRUSSELS, Jan 8 (Reuters) - The EU has discussed what a European response would look like if the U.S. threat on acquiring Greenland, a semi-autonomous Danish territory, is real, European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said on Thursday.

Brodard is one of seven victims from Lutry Football Club, the club said. Five others are fighting for their lives in hospitals.

Under light snowfall, dozens of people including fellow players walked through the cobbled streets of Lutry to the church holding black umbrellas before filling every pew, with more standing or sitting in the aisles.

A large banner showed a drawing of Brodard in the arms of his younger brother Benjamin.

His mother Laetitia Brodard-Sitre described him as "responsible and kind" and carried a white teddy bear and a single red rose - the colours of his team.

At the start of the ceremony, a song called “One day in the wrong place” by France's Calogero played on the speakers with the lyrics: “And it’s because they were there/One day in the wrong place”.

Brodard had reserved a table with friends at Le Constellation bar the night of the fire, his mother told Reuters last week.

Just over an hour before the blaze, he texted her "Happy New Year mum. I love you" and shared a disappearing video of them partying together, she said.

His photo, with tousled brown hair carrying a Yorkshire Terrier "Lili", appeared in newspapers around the world as she sought information on his whereabouts from morgues and hospitals.

He was identified as one of the victims on January 3.

"Loved by all for his kindness, his dedication and commitment, he will be part of the Lutry Football Club family forever," the club in the pretty lakeside village, east of the city of Lausanne, said in Swiss newspaper 24 heures.

Swiss authorities said this week that the bar in the upscale ski resort of Crans-Montana had not had a mandatory inspection since 2019 and questions remain about safety standards .

Swiss prosecutors are investigating a couple who ran the bar and a group of victims' families have filed legal complaints . The couple's lawyers did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Lutry ceremony was one of two back-to-back services for teenage fire victims at the same church.

Another joint funeral for two 14- and 15-year-old sisters happened in Lausanne earlier on Thursday. Local schools have mobilised mental health counsellors to support students and teachers, the Vaud canton said.

Twenty-one of the dead were from Switzerland , seven from France, six from Italy, and there was a Swiss-French dual national and a French-British-Israeli national. The remaining four were Romanian, Turkish, Belgian and Portuguese.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 14:53:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CIAFOMSXP5NADCA5QB7TQ7IFW4.jpg?auth=a9bb69b611be9fca35ceb6125b91fa36f45f98f5452845c7d874e0583f45073f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump withdrawal from bedrock UN climate treaty raises legal questions</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/cop/trump-withdrawal-bedrock-un-climate-treaty-raises-legal-questions-2026-01-08/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 8 (Reuters) - The Trump administration's decision to withdraw the United States from the foundational U.N. climate treaty, which the U.S. Senate unanimously adopted more than 30 years ago, may be illegal, according to some legal experts who say that Congress would need to approve its exit.

President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that the United States would withdraw from dozens of international and U.N. entities , including the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change as well as the scientific Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, that "operate contrary to U.S. national interests" of focusing on oil, gas and mining development.

Trump, a vocal critic of renewable energy who has called climate change a "con job" and a hoax, went beyond his previous action of withdrawing the U.S. - the world's biggest historical greenhouse gas emitter - from the Paris climate agreement, by removing the country from the underlying UNFCCC.

He also pulled the U.S. out of the key scientific climate change body called the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and a host of other U.N. bodies focused on environment, health, arts and women's rights.

Some international law experts said the president's unprecedented move on Wednesday raises major legal questions because case law has not been clear on whether a president can unilaterally withdraw the country from a treaty that has been ratified by a majority of the Senate.

"Because the U.S. entered the UNFCCC with advice and consent of the Senate in 1992, it’s our legal view that it also must be exited using the same process in reciprocation," Jean Su, energy justice director at the Center for Biological Diversity told Reuters. "Letting this lawless move stand could shut the U.S. out of climate diplomacy forever.”

The CBD is currently evaluating whether to take the U.S. government to court on this, Su said.

White House officials were not immediately available to respond to Reuters questions on the legality of the move.

Quitting the UNFCCC would take effect a year after notification and would mean the U.S. would withdraw from all global climate negotiations including the central Paris climate agreement.

The U.S. already skipped the annual U.N. international climate summit last year in Belem, Brazil for the first time in three decades and Trump announced the withdrawal from the Paris pact a year ago. It is the only country to exit the UNFCCC.

The UNFCCC requires wealthy industrialized countries to take measures to cut their emissions, adopt policies to limit greenhouse gas emissions, publicly report their emissions, and provide funding to help poorer nations address climate change.

While the rules around ratifying a treaty are clear, the rules around withdrawing from a treaty are not spelled out in the U.S. Constitution, said Curtis Bradley, a professor at the University of Chicago Law School.

This has meant that some presidents have asserted the authority to withdraw the United States from treaties and international agreements without seeking Congressional approval. For example, Republican President Ronald Reagan withdrew the U.S. from UNESCO in 1983 over his concerns about that agency's perceived politicization.

Bradley said Congress could enact legislation to prevent a president from unilaterally withdrawing from a treaty. Congress did pass a law in 2023 to stop a future administration from withdrawing from the NATO treaty.

"But that is not likely to happen for the UNFCCC," he said, given the polarization around climate change policy in Congress.

Legal experts are also split around how difficult it would be to rejoin the UNFCCC.

Some legal groups believe that if a future administration wants to get back in, it would need to go through a new process of getting the two-thirds support in the U.S. Senate required for treaty ratification.

Other experts argue that the U.S. can easily rejoin after 90 days, using the "advise and consent" that the Senate used to ratify the treaty unanimously in 1992 under Republican President George H.W. Bush.

In recent years, achieving a two-thirds majority in the highly polarized U.S. Congress has been near impossible, especially on divisive issues.

The U.S. has entered into more than 90% of international agreements through different mechanisms that rely on executive authority or pre-existing domestic laws.

Sue Biniaz, former deputy special envoy for climate change during the Biden administration, said she is in the camp of legal scholars who believe that rejoining the UNFCCC could be "seamless" because of the unanimous Senate approval it won in 1992.

"There are multiple future pathways for rejoining the key climate agreements," she said.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 14:54:17 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5SPLPWYVSNNSLM5ADJ2GXCQZQU.jpg?auth=093b2605fa2a767d526d3f17a7a566c314876f2f72493548c66bbd8edb9408dd&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Fatal ICE shooting sparks protests in Minneapolis</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/fatal-ice-shooting-sparks-protests-in-minneapolis</link><description /><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 14:56:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/1e29dc8e-eca0-11f0-a716-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260108-151056-151715-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia frees imprisoned French researcher Laurent Vinatier</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/russia-frees-imprisoned-french-researcher-laurent-vinatier</link><description /><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 14:56:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/d765b364-ec9e-11f0-ab27-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260108-150157-150341-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Yemeni separatist chief fled to UAE, Saudi-led coalition says</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260108-yemeni-separatist-chief-fled-to-uae-saudi-led-coalition-says</link><description>Yemen 's separatist leader has fled to the UAE with Emirati help, the Saudi-led coalition said on Thursday, after a failed military advance that roiled relations between the Gulf countries .

Aidarous Al-Zubaidi was accused of high treason and removed from Yemen's Presidential Leadership Council on Wednesday, while the coalition bombed his home province after he refused to attend talks in Riyadh.

Zubaidi's UAE-backed Southern Transitional Council (STC) seized swaths of territory last month and he announced a two-year transition to independence before the group was pushed back under Saudi military pressure.

A coalition statement detailed Zubaidi's boat-and-plane journey from Aden to Abu Dhabi via Somaliland , a breakaway region in the Horn of Africa , and Somalia .

"Reliable intelligence indicates that Aidarous Al-Zubaidi and others have escaped in the dead of night," the statement said.

Zubaidi sailed from Aden to Somaliland's Berbera – whose port is run by DP World, a United Arab Emirates state-owned company – after midnight on Wednesday, the coalition said.

He then flew in a Russian-made Ilyushin plane to Mogadishu "under the supervision of UAE officers", before continuing to a military airport in Abu Dhabi, arriving on Wednesday evening, it added.

An STC official contacted by AFP on Thursday insisted Zubaidi was still in Yemen. The UAE foreign ministry did not respond to a request for comment.

Somalia's immigration agency said it was investigating an "alleged unauthorised use of Somalia's national airspace and airports".

Last month's STC offensive brought fresh turbulence to fractured Yemen, the Arabian Peninsula's poorest country, and exposed a deep rift between Saudi Arabia and the UAE.

The oil-rich neighbours formed the backbone of the coalition fighting Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, who overran the capital Sanaa in 2014 and still control much of the country.

Riyadh and Abu Dhabi now find themselves backing competing factions in Yemen's internationally recognised government, which includes the STC and is based in the group's southern stronghold of Aden.

Cinzia Bianco, a visiting fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said helping Zubaidi flee would indicate the UAE is in "damage-control mode".

"I think it means a retrenchment of UAE influence in Yemen for sure," she added. "Which is also partly because Saudi Arabia is simply the most relevant external player."

The STC moved into Hadramawt and Mahra provinces bordering Saudi Arabia and Oman in December, before being pushed back by air strikes from Saudi jets and a counter-offensive by pro-Saudi land forces.

On Wednesday, the STC said its delegation of more than 50 officials had been "arbitrarily detained and taken to an unknown location" after flying to Riyadh for talks.

The Saudi ambassador to Yemen, Mohamed AlJabir, posted a picture with 19 officials on Thursday, saying he met the STC delegation and discussed a conference on south Yemen to be held in Riyadh soon.

In a sign of Saudi anger, Riyadh-based Arab News printed a front-page headline of "WANTED" with a photo of Zubaidi in military fatigues.

A Yemeni security official told AFP that units from the Saudi-backed Nation Shield forces had arrived in Aden and were awaiting deployment in coordination with forces there.

Government buildings in Aden are being guarded by forces controlled by Zubaidi's deputy, who is in Riyadh and approved his demotion from the Presidential Leadership Council.

The STC seeks to restore independence after Yemen was formally divided between North and South from 1967 to 1990.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 14:56:42 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/10739fb0-ec75-11f0-9a5b-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/e753383e2a491e5af6b7aea21620aaa49acfd6cf.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>One dead in floods in Albania as rain and snow grip Balkans</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/one-dead-floods-albania-rain-snow-grip-balkans-2026-01-08/</link><description>FIER, Albania, Jan 8 (Reuters) - A man was found drowned on Thursday in the Albanian city of Durres and emergency teams worked around the clock to evacuate dozens of people from flooded houses hit by heavy rainfall.

The Western Balkan countries have seen disruption from snow and other winter weather since Sunday, with the closure of roads and railway lines, power cuts and drinking water affected.

Emergency teams were using boats to evacuate villagers trapped in flooded houses in the area around other southwestern Albanian towns of Fier and Vlora, after the Viosa River rose to over 9 metres, the defence ministry said.

A 55-year-old municipal worker who went missing on Tuesday was found dead in a drainage canal in Durres, probably swept away by the current, according to the interior ministry.

The emergency services said they were working to remove water from around 800 homes and buildings, after sheltering around 300 people in the army and police facilities.

In neighbouring Kosovo, where vast areas of land have been flooded in the past days, the rain was replaced by snow on Thursday. Bosnia has also been hit by snow.

"It is very difficult to function like this, the streets are not cleared, especially for pedestrians," said Armin Hasanovic, a resident of the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo.

The temperature of -14 degrees Celsius (7 degrees Fahrenheit) was recorded on Thursday morning in the Croatian capital of Zagreb, with meteorologists forecasting a new cold spell on Sunday with even lower temperatures.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 15:26:48 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/EH34RGIDWZM5PPNKCBUNXJWQMM.jpg?auth=6049bd7f458d73e9aefb910f86072208afd107373a3220c7c97f9024ae4a426e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Brazil's Lula vetoes bill cutting former president Bolsonaro's sentence</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/brazils-lula-vetoes-bill-cutting-former-president-bolsonaros-sentence-2026-01-08/</link><description>SAO PAULO, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva vetoed on Thursday a bill passed by Congress cutting former President Jair Bolsonaro's 27-year prison sentence for plotting a coup after losing the 2022 election.

The bill approved by lawmakers in December was set to cut the former right-wing president's prison term to just over two years. Congress can still override Lula's veto.

The bill also reduced sentences for those convicted over their roles in a January 2023 riot, when Bolsonaro supporters invaded and ransacked the presidential palace, Supreme Court and Congress.

About 2,000 people were arrested over the attack, which drew comparisons to the January 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol in Washington. Many of those in Brazil have been convicted by the Supreme Court of attempting a coup, among other crimes.

"All of the (coup plotters) were tried transparently and impartially, and at the end of the trial they were convicted on the basis of strong evidence," Lula said at an event in Brasilia.

The leftist leader had already vowed to veto the bill in December. Bolsonaro began serving his sentence in November.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 15:28:48 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/JI724IJO7FLP7IJCTGCF63MQDE.jpg?auth=bee1a566a453865bd881f178562fadfac4eeb7d65376def45457b88f42391b6c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Brazil's Lula vetoes bill cutting former President Bolsonaro's sentence</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/brazils-lula-vetoes-bill-cutting-former-president-bolsonaros-sentence-2026-01-08/</link><description /><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 15:29:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Policing the sky: NATO’s high-risk patrols near Ukraine</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/policing-the-sky-nato-s-high-risk-patrols-near-ukraine</link><description /><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 15:30:02 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/086eecee-eca1-11f0-bd61-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260108-152609-152917-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israel bars some aid workers from Gaza as groups face suspension</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-bars-some-aid-workers-gaza-groups-face-suspension-2026-01-08/</link><description>GENEVA/CAIRO/JERUSALEM, Jan 7 (Reuters) - Israel said on Thursday it had barred entry to Gaza of foreign medical and humanitarian staff whose organisations were ordered to cease operations unless they register employee details with Israeli authorities and meet other new rules.

Fearing a renewed humanitarian crisis if medical and aid services can suddenly no longer access war-shattered Gaza , some of the 37 international nongovernmental organisations that were ordered to halt work are weighing whether to submit staff names to Israeli authorities, two aid sources told Reuters.

Three of the aid groups said their foreign staff were told by Israeli authorities this week they could not enter Gaza.

Israel's diaspora ministry, which manages the registration process, says the measures are meant to prevent diversions of aid by Palestinian armed groups. NGOs say sharing staff details poses too much of a risk, pointing to the hundreds of aid workers who were killed or injured during the two-year Gaza war.

Israel has shared little evidence of aid being diverted in the Palestinian enclave, an allegation that was disputed in a U.S. government analysis.

The diaspora ministry said that while the NGOs had been granted 60 days to conclude operations, "the entry of foreign personnel into Gaza is not approved". It said international staff with "approved organisations" including the United Nations could continue work as usual.

Three prominent global NGOs - Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), Medecins du Monde Suisse and the Danish Refugee Council - said their international staff were refused entry to Gaza this week. Foreign aid staff had generally been permitted to rotate in and out of Gaza since the start of the war.

"If we don't have somebody in a key position, such as the emergency coordinator in charge of operations, then we either have to compensate, or we have a gap" in aid service, said Anna Halford, Gaza emergency coordinator at MSF.

Israel's government said some 23 aid groups had agreed to the new registration rules, meaning humanitarian goods will continue to get into Gaza.

But a U.N.-led coordination body has said the international groups that have registered could meet only a fraction of the required humanitarian response in the devastated Gaza Strip, where homelessness and hunger remain rife.

Some of the 37 banned groups operate specialised services like field hospitals, aid officials say. MSF bolsters six Gaza health ministry hospitals and runs two field hospitals. The Medicos del Mundo NGO screens Gaza residents for malnutrition and provides mental health services.

"Without nutritional staff doing the screening and primary healthcare centres doing the therapeutic feeding and referral of patients with severe malnutrition to in-patient care - the whole system breaks down," an aid source told Reuters.

Fearing the loss of those essential services for Gaza's two million residents, some aid groups are considering reversing course and agreeing to the new registration rules.

"The essence of the debate (for aid groups) is how to safeguard their principles, humanitarian standards, and the safety of the local staff while being able to continue the services," a senior aid source said.

COGAT, the Israeli defence ministry unit that controls access to Gaza, said the NGOs' conduct "raises suspicion regarding the parties with whom they operate" in Gaza, but they remained free to register with the diaspora ministry.

Samira al-Ashqar, 40, who fled her Beit Lahia home to Al-Ansar camp in north Gaza with her disabled husband and nine others during the war, depends on Oxfam - one of the aid groups facing an Israeli ban - for food and financial support.

"Now, after the war, everything is missing, and things have become dire ... If these institutions were to stop, the people of Gaza would face complete devastation," al-Ashqar said.

Mohamed Abu Selmia, head of Gaza's Al Shifa Hospital, told Reuters the banning of groups like MSF could affect hundreds of thousands of people.

"The Israeli occupation's decision comes at a time of unprecedented deterioration in health conditions. We suffer acute shortages of medication that reach 100% in some areas, and 55% overall," he said.

MSF said an Israeli ban could also mean that foreign aid groups would no longer be able to pay local staff in Gaza because Israel could block bank transfers.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 15:50:54 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/B6LTESADKNJQTOGN46TGH4AF4I.jpg?auth=40bd6b53a51c702e23adcd37ce163fb8b75645b0210db218b00f7a25d86de956&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Somalia says it is investigating Yemen separatist leader flight via Mogadishu</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/somalia-says-it-is-investigating-yemen-separatist-leader-flight-via-mogadishu-2026-01-08/</link><description>MOGADISHU, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Somalia's immigration and citizenship agency said on Thursday that it had launched an investigation after the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen accused the United Arab Emirates of spiriting a separatist leader out of the country via Mogadishu airport.

Known for his reporting on immigration enforcement and ICE raids, the Emmy Award-winner was arrested by US immigration authorities on June 14, 2025, while covering a “No Kings” protest against US President Donald Trump in the suburbs of Atlanta, Georgia.

At the time of his arrest, Guevara held a valid work permit and press credentials. The 48-year-old father of three – two of whom are US citizens – was separated from his family and transferred between six detention facilities before spending nearly four months in an ICE detention centre in Georgia.

Guevara says he was targeted because of his journalistic work and his prominence within Latino communities in the southern United States, where his reporting reaches more than one million followers on TikTok and Facebook combined. Placed in solitary confinement – officially, for his own safety –  he says the move was intended to silence a reporter who closely monitors ICE operations.

After ICE convinced a judge to reopen his immigration case, on October 3 Guevara was deported  without the possibility of appeal to El Salvador , where he remains today, separated from his family. His 112-day-long detention also made him one of the journalists to have spent the longest time behind bars in US history .

FRANCE 24 spoke with Guevara about press freedom in the United States since Trump’s return to the White House and the growing challenges of reporting on immigration enforcement, as ICE raids intensify nationwide and a day after the shooting death of a 37-year-old woman during an ICE raid in Minneapolis.

FRANCE 24: How did you get into journalism, and what led you to move to the United States?

Mario Guevara: I was drawn to journalism from a very young age. I studied the field in college and began my career in 2000 as a photojournalist for La Prensa Gráfica, one of El Salvador’s leading daily newspapers. Soon after, I was threatened by criminal gangs – they followed me and even threw rocks at me – forcing me to leave the country in 2004.

My mother had lived in Atlanta, Georgia, so it felt natural to move there when I applied for asylum in the United States. The process was long, and my case remained unresolved until 2012. In the meantime, I began working for El Mundo Hispánico, the Spanish-language version of the local Atlanta newspaper AJC (The Atlanta Journal-Constitution). Immigration authorities then denied my asylum request, and the judge granted me voluntary departure. I was planning to move to Canada with my family when immigration officials contacted my attorney to say the case had been put on hold and I was allowed to stay in the United States with a work permit.

In 2024, I launched my own media outlet, MG News , which now employs six full-time staff.

How have ICE raids evolved in recent years? Have you seen a difference between Trump’s first and second term?

I have been covering immigration and police stories for a long time. Topics related to ICE are particularly followed by the Latino community in the United States. I usually wake up around 4-5am, when followers alert me to suspicious activity in a neighbourhood. ICE officers often make arrests in the streets or at workplaces, frequently targeting work vans. They often appear to be civilians but wear bulletproof vests.

In the past, people had the right to go to court and be assisted by an attorney. Today, ICE arrests are much more immediate, and people have fewer due process rights. Deportations can now happen without a judge ever reviewing the case (a process known as “ expedited removal ”). I used to follow ICE officers during raids in Latino communities in Gwinnett County, Georgia, under the Obama administration. But now, immigration officers act more aggressively. During their operations they sometimes accuse people of obstruction, and press freedom is not respected. It’s also more and more common to see people hunting others for money, almost like bounty hunters.

During his first term, Trump’s approach was somewhat different. Under Biden , immigration policy was more open, with more work permits granted. But since Trump returned, his rhetoric and actions appear harsher toward the Latino community. He refers to some as "criminals" or "terrorists" and stepped up enforcement. It is a significant shift.

Many Latino voters supported Trump because of his promises to protect Christians and create job opportunities, messages that resonated in their communities. Today, many feel betrayed, as his focus seems to have shifted almost entirely to immigrants rather than the broader agenda he had promoted.

Can you tell us about the day you were arrested and the circumstances surrounding it?

It was a Saturday, and I was covering one of the “No Kings” protests in the suburbs of Atlanta. The participants did not have a permit to demonstrate, and the police arrested 30 people, including me. Although I am a journalist and had proper credentials, they ignored them and accused me of being part of the protest. I believe they recognised me – I was the only reporter broadcasting live in Spanish – but it is difficult to prove that I was specifically targeted.

I was placed in a police car, then a bus, and finally taken to a jail, where I was put in a small cell. My attorney visited me and was optimistic, saying I should be released the same day. However, the following day, the sheriff informed me that immigration had requested I be held. Despite my work permit being valid until 2030, they effectively moved to detain me.

I contacted my consulate, and initially they were supportive. But my work permit was immediately revoked, and I was placed into immigration proceedings for deportation.

What were the conditions like during your detention ?

I was initially transferred between six different jails, spending about a week in each. I was then placed in the Folkstone ICE detention centre, on the border between Georgia and Florida, where I remained for 112 days – almost four months. Most of the time, I was alone in a cell measuring roughly two by three metres. The lights were on constantly, and I could barely sleep. I spent 23 hours a day confined, with only about two hours outside to breathe and see the sun.

While I was never physically harmed, the experience felt like emotional torture . Authorities justified the solitary confinement as a protective measure, claiming it was because I was a public figure. I find that hard to believe. I was told it was standard procedure, yet I am convinced it was a strategy to pressure me into accepting voluntary deportation.

I was allowed to see my family on weekends, for an hour at a time, which was better than nothing. I filled my days with reading and sleeping. I was in contact with my attorney once a week but  he consistently brought bad news, warning that immigration was preparing a strong case against me. My phone had been confiscated, and they monitored my social media, looking for anything that could be used against me. It felt as though my attorney had very little room for manoeuvre. From this experience, I realised that if you are not a US citizen, you do not have the same rights – even as a journalist.

How did your deportation unfold?

The immigration authorities’ strategy was to reopen my 2012 case, effectively cancelling the administrative closure that had previously allowed me to stay. A new judge ruled that I had to leave the country, and within less than 48 hours, I was ordered into immediate deportation.

On Thursday, October 2 at 4am, I was woken, handcuffed – hands and feet – and taken to an airport in Jacksonville, Florida. From there, I was transferred to another plane in Louisiana, where I remained for 24 hours. The following day, Friday, October 3 at 4am, I was placed on a flight to El Salvador. I was only able to bring what I had on me at the time of my arrest: a wallet, my original clothes and shoes, my watch, my jewellery, and my bulletproof vest and press credentials.

When I arrived at the airport, many reporters were there.

How are you and your family managing from a personal standpoint?

I want to return to the United States, to my family and my home. My only relatives in El Salvador are my grandmother and my aunt.

The liberations, a repeated demand of the country's opposition, are a gesture of peace, Rodriguez said, adding the action was unilateral and not agreed with any other party.

“The Bolivarian government, together with state institutions, has decided to release a significant number of Venezuelan and foreign individuals, and these release processes are taking place as of this very moment,” Rodriguez added.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 17:27:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/MR4L6MM3NJOXXMZ76AUUPHKARM.jpg?auth=eb4df88c29fb51d330e40335fe52003c71f29828ea82744edafa955643f756d6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US and Colombia hold call as country protests Trump's threats</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/us-and-colombia-hold-call-as-country-protests-trump-s-threats</link><description /><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 17:29:02 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/d56c30aa-ecae-11f0-93b2-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260108-170428-170818-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US president's agenda tests world order</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/us-president-s-agenda-tests-world-order</link><description /><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 17:29:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/07d6271e-eca8-11f0-98ea-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260108-160722-161655-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Brazil's President Lula vetoes law reducing Bolsonaro's sentence</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260108-brazil-s-president-lula-vetoes-law-reducing-bolsonaro-s-sentence</link><description>Brazil 's left-wing President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva on Thursday vetoed a law dramatically reducing the prison sentence of former far-right leader Jair Bolsonaro , convicted last year of coup plotting.

Lula vetoed the law adopted by Congress late last year on the third anniversary of major riots by Bolsonaro supporters in the capital Brasilia over his defeat by Lula in 2022 elections.

In scenes reminiscent of the 2021 US Capitol riots, thousands of demonstrators ransacked government buildings in Brasilia on January 8, 2023, a week after Lula's inauguration for a third term.

The rioters called on Brazil's military to overthrow Lula.

"January 8th is etched in our history as the day of our democracy 's victory," Lula said at the presidential palace, which was among the buildings targeted by the rioters.

He added that it was a "victory over those who tried to seize power by force, disregarding the will expressed at the ballot box."

Bolsonaro, 70, was sent to prison in November after being convicted of trying to cling onto power in a landmark coup trial seen as a test of Brazilian democracy.

Bolsonaro denied the charges.

He and his supporters, including US President Donald Trump , have argued that is the victim of a left-wing "witch hunt."

His allies in Brazil's conservative-dominated Congress late last year pushed through a law reducing his prison sentence from 27 years to a little over two.

Lula had made no secret of his plan to strike down that legislation.

In Brazil, Congress has the last word, however, and can in turn reject the president's veto.

Bolsonaro was convicted over a scheme to stop Lula from taking office after the right-winger's razor-thin loss in the bitter 2022 election that highlighted Brazil's stark political divisions.

The plot allegedly involved a plan to assassinate Lula, his vice president Geraldo Alckmin and Supreme Court judge Alexandre de Moraes.

Prosecutors said the scheme failed because of a lack of support from military brass.

Bolsonaro's lawyers have appealed, in vain, for him to be allowed serve his sentence under house arrest, on health grounds.

The former army captain, who has suffered serious health complications related to a 2018 stabbing on the campaign trial, spent a week in hospital in December following surgery for a groin hernia and treatment for recurring hiccups.

On Wednesday, he returned to hospital for check-ups following a fall in prison. Doctors gave him a clean bill of health.

Under current rules, he is expected to serve at least eight years behind bars.

The law passed by Congress on his early release also aims to benefit others convicted over the coup plot, as well as more than 100 people who were imprisoned for their role in the January 2023 riots.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 17:29:07 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/53c32888-ecae-11f0-8a72-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/be4ec620a72589bda1d7d4f67af707cbcf48993a.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Exclusive: Trump administration mulls payments to sway Greenlanders to join US</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/trump-administration-mulls-payments-sway-greenlanders-join-us-2026-01-08/</link><description>Jan 8 (Reuters) - U.S. officials have discussed sending lump sum payments to Greenlanders as part of a bid to convince them to secede from Denmark and potentially join the United States, according to four sources familiar with the matter.

While the exact dollar figure and logistics of any payment are unclear, U.S. officials, including White House aides, have discussed figures ranging from $10,000 to $100,000 per person, said two of the sources, who requested anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.

The idea of directly paying residents of Greenland, an overseas territory of Denmark, offers one explanation of how the U.S. might attempt to "buy" the island of 57,000 people, despite authorities' insistence in Copenhagen and Nuuk that Greenland is not for sale.

The tactic is among various plans being discussed by the White House for acquiring Greenland, including potential use of the U.S. military . But it risks coming off as overly transactional and even degrading to a population that has long debated its own independence and its economic dependence on Denmark.

"Enough is enough ... No more fantasies about annexation," Greenland's Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen wrote in a Facebook post on Sunday after U.S. President Donald Trump again told reporters the U.S. needed to acquire the island.

Leaders in Copenhagen and throughout Europe have reacted to comments by Trump and other White House officials asserting their right to Greenland in recent days with disdain, particularly given that the U.S. and Denmark are NATO allies bound by a mutual defense agreement.

On Tuesday, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, Britain and Denmark issued a joint statement , saying only Greenland and Denmark can decide matters regarding their relations.

Asked for comment about discussions to purchase the island, including the possibility of direct payments to Greenlanders, the White House referred Reuters to remarks by press secretary Karoline Leavitt and Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Wednesday.

During a press briefing, Leavitt acknowledged that Trump and his national security aides were "looking at what a potential purchase would look like." Rubio said he would meet his Danish counterpart next week in Washington to discuss Greenland.

The Danish embassy declined to comment, and Greenland's representative office in Washington did not respond to a request for comment.

Trump has long argued that the U.S. needs to acquire Greenland on several grounds, including that it is rich in minerals needed for advanced military applications. He has also said the Western Hemisphere broadly needs to be under the geopolitical influence of Washington.

While internal deliberations regarding how to seize Greenland have occurred among Trump's aides since before he took office a year ago, there has been renewed urgency after his government captured Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro in a daring snatch-and-grab operation over the weekend, according to sources familiar with internal deliberations.

One source said White House aides were eager to carry over the momentum from the Maduro operation toward accomplishing Trump's other long-standing geopolitical goals.

"We need Greenland from the standpoint of national security, and Denmark isn't going to be able to do it," Trump told reporters on Air Force One on Sunday. "It's so strategic."

One of the sources familiar with White House deliberations said the internal discussions regarding lump sum payments were not necessarily new. However, that person said, they had gotten more serious in recent days, and aides were entertaining higher values, with a $100,000-per-person payment - which would result in a total payment of almost $6 billion - a real possibility.

Many details of any potential payments were unclear, such as when and how they would be doled out if the Trump administration pursued that route or what exactly would be expected of the Greenlanders in exchange. The White House has said military intervention is possible, though officials have also said the U.S. prefers buying the island or otherwise acquiring it through diplomatic means.

Among the possibilities being floated by Trump's aides, a White House official said on Tuesday, is trying to enter into a type of agreement with the island called a Compact of Free Association.

The precise details of COFA agreements - which have only ever been extended to the small island nations of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands and Palau - vary depending on the signatory. But the U.S. government typically provides many essential services, such as mail delivery and military protection. In exchange, the U.S. military operates freely in COFA countries, and trade with the U.S. is largely duty-free.

COFA agreements have previously been inked with independent countries, and Greenland would likely need to separate from Denmark for such a plan to proceed. In theory, payments could be used to induce Greenlanders to vote for their independence, or to sign onto a COFA after such a vote.

While polls show an overwhelming majority of Greenlanders want independence, concerns about the economic costs of separating from Denmark - among other issues - have kept most Greenlandic legislators from calling for an independence referendum.

Surveys also show most Greenlanders, while open to separating from Denmark, do not want to be part of the U.S.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 17:54:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/XJU5P6MTXVMO3ANKNE3A4POZXY.jpg?auth=ddeeafba184498215a16ef202cb442e2add2b699e7451f94c2872748d778509f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Digital blackout hits Tehran, other parts of Iran, Netblocks says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/digital-blackout-hits-tehran-other-parts-iran-netblocks-says-2026-01-08/</link><description>Jan 8 (Reuters) - Tehran and several other parts of Iran experienced a digital blackout on Thursday as internet connectivity dropped across multiple service providers, internet monitoring group NetBlocks said, during nationwide protests against economic hardships .</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 17:54:27 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/J2OT46IMSVO2LHG3HHCW3T5WGM.jpg?auth=1bb42dc711388997fd45b2f1aac58ca16ebd233c55b315fd77faa5f6343d7aff&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran security forces attack hospital after protests in western region</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260108-security-forces-attack-hospital-protests-western-iran</link><description>The FRANCE 24 Observers team has verified videos showing Iranian security forces attacking a hospital in the city of Ilam, in western Iran , on the night of 3-4 January 2026. The footage shows security forces firing shotguns and using tear gas inside and around the hospital as they attempt to detain protesters who had been injured earlier in the day.

Hours before the hospital raid, security forces opened fire on a peaceful protest in the nearby town of Arkavaz, killing several demonstrators, according to local reports. Witnesses say the wounded were transferred to Khomeini Hospital in Ilam, where further clashes broke out between residents trying to protect injured protesters and armed security units, including motorcycle forces.

On January 7, Iran’s government announced that it would investigate the incident.

The latest wave of protests began in December 2025, driven by Iran’s worsening economic crisis, and has since spread to dozens of cities across the country. According to HRANA, an Iranian human rights organisation, at least 36 protesters have been killed so far, including children.

The unrest has drawn international attention following comments by US President Donald Trump , who warned Iran’s leadership against the use of lethal force. Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , has rejected dialogue with what he described as “rioters”, insisting that security forces must restore order.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 17:56:10 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/1ae98c4a-ec9b-11f0-b531-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/vlcsnap-2026-01-08-14h41m35s840.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Storm Goretti set to batter Europe with heavy wind, rain and snow</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260108-storm-goretti-set-to-batter-europe-with-heavy-wind-rain-and-snow</link><description>Europe was set to be buffeted by weather ranging from severe winds to snow and freezing temperatures with the arrival of Storm Goretti on Thursday, with forecasters issuing warnings from Britain to Germany .

Britain's Met Office issued a "rare" red wind warning for the Isles of Scilly and Cornwall in southwestern England between 1600 GMT and 2300 GMT -- its highest level of alert.

"Exceptionally strong winds" of up to 160 kilometres (100 miles) per hour were expected, it said, warning that "very large waves will bring dangerous conditions to coastal areas".

It also issued an amber snow warning in Wales , the Midlands and parts of northern England, predicting snow of up to 30 centimetres (11 inches) in some areas.

The UK 's National Rail has said train services will be impacted over the next two days, and called on people to avoid travel unless necessary.

No disruptions to air travel from London had yet been announced.

France was also bracing for Goretti, which will bring gusts of up to 160 kilometres per hour in the northern Manche department.

Schools there will remain closed Friday, and weather alerts have been issued in 30 other northwestern regions.

"Take shelter and do not use your vehicle," the Manche prefecture warned on X, urging residents to prepare emergency lighting and a drinking water supply.

In Germany , heavy snow and winds in the north were set to affect schools, hospitals and transport links.

Up to 15 centimetres of snow (six inches) could fall in the north, and there was a risk of icy conditions in the south, according to the German Weather Service (DWD).

Temperatures this weekend could plunge to as low as -20C in certain areas, DWD meteorologist Andreas Walter told AFP.

Some areas have announced schools will shut on Friday, including in the northern cities of Hamburg and Bremen.

In Hamburg, the weather had already caused delays and cancellations on the public transport network on Thursday.

The national rail company Deutsche Bahn warned of significant delays in the coming days and has mobilised more than 14,000 employees to clear snow from tracks and platforms.

The DWD says that the storm is expected to last until Saturday, with snowfall stopping on Monday.

Walter said the storm was an exception when compared to the last few years of milder winters, which were a "a consequence of climate change ".

"It's still possible to have a cold month with snow, even as temperatures rise due to climate change, but such events will become rarer in the future," he said.

The Norwegian Meteorological Institute meanwhile said there was only one region in Norway with temperatures above freezing on Thursday: the Arctic archipelago Svalbard.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 17:56:12 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/a81f96aa-ecb3-11f0-848a-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/4af3001752f2071368a06943afcc0bf0e793981f.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>France to vote against Mercosur trade deal, Macron says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/france-vote-against-mercosur-trade-deal-macron-says-2026-01-08/</link><description>PARIS, Jan 8 (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron said on Thursday that France would vote against the signing of the free trade agreement with the Mercosur bloc of South American nations on Friday.

Macron said on social media platform X that there had been a unanimous political rejection of the agreement in France despite "significant concessions" for farmers in the European Union.

"The signing of the agreement is not the end of the story. I will continue to fight for the full implementation of the commitments obtained from the European Commission and to protect our farmers."

Ireland will also vote against the agreement, its deputy prime minister Simon Harris said earlier.

But as the European Commission has secured the support of Italy , the agreement is likely to be adopted during Friday's vote.

During the day, French farmers blockaded roads into Paris and landmarks like the Arc de Triomphe with tractors in protest against the EU-Mercosur deal.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 18:31:22 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LLSA6J6DVBIT7HGSUWZGAK6OW4.jpg?auth=06f0da45bceb74f5a7c3edbeacd179b0ba26b603b7e0d8893dc19ad0636d44f3&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Yemen's Saudi-backed presidential council sacks defence minister, Saba says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/yemens-saudi-backed-presidential-council-sacks-defence-minister-saba-says-2026-01-08/</link><description>Jan 8 (Reuters) - Yemen's Saudi-backed presidential leadership council has dismissed Defence Minister Mohsen al-Daeri in the internationally recognised government, the state news agency Saba reported on Thursday.

The U.S. State Department's Under Secretary of Foreign Assistance in an X post on Wednesday said Somali government officials had destroyed a U.S.-funded World Food Programme warehouse and illegally seized donor-funded food aid for vulnerable Somalis.

As a result, he said, Washington was suspending aid to Somalia. The value of the aid was not immediately clear.

Somalia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Thursday disputed the assertion that the U.S.-provided aid had been stolen, and said it remained in WFP custody.

It said expansion and repurposing works had been taking place in the Mogadishu Port area, where the warehouse originally holding the aid - known as the blue warehouse - was located. Those operations "have not affected the custody, management, or distribution of humanitarian assistance," it added.

A WFP spokesperson said the blue warehouse had been demolished by port authorities and that WFP was working with the authorities to address the issue and ensure the safe storage of food.

"The warehouse contained 75 metric tons of specialized nutritious foods intended for the treatment of malnourished pregnant and breastfeeding women and girls and young children. The warehouse is crucial for WFP's emergency operations at a moment when almost a quarter of the population (4.4 million people) are facing crisis levels of hunger or worse," the spokesperson said.

WFP did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether it had possession of the aid.

A Mogadishu Port Authority shipment handover note, seen by Reuters and dated Wednesday, says WFP took over the food that had been "earlier shifted from the blue warehouse" to another warehouse. The note appears to be signed by a WFP Somalia official and includes a handwritten comment saying WFP will confirm final receipt of the food once a lab test confirms it is suitable for human consumption.

According to a letter to the WFP country director seen by Reuters, Somalia's Ministry of Ports and Marine Transport in November provided official notice that the program was required to vacate the blue warehouse by December 31 as a result of plans to relocate port offices.

In Trump's second term, the Republican president has pursued a hardline immigration policy that has posed a stumbling block to relations between Washington and Mogadishu. The Trump administration has barred citizens of Somalia from entering the U.S., and last month said it was auditing immigration cases involving U.S. citizens of Somali origin to detect fraud.

It has also leveled fraud allegations against some nonprofit groups in Minnesota's Somali community, with at least 56 people pleading guilty since federal prosecutors under the previous Democratic administration of Joe Biden started investigating childcare and other social service programs in the Somali community.

The U.S. State Department said on Wednesday that any resumption in assistance would be dependent on Somalia's government taking accountability and remedial steps.

Since returning to office last year, the Trump administration has more widely slashed U.S. aid spending, shifting the U.S. priority in Africa from assistance to trade.

On Thursday, the U.S. embassy in South Sudan said it was suspending assistance to an area in South Sudan and considering significant reductions in another area after what it said was South Sudanese officials' interference and the exploitation and theft of U.S. aid.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 19:22:19 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ULCW3VGE45KLHJSGMO3N2IXEX4.jpg?auth=4e20a31e3ce4d93ef48698ff3d2fd2d304d2780ed5746b9b879ddc7911169503&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Brazil's Justice Minister Lewandowski resigns</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/brazils-justice-minister-lewandowski-resigns-2026-01-08/</link><description>BRASILIA, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Brazil's Justice Minister Ricardo Lewandowski resigned from his role, a letter released by the ministry showed on Thursday.

U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that the United States would withdraw from dozens of international and U.N. entities, including a key climate treaty and a U.N. body that promotes gender equality and women's empowerment, because they "operate contrary to U.S. national interests."

A "large number" of the 31 U.N. entities on the U.S. list are funded by the regular U.N. budget, said U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric, adding that the U.N. has not received any formal notification from the Trump administration. He noted the U.S. had listed some treaty organizations that it plans to withdraw from, which would require official letters.

"All United Nations entities will go on with the implementation of their mandates as given by member states," Dujarric said. "The United Nations has a responsibility to deliver for those who depend on us."

The United States is the top contributor to the U.N. regular budget, paying the maximum 22% according to assessments agreed upon by the General Assembly. These payments are mandatory. The U.S. made no payments to the regular budget last year, Dujarric said. Washington currently owes some $1.5 billion.

"Assessed contributions to the United Nations regular budget and peacekeeping budget, as approved by the General Assembly, are a legal obligation under the U.N. Charter for all member states, including the United States," Dujarric said.

The regular budget - which for 2026 is $3.45 billion - includes political, humanitarian, disarmament, economic, social affairs and communications work. Contributions to most U.N. agencies, funds and programs - such as the World Food Programme and children's group UNICEF - are voluntary.

Trump has described the U.N. as having " but said it is that. He wants to slash U.S. funding.

Chief Judge Virginia Kendall of the U.S. District Court in Chicago said she lacked the power and tools to evaluate "delicate foreign policy decisions" belonging to the government's Executive Branch, while expressing sympathy with "the impossible positions in which many of the plaintiffs have found themselves."

Nine Palestinian Americans, all U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents, sued in December 2024, accusing the U.S. government of violating their constitutional right to equal protection by abandoning them in a war zone and not evacuating them as readily as it would evacuate other Americans.

They said destroyed homes, food shortages, poor medical care, mental anguish and other hardships imposed a "mandatory, non-discretionary duty" on the government to evacuate people from Gaza.

But the judge said she was ill-equipped to address how to coordinate an evacuation with neighboring countries, how to shepherd evacuees through dangerous "red zones," which people are eligible for evacuations, and how the nonexistent U.S. diplomatic presence in Gaza would complicate the process.

"Endeavoring to answer these questions - and many more like them - from the comfort of chambers is both undoable and would also invade the political branches’ constitutionally committed tasks of determining when, how, and under what circumstances evacuations from war zones should proceed," Kendall wrote.

The judge also said available evidence showed the U.S. government has developed an evacuation plan, and the nine plaintiffs had either been evacuated or rejected offers that did not cover immediate family members.

Lawyers from the Council on American-Islamic Relations advocacy group, which represents the plaintiffs, had no immediate comment. The U.S. Department of State did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Hamas-led militants killed about 1,200 people and abducted 251 others in an October 7, 2023, assault on Israel, according to Israeli data. More than 71,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's offensive in Gaza since then, according to the territory's health ministry.

The lawsuit was filed against former U.S. President Joe Biden, former Secretary of State Antony Blinken and former Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, and continued against their respective successors Donald Trump, Marco Rubio and Pete Hegseth.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 20:28:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ND44AHBCHJM7HLAEHB3UGHUBPI.jpg?auth=dbaa8084876272979b2dfe2b11cedfd81c32879e090cf2bfa1a12f04207fe8e4&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'If it expires, it expires,' Trump tells NYT about US-Russia nuclear treaty</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/if-it-expires-it-expires-trump-tells-nyt-about-us-russia-nuclear-treaty-2026-01-08/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 8 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump appeared to suggest he would allow the last arms control treaty with Russia to expire and not accept an offer from Moscow to voluntarily extend the deal, according to remarks released on Thursday.

In September, Russian President Vladimir Putin suggested the two nations could voluntarily maintain , opens new tab the limits on deployed strategic nuclear weapons set out in the New START treaty, which is set to expire on February 5.

"If it expires, it expires," Trump told the New York Times on Wednesday. "We'll just do a better agreement."

Trump said China should be incorporated in any future agreement, according to the newspaper.

Spokespeople for the Russian and Chinese embassies in Washington did not immediately respond to requests for comments.

The 2010 New START agreement cannot be extended. The treaty provided for one extension and Putin and former U.S. President Joe Biden agreed to roll it over for five years in 2021.

The agreement caps U.S. and Russian deployments of strategic nuclear war heads at 1,550 and their delivery platforms - missiles, aircraft and submarines - at 700.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 20:28:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5G723T74DNLNHIG3YVKJA4TGFQ.jpg?auth=475b0a14384d6a466c677be9d01e183c49680e1205d1c971ae0b554fbf4469a9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US detains Ghana's fugitive former finance minister</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/us-detains-ghana-s-fugitive-former-finance-minister</link><description /><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 21:24:10 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/35cca20a-ecd6-11f0-997e-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/ANGL260108-2140-Live-01.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Yes, Elon Musk’s Grok chatbot is 'digitally undressing' women and children</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/musk-s-x-facing-global-probes-after-grok-chatbot-digitally-undresses-women-and-children</link><description /><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 21:24:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/643997c2-ecd3-11f0-937d-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/ANGL260108-2045-Live-CS2045.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>No call for reform: Amid nationwide protests, do Iranians envision new regime in free secular Iran?</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/no-call-for-reform-amid-nationwide-protests-do-iranians-envision-new-regime-in-free-secular-iran</link><description /><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 21:24:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/83421610-ecd0-11f0-b879-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260108-163000-163009-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump says there could be more US strikes in Nigeria, New York Times reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/trump-says-there-could-be-more-us-strikes-nigeria-new-york-times-reports-2026-01-08/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 8 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said there could be more strikes by the U.S. in Nigeria if Christians are killed in the African nation, even as Nigeria has previously denied Christians there are subjected to systematic persecution.

Trump's comments in an interview with the New York Times were published on the newspaper's website on Thursday.

Trump made the remarks when asked about Washington's Christmas Day military strike in Nigeria. The U.S. military said at the time it carried out a strike against Islamic State militants in northwest Nigeria at the request of Nigeria's government.

Nigeria said then that the strike was a "joint operation" targeting "terrorists," and had "nothing to do with a particular religion."

"I'd love to make it a one-time strike ... But if they continue to kill Christians, it will be a many-time strike," Trump was quoted as saying.

When asked about his own Africa adviser having said that Islamic State and Boko Haram militants were killing more Muslims than Christians, Trump responded: "I think that Muslims are being killed also in Nigeria. But it's mostly Christians."

Trump, in late October, began warning that Christianity faces an "existential threat" in Nigeria and threatened to militarily intervene in the West African country over what he says is its failure to stop violence targeting Christian communities.

Nigeria's population of over 230 million people is roughly evenly divided among Christians, who predominate in the south, and Muslims, who predominate in the north.

While Nigeria has had persistent security problems, including violence and kidnappings by Islamist insurgents in the north, it strongly denies that Christians are subjected to systematic persecution.

Its government responded to Trump's past threats by saying it intended to work with Washington against militants, while rejecting U.S. language that suggested Christians were in particular peril. Nigerian authorities note that militants have killed many Muslims as well as Christians.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 21:43:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/JAS2QHNI6FJYBALNZMLXYLTYJA.jpg?auth=baf1d82dfaefef375c2a1d21b0eb7641b14ed07493ec2d39883088d687efa413&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Treasury's Bessent says Iran facing precarious moment, economy in trouble</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/treasurys-bessent-says-iran-facing-precarious-moment-economy-trouble-2026-01-08/</link><description>GOLDEN VALLEY, Minnesota, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Iran's economy is facing high inflation and other challenges, partly due to U.S. sanctions, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Thursday, underscoring Washington's concerns about Tehran cracking down violently on anti-regime protests.

"The Iranian economy is on the ropes," Bessent told the Economic Club of Minnesota, underscoring President Donald Trump's warning to Tehran to avoid harming protesters.

"It's a very precarious moment. He does not want them to harm more of the protesters. This is a tense moment," the U.S. Treasury secretary said, referring to Trump's threat on Sunday to hit Tehran if it began killing protesters.

"We're watching it very closely. If they start killing people like they have in the past, I think they're going to get hit very hard by the United States," Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday.

Rights groups say at least 25 people were killed in Iran during the first nine days of protests that started in the bazaar of Tehran over the plunging value of the currency and soaring inflation, the biggest wave of dissent in three years.

The protests have since spread nationwide amid deepening distress over rocketing inflation driven by mismanagement and Western sanctions, and curbs on political and social freedoms.

Iranian authorities have acknowledged the economic hardships facing Iranians, but accused networks linked to foreign powers of stoking the protests. Iran's top judge warned protesters on Wednesday there would be "no leniency for those who help the enemy against the Islamic Republic."

Bessent said it was clear that "what had been an affluent society that still maintained a high standard of living is really crumbling, and a lot of that is through the sanctions."

He said it was unclear how Tehran planned to finance the rebuilding of its nuclear program.

Trump's threat to come to the aid of protesters if security forces fire on them comes seven months after Israeli and U.S. forces bombed Iranian nuclear sites in a 12-day war. Trump often references the U.S. and Israeli attacks as an example of what he sees as his strong leadership on global affairs.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 21:44:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/GOZBI5OTVNMVFM6UYR3VVRN6PI.jpg?auth=8e854a9332ea4e9b0b978df34559c2de6b2d97fd0a5b8b71b7d2b9feb73e716d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Some whales restrand at New Zealand's Farewell Spit, six die</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/some-whales-restrand-new-zealands-farewell-spit-six-die-2026-01-08/</link><description>AUCKLAND, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Fifteen whales restranded and six have died after a mass stranding at Farewell Spit on the coast of New Zealand’s South Island, conservation group Project Jonah said on Friday, as volunteers prepared to attempt to refloat them.

On Thursday, 55 whales were stranded in two locations in Farewell Spit, a 26-kilometre (16-mile) sandbar at the northern tip of the South Island. Most of them were refloated.

Project Jonah, in a statement on Facebook, said teams had been checking beaches across Golden Bay, where Farewell Spit is located, for other stranded whales and are working to keep the surviving animals cool and comfortable until the afternoon high tide.

“These whales have restranded along the high-tide line, which adds to the complexity of the refloat,” Project Jonah said in an update.

Farewell Spit has been the site of numerous whale strandings over the years. It is a remote location with no facilities and those travelling to the area are being reminded to stock up on energy snacks, food, toiletries and water.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 22:21:58 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KKZN47MTURPUTMH7XUSQCHC2GE.jpg?auth=5f2efe82efe093bd394071e1cf79ad281e2ece386fd2a93b4cc3ac087c4f9672&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump advisers meet with Denmark, Greenland envoys, Danish official says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-advisers-meet-with-denmark-greenland-envoys-danish-official-says-2026-01-08/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Aides to U.S. President Donald Trump met at the White House on Thursday with envoys from Denmark and Greenland, a Danish government official said as Trump pushes to bring the island territory under U.S. control.

Denmark's Ambassador Jesper Moller Sorensen and Jacob Isbosethsen, Greenland’s chief representative to Washington, met with officials at the White House National Security Council, the official said on condition of anonymity.

The White House did not immediately confirm the meeting.

The talks were described as an effort to get more clarity on U.S. comments over the past week about Greenland.

The White House said on Tuesday that the U.S. is considering a range of options to acquire Greenland, and that U.S. military force was among the options. The purchase of the territory is also an option, U.S. officals said.

President Donald Trump has said the U.S. needs Greenland for national security.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is expected to meet with Danish officials next week in Washington.

Greenland has repeatedly said it does not want to be part of the United States. Leaders from major European powers and Canada rallied behind the Arctic territory on Tuesday, saying it belongs to its people.

A U.S. military seizure of Greenland from a longtime ally, Denmark, would send shock waves through the NATO alliance and deepen the divide between Trump and European leaders.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 22:22:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Panama says it canceled flag of US-seized oil tanker a year ago</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/panama-says-it-canceled-flag-us-seized-oil-tanker-year-ago-2026-01-08/</link><description>PANAMA CITY, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Panama's maritime authority on Thursday said it had canceled in January of last year the flag of the M Sophia, a Venezuela-linked oil tanker seized by the U.S. military this week.

The U.S. military's Southern Command on Wednesday said it had intercepted the M Sophia before dawn, and described it as a "stateless, sanctioned dark fleet motor tanker." Panamanian authorities canceled the supertanker's flag on January 23, 2025, the AMP authority said in a statement.

The maritime authority also said the Bella-1, a Russian-flagged tanker the U.S. seized the same day near Iceland after a two-week pursuit, was once listed on the country's registry but this stopped being the case as of October 7, 2024.

A ship's flag determines who has authority over it. The U.S. says that when a flag is canceled it can become stateless, meaning it lacks protections under international law and may be boarded or even seized.

Panama's maritime authority did not immediately respond to a request for more information on why the ships were no longer flagged as Panamanian.

The Bella-1 appeared to be the first time in recent memory that the U.S. military has seized a Russian-flagged vessel.

Wednesday's tanker seizures were third and fourth after the United States intercepted two vessels in December and then captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro in a pre-dawn raid on the capital Caracas, and demanded authorities there open oil to U.S. companies or risk more military intervention.

Top Venezuelan officials have accused the U.S. of trying to steal the country's vast oil reserves, estimated to be the largest in the world, but Trump said earlier this week he had reached a deal with Maduro's successor on crude exports.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 22:47:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US law enforcement clashes with protesters after fatal immigration shooting</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260108-us-law-enforcement-protesters-immigration-shooting</link><description>The White House said Thursday US law enforcement was under "organised attack" as protesters clashed with officers in Minneapolis following a woman's fatal shooting by an immigration agent.

Victim Renee Nicole Good, 37, was shot in the head as she apparently tried to drive away from agents approaching her car, which they said blocked their way.

Vice President JD Vance said, without providing evidence, she was part of a "broader left-wing network" opposed to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and insisted the officer acted in "self-defense."

Federal immigration officers armed with pepperball guns and tear gas wrestled several protesters to the ground Thursday, as large, noisy crowds gathered around Minneapolis to chant slogans against ICE. More protests are planned.

Footage from Wednesday shows a masked agent attempt to open Good's car door before another officer, standing near the front bumper, fired three times into the Honda SUV.

The vehicle veered into parked cars, as horrified onlookers hurled abuse at the federal officers before her bloodied body appeared slumped at the wheel.

Good leaves behind a wife and six-year-old, officials said. More than $800,000 has been fundraised for her family.

President Donald Trump and senior officials quickly claimed Good was trying to kill the agents, an assertion local leaders rubbished.

"I want to see nobody get shot. I want to see nobody screaming and trying to run over policemen either," Trump told The New York Times.

Witness Tyrice told US media he heard "three gunshots and then I hear a car crash."

"I see this lady hugging the victim," he said.

"There's blood all in the snow in front of our house. I could see a lady in the car...You could see the wounds and everything, like a whole bunch of blood."

Good, a US citizen, was not the target of immigration enforcement action and was only suspected of blocking traffic, police said.

Vance alleged Thursday Good was "part of a broader left-wing network to attack, to doxx, to assault and to make it impossible for our ICE officers to do their job."

White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said "law enforcement are under organised attack."

Protests grew after Minnesota's Democratic Governor Walz called it a "patriotic duty" to demonstrate.

On Thursday he said Minnesota must participate in the shooting probe alongside federal investigators -- otherwise Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem "is judge, jury and basically executioner."

But Vance suggested the officer would be cleared by a federal probe that would exclude state-level officials.

"The idea that this was not justified is absurd," he said.

Minneapolis schools were closed Thursday and Friday in anticipation of unrest.

ICE is at the forefront of Trump's immigrant deportation drive, carrying out raids despite local opposition.

Wednesday's incident came during protests over immigration enforcement in southern Minneapolis, where locals are expressing widespread anger over Trump's vow to arrest and deport "millions" of undocumented people.

The victim's mother, Donna Ganger, told the Minnesota Star Tribune her daughter "was probably terrified" and "not part" of anti-ICE activity.

Good was a poet who studied creative writing at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia, US media reported.

Religious leaders addressed crowds at the scene, where a growing memorial of flowers and candles was erected to commemorate Good's life.

"Hate does not make us great," said one banner.

Nearby, Abdinasir Abdullahi, 38, a naturalised US citizen originally from Ethiopia , told AFP he goes nowhere without his passport for fear of ICE.

"They don't trust if I say I'm a citizen, they don't want to trust you," he said.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 23:21:26 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/cadbbf2e-ecaa-11f0-b6ee-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-08T143356Z-2045700529-RC22XIA7SX09-RTRMADP-3-USA-TRUMP-MINNESOTA.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump says Venezuela does not give China a Taiwan precedent, but 'it's up to' Xi</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/trump-says-venezuela-does-not-give-china-taiwan-precedent-its-up-to-xi-2026-01-08/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 8 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said "it’s up to" Chinese President Xi Jinping what China does on Taiwan, but that he would be "very unhappy" with a change in the status quo, according to an interview the New York Times published on Thursday.

"He (Xi) considers it to be a part of China, and that’s up to him what he’s going to be doing," Trump told the newspaper on Wednesday.

"But I’ve expressed to him that I would be very unhappy if he did that, and I don’t think he’ll do that. I hope he doesn’t do that."

Trump made the comments in the context of an exchange about what lessons Xi might take away from Trump's audacious military operation in Venezuela.

The Republican president said he did not view the situations as analogous because Taiwan did not pose the same type of threat to China that he has said the government of Nicolas Maduro posed to the United States.

He also repeated his belief that Xi would not make a move against Taiwan during his presidency, which ends in 2029.

"He may do it after we have a different president, but I don’t think he’s going to do it with me as president," Trump said.

The Trump administration said in a strategy document last year that it aims to prevent conflict with China over Taiwan and the South China Sea by building up U.S. and allies' military power.

China views democratically governed Taiwan as its own, and Beijing has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control. Taiwan rejects Beijing's claims.

“The Taiwan question is purely China's internal affair, and how to resolve it is a matter purely within China’s sovereign rights,” said Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for China’s embassy in Washington.

The United States has no formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan, but Washington is the island's most important international backer and is required by law to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself. The issue has been an irritant in U.S.-China relations for years.

Trump has largely avoided directly saying how he would respond to a rise in tensions over the island.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 23:40:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5G723T74DNLNHIG3YVKJA4TGFQ.jpg?auth=475b0a14384d6a466c677be9d01e183c49680e1205d1c971ae0b554fbf4469a9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russian attack hits infrastructure target in western Lviv region, governor says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/russian-attack-hits-infrastructure-target-western-lviv-region-governor-says-2026-01-08/</link><description>Jan 9 (Reuters) - A Russian attack struck an infrastructure target in western Ukraine's Lviv region, officials in the region said early on Friday.

Lviv Mayor Andriy Sadovyi and regional governor Maksym Kozytskyi, writing on Telegram, gave no details on the strike and did not say what weapons had been deployed.

Sadovyi said it was for Ukraine's military to determine if the weapon deployed by Russian forces was an Oreshnik missile.

Kozytskyi said experts were examining the area where the strike occurred.

Russia fired an Oreshnik missile against the Ukrainian city of Dnipro for the first time in November 2024.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has said the Oreshnik's destructive power is comparable to that of a nuclear weapon, even when fitted with a conventional warhead.

Ukraine's Air Force warned of the threat of missiles being fired from a Russian testing ground in Kapustin Yar, where the Oreshnik is based in southeastern Russia. Oreshnik missiles have also been based in Russia's ally, Belarus.</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 23:41:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Canadian PM Carney, Brazilian President Lula urge Venezuelan-led transition process</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/canadian-pm-carney-brazilian-president-lula-urge-venezuelan-led-transition-2026-01-09/</link><description>Jan 8 (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney spoke to Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva on Thursday about the situation in Venezuela , and the two countries have affirmed their support for a "peaceful, negotiated, and Venezuelan-led transition process."

The U.S. military seized ousted Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro and his wife from Venezuela in a raid over the weekend and brought the two to New York.

"They affirmed their support for a peaceful, negotiated, and Venezuelan-led transition process that respects the democratic will of the Venezuelan people," Prime Minister Carney's office said in a statement about his discussion with Lula.

"The leaders emphasised the necessity for all parties to uphold international law and the principle of sovereignty."

The U.N. human rights office has said the U.S. intervention in Venezuela was a violation of international law that made the world less safe.

Trump told the New York Times in an interview published on Thursday that the U.S. could oversee Venezuela and control its oil revenue for years.

Trump has decided to back Venezuela's interim president, Delcy Rodriguez, instead of Venezuelan opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Corina Machado .

Carney spoke to the Venezuelan opposition leader on Sunday and his office said he thanked her "for her resolute voice on behalf of the Venezuelan people."

Canada has been critical of Maduro's government over reported human rights abuses in Venezuela and Carney called his removal from power "welcome news", but Ottawa did not directly praise the U.S. military raid in the South American nation. Carney has also urged parties to uphold international law.

Lula has condemned Washington's actions as crossing an "unacceptable line."</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 01:47:21 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/RMYU2YOSBBPJRBFS2XZDD4G24Q.jpg?auth=6aba0339d5a6b1f03d5b164fbeec53ddab3ae61464dbac6f2bdf71677bd47b4b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russian drone attack on Kyiv kills at least two, triggers fires</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-drone-attack-kyiv-triggers-fires-injures-four-officials-say-2026-01-08/</link><description>Jan 9 (Reuters) - Russian drones attacked targets in Kyiv early on Friday, killing at least two people, triggering fires and inflicting considerable damage, officials said.

Tymur Tkachenko, head of the capital's military administration, wrote on Telegram that two people had been killed in the strikes, which began just before midnight (2200 GMT).

Mayor Vitali Klitschko put the death toll at three, with six injured. One of the dead, he said, was an emergency medic who had arrived at an apartment hit by two drones in succession.

Klitschko said two apartment buildings had been hit on the east bank of the Dnipro River, causing major damage. In one building, an entire entrance had been destroyed.

A high-rise building had also been badly damaged in a central district, he said.

Tkachenko said one drone had triggered a fire in a shopping centre, while another had fallen outside a medical facility.

Both officials said fires had broken out in several city districts.

Air alerts were in effect throughout the country. In the capital, an alert remained in place more than three hours after the first drone attacks occurred.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 01:47:26 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Honduras opposition party condemns attack on lawmaker as election tensions simmer</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/honduras-opposition-party-condemns-attack-lawmaker-election-tensions-simmer-2026-01-09/</link><description>TEGUCIGALPA, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Honduran opposition lawmaker Gladis Aurora Lopez was injured on Thursday after an explosive device was thrown near her at the National Congress, her National Party said in a statement, as tensions remain high following the country's disputed presidential election.

The conservative National Party alleged the device was thrown by members of the ruling Liberty and Refoundation Party (Libre), and said the blast detonated "centimeters" from Lopez, wounding her.

A representative for the Libre Party did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Video verified by Reuters showed the lawmaker seated, with a white button-down shirt pulled away to reveal stripes of blood and apparent bruising on her back.

The incident comes amid political mistrust after the November 30 vote, in which centrist Salvador Nasralla has appealed to the Electoral Justice Tribunal seeking recounts in multiple departments after the electoral authority declared National Party candidate Nasry Asfura the winner by less than 1% of the vote.

Both were seeking to unseat the leftist Libre Party of President Xiomara Castro, whose candidate Rixi Moncada trailed in third in the elections.

Asfura is due to take office on January 27.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 01:47:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>South Korea's President Lee to visit Japan for a summit with PM Takaichi</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/south-koreas-president-lee-visit-japan-summit-with-pm-takaichi-2026-01-09/</link><description>SEOUL, Jan 9 (Reuters) - South Korean President Lee Jae Myung will visit Japan on January 13 and 14 for a summit with Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, Lee's office said in a statement on Friday.

UN economists predicted that growth would edge up to 2.9% in 2027. That's still well below the average 3.2% growth between 2010 and 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic hurt economies around the globe. The estimate for 2025 is 2.8%.

“A combination of economic, geopolitical and technological tensions is reshaping the global landscape," UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Thursday in a statement, "generating new economic uncertainty and social vulnerabilities.”

But the UN economists said there was “unexpected resilience" to the sharp increases in US tariffs last year. This was supported by solid consumer spending and easing inflation, which helped sustain growth, but they cautioned that underlying weaknesses persist.

According to the UN’s World Economic Situation and Prospects report, growth in Europe, Japan and the United States is projected to hold broadly steady.

In the United States, the UN said growth declined from 2.8% in 2024 to an estimated 1.9% in 2025, “as strong consumer spending and AI-related investment were partly offset by weak residential and commercial construction.”

The UN projected a very small rise in US economic growth this year to 2%, and it forecast that growth will edge up to 2.2% in 2027.

Japan’s economy is forecast to grow by 0.9% this year and by 1% in 2027 — below the 1.2% growth estimated for 2025, the UN said.

“Private consumption is expected to recover gradually, while exports — particularly of automobiles — will likely remain constrained by higher United States tariffs and policy uncertainty,” the economists said of Japan.

The European Union ’s economic growth is forecast to decline from 1.5% in 2025 to 1.4% in 2026 “as higher US tariffs and ongoing geopolitical uncertainty dampen exports,” the report said. But it projected growth will increase to 1.6% in 2027.

On a more positive note, the UN said some large developing economies, including China, India and Indonesia, are expected to continue to see solid growth.

Prospects for many low-income and vulnerable countries are expected to remain less favorable, the economists said, though they projected growth in the world’s least developed countries will rise from an estimated 3.9% in 2025 to 4.6% in 2026 and 5% in 2027. They singled out stronger economic performances in Bangladesh, Ethiopia and Tanzania.

In East Asia, the UN said, economic growth is projected at 4.4% this year, down from 4.9% last year. China’s economy, the world’s second largest, is forecast to grow by 4.6% in 2026 and 4.5% in 2027, below the estimated 4.9% expansion in 2025.

“A temporary easing of trade tensions with the United States — including targeted tariff reductions and a one-year trade truce — has helped stabilise confidence,” it said.

In Africa, modest economic growth is projected, from an estimated 3.9% in 2025 to 4% in 2026 and 4.1% in 2027, the report said. “However, high debt and climate-related shocks pose significant risks," it said.

In Latin America and the Caribbean, while “the outlook remains broadly resilient,” growth is projected to decline slightly from an estimated 2.4% in 2025 to 2.3% in 2026 before edging up to 2.5% in 2027.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 01:48:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/d108b698-ecf7-11f0-81cc-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP081003016631.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israeli strikes kill at least 13 in Gaza, including children, civil defence says</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260108-israeli-strikes-gaza-children</link><description>Gaza 's civil defence agency said Israeli attacks in the Palestinian territory on Thursday killed at least 13 people, including five children, despite a ceasefire that has largely halted the fighting.

Four people including three children were killed when a drone struck a tent sheltering displaced people in southern Gaza, agency spokesman Mahmud Bassal told AFP.

In the north of the Gaza Strip, an 11-year-old girl was killed near the Jabalia refugee camp and a strike on a school killed one person, while a drone near Khan Yunis in the south killed a man, the agency added.

Two more Gazans, including a child, were killed in other attacks, reported the agency, which operates under Hamas authority.

When asked by AFP, the Israeli military said it was checking the reports.

Later on Thursday evening, four more people were killed in an Israeli air strike that targeted a house in an eastern area of Gaza City, Bassal said, adding that rescue work to search for several people who were missing had begun.

"The death toll has risen to 13 as a result of Israeli strikes on the Gaza Strip since this morning in a clear violation of the ceasefire agreement," Bassal said.

Earlier on Thursday, the Israeli military said a projectile was launched "from the area of Gaza City toward the State of Israel" but that it fell within the Gaza Strip.

"Shortly after, the (military) precisely struck the launch point," it said in a statement.

Since October 10, a fragile US-sponsored truce in Gaza has largely halted the fighting between Israeli forces and Hamas, but both sides have alleged frequent ceasefire violations.

Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem told AFP that the strikes in Gaza on Thursday "confirm the Israeli occupation's renunciation of its commitment to the ceasefire".

Israeli forces have killed at least 425 Palestinians in Gaza since the ceasefire took effect, according to Gaza's health ministry.

At least 21 people were killed on November 22 in Israeli strikes, making it one of the deadliest days in Gaza since the ceasefire came into effect.

The Israeli military said militants have killed three of its soldiers during the same period.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 01:48:39 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/d3326096-ece7-11f0-8b5e-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26008624019273.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump says he will meet with Venezuela's Machado next week</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/trump-says-he-will-meet-with-venezuelas-machado-next-week-2026-01-09/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 8 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump indicated on Thursday that Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado was coming to Washington next week.

During an interview on Fox News' "Hannity" program, Trump was asked if he plans to meet with Machado following U.S. strikes on Venezuela that resulted in the capture of its president Nicolas Maduro .

"Well, I understand she's coming in next week sometime, and I look forward to saying hello to her," Trump responded.

The White House did not immediately respond when reached for additional details on the meeting.

This will be Trump's first meeting with Machado, who said earlier this week that she hadn't spoken to the U.S. leader since she won the Nobel Peace Prize in October.

The future governance of the South American country remains in doubt. Trump over the weekend dismissed the idea of working with Machado, saying "she doesn't have the support within or the respect within the country."

Trump told Fox News that it will take time for the South American country, currently led by interim acting President Delcy Rodriguez , to get to a place where it can hold elections.

"We have to rebuild the country. They couldn't have an election," he said. "They wouldn't even know how to have an election right now."

Venezuela, an OPEC member, is one of the biggest producers of oil. Its industry has become focal point of the Trump administration with a senior official telling Reuters that oil sales to the United States will start immediately with an initial shipment of approximately 30 million to 50 million barrels and will continue indefinitely.

Trump said he will meet with oil executives at the White House on Friday. Those oil companies, according to the president, will play a key role in rebuilding Venezuela's oil industry.

"They're going to rebuild the whole oil infrastructure. They're going to spend at least $100 billion and it's an unbelievable oil that they have, and an unbelievable quality of oil and amount of oil," he said.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 03:40:56 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5FGNLH7NRRPUZHLOYODYLM53SU.jpg?auth=8e56798760bc40ca13f63e81ef32078eb2f9d608bf59a5e68e784733cbb3111b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Three people missing as bushfires destroy homes in Australia's southeast</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/three-people-missing-bushfires-destroy-homes-australias-southeast-2026-01-09/</link><description>SYDNEY, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Three people are unaccounted for as out-of-control bushfires rage in the Australian state of Victoria, destroying homes and burning through vast swathes of bushland, authorities said on Friday.

Victoria's Emergency Management Commissioner Tim Wiebusch told a news conference that firefighters were battling 30 active blazes, with the state's fire danger rating on Friday at "catastrophic", the highest level.

Authorities said damaging winds and temperatures up to 46 degrees Celsius (114.8 degrees Fahrenheit) forecast for Victoria’s north would mean any fires burning will be "undefendable".

"Today represents one of the most dangerous fire days that this state has experienced in years," said Victoria's state Premier Jacinta Allan.

A blaze near the town of Longwood has burned through more than 35,000 hectares (86,486 acres) of bushland, while a blaze near Walwa has grown to around 20,000 hectares (49,421 acres).

Both started on Wednesday as an intense heatwave in the country’s south produced the worst fire conditions since 2019, when bushfires destroyed large tracts of southeastern Australia, killing 33 people, in what became known as the Black Summer.

The largest fire near Longwood had destroyed community and residential property, including multiple homes, a community centre and a telephone exchange, said Wiebusch.

"We can't confirm those numbers at this stage, it's still too dangerous to get in and on the ground," he said.

Victoria Police Deputy Commissioner Bob Hill said two adults and a child were unaccounted for in Longwood after firefighters told them to shelter in their house on Thursday.

"They alerted those people that the risks are great, the risks are so high that they needed to take shelter, that it was too late for them to leave," he said.

"Later that afternoon, those same fire service representatives reattended that area to see the house they saw those three people standing in front of had been completely destroyed," he said.

The Walwa fire had burned through a pine plantation but had not yet caused any property losses.

Dozens of communities near the fires have been evacuated and many of the state's parks and campgrounds are closed.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 03:41:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Italian PM Meloni to visit South Korea for summit with President Lee</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/italian-pm-meloni-visit-south-korea-summit-with-president-lee-2026-01-09/</link><description>SEOUL, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni will visit South Korea between January 17 and 19 for a summit with President Lee Jae Myung, South Korea's Blue House said in a statement on Friday.

Officials did not provide details of the medical event but said the unidentified crewmember is stable. They said it did not result from any kind of injury onboard or from ISS operations.

NASA chief medical officer James Polk said "lingering risk" and a "lingering question as to what that diagnosis is" led to the decision to return early. Officials insisted it was not an emergency evacuation.

The four astronauts on NASA-SpaceX Crew 11 -- US members Mike Fincke and Zena Cardman along with Japan's Kimiya Yui and Russia 's Oleg Platonov -- would return within the coming days to one of the routine splashdown sites.

Amit Kshatriya, a NASA associate administrator, said it was the "first time we've done a controlled medical evacuation from the vehicle. So that is unusual."

He said the crew deployed their "onboarding training" to "manage unexpected medical situations."

"Yesterday was a textbook example of that training in action. Once the situation on the station stabilised, careful deliberations led us to the decision to return Crew 11... while ensuring minimal operational impact to ongoing work aboard."

The four astronauts set to return have been on their mission since August 1. Such journeys generally last approximately six months, and this crew was already due to return in the coming weeks.

Officials indicated it was possible the next US mission could depart to the ISS earlier than scheduled, but did not provide specifics.

Chris Williams, who launched on a Russian mission to the station, will stay onboard to maintain US presence.

Russians Sergey Kud-Sverchkov and Sergei Mikaev are also there.

NASA had previously said it was postponing a spacewalk planned for Thursday due to the medical issue.

Astronauts Fincke and Cardman were to carry out the approximately 6.5-hour spacewalk to perform power upgrade work.

Continuously inhabited since 2000, the ISS functions as a testbed for research that supports deeper space exploration -- including eventual missions to Mars.

The ISS is set to be decommissioned after 2030, with its orbit gradually lowered until it breaks up in the atmosphere over a remote part of the Pacific Ocean called Point Nemo, a spacecraft graveyard.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 03:42:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/ef600690-ece9-11f0-9073-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26008604020905.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump administration says it is creating new DOJ division to tackle fraud</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-administration-says-it-is-creating-new-doj-division-tackle-fraud-2026-01-09/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 8 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's administration said on Thursday it was creating a new division at the U.S. Department of Justice to combat what the White House called "rampant" fraud across the country.

Rights advocates and critics have said the Trump administration has used fraud allegations as an excuse to target immigrants and political opponents. They have also dismissed Trump's ability to tackle fraud, citing pardons from Trump to those who have faced fraud convictions in the past.

"To combat the rampant and pervasive problem of fraud in the United States, the DOJ's new division for national fraud enforcement will enforce the federal criminal and civil laws against fraud targeting federal government programs, federally funded benefits, businesses, nonprofits and private citizens nationwide," the White House said in a statement.

In recent weeks, the Trump administration has singled out Minnesota, alleging rampant fraud is being committed by immigrants in the welfare system and social-service programs.

Trump administration officials have frequently and sharply attacked the state's Somali community, the largest in the country. Rights and immigration advocates say Trump has exaggerated isolated examples and used those to engage in what they called federal overreach.

The assistant attorney general for the new Justice Department division will be responsible for leading the department's efforts to investigate, prosecute and remedy fraud affecting the federal government, federally funded programs and private citizens, the White House said.

The White House said the official will advise the U.S. attorney general and deputy attorney general "on issues involving significant, high-impact fraud investigations and prosecutions and related policy matters."

Earlier this week, the Trump administration said it would freeze more than $10 billion in federal childcare and family assistance funds to California, Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota and New York, citing what the administration called fraud concerns. The states later sued the Trump administration.

The administration has threatened federal funding cuts to organizations and states over a number of issues ranging from alleged fraud in programs in states governed by Democrats to diversity initiatives and pro-Palestinian university protests against U.S. ally Israel's assault on Gaza .</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 04:41:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CECJ53VF3FOLPAD36EQ2BS36C4.jpg?auth=ccbbf6a01a72c88cb50f4453d481a6397e2ae6949aaaa95e24f715e33dd3f9ad&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran's rulers face legitimacy crisis amid spreading unrest</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/irans-rulers-face-legitimacy-crisis-amid-spreading-unrest-2026-01-09/</link><description>DUBAI, Jan 9 (Reuters) - With Iran's anti-government unrest evolving rapidly and foreign pressure mounting, the clerical establishment appears unable, for now, to tackle what has become a crisis of legitimacy at the heart of the Islamic Republic .

The demonstrations, which began in Tehran last month, have spread to all of Iran's 31 provinces but have yet to reach the scale of the 2022-3 unrest sparked by the death of Mahsa Amini while in detention for allegedly violating Islamic dress codes.

Starting in Tehran with shopkeepers in the Grand Bazaar angered by a sharp slide in the rial currency, the latest protests now involve others - mainly young men rather than the women and girls who played a key role at the Amini protests.

The U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA), has reported at least 34 protesters and four security personnel killed, and 2,200 arrested during the unrest, which analysts say highlights a deeper disillusionment with the Shi'ite status quo.

"The collapse is not just of the rial, but of trust," said Alex Vatanka, director of the Iran Program at the Middle East Institute in Washington D.C.

Authorities have tried to maintain a dual approach to the unrest, saying protests over the economy are legitimate and will be met by dialogue, while meeting some demonstrations with tear gas amid violent street confrontations.

Nearly five decades after the Islamic Revolution, Iran's religious rulers are struggling to bridge the gap between their priorities and the expectations of a young society.

"I just want to live a peaceful, normal life … Instead, they (the rulers) insist on a nuclear program, supporting armed groups in the region, and maintaining hostility toward the United States," Mina, 25, told Reuters by phone from Kuhdasht in the western Lorestan province.

"Those policies may have made sense in 1979, but not today. The world has changed,” said the jobless university graduate.

A former senior official from the establishment's reformist wing said the Islamic Republic's core ideological pillars — from enforced dress codes to foreign policy choices - did not resonate with those under 30 - nearly half the population.

"The younger generation no longer believes in revolutionary slogans — it wants to live freely," he said.

The hijab, a flashpoint during the Amini protests, is now being enforced selectively. Many Iranian women now openly refuse to wear it in public places - breaking with a tradition which has long defined the Islamic Republic.

In the ongoing protests, many protesters are venting anger over Tehran's support for militants in the region, chanting slogans such as "Not Gaza, not Lebanon, my life for Iran," signalling frustration at the establishment's priorities.

Tehran's regional sway has been weakened by Israel's attacks on its proxies - from Hamas in Gaza to Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen and militias in Iraq - as well as by the ousting of Iran's close ally, Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad.

In a video shared on X and verified by Reuters, protesters in the second-most-populated city of Mashhad, in the northeast, were seen bringing a large Iranian flag down from a pole and tearing it up.

People clashed with security forces in Tehran's Grand Bazaar and cheering protesters marched through Abdanan, a city in southwestern Ilam province, other videos verified by Reuters this week showed.

In a video from the northeastern city of Gonabad, which Reuters was unable to verify, young men were seen rushing out of a seminary mosque to join a large crowd of protesters cheering them on in an apparent revolt against the clergy.

Vatanka from the Washington-based Middle East Institute said the Iranian clerical system had survived repeated protest cycles by repression and tactical concessions but the strategy was reaching its limits.

"Change now looks inevitable; regime collapse is possible but not guaranteed," he said.

In other countries in the region such as Syria, Libya and Iraq, longtime leaders only fell after a combination of protests and military intervention.

U.S. President Donald Trump has said he might come to the aid of Iranian protesters if security forces fire on them.

"We are locked and loaded and ready to go," he posted, without elaborating, on January 2, seven months after Israeli and U.S. forces bombed Iranian nuclear sites in a 12-day war.

Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, facing one of the most precarious moments of his decades-long rule, responded by vowing Iran "will not yield to the enemy."

The former Iranian official said there is no easy way out for the 86-year-old leader, whose decades-old policies of building proxies, evading sanctions and advancing nuclear and missile programs appear to be unravelling.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has praised the protests, calling them "a decisive moment in which the Iranian people take their futures into their hands".

Inside Iran, opinions are divided on whether foreign military intervention is imminent or possible and even firm government critics question whether it is desirable.

"Enough is enough. For 50 years this regime has been ruling my country. Look at the result. We are poor, isolated and frustrated," said a 31-year-old man in the central city of Isfahan on condition of anonymity.

Asked whether he supported foreign intervention, he replied: "No. I don't want my country to suffer military strikes again. Our people have endured enough. We want peace and friendship with the world — without the Islamic Republic."

Exiled opponents of the Islamic Republic , themselves deeply divided, think their moment to bring down the establishment may be close at hand and have called for more protests. But how far they enjoy any support inside the country is uncertain.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:26:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/GW3DJTDWZRPWLEV5OAZMVA5254.jpg?auth=b511255495012b817af34ceca8ebaf5fe8fbe10db1bbb67a6c03028eb26767d7&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Syria announces Aleppo ceasefire after deadly clashes force thousands to flee</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260109-syria-announces-aleppo-ceasefire-after-deadly-clashes-force-thousands-to-flee</link><description>Syria 's defence ministry announced a ceasefire in Aleppo on Friday after days of deadly clashes between the army and Kurdish fighters forced thousands of civilians to flee.

The violence, which has killed at least 21 people, is the worst to erupt since the Islamist authorities took power just over one year ago.

The Syrian government forces have been fighting the US-backed Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in the country's second city since Tuesday.

Both sides have traded blame over who started the fighting, which comes as they struggle to implement a deal to merge the Kurds' administration and military into the country's new government.

The SDF controls swathes of Syria's oil-rich north and northeast, and was key to the territorial defeat of the Islamic State group in Syria in 2019.

"To prevent any slide towards a new military escalation within residential neighbourhoods, the Ministry of Defence announces ... a ceasefire in the vicinity of the Sheikh Maqsud, Ashrafiyeh and Bani Zeid neighbourhoods of Aleppo, effective from 3:00 am," the Ministry of Defence wrote in a statement.

Kurdish fighters were given until 9:00 am Friday (0600 GMT) to leave those areas.

The goal is for civilians who were displaced by the fighting to be able "to return and resume their normal lives in an atmosphere of security and stability," the ministry added.

The governor of Aleppo, Azzam Algharib, told the official SANA news agency that he had inspected the security arrangements in the Ashrafiyeh neighbourhood.

There was no immediate comment from Kurdish forces in response to the government statements.

An AFP correspondent reported fierce fighting across the Kurdish-majority Ashrafiyeh and Sheikh Maqsud districts into Thursday night.

Syria's military had instructed civilians in those neighbourhoods to leave through humanitarian corridors ahead of launching the operation.

State television reported that around 16,000 people had fled.

"We've gone through very difficult times... my children were terrified," said Rana Issa, 43, whose family left Ashrafiyeh earlier Thursday.

"Many people want to leave", but are afraid of the snipers, she told AFP.

Mazloum Abdi -- who leads the SDF -- said attacks on Kurdish areas "undermine the chances of reaching understandings", days after he visited Damascus for talks on the March integration deal.

The agreement was meant to be implemented last year, but differences, including Kurdish demands for decentralised rule, have stymied progress.

Sheikh Maqsud and Ashrafiyeh have remained under the control of Kurdish units linked to the SDF, despite Kurdish fighters agreeing to withdraw from the areas in April.

Turkey, which shares a 900-kilometre (550-mile) border with Syria, has launched successive offensives to push Kurdish forces from the frontier.

Aron Lund, a fellow at the Century International research centre, told AFP that "Aleppo is the SDF's most vulnerable area".

"Both sides are still trying to put pressure on each other and rally international support," he said.

He warned that if the hostilities spiral, "a full Damascus-SDF conflict across northern Syria, potentially with Turkish and Israeli involvement, could be devastating for Syria's stability".

Israel and Turkey have been vying for influence in Syria since the December 2024 toppling of longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad.

In Qamishli in the Kurdish-held northeast, hundreds of people have protested the Aleppo violence.

"We call on the international community to intervene," said protester Salaheddin Sheikhmous, 61, while others held banners reading "no to war" and "no to ethnic cleansing".

In Turkey, several hundred people joined protests in Kurdish-majority Diyarbaki.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:28:26 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/6e5e0dbe-ecf1-11f0-bcc5-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-08T160142Z-1160667913-RC24XIARWNKT-RTRMADP-3-SYRIA-SECURITY-ALEPPO.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia hits Kyiv in large-scale strike after rejecting peacekeeping plan</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260109-russia-hits-kyiv-in-large-scale-strike-after-rejecting-peacekeeping-plan</link><description>Russia launched a massive attack on Ukraine 's capital, setting apartment blocks alight and killing at least four people, Kyiv's mayor said Friday after Moscow rejected the latest post-war peacekeeping plan.

Ukraine and its Western allies, scrambling to bring an end to the war as it approaches the four-year mark, agreed this week that Europe would deploy troops after a ceasefire.

But Moscow , which says it launched its February 2022 invasion in part to prevent Kyiv from joining the NATO defence treaty, has repeatedly rejected the idea of any Western forces stationed in Ukraine.

Such troops would be "considered legitimate military targets", Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova warned on Thursday, branding Ukraine and its American and European allies an "axis of war".

As diplomats wrangle for a breakthrough in what has been Europe's deadliest conflict since World War II, Russia has continued to press forward with its assault, bombarding Ukraine daily.

In Kyiv, drone strikes across the city killed four people and wounded at least 19 others, Mayor Vitali Klitschko said early Friday.

At a residential building on the city's left bank, a medic was killed while responding to a strike as the site was hit a second time.

Some neighbourhoods were plunged into darkness during what Klitschko described as a "massive enemy missile attack".

The country's military warned "all of Ukraine is under a missile threat" after confirming Russian bombers were airborne.

In the western city of Lviv, the Ukrainian Air Force said a ballistic missile traveling at hypersonic speed struck "infrastructure facilities" just before midnight.

It said the missile had been travelling at about 13,000 kilometres (8,000 miles) per hour.

Lviv Mayor Andriy Sadovy said it was up to the Ukrainian military to determine if a nuclear-capable Oreshnik missile had been used in the strike near the border with Poland.

The regional military administration said afterwards that radiation levels were within normal range.

Russia used an Oreshnik with a conventional warhead to strike the city of Dnipro in central Ukraine in late 2024.

Russia's latest barrage came after the US Embassy in Kyiv warned on Thursday that a "potentially significant air attack" could occur any time within the next several days.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had echoed the rare warning in his evening address.

Ukraine was still scrambling to restore heating and water to hundreds of thousands of households after strikes targeted energy facilities in Dnipropetrovsk and Zaporizhzhia regions.

"This is truly a national level emergency," Borys Filatov, mayor of Dnipropetrovsk's capital Dnipro, said as families were left without power in the frigid depths of winter.

While Zelensky has said an agreement between Kyiv and Washington for US security guarantees was "essentially ready for finalisation", German Chancellor Friedrich Merz acknowledged a ceasefire deal was still "quite far" given Russia's position.

Moscow balked after European leaders and US envoys announced this week that post-war guarantees for Ukraine would include a US-led monitoring mechanism and a multinational force.

In its first response after a summit in Paris, Russia called the plan dangerous" and "destructive".

Key territorial issues also appear to remain unresolved.

Russia, which occupies around 20 percent of Ukraine, has insisted on full control of the Donbas region as part of any settlement, a term Kyiv rejects.

Russia's army claimed to have captured another village in the Dnipropetrovsk region on Thursday as its grinding advance continues.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:28:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/68fa387e-e356-11f0-bfe1-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/42f65562daf289921eca99a2f3deffeaef24815a.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'Intended killings': Tanzania's election violence ensnared unsuspecting victims</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/intended-killings-tanzanias-election-violence-ensnared-unsuspecting-victims-2026-01-09/</link><description>NAIROBI, Jan 9 - Around 8:30 p.m. on October 31, a group of policemen appeared in the Mjimwema neighbourhood of the Tanzanian city of Mwanza, where residents were running errands and drinking coffee. Without warning, they opened fire in different directions, triggering panic.

The officers ordered men who had taken shelter in a nearby cafe to lie on the ground and then shot at them, three witnesses told Reuters. By the time shooting subsided, more than a dozen lay dead, they said.

A video posted on social media in early November and verified by Reuters shows the aftermath - 13 limp bodies splayed on the blood-soaked ground.

The massacre in Mjimwema, reported by Reuters in detail for the first time, is one of the deadliest known incidents from days of violence around Tanzania's October 29 elections.

It was not an isolated case.

Reuters interviewed nine witnesses to eight other incidents in Mwanza as well as Tanzania's commercial capital Dar es Salaam and the northern city of Arusha who said they saw officers shoot at people who were not protesting, sometimes kilometres away from any known demonstrations.

Driven by the exclusion of leading opposition candidates from the elections and a surge of arrests and alleged abductions of government critics, the violence was the worst political unrest in Tanzania's post-independence history and has undermined its reputation for stability.

The U.N. human rights office estimates hundreds were killed and the U.S. government says it is reviewing its relationship with the country, partly as a result.

The demands by mostly youthful demonstrators for more accountable governance echoed so-called Gen-Z protests in countries like Kenya, Madagascar and Nepal , which have forced major reforms or toppled governments.

Charles Kitima, the secretary-general of the Tanzania Episcopal Conference, the country's Catholic bishops organisation, said police deliberately targeted civilians.

"We have witnessed lots of people killed in their houses. That's why we say it was intended killings," Kitima told Reuters.

He acknowledged some looting occurred: "But overall protesters were not criminals. They were demonstrating their needs."

Palamagamba Kabudi, a senior Tanzanian official, said the government takes concerns about the use of force seriously and has created a commission of inquiry to investigate election violence. However, he said many allegations were based on unverified and out-of-context information.

"The Government does not recognise a policy or practice of intentional brutality against civilians," Kabudi, Minister of State in the President's Office, told Reuters in written responses to questions.

"Security operations are conducted for specific law-enforcement purposes and are governed by legal safeguards."

President Samia Suluhu Hassan was declared winner of the presidential election with nearly 98% of the vote. In public remarks, she has defended the security response as a reasonable reaction to violence by protesters.

Hassan, previously vice president, came to power in 2021 when her predecessor died in office and the vote was her first electoral test. After initially promoting democratic reforms, Hassan has in recent years clamped down on opponents her government accuses of trying to disrupt elections and foment instability.

After young people in several cities took to the streets on election day, authorities cut internet access across Tanzania for more than five days, limiting access to information and reliable accounts of violence.

Shortly before the connection was restored, police threatened legal action against anyone who shared images that "cause panic or degrade a person's dignity".

Independent human rights experts appointed by the U.N. Human Rights Council said in December that “disturbing reports” indicated security personnel were given "shoot to kill" orders during an enforced curfew, without saying where that information came from.

Kabudi said the government "categorically rejects claims that 'shoot to kill' orders were issued as policy".

The U.N.-appointed experts estimated at least 700 people had been extrajudicially killed but said other estimates pointed to thousands of potential victims.

Kabudi acknowledged that lives were lost but said it would be premature to issue a definitive death toll. The commission of inquiry's findings would be published "in due course", he said.

Witnesses interviewed by Reuters from Mwanza, Dar es Salaam and Arusha, Tanzania's three biggest cities, described widespread vandalism during protests, saying some demonstrators set fire to government offices, properties belonging to ruling party members and public infrastructure.

But, according to the witnesses, police shot civilians not involved in demonstrations and fired indiscriminately into crowds of protesters.

In most cases, the witnesses said they did not know why the police acted the way they did. In some, officers appeared to be targeting civilians accused of ignoring orders the officers had issued to go home, they said.

Reuters was unable to ascertain the legal basis for these orders.

While the police announced on state television a dusk-to-dawn curfew in Dar es Salaam after the initial violence, Reuters could find no evidence of an official curfew or lockdown order for Mwanza or anywhere else.

The national police spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.

From the hills above Lake Victoria, people in Mjimwema could see demonstrations elsewhere in Mwanza on October 30 and 31, but there was no unrest in the immediate area, six residents told Reuters in telephone interviews.

Nonetheless, at around 6 p.m., police came through the neighbourhood to order people who were shopping or watching television in cafes to go home, an instruction that was largely ignored, a witness said.

Around two hours later, about half a dozen police officers - some in the green police uniforms worn by many field units, others dressed in black - arrived on foot and began firing their weapons in different directions, four witnesses said.

Terrified people scattered. One of the witnesses hid in a house. Another sheltered in a nearby bar.

In one cafe, a wooden structure that had no official name but showed soccer matches, patrons switched off the television and the lights in hopes of going unnoticed, said two witnesses who were inside. One of them said he then snuck out a back door and sprinted to a nearby compound. The other remained inside.

When the police reached the door, they ordered those inside to come out and lie on the street, said three of the witnesses.

The witness still inside the cafe said he crawled out, as instructed by the officers. He recalled a stream of insults from the police but at no point did the officers explain their actions, he said.

Then the shooting started. For around 30 seconds, the witness stayed still. "They would shoot again if they noticed you were moving," he said.

After the police left, firing into the air as they departed, he rose, shaken but alive. He said he saw over 15 dead and wounded people around him.

A video posted on social media platform X by a U.S.-based Tanzanian activist on November 5 showed 13 lifeless bodies, surrounded by pools of blood, most face-down near the cafe's entrance. The ground is strewn with sandals, a glass bottle and a cell phone.

A voice can be heard saying: "All of them are dead. This is murder."

In a photo taken by a witness and verified by Reuters, nine of the same bodies are visible.

Two of the witnesses – the one hiding in the bar and the one who fled to a nearby compound – said they saw at least 14 bodies after the shooting.

A few minutes later, police officers in green uniforms pulled up in a large vehicle, loaded the bodies inside and drove off, according to four witnesses, the fourth of whom had returned to the area after taking shelter down the road.

A man in his 20s with a gunshot wound arrived at the nearby Sekou Toure Hospital around 10 p.m., saying police shot people at a Mjimwema cafe, said a person at the hospital that evening. Less than an hour later, police brought about 15 young men - all but one were dead from bullet wounds, he added.

The hospital did not respond to a request for comment.

Kabudi said authorities are reviewing the Mjimwema incident but require verified information before drawing any conclusions.

Reuters confirmed the identities of three of those killed.

Thirty-nine-year-old Raphael Esau Magige and his 27-year-old nephew Johnson Patrick Deus went to the cafe that evening to watch the television news, a family member said.

Neither was politically active, the family member said. Deus, who was learning to drive for a job he had landed in Dar es Salaam, had a young son. Magige, a tailor, had a teenage daughter.

Family members identified their remains at the Sekou Toure hospital mortuary. Deus had been shot four times, including in the ribs and the chest, while Magige had been shot three times in his neck and chest, the family member said. They were buried on November 4.

Another victim was 20-year-old Juma Shaban Joseph, a domestic worker and fervent supporter of Dar es Salaam’s Simba S.C. soccer club, a family friend told Reuters, citing witnesses who saw his body at the scene.

Like the families of many victims nationwide, Joseph's relatives have searched city hospitals and mortuaries in vain for his body, the person said.

In their November statement, the U.N. Human Rights Office cited “disturbing reports” that security forces had taken bodies to undisclosed locations "in an apparent attempt to conceal evidence".

Kabudi denied there was a policy of concealing bodies or evidence.

The cafe in Mjimwema is no longer standing, according to a photo taken in mid-December. A few weeks after the incident, one of the witnesses said he saw workers dismantling the structure. Reuters could not determine who ordered this.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 06:36:26 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/N6S3T43K6NODBCGNCKTEAOHMAE.jpg?auth=5d64fa2392d93ac80e89f2ac67c1270339e99bc933789996eff1f1df32015e5a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Jeju Air crash victims could have all survived without concrete barrier, lawmaker says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/jeju-air-crash-victims-could-have-all-survived-without-concrete-barrier-lawmaker-2026-01-09/</link><description>SEOUL, Jan 9 (Reuters) - A South Korean government-commissioned report found the Jeju Air (089590.KS) , opens new tab plane crash in December 2024 that killed 179 people might not have been deadly if there had not been a concrete mound at the end of the runway, an opposition lawmaker said.

The Boeing (BA.N) , opens new tab 737-800 coming from Bangkok belly-landed and overran the runway at Muan International Airport, killing almost everyone on board after it struck a concrete support for a localiser antenna. The only survivors were two flight attendants at the far rear of the plane.

A simulation contained in the report commissioned by the government-led Aviation and Railway Accident Investigation Board indicated that all on board might have survived without the concrete structure , which did not meet international safety standards, Kim Eun-hye, a member of a bipartisan parliamentary special committee on the accident, said in a press release issued on Thursday.

The simulation by a South Korean structural engineering institute found the aircraft's initial impact as it hit the runway was not strong enough to cause severe injuries and the plane would have slid about 770 m (2,526 ft) before stopping if the barrier was not there, her press release said.

It also concluded that if the navigation facility had been supported by a breakable structure, instead of a concrete mound, the aircraft could have breached a fence with only minor injuries, according to the release.

Kim's office declined to share the full report. Korea Airports Corp, which runs Muan airport, said it could not comment until the final investigation results are released. South Korea's investigation board did not respond immediately to requests for comment.

Kim said the tragedy reflected years of government negligence dating back to 1999, when the structure was built, and it was left uncorrected despite violating regulations and being flagged as unsafe.

The lawmaker's statement comes as families of the victims and opposition politicians step up pressure for full accountability, accusing authorities of delaying the release of the analysis and failing to adequately address whether the infrastructure's design contributed to the high death toll.

The report focused on the structural hazard, but does not yet constitute a final official accident conclusion.

A full investigative report is still pending authorities’ public disclosure after missing a one-year deadline to release a progress report. The Muan airport has been closed since the crash and is not due to reopen until April.

A representative of the victims' family association told Reuters that the report was "solid proof that the disaster was man-made" and said the families were demanding an apology from the investigation board for concealing the information.

The investigation board said in a preliminary report in January last year that both of the plane's engines sustained bird strikes .

The pilots shut off the less-damaged engine after the bird strikes, investigators said in a July update that was not released publicly due to objections from victims' families.

South Korea's parliament has launched its own probe into the crash and its aftermath amid continuing calls for greater transparency.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 06:36:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CM33IBI7RJMEVGTMFCR7YARJOQ.jpg?auth=b851cc9bcaa2968391971a2c42f7937e4938bb55c59638ce278f479211cb362e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Can the US put a price tag on Greenland?</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/can-us-put-price-tag-greenland-2026-01-09/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Despite Denmark's repeated insistence that Greenland is not for sale , U.S. President Donald Trump and his team are "talking about what a potential purchase would look like", according to a White House spokeswoman this week.

But even as a thought experiment that assumes the presence of a willing seller, discussion of the hypothetical sale of an autonomous territory such as Greenland rapidly encounters imponderables such as how a meaningful price tag could even be established.

"There's not a market for buying and selling countries," said Nick Kounis, chief economist of Dutch ABN AMRO bank, noting there was no accepted framework for valuing countries.

Attempts to find historical benchmarks for fair value also run into difficulties.

In 1946 the U.S. offered to buy the vast, mineral-rich Arctic island from Denmark for $100 million - an offer that was rejected back then.

In today's money, that is around $1.6 billion. But that figure, already paltry, is of no use as a baseline because of the massive growth in both U.S. and Danish economies over eight decades since then: it does not reflect any relative "value" of Greenland and its resources in the global economy of the 2020s.

America's $15-million purchase of Louisiana in 1803 and $7.2-million acquisition of Alaska from Russia in 1867 are also not useful precedents.

First and most obviously there is the fact that both France and Russia actually chose to sell.

And while it is clear that those figures would be vastly higher in today's money, how much more would depend on how and whether you factored in variables like inflation, appreciation in land prices and growth in local economies.

So how about if you tried a method akin to the valuation of a corporate takeover based on the income the target is capable of generating? Still tricky.

Denmark's central bank put the size of Greenland's fishing-based Gross Domestic Product (GDP) at a tiny $3.6 billion in 2023 - about a tenth that of its smaller Arctic neighbour Iceland. Even if that was a starting point for a valuation, what multiple would you use to determine a price based on that?

How too would you account for the fact that Danish subsidies cover about half Greenland's public budget, funding hospitals and schools and underpinning infrastructure for the sparsely populated territory?

While Trump has denied the U.S. has its eyes on Greenland's mineral assets and energy assets, Reuters reported last October that his administration has held discussions about taking a stake in Critical Metals Corp (CRML.O) , opens new tab , a company aiming to build the largest rare earths project there.

Estimates put the value of Greenland's mineral and energy reserves in the hundreds of billions of dollars or more. Proper geological studies of the entire island have not been fully conducted but a 2023 survey showed that 25 of 34 minerals deemed "critical raw materials" by the European Commission were there.

Mining and energy companies have a long history of putting price tags on assets around the world. But here, at least two complications emerge.

First, the extraction of oil and natural gas is banned in Greenland for environmental reasons, and development of its mining sector has been snarled in red tape and opposition from Indigenous people. Is that a political constraint that a buyer would want a discount for? If so, how much?

And second, mining and energy deals crucially do not include the transfer of national sovereignty - in this case complicated further by the presence of Greenlandic Inuits who assert ownership claims of their own.

"Because you are adding the intangible notions of Indigenous peoples' culture, history, then you can't - there is no way to price it," said Andreas Osthagen, Research Director for Arctic and Ocean Politics at the Fridtjof Nansen Institute in Norway. "It's why that notion is ridiculous."

For now, the Trump administration says all options are on the table - including military action - to gain control of a territory that it says is vital for U.S. national security and where it already has a small military presence.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio's scheduled meeting with Danish leaders next week may yield further insights into the U.S. game plan on Greenland.

ABN AMRO's Kounis suggested Trump could be using a similar playbook to one he has used in other situations such as talks on trade tariffs, where an extreme scenario is put on the table simply to soften up the other side.

If one possible outcome is an agreed settlement that the U.S. sees as being to its military and economic advantage, then "part of this might well be about getting leverage for future negotiations", Kounis said.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 06:37:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/2OTT6ITHEJKHLANKLGUJGNPN3A.jpg?auth=dd0487a03c448d02e7575305125368c4c67d9a59e316f1b9cf03408349468cea&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Live: Russia pounds Kyiv in massive attack after rejecting peacekeeping plan</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260109-live-russia-pounds-kyiv-in-massive-attack-after-rejecting-peacekeeping-plan</link><description>Russia also struck critical infrastructure in the western city of Lviv using an unidentified ballistic missile, said Mayor Andriy Sadoviy. The Western Command of Ukraine's Air Force later said the missile traveled at a speed of 13,000 kilometers (more than 8,000 miles) per hour, and that the specific type of rocket was being investigated.

A Ukrainian attack left more than half a million people without heat or power in the Russian border region of Belgorod, its governor said early Friday.

"According to the results of the enemy's overnight attack on Belgorod region's utility infrastructure, as of 6:00 am today, 556,000 people in six municipalities are without power," said Vyacheslav Gladkov, adding that almost the same number were without any heating as temperatures hovered around freezing.

Russia launched a massive attack on Ukraine's capital, setting apartment blocks alight and killing at least four people, Kyiv's mayor said Friday after Moscow rejected the latest post-war peacekeeping plan.

The Defence Ministry said in a statement that the strike was a response to an attempted Ukrainian drone attack on one of President Vladimir Putin's residences at the end of December.

Kyiv has called the Russian assertion that it tried to attack the residence, in Russia's Novgorod's region, "a lie."

The governor of Ukraine's western Lviv region had earlier said that a Russian attack had struck an infrastructure target, which unverified social media reports said was a massive underground gas storage facility.

Reuters could not verify that.

Ukrainian media had quoted the Ukrainian Air Force as saying that a ballistic missile had been used in the strike which had been travelling at a speed of nearly 13,000 km per hour (8,000 mph).

Moscow first fired an Oreshnik – Russian for hazel tree - against what it said was a military factory in Ukraine in November 2024. On that occasion Ukrainian sources said the missile was carrying dummy warheads, not explosives, and caused limited damage.

Putin has said that the intermediate-range Oreshnik missile is impossible to intercept because of speeds reportedly more than 10 times the speed of sound and that its destructive power is comparable to that of a nuclear weapon, even when fitted with a conventional warhead.

Some Western officials have expressed scepticism about the Oreshnik's capabilities. One U.S. official said in December 2024 that the weapon was not seen as a game-changer on the battlefield.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 07:27:54 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/3YBD3VOPFJIZ5GJLXNDT2Z65NM.jpg?auth=f44d5269426794f78ae1e7e9015ddee090cbc01bd6414f3bd7dd7761a0875b07&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Storm Goretti lashes France with fierce winds, cuts power to 380,000 households</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260109-storm-goretti-lashes-france-fierce-winds-cuts-power-to-380000-households</link><description>Around 380,000 households in France were without power on Friday morning as Storm Goretti swept through northern Europe with fierce winds.

The vast majority of the affected households were in the northern Normandy region, the Enedis power provider said in a statement, with residents also affected in Brittany, Picardy and the Ile-de-France region around Paris.

Forecasters had issued weather warnings ahead of Storm Goretti, urging people to stay inside their homes.

Overnight, a wind gust of 213 kilometres per hour (132 miles) was registered in France's northwestern Manche region, authorities said.

"Take shelter and do not use your vehicle," the Manche prefecture warned on X, urging residents to prepare emergency lighting and a drinking water supply.

Britain's Met Office also issued a "rare" red wind warning for the Isles of Scilly and Cornwall in southwestern England – its highest level of alert.

"Exceptionally strong winds" of up to 160 kilometres (100 miles) per hour were expected, it said, warning that "very large waves will bring dangerous conditions to coastal areas".

It also issued an amber snow warning in Wales , central England and parts of northern England, predicting snow of up to 30 centimetres (11 inches) in some areas.

The UK's National Rail has said train services will be affected over the next two days, and called on people to avoid travel unless necessary.

Europe's current extreme weather conditions have caused at least eight deaths, and on Thursday police in the Albanian city of Durres pulled a man's body from floodwater following days of heavy snow and torrential rain across the Balkans .

In Germany , heavy snow and winds in the north were set to affect schools, hospitals and transport links.

Up to 15 centimetres of snow (six inches) could fall in the north, and there was a risk of icy conditions in the south, according to the German Weather Service (DWD).

Temperatures this weekend could plunge to as low as -20C in certain areas, DWD meteorologist Andreas Walter told AFP.

Some areas have announced schools would be shut on Friday, including in the northern cities of Hamburg and Bremen.

In Hamburg, the weather had already caused delays and cancellations on the public transport network on Thursday.

The national rail company Deutsche Bahn warned of significant delays in the coming days and has mobilised more than 14,000 employees to clear snow from tracks and platforms.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 07:28:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/70d3b090-ed27-11f0-aeba-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/000-92366ZQ.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>With Maduro gone, the US sets its sights on driving Hezbollah from Venezuela</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260109-with-maduro-gone-us-sets-sights-driving-hezbollah-from-venezuela</link><description>The shockwaves unleashed by the deadly US strikes on Caracas and the capture of Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro were felt all the way to the southern suburbs of Beirut, the stronghold of Lebanese Shiite group Hezbollah

Washington has used Maduro’s abduction to send an unmistakable signal to the militant group’s leadership as well as its Iranian backers, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio directly threatening them the morning after the attack.

“It's very simple,” he told US broadcaster CBS . “In the 21st Century, under the Trump administration, we are not going to have a country like Venezuela in our own hemisphere in the sphere of control and the crossroads for Hezbollah, for Iran and for every other malign influence in the country, in the world. That's just not going to exist.”

Rubio later told NBC News that the new dispensation would mean the outright elimination of any Hezbollah or Iranian presence on Venezuelan soil, where they have been welcomed for the past three decades in the name of a shared antipathy to the United States. The US designated Hezbollah as a foreign terrorist organization in 1997.

Rubio called on the Venezuelan regime – now under the interim leadership of Maduro’s vice president, Delcy Rodriguez – to break with both Iran and Hezbollah. The Islamic Republic, facing mounting protests first triggered by a cost-of-living crisis, has also found itself under pressure, with US President Donald Trump even threatening to intervene if Iranian security forces kill peaceful protesters.

The US has long been monitoring Hezbollah’s activities in the region. The US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has said since 2008 that the movement, then led by Hassan Nasrallah , had been financing itself through drug-trafficking, arms sales and money laundering across Latin America and beyond. According to DEA figures, these activities earned Hezbollah about $1 billion a year .

As for Venezuela in particular, US investigators say that Maduro was even more permissive than his predecessor, Hugo Chavez , and that Venezuela had become a safe haven for the Shiite movement, which reportedly set up command structures in the capital Caracas.

Both Venezuela and Hezbollah have strongly denied these allegations, with the latter insisting that drug trafficking and related activities are “forbidden by Islam”. Despite this, the self-described “Party of God” appeared to have played a key role, alongside Bashar al-Assad’s regime, in trafficking the illicit drug captagon across the Middle East during the Syrian Civil War.

US investigators have long accused Hezbollah of extending its operations into Venezuela in part through the region’s Lebanese and Syrian diaspora.

“In Venezuela, Hezbollah’s support network operates through compartmentalized, familial clan structures that embed into the Maduro regime-controlled illicit economy and the regime’s political apparatus and bureaucracy,” according to a 2020 report by the Washington-based Atlantic Council think tank. “Many of the clans are assimilated within the Venezuelan state and society through the robust Lebanese and Syrian communities that extend to neighboring Colombia .”

Links between Caracas and the Shiite movement “are mutually beneficial, allowing Hezbollah a safe space to conduct its global crime-terror operations and providing the Maduro regime with increased illicit support from the Middle East”, the report says.

Caroline Rose, the director of military and national security priorities at the Washington-based New Lines Institute for Strategy and Policy, said the Latin American drug trade had given Hezbollah access to badly needed financing.

“The relationship that Hezbollah has developed with the Maduro regime and the embedded Cartel de los Soles syndicate (a term used for Venezuelan officials the US accuses of having links to drug trafficking) is extremely nuanced, often simplified by reductionist assertions that Venezuela is a ‘base’ for Hezbollah’s terrorist operations,” she said. “Rather, the picture has been more complex, with the group exploiting Venezuela’s proximity to established drug smuggling routes – just as they have in Western Africa – as a way to diversify alternative revenue streams through the trafficking of drugs, arms, and money laundering schemes.”

Rose said that the sudden death of Chavez in 2013 had only intensified Hezbollah’s activities in Venezuela after his hand-picked successor Maduro took office.

“The relationship has grown since Venezuela’s Chavez era, with reports that Hezbollah has particularly taken advantage of informal ports and smuggling routes off the coast of Venezuela’s Margarita Island,” she said.

This sun-drenched island in the country’s northeast is believed to serve as a key logistics hub for Hezbollah, used for financial activities, espionage and possibly drug trafficking. Margarita Island was described in 2011 during a congressional hearing of the Subcommittee on Counterterrorism and Intelligence as having “ eclipsed ” the infamous “Triple Frontier” between Paraguay , Brazil and Argentina as the movement’s favored bastion in the Americas. This border region served for decades as one of Hezbollah’s strongholds in Latin America, used by the group as both sanctuary and center of operations.

More recently, former assistant secretary for terrorist financing at the US Treasury Marshall Billingslea told a Senate hearing in October 2025 that “under Hugo Chavez, Venezuela opened its doors to Hezbollah, allowing the group establish a major footprint, including a paramilitary training site, on Margarita Island”.

Lebanon’s media have made much of the fact that Rubio’s threats come at a tense moment for the Shiite group and its new leader, Naim Qassem , who is under intense US and Israeli pressure to disarm.

Despite having been severely weakened both militarily and politically during its most recent conflict with Israel – losing longtime leader Nasrallah and most of its military leadership, as well as the abrupt collapse of its Assad ally in Syria – Hezbollah has categorically refused to lay down arms.

According to Rose, “2025 has been a transition year for Hezbollah”. And it may now need to consider its remaining options.

“Israel has imposed a severe blow on Hezbollah’s command and control, infrastructure and finances, creating an incentive for the organization to lay low in Lebanon while pursuing alternative revenue-generating schemes, such as drug trafficking, elsewhere,” she said.

“In that same vein, risk-taking behavior from both Israel and the Trump administration – demonstrated through Israeli strikes on Qatar and Iran, as well as the US’s recent capture of Maduro and designation of cartels as terrorist organizations – could also serve as a deterrent against any major Hezbollah entrenchment in Venezuela,” she added.

For Rose, Trump’s attack on Venezuela, and threats of more to come, could well push Hezbollah to redirect its operations to parts of the world less directly menaced by Washington’s military reach.

“The Trump administration’s violation of international law – and brazen impetus to act against actors that could be brandished as ‘narco-terrorists’ – could make South America a more risk-ridden zone for outside players like Hezbollah,” Rose observed.

“I believe that with so much attention and pressure against any organization that engages in illicit smuggling that encompasses an armed component – militarized cartels, terrorist organizations, and mafia networks – Hezbollah will do its best to quiet its activities in South America. Likely, it will turn its attention towards existing enclaves in Western Africa, as well as seek to charter new potential inroads, such as Southeast and Central Asia .”

US President Donald Trump , who has been pressuring Maduro allies now leading the country to fold to his vision for the future of the oil-rich nation, said the releases came at the request of the United States. In the interview on Fox News on Thursday night, Trump praised the government of acting President Delcy Rodriguez, saying: “they've been great ... Everything we’ve wanted, they’ve given us.”

Jorge Rodriguez, brother of the acting president and head of Venezuela's National Assembly, said a “significant number” of people would be freed, but as of late Thursday night it was still not clear who or how many people would be released. The US government and Venezuela's opposition have long demanded the widespread release of imprisoned politicians, critics and members of civil society. The Venezuelan government insists it does not hold prisoners for political reasons.

“Consider this a gesture by the Bolivarian (Venezuelan) government, which is broadly intended to seek peace,” he announced.

Among those released was Biagio Pilieri, an opposition leader who was part of Nobel Peace Prize winner María Corina Machado’s 2024 presidential campaign, according to Foro Penal, an advocacy group for prisoners based in Venezuela's capital, Caracas. Also released was Enrique Márquez, a former electoral authority and candidate in the 2024 presidential election, the organisation said.

Videos posted by journalists on social media show Marquez and Pilieri embracing loved ones on the streets outside the prison. One video showed Marquez beaming and video-calling family members, saying, “Soon I will be with you all.”

Five Spanish citizens – including the prominent Venezuelan-Spanish lawyer and human rights activist Rocío San Miguel – were also released in the afternoon and, as the night wore on, reports trickled out of more detainees walking free. Relatives who waited for hours outside a prison in Guatire, about an hour east of Caracas, briefly chanted, “Libertad! Libertad!” meaning “Freedom! Freedom!”

Venezuela's government has a history of releasing people imprisoned for political reasons – including real and perceived opponents – during moments of high tension to signal openness to dialogue. The releases on Thursday were the first since Maduro was deposed.

Human rights groups and members of the opposition were encouraged by the move, though it wasn’t clear yet what it represented – whether the growing pains of a government in transition or a symbolic overture to placate the Trump administration, which has allowed Maduro’s loyalists to stay in power as it exerts pressure through crippling sanctions.

For opposition leader Machado – whom Trump has snubbed by endorsing Rodriguez to lead the transition – the gesture was “an act of moral restitution".

“Nothing brings back the stolen years,” she said in an audio message from exile addressed to families of released detainees, urging them to take comfort in the knowledge that “injustice will not be eternal and that the truth, though badly wounded, eventually prevails".

Alfredo Romero, president of Foro Penal, expressed cautious hope "that this is indeed the beginning of the dismantling of a repressive system in Venezuela ... and not a mere gesture, a charade of releasing some prisoners and incarcerating others".

Despite a widespread crackdown in the aftermath of the tumultuous 2024 election – in which authorities said they detained more than 2,000 people – Venezuela's government denies that there are prisoners unjustly detained, accusing them of plotting to destabilise Maduro’s government.

Romero's organisation said that as of Dec. 29, 2025, there were 863 people detained in Venezuela “for political reasons".

The Spanish government said Thursday that five of its citizens, including dual national San Miguel, had been released from custody in Venezuela and would soon return to Spain.

Speaking to Spanish broadcaster RNE, Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares identified the other Spanish nationals released as Andrés Martínez, Jose Maria Basoa, Ernesto Gorbe and Miguel Moreno.

Two of them, Martinez and Basoa, were arrested in Venezuela in September 2024 and accused of plotting to destabilise Maduro’s government as Spanish spies – allegations vehemently denied by Spain.

Spain’s El Pais newspaper reported Thursday that another freed detainee, Gorbe, was arrested in 2024 on allegations of overstaying his visa.

As the news of the release broke Thursday, families of detainees rushed to prisons across the country, seeking information on their loved ones.

Pedro Duran, 60, was among those hoping to reunite with his brother Franklin Durán as he waited outside the prison in Guatire. Duran said his brother was detained in 2021 on charges of trying to overthrow Maduro’s government – an accusation his family denies.

Durán, who has been living in Spain, heard rumors on Wednesday that the government could release a number of detainees and immediately bought a plane ticket from Madrid to Caracas to find his brother.

“I don’t have words to express the emotion I’m feeling,” Durán said. “We’re feeling a lot of hope ... We’re just waiting now.”

Despite the anticipation, fear persists.

“Of course everyone here is very scared, but what more could (the government) do to us that they haven’t done already,” he added.

Ronal Rodríguez, a researcher at the Venezuelan Observatory at the University of Rosario in Bogotá, Colombia, said the government releases prisoners at politically strategic moments.

In July last year, Venezuela released 10 jailed US citizens and permanent residents in exchange for the repatriation of over 200 Venezuelans deported by the Trump administration to El Salvador , where they had been held in a prison built to house criminal gangs.

“The regime uses them like a bargaining chip,” he said of prisoners in Venezuela. It will be telling to see not only how many people the government releases, he said, but also under what conditions and whether the releases include anyone high-profile.

On Wednesday, the Trump administration sought to assert its control over Venezuelan oil, seizing a pair of sanctioned tankers transporting petroleum and announcing plans to relax some sanctions so the US can oversee the sale of Venezuela’s petroleum worldwide.

Both moves reflect the administration’s determination to make good on its effort to control the next steps in Venezuela through its vast oil resources. Trump pledged after the capture of Maduro that the US will “run” the country.

Trump on Thursday night said that Machado may be visiting Washington next week and that he may be meeting with her.

“I understand she’s coming in next week some time and I look forward to saying hello to her,” Trump said in the Fox News interview with Sean Hannity. “And I’ve heard that she wants to do that.”</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 07:28:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/b8c0371a-ecc4-11f0-9727-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-08T185350Z-1984415062-RC26XIA6AXU8-RTRMADP-3-USA-VENEZUELA-PRISONERS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuela-style strike on Taiwan's leader could prove tricky for China</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/venezuela-style-strike-taiwans-leader-could-prove-tricky-china-2026-01-09/</link><description>HONG KONG/TAIPEI, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Some Chinese online users are calling for a lightning Venezuela-style snatch of Taiwan's leaders in a prelude to taking over the island, but analysts, scholars and security officials say China's modernising military is still far from ready.

In Taiwan, they say, China's military has an adversary which has prepared for years against a "decapitation operation" on its leaders, besides extensive air defences and radar capabilities, as well as likely support from the United States and its allies.

Although China has spent years acquiring advanced weapons, questions remain about the capabilities of its People's Liberation Army in using them effectively, as well as a command structure that must knit them together in combat.

"Once such an operation runs into trouble, it would quickly escalate into a full-scale conflict, with extremely high political and military risk," said Chen Kuan-ting, a lawmaker of Taiwan's ruling Democratic People's Party.

Taiwan's layered air defence and early warning systems meant any air assault or special operations infiltration effort would risk detection as it crossed the Taiwan Strait, foreshadowing escalation, he added.

The United States showcased its forces' battle-tested air dominance with last weekend's operation to extract Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife.

Its military controlled the skies with stealth fighters, jets that jammed enemy defences and covert reconnaissance drones and satellites feeding commanders real-time intelligence.

By contrast, the PLA "still has clear gaps in real joint-operations experience, electro-magnetic and electronic-warfare capabilities, and actual combat validation of high-risk missions," said Chen.

China's defence ministry offered no immediate response to faxed questions from Reuters.

China, which claims Taiwan as its own territory, has not ruled out using force to bring the island under its control. Taiwan rejects China's claims.

"Operationally, while the PLA is in recent times trying to get up to speed with force integration, it is still baby steps compared to what the Americans have for decades been accumulating," said Singapore-based security scholar Collin Koh.

Taiwan is determined to defend its sovereignty and boost its defence, President Lai Ching-te said last month, after Beijing fired rockets towards Taiwan as part of its latest military drills.

The drills surrounding Taiwan - the most extensive to date - were accompanied by strong messaging from Chinese officials and the military.

"Any external forces that attempt to intervene in the Taiwan issue or interfere in China's internal affairs will surely smash their heads bloody against the iron walls of the Chinese People's Liberation Army," China's Taiwan Affairs Office said in a statement.

In October, Lai unveiled a multi-layered air defence system called "T-Dome".

It is intended to be similar to Israel's "Iron Dome", with a more efficient and "sensor-to-shooter" mechanism for a higher kill rate that integrates weaponry from Taiwan-developed Sky Bow missiles to U.S.-supplied HIMARS rocket systems.

In July, Taiwan's military staged a drill to protect the Taipei's main airport from a hostile landing, deploying portable stinger rockets and tanks.

While military attaches say China has war-gamed extraction operations in Taipei in a broad range of military options to take control of Taiwan, some Chinese online users tom-tommed the U.S. action in Venezuela as inspiration.

"The Venezuelan situation has provided us a solution for unifying Taiwan," said one user on the X-like microblogging site Weibo.

"First use special operations to arrest Lai Ching-te, then immediately announce the takeover of Taiwan, issue new identity cards ... and achieve a swift and decisive victory."

Chen, who sits on the foreign affairs and defence committee of Taiwan's parliament, dismissed such remarks as "fantasy" and other analysts said any such attempt would quickly face hard military realities.

China had added aircraft to replicate platforms such as Boeing's EA-18G Growler electronic warfare jet and Northrop Grumman's (NOC.N) , opens new tab E-2D Advanced Hawkeye command and early warning aircraft, but their precise capabilities had yet to be delineated, Koh said.

With the ruling Communist Party still playing a role in the PLA's command structure, doubts remain about its effectiveness, added Koh, who is with the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies.

"A decentralised command-and-control hierarchy is essential; that allows field commanders to exercise necessary initiative to cope with the fluid, evolving and uncertain nature of military operations as events unfold," Koh said.

Despite any perceived PLA shortcomings, Taiwan's leaders are taking no chances, however.

"We have have no capital to take them lightly," said a senior Taiwan security official, who spoke on condition of anonymity as the military issues are sensitive.

"After all, in the wake of this painful and shocking experience, China will also look for all kinds of ways to overcome these problems."</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 08:31:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CYJID4IXC5JMZO2CABI3PBDVP4.jpg?auth=c971b87602e23785cd34b72e0738bd990c06de33bd60255de356a32d74434ad9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US to provide $45 million to help implement Cambodian-Thai accords</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/us-provide-45-million-help-implement-cambodian-thai-accords-2026-01-09/</link><description>Jan 9 (Reuters) - The United States will provide $45 million in assistance to Cambodia and Thailand, the senior U.S. diplomat for East Asia said on Friday during a visit to the region, to help solidify President Donald Trump 's peace-making efforts between the two.

"The United States will continue to support the Cambodian and Thai governments as they implement the Kuala Lumpur Peace Accords and pave the way for a return to peace, prosperity, and stability for their people and the region," Michael DeSombre, the U.S. assistant secretary for East Asia, said in a statement.

A senior State Department official said DeSombre would meet senior Thai and Cambodian officials in Bangkok and Phnom Penh on Friday and Saturday to discuss implementation of the peace accords "and broader efforts to promote our shared interests in a safer, stronger and more prosperous Indo-Pacific."

DeSombre said the United States, which has slashed its global foreign assistance programs under Trump, would provide $15 million for border stabilization to help communities recover and to support people displaced by the recent conflict, and $10 million for demining and clearing of unexploded ordnance.

The U.S. would also provide $20 million for initiatives that will help Cambodia and Thailand combat scam operations and drug trafficking, and other programs, DeSombre said.

The Trump administration has made combating the so-called scam centers based in Southeast Asia a priority, as U.S. citizens have been targeted by their financial fraud operations.

Border clashes between Cambodia and Thailand flared up again last month after the collapse of a previous ceasefire deal brokered in July by Trump and Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim to end a previous round of conflict.

The Southeast Asian neighbors agreed on another ceasefire at the end of last year, halting 20 days of fighting that killed at least 101 people and displaced more than half a million on both sides. The more recent clashes included fighter-jet sorties, exchanges of rocket fire and artillery barrages.

Thailand is a long-time U.S. ally, while the United States has sought to improve relations with Cambodia to try to woo it away from strategic rival China.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 08:31:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/RSJQETYPTFJUVLQBN32DYO7BLY.jpg?auth=2c2c98f52619d096eef373d750b17643b11f7ce79ee1dc3cc88aab04e6a92672&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China tops Japanese public's security worries in latest government poll</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-tops-japanese-publics-security-worries-latest-government-poll-2026-01-09/</link><description>TOKYO, Jan 9 (Reuters) - The Japanese public now sees China's growing military power as the country's leading security concern, overtaking the threat posed by North Korean nuclear missiles, a government survey released on Friday showed.

In the survey 68% of 1,534 respondents pointed to advances in Chinese military technology and its activities close to Japan and in the South China Sea as their top security worry, up from 61% when the poll was last conducted three years ago.

The five-week survey began on November 6, a day before Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi sparked the worst diplomatic dispute with Beijing in more than a decade by saying that Tokyo could deploy its forces if a Chinese attack on democratically governed Taiwan was deemed an existential threat to Japan.

China has demanded she retract her remarks , warned its citizens against travelling to Japan and threatened to restrict exports of rare earths, a key component in industrial supply chains. Beijing has also conducted military drills near Japan and, last week, held war games around Taiwan involving missiles, warships and aircraft.

The survey also showed support for Japan's military at an all-time high, with 94% of respondents saying they had a favourable opinion of the Self-Defense Forces.

The poll comes as Takaichi's government prepares to formulate its next defence plan, which is expected to further increase funds for defence.

Under its U.S.-drafted post-war constitution, Japan renounced the right to wage war, but it remains one of the world's biggest military spenders. It is doubling defence outlays to 2% of GDP to deter China from using force to pursue its territorial ambitions in East Asia.

Beijing has accused Japan of stoking regional tensions with its military plans and has warned Tokyo of a "crushing" defeat if it were to intervene over Taiwan, which Beijing claims as its own territory.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 08:31:54 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/MIS3J3ZQRJKV7NQ7AVJ5DOXA3Q.jpg?auth=01fac781bdd2ff1e49f2d0eac3c004dc17e60256993583cfbdedc7b5f15657f7&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China tops Japanese public's security worries in latest government poll</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-tops-japanese-publics-security-worries-latest-government-poll-2026-01-09/</link><description /><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 08:32:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Switzerland marks day of mourning for victims of Crans-Montana fire tragedy</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260109-live-switzerland-holds-memorial-ceremony-victims-crans-montana-fire-tragedy</link><description>All of Switzerland will mark a national day of mourning Friday for the dozens of mostly teenagers killed when fire ravaged a ski resort bar crammed with New Year revellers.

Just over a week after the tragedy at the Le Constellation bar in Crans-Montana, which left 40 dead and 116 injured, the wealthy Alpine nation will come to a standstill for a minute of silence at 2pm (1300 GMT).

A chorus of church bells will then ring throughout the country.

The moment of silence will stand as a "testament to the shared grief felt by the entire nation with all the families and friends directly affected", the Swiss government said in a statement.

At the same time, a memorial ceremony for the victims will be held in Martigny, a town about 50 kilometres (31 miles) down the valley from Crans-Montana, which had been rendered all but inaccessible by a large snowstorm.

Inhabitants of the plush ski resort town will meanwhile be able to watch the ceremony as it is livestreamed to large screens, including at the congress centre that for days after the tragedy accommodated families seeking news of missing loved ones.

A memorial that has sprung up in front of the bar, loaded with flowers, candles and messages of grief and support, was covered in an igloo-like tarp Thursday to protect it from the heavy snowfall.

Swiss President Guy Parmelin, who has declared the fire "one of the worst tragedies that our country has experienced", will be joined for the ceremony by his French and Italian counterparts, whose countries lost nine and six nationals respectively in the fire.

Top officials from Belgium, Luxembourg, Serbia and the European Union were also due to participate in the ceremony.

Most of those impacted by the inferno at Le Constellation were Swiss, but a total of 19 nationalities were among the fatalities and the wounded.

Half of those killed in the blaze were under 18, including some as young as 14.

Of those injured, 83 remain in hospital, with the most severely burned airlifted to specialist centres across Switzerland and abroad.

Prosecutors believe the blaze started when champagne bottles with sparklers attached were raised too close to sound insulation foam on the ceiling in the bar's basement section.

Experts have suggested that what appeared to be highly flammable foam may have caused a so-called flashover – a near-simultaneous ignition of everything in an enclosed space, trapping many of the young patrons.

Video footage which has emerged from the tragedy shows young people desperately trying to flee the scene, some breaking windows to try to force their way out.

On Tuesday, municipal authorities acknowledged that no fire safety inspections had been conducted at Le Constellation since 2019, prompting outrage.

The investigation underway will seek to shed light on the responsibilities of the authorities, but also of bar owners Jacques and Jessica Moretti.

The French couple, facing charges of manslaughter by negligence, bodily harm by negligence and arson by negligence, have been called in for questioning on Friday, sources close to the investigation told AFP.

The pair, who have not been detained, said in a statement Tuesday that they were "devastated and overwhelmed with grief", and pledged their "full cooperation" with investigators.

They will need to answer numerous questions about why so many minors were in the bar, and whether fire safety standards were adhered to.

There has been much focus on the soundproofing foam, which, according to photos taken by the owners, had been added during renovations in 2015.

A video filmed by a member of the public, screened Monday by Swiss broadcaster RTS, showed that the danger was known years ago.

"Watch out for the foam!", a bar employee said during 2019 New Year's Eve celebrations, as champagne bottles with sparklers were brought out.

"This video is staggering," Romain Jordan, a lawyer representing several affected families, told AFP, saying it showed "there was an awareness of this risk – and that possibly this risk was accepted".</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 08:32:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/dc4cd2cc-ed2a-11f0-8c43-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-07T110415Z-489520278-RC2AWIAYPPYA-RTRMADP-3-SWISS-BLAST.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US border agent shoots and wounds two people in Portland</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-federal-agents-shot-two-people-portland-abc-affiliate-reports-2026-01-08/</link><description>Jan 8 (Reuters) - A U.S. immigration agent shot and wounded a man and a woman in Portland, Oregon, authorities said on Thursday, leading city and state officials to call for calm given public outrage over the ICE shooting death of a Minnesota woman a day earlier.

"We understand the heightened emotion and tension many are feeling in the wake of the shooting in Minneapolis, but I am asking the community to remain calm as we work to learn more," Portland police chief Bob Day said in a statement.

The Portland shooting unfolded Thursday afternoon as U.S. Border Patrol agents were conducting a targeted vehicle stop, the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement.

The statement said the driver, a suspected Venezuelan gang member, attempted to "weaponize" his vehicle and run over the agents. In response, DHS said, "an agent fired a defensive shot" and the driver and a passenger drove away.

Reuters was unable to independently verify the circumstances of the incident.

Portland police said in a statement that the shooting took place near a medical clinic in the eastern part of the city.

Six minutes after arriving at the scene and determining federal agents were involved, police were informed that two people with gunshot wounds - a man and a woman - were asking for help at a location about 2 miles (3 km) to the northeast of the medical clinic.

Police said they applied tourniquets to the man and woman, who were taken to a hospital. Their condition was unknown.

Portland and Oregon leaders said at a news conference Thursday evening that they had no details on what led to the shootings, including whether the violence was linked to immigration enforcement.

While they said the FBI was investigating, Portland Mayor Keith Wilson and Oregon Governor Tina Kotek, both Democrats, called for a pause in the federal immigration crackdown pending a full and independent investigation.

"There was a time when we could take them at their word," Wilson said of how federal officials had described the shooting. "That time is long past."

At the same news conference, state Senator Kayse Jama, who arrived in the U.S. 28 years ago as a refugee from Somalia, addressed federal immigration agents: "We do not need you, you are not welcome, you need to get the hell out of our community."

Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield said late on Thursday that his office is opening a formal investigation into the incident to look into whether "any federal officer acted outside the scope of their lawful authority."

"We have been clear about our concerns with excessive use of force by federal agents in Portland and nationally," Rayfield said.

The shooting came a day after a federal agent from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), a separate agency from the Border Patrol within the Department of Homeland Security, fatally shot a 37-year-old mother of three in her car in Minneapolis.

That shooting has prompted two days of protests in Minneapolis.

Officers from both ICE and Border Patrol have been deployed in cities across the U.S. as part of Republican President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown.

While the aggressive enforcement operations have been cheered by the president's supporters, Democrats and civil rights activists have decried them as unnecessary provocation.

U.S. officials contend criminal suspects and anti-Trump activists have increasingly used their cars as weapons, though video evidence has sometimes contradicted their claims.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 09:28:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WPRY3PERWNLWPCSRDMT6WVC6IA.jpg?auth=ac896ef15d6c6e03021964289bd4ca712daab252249a46317f89fdcc80762b6b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran's Supreme Leader to give speech about protests shortly, state TV says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/irans-supreme-leader-give-speech-about-protests-few-minutes-state-tv-2026-01-09/</link><description>Jan 9 (Reuters) - Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei will give a speech in a few minutes on "the terrorist actions" in the country, Iranian state TV reported on Friday, as protests over economic hardships continued nationwide.

A countrywide internet blackout was reported in Iran on Thursday and extended into Friday, internet monitoring group NetBlocks said. It coincided with calls for more protests from Reza Pahlavi, the long-exiled son of Iran's last shah who was toppled in the 1979 Islamic Revolution.

Starting in Tehran with shopkeepers in the Grand Bazaar angered by a sharp slide in the rial currency, the latest protests now involve others - mainly young men rather than the women and girls who played a key role in 2022-23.

The U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency has reported at least 34 protesters and four security personnel killed, and 2,200 arrested during the unrest, which analysts say highlights deeper disillusionment with the status quo.

Authorities have tried to maintain a dual approach to the unrest, saying protests over the economy are legitimate and will be met by dialogue, while responding to some demonstrations with tear gas amid violent street confrontations.

Nearly five decades after the Islamic Revolution, Iran's Shi'ite Muslim clerical rulers are struggling to bridge the gap between its priorities and the expectations of a young society.

In the ongoing unrest, many protesters are venting anger over Iran's support for militants around the Middle East, chanting "Not Gaza, not Lebanon, my life for Iran" in frustration over the authorities' perceived neglect of domestic problems.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 09:29:39 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HVEXFIO5DBNW3MV4JZ6J7TJJCE.jpg?auth=35e43fea6a5cfac3f17359455cf2fd1f66a5df7e0ed17a77789165f9c2684698&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>What is the Oreshnik missile?</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/what-is-oreshnik-missile-that-russia-has-fired-ukraine-2026-01-09/</link><description>Jan 9 (Reuters) - Russia said on Friday it had fired an Oreshnik missile at Ukraine. Here's what to know about this weapon.

The Oreshnik, whose name means Hazel Tree, is an intermediate-range hypersonic ballistic missile that Russia has fired only once before against Ukraine, in November 2024. On that occasion it was equipped only with dummy warheads and therefore caused limited damage, Ukrainian sources said, in what was effectively a test. If the overnight attack carried explosive warheads, it would mark the first time that Russia has used the Oreshnik with full destructive intent. The strike targeted what Russia called critical infrastructure in Ukraine, though the extent of the damage was not immediately clear.

Experts say the novel feature of the Oreshnik is that it can carry multiple warheads capable of simultaneously striking different targets - usually associated with longer-range intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs).

The missile is based on the RS-26 Rubezh, which Russia had originally developed as an intercontinental missile.

Like many Russian weapons systems, it is capable of carrying nuclear as well as conventional warheads, but there was no suggestion of any nuclear component to the overnight attack.

Ukraine said the missile fired in 2024 took about 15 minutes to reach its target after being launched from southern Russia, and reached a speed of about 13,600 kph (8,450 mph).

Russian President Vladimir Putin has claimed that the Oreshnik is impossible to intercept and that it has destructive power comparable to that of a nuclear weapon, even when fitted with a conventional warhead.

Some Western experts have said those claims are exaggerated. In December 2024, a U.S. official said the weapon was not seen as a game-changer on the battlefield, calling it experimental in nature and saying Russia likely possessed only a handful.

Since 2024, Russia has put the Oreshnik into serial production and also supplied it to its ally Belarus.

The Russian military said it fired the Oreshnik in response to what Moscow says was an attempted Ukrainian drone attack late last year on one of Putin's residences in Novgorod, northern Russia. Ukraine said Russia was lying, and that no such attack took place.

Putin had previously threatened to use the Oreshnik, including against "decision-making centres" in Kyiv, if Ukraine continued to attack Russia with long-range Western weapons, but had refrained from doing so until now.

The overnight attack was directed against the Lviv region of western Ukraine, which borders NATO member Poland. Ukraine's foreign minister called it a "global threat" that demanded a global response.

The escalation comes as U.S. President Donald Trump struggles to persuade Russia and Ukraine to agree a peace deal to end the war that began with Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 09:30:33 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/JGKXHFVR2BJLXCENWG3PUJGGUA.jpg?auth=c3c1263ed305fd2bc6ac5c98b7f7446e1cdbfbd67bc8cebccaa203e715b84dd3&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>EU countries expected to clear signing of record Mercosur trade deal</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/eu-countries-expected-clear-signing-record-mercosur-trade-deal-2026-01-09/</link><description>BRUSSELS, Jan 9 (Reuters) - EU nations are expected on Friday to approve the signing of the bloc's largest ever free trade accord with South American group Mercosur, over 25 years since negotiations began and after months of wrangling to secure key member states' backing.

The European Commission, which concluded negotiations a year ago, and countries such as Germany and Spain argue it is a vital part of an EU push to unlock new markets to offset business lost from U.S. tariffs and to reduce reliance on China by securing access to critical minerals.

Opponents led by France, the European Union's largest agricultural producer, say the agreement will jack up imports of cheap food products, including beef, poultry and sugar, undercutting domestic farmers. Farmers have launched protests across the EU, blockading French roads on Thursday.

Ambassadors from the EU's 27 member states are due to indicate their governments' positions on Friday, with 15 countries representing 65% of the bloc's total population required for approval. EU capitals would then give written confirmation later on Friday or on Monday.

This will clear the way for Commission President Ursula von der Leyen to sign the agreement with Mercosur partners - Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. The European Parliament will also need to approve the accord before it can enter force.

The free trade agreement would be the European Union's biggest in terms of tariff reduction, removing 4 billion euros ($4.66 billion) of duties on its exports. The Mercosur countries have high tariffs, such as 35% on car parts, 28% on dairy products and 27% on wines.

The EU and Mercosur will hope to expand evenly split goods trade worth 111 billion euros in 2024. EU exports are dominated by machinery, chemicals and transport equipment, and Mercosur's are focused on agricultural products, minerals, pulp and paper.

To win over deal sceptics, the European Commission has put in place safeguards that can suspend imports of sensitive farm produce. It has strengthened import controls, notably regarding pesticide residues, established a crisis fund, accelerated support for farmers, and has pledged to cut import duties on fertilisers .

The concessions were not enough to win over Poland or France, but Italy appears to have shifted from a 'no' in December to a 'yes' on Friday.

French Agriculture Minister Annie Genevard has said the battle is not over and has pledged to fight for a rejection by the EU assembly, where the vote could be tight. European environmental groups also oppose the accord, with Friends of the Earth calling it a "climate-wrecking" deal.

German Social Democrat Bernd Lange, the chair of parliament's trade committee, expressed confidence that the deal would be passed, with a final vote most likely in April or May.

Jean-Noel Barrot's comments come amid increasing frustration among some of Washington's allies over how President Donald Trump's "America First" foreign and trade policies have upended traditional relationships and alliances.

"In just a few months, the new U.S administration has decided to rethink the ties that bind us. That is its right. And it is also our right to say no to an historic ally, however historic it may be, when its proposal is unacceptable," Jean-Noel Barrot said in an annual speech to French ambassadors.

Trump's coveting of Greenland, the autonomous, mineral-rich Danish territory that he says the U.S. needs for its national security, is the latest policy stance to alarm Europeans, who are scrambling to assess how to respond to the threat.

Barrot appeared to cast the U.S. as a threat on a par with President Vladimir Putin's Russia, whose forces have invaded Ukraine, saying Europe was being assailed from the outside by "adversaries" trying to unravel historic bonds.

"They dream of exploiting our divisions once again, as they have done for centuries. They are already beginning to test the strength of our Union through threats and coercion, as evidenced by territorial incursions on our eastern flank, trade blackmail, and claims to Greenland, which is not for sale," he said.

Barrot was speaking two days after Germany's President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, in unusually strong comments, spoke of a "breakdown of values by our most important partner, the USA" and said the world risked being turned into a "den of robbers, where the most unscrupulous take whatever they want".

With a French presidential election in less than 18 months, Barrot criticised efforts to back "political forces that want to turn their backs on the European heritage" - a clear reference to U.S. support for far-right parties in Europe.

Barrot also slammed U.S. sanctions imposed on European anti-disinformation campaigners and former European Union officials, including ex-commissioner Thierry Breton, over what Washington says were attempts to censor U.S. social media platforms.

"These are... in reality a challenge to our ability to choose our own rules within our own borders," he said, adding that France would resist such pressure.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 09:53:27 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ZYSR7VHYSBJ3ROFRAD5EFQKVHI.jpg?auth=51cdb49664f8367a8e1b24008ff2838ac48f75dcc8fea7d605c446faccc0cead&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>South Korea's ex-President Yoon faces potential death sentence request in trial</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/south-koreas-ex-president-yoon-faces-potential-death-sentence-request-trial-2026-01-09/</link><description>SEOUL, Jan 9 (Reuters) - South Korea's special prosecutor is expected to make a sentencing request for former president Yoon Suk Yeol on charges of insurrection over his brief imposition of martial law in 2024, as a lower court trial convened on Friday for its final session.

Yoon, who is accused of masterminding an insurrection, could face the death penalty or life in prison under South Korean law if found guilty. South Korea has followed an unofficial moratorium for nearly 30 years and has not executed a death-row inmate since 1997.

In hearings at the Seoul Central District Court, prosecutors have alleged Yoon and then-defence minister, Kim Yong-hyun, began devising a scheme as far back as October 2023 to suspend parliament and take over legislative powers.

Prosecutors allege Yoon sought to brand political opponents - including then-opposition leader Lee Jae Myung - as "anti-state forces" and detain them.

The then president and Kim also tried to manufacture a pretext for martial law by escalating tensions with North Korea through a covert drone operation , prosecutors have said.

While the botched bid to impose martial law lasted only about six hours, it sent shockwaves through Asia's fourth-largest economy, a key U.S. security ally and long considered one of Asia's most resilient democracies.

Yoon, 65, has denied the charges. The conservative has argued it was within his powers as president to declare martial law and that the action was aimed at sounding the alarm over opposition parties' obstruction of government.

Dressed in a dark suit and white shirt and appearing noticeably thinner than at the start of the trial in February, Yoon sat with seven other defendants including Kim and legal counsel.

The session opened earlier than usual for defence arguments, followed by the prosecutors' final arguments and sentencing requests relating to each of the defendants.

The court is expected to rule in February, capping more than a year of political upheaval following Yoon's martial law declaration on December 3, 2024, which was revoked within hours after lawmakers scaled fences to break through a security cordon around the National Assembly to vote.

Yoon was later impeached and removed from office by the Constitutional Court and a snap presidential election in June last year brought liberal-leaning Lee Jae Myung to power.

Yoon faces a string of other criminal charges, including obstructing the execution of an arrest warrant and abuse of power.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 09:53:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/SDST3LAVT5OLRL7SZHS4EMR43I.jpg?auth=95e48f5a4a2e84c274baa07d1e86c43fa4d24997a5dcc728e8b918a75e1a124c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Pope Leo decries 'diplomacy based on force' in speech to Vatican envoys</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/pope-leo-decries-diplomacy-based-force-speech-vatican-envoys-2026-01-09/</link><description>VATICAN CITY, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Pope Leo decried the use of military force by countries wishing to achieve diplomatic goals on Friday, saying the weakness of international organizations in the face of global conflicts was "a particular cause for concern."

Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei accused protesters of acting on behalf of U.S. President Donald Trump, saying rioters were attacking public properties and warning that Tehran would not tolerate people acting as "mercenaries for foreigners".

The protests that began over soaring inflation in the Islamic Republic late last month have spiralled into the biggest for three years, with unrest reported in every province and rights groups documenting dozens of deaths.

Iran's fragmented external opposition factions called for more protests on Friday with Reza Pahlavi, exiled son of the late ruling shah, telling Iranians in a social media post: "The eyes of the world are upon you. Take to the streets."

Trump, who bombed Iran last summer and who last week warned Tehran it could come to the protesters' aid, said on Friday he would not meet Pahlavi and was "not sure that it would be appropriate" to back him.

The images published by state television overnight showed what it said were burning buses, cars and motorbikes as well as fires at metro stations and banks. It accused the People's Mujahedin Organisation, an opposition faction that splintered off after the 1979 Islamic Revolution and also known as the MKO, of being behind the unrest.

A state television journalist standing in front of the fires on Shariati Street in the Caspian Sea port of Rasht said "this looks like a war zone - all the shops have been destroyed".

Iran has quelled far bigger bouts of unrest before, but it now faces a graver economic situation and intensifying international pressure with global sanctions over its nuclear programme reimposed since September.

A French diplomatic source on Friday said Iran should show maximum restraint towards protesters.

The protests have not yet approached the scale of nationwide demonstrations in late 2022 over women's rights following the death in custody of a Kurdish woman, Mahsa Amini, but they pose the biggest internal challenge to the authorities since then.

The authorities have attempted a dual approach - describing protests over the economy as legitimate while condemning what they call violent rioters and cracking down with security forces.

"Last night in Tehran, a bunch of vandals and rioters came and destroyed a building that belonged to the state, to the people themselves, just to please the heart of the president of the United States," Khamenei said, urging Trump to "manage your own country".

While the initial protests were focused on the economy, with the rial currency losing half its value against the dollar last year and inflation topping 40% in December, they have morphed to include slogans directly against the authorities.

Protesters have chanted slogans including "Death to the dictator" and praising the former monarchy that was toppled in 1979. The extent of support inside Iran for the monarchy or for the MKO, the most vocal groups among émigré Iranians, is disputed.

Most of the demonstrators seen in videos viewed by Reuters, many of which it has been unable to verify, have been young men.

Iran blocked off the internet overnight. Reuters reporters trying to place phone calls to Iran from abroad were unable to do so on Friday.

At least six flights between Dubai and Iranian cities scheduled for Friday were cancelled, the Dubai Airport website showed.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 10:24:19 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/2MFOTYODRNOPNEEM7LBT3W7WAY.jpg?auth=01406f2e17012aff4bfa67deb51e59f34a6fddf80f86c774a2e8abd7130f4804&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>French opposition parties seek to topple government over Mercosur</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/french-opposition-parties-seek-topple-government-over-mercosur-2026-01-09/</link><description>PARIS, Jan 9 (Reuters) - France's far-right and far-left opposition parties will launch no-confidence motions against France's weak minority government in response to the likely approval on Friday of the EU's Mercosur trade deal.

The far-left France Unbowed (LFI) party said it would file a no-confidence motion on Friday morning, while the far-right National Rally (RN) said it would also launch one against the European Commission chief in Brussels.

The no-confidence motions underline the domestic political blowback French President Emmanuel Macron's government faces over the trade deal with South American nations as it battles to pass an already-late 2026 budget through a truculent parliament.

It seems unlikely the RN and LFI will muster enough votes in parliament to oust the government, led by Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu. Still, their threats underline the perilous political tightrope Macron's administration continues to walk just over a year before the 2027 presidential election.

Macron says France will vote against the Mercosur accord. However, the treaty only requires qualified majority support among EU member states for the deal to be signed by the European Commission and the South American bloc. The European Parliament would then need to ratify the accord.

In a post on X late on Thursday, RN party president Jordan Bardella said Macron's pledge not to vote in favour of the deal was mere posturing amounting to "a betrayal of French farmers."

In a separate X post, RN party chief Marine Le Pen called on Macron "to announce, if necessary, the suspension of France's contribution to the European Union budget."

LFI lower house chief Mathilde Panot said on X that France had been "humiliated" by Brussels and on the world stage.

"Lecornu and Macron must go," she wrote.

Lecornu said the motions of no confidence were sending a negative signal abroad at a time France should be trying to display unity to convince other European nations and was delaying talks to agree on a budget.

"Tabling a motion of no-confidence in this context... is choosing to weaken France's voice rather than show national unity in defence of our agriculture," Lecornu posted on X.

EU nations are expected on Friday to approve the signing of the bloc's largest ever free trade accord with Mercosur.

Supporters, including Germany and Spain, argue it is a vital part of an EU push to unlock new markets to offset business lost from U.S. tariffs and to reduce reliance on China.

Opponents led by France, the European Union's largest agricultural producer, say the agreement will jack up imports of cheap food products, undercutting domestic farmers.

The FAO Food Price Index, which tracks a basket of globally traded food commodities, averaged 124.3 points in December, down from 125.1 in November and 2.3% lower than a year earlier.

For the full 2025 year, the index averaged 127.2 points, up 4.3% from 2024, as higher world prices for vegetable oils and dairy products outweighed declines in cereal and sugar quotations.

The dairy index declined by 4.4% in December, driven by a steep drop in butter prices following increased cream availability in Europe. However, for 2025 as a whole, dairy prices averaged 13.2% above 2024, reflecting strong import demand and limited exportable supplies earlier in the year.

Meat prices dipped 1.3% last month, led by falls in bovine and poultry categories, but the full-year index remained 5.1% above the previous year's value, supported by strong global demand and uncertainty linked to animal diseases and geopolitical tensions, the FAO said.

Vegetable oil prices eased 0.2% in December to a six-month low, as weaker soy, rapeseed and sunflower oil quotations offset gains in palm oil. For the whole of 2025, the vegetable oil index averaged 17.1% higher than in 2024, reaching a three-year high amid tight global supplies.

The FAO Cereal Price Index rose 1.7% in December with wheat supported by renewed concerns over Black Sea export flows, and maize buoyed by strong ethanol production in both Brazil and the United States.

For the whole of 2025, the cereal index averaged 4.9% below its 2024 level, its third consecutive annual decline and the lowest annual average since 2020.

Sugar prices rose 2.4% in December after three consecutive monthly declines, mainly due to lower production in Brazil's southern regions.

The sugar index reached a five-year low for 2025, down 17% from 2024, as global supplies remained plentiful.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 10:26:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/S2QOCJCST5N45HIWAIK4MGOEYM.jpg?auth=898baef623f9c723b4c052ea2db0f677c1c05acb441c57dc89b0c2f8d3a0524e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>World food prices dip in December but still up in 2025, UN's FAO says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/world-food-prices-dip-december-still-up-2025-uns-fao-says-2026-01-09/</link><description /><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 10:26:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Spain arrests dozens of suspected 'Black Axe' crime ring members</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/spain-arrests-dozens-suspected-black-axe-crime-ring-members-2026-01-09/</link><description>MADRID, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Spanish police have arrested 34 people in a nationwide operation against an international crime ring known as "Black Axe" on accusations of fraud, money laundering and document forgery, Europol said on Friday.

Black Axe originated in Nigeria as a student confraternity in the late 1970s and has since evolved into a structured, violent criminal organisation dealing mainly in cyber-enabled financial crime.

The arrests were carried out across several Spanish provinces from Seville in the south to Barcelona in the northeast with support from Europol, the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation.

Europol said the operation was coordinated with authorities in Germany as part of a wider investigation.

The organised crime network allegedly recruited money mules in impoverished areas of Spain with high unemployment rates.

"Most of these vulnerable individuals are Spanish nationals and are exploited to facilitate the network's criminal activities," Europol said in a statement.

Investigators estimate that the network had defrauded its victims of more than 5.9 million euros ($6.87 million).

Moscow said it had fired the Oreshnik missile in response to what it has described as an attempted drone attack on one of President Vladimir Putin's residences last month, which Ukraine has denied and the United States has said did not happen.

It was only the second time Russia has fired the Oreshnik at Ukraine, and came amid a night of air attacks that Ukrainian authorities said also killed four people in Kyiv, knocked out power in the capital and damaged the Qatari embassy there.

The Oreshnik, designed to project power across Europe and which Moscow says is impossible to intercept, is capable of carrying nuclear warheads although there was no suggestion it had done so.

"Such a strike close to EU and NATO border is a grave threat to the security on the European continent and a test for the transatlantic community,” Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha said on X.

"It is absurd that Russia attempts to justify this strike with the fake 'Putin residence attack' that never happened," he added. "Putin uses an IRBM near EU and NATO border in response to his own hallucinations — this is truly a global threat. And it demands global responses."

Kyiv has called Russia's allegation it attacked Putin's residence in the Novgorod region of northern Russia on December 29 "an absurd lie" to sabotage peace talks. U.S. President Donald Trump has said he does not believe it happened, although something else happened in the area.

The Oreshnik hit the Lviv region in western Ukraine, around 60 kilometres (40 miles) from the border with Poland. Moscow said it hit a drone factory and energy infrastructure. Ukrainian officials said it hit unspecified infrastructure; local media reported that it struck a large underground gas storage site.

Russia fired a total of 242 drones and 36 missiles, including Oreshnik, to hit infrastructure in the western Lviv region and in and around the capital Kyiv, Ukraine said.

Authorities said at least four people were killed and more than 20 injured by the strikes on Kyiv, which knocked out electricity to more than half a million homes in the capital. Water and heat were cut off, with temperatures around -10 degrees Celsius (14°F) and heavy snow.

There was no immediate word from Qatar about reports of damage to the building housing its embassy in Kyiv. Qatar has occasionally acted as a mediator in the conflict.

The Oreshnik was fired just before midnight, according to Lviv regional officials. The Ukrainian military said the missile was moving at a speed of 13,000 km per hour.

"The strike's targets were hit," Russia's Defence Ministry said in a statement, describing the targets as a factory producing drones used in the alleged attack against Putin's residence, as well as energy infrastructure.

Russian war correspondents released video purportedly showing the moment the Oreshnik struck its target in western Ukraine. Filmed across a snow-covered landscape, what looked like six flashes were seen striking the ground followed by a loud bang and a series of detonations. Reuters could not immediately verify the authenticity of the video.

Moscow first fired an Oreshnik – Russian for "hazel tree" - against what it said was a military factory in Ukraine in November 2024. On that occasion Ukrainian sources said the missile was carrying dummy warheads, not explosives, and caused limited damage.

Ukrainian and U.S. envoys, joined by a coalition of Ukraine's allies, have been negotiating in Paris this week to iron out remaining disagreements in a peace framework Washington is seeking to thrash out with Kyiv before presenting it to Russia.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 10:50:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/3GUDOO4WPZL5LLP3D3ZLVITMME.jpg?auth=08f786a3f91ef0a8e84a4973907a6a0b997435e50fa4669ad239bbe2ee4dc492&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Swiss prosecutors summon owners of ski resort bar after deadly blaze</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/swiss-prosecutors-summon-owners-ski-resort-bar-after-deadly-blaze-2026-01-09/</link><description>SION, Switzerland, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Swiss prosecutors summoned on Friday the owners of a ski resort bar where a fire on New Year's Day killed 40 people, amid growing criticism that the couple is still at large.

The prosecutors are investigating the French owners on suspicion of crimes including homicide by negligence, while victims' families have filed legal complaints over the blaze at the "Le Constellation" bar in the town of Crans-Montana.

The owners, Jacques and Jessica Moretti, did not answer reporters' questions as they entered the prosecutors' office in the nearby town of Sion on Friday, which Swiss authorities have designated a national day of mourning over the tragedy.

The couple have expressed their grief over the fire and said they would cooperate fully with the investigation. More than half of the 40 people killed in the blaze were teenagers and a further 116 people were injured, many of them seriously.

"We are devastated and overcome with grief, our thoughts are constantly with the victims, their loved-ones who have been bereaved so brutally and prematurely, and all those who are fighting for their lives," they said in a January 6 statement.

Prosecutors said last weekend that the legal criteria to detain the couple had so far not been met.

Witnesses and prosecutors have said the blaze appeared to have been started by the use of sparkling candles that set foam soundproofing on the basement ceiling alight.

Questions remain about oversight at the bar, which the local mayor admitted this week had missed multiple safety checks.

Twenty-one of the dead were from Switzerland , seven from France, and six from Italy. There was also a Swiss-French dual national and a French-British-Israeli national.

The presidents of France and Italy are expected to attend Friday's ceremony in the nearby town of Martigny to mark the tragedy and remember the victims.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 10:50:47 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7XLGTPIENRP4LBQGA76XERVLUE.jpg?auth=eaf695f31d2a1feb85b6a41e7a6964d78528947464c181265d943bdd2aed2e2b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Yemen's southern separatists have disbanded, delegate to talks in Saudia Arabia says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/yemens-southern-separatists-have-disbanded-delegate-talks-saudia-arabia-says-2026-01-09/</link><description>DUBAI, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Yemen's main southern separatist group has decided to disband, one of its members said in a statement broadcast on state media on Friday in Saudi Arabia, where a delegation from the group, which appears to be splitting, has been attending peace talks.

There was no immediate comment from those members of the separatist group - the Southern Transitional Council (STC) - who are not taking part in the Riyadh talks, which were aimed at ending a crisis between Gulf powers Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates over developments in Yemen .

The UAE -backed leader of STC, Aidarous al-Zubaidi, fled Yemen on Wednesday instead of heading to Saudi Arabia for the talks, which follow a sweeping advance through southern Yemen by the STC close to Saudi Arabia's border, which angered the Saudi government.

The Saudi-led coalition later said he had escaped with the help of UAE officers on a flight that ultimately landed at a military airport in Abu Dhabi.

A member of the delegation in Riyadh read a statement outlining the decision to disband the group on Saudi Arabia's state al Ekhbariya TV and media in Yemen.

The STC had said it had lost contact with all members of the delegation in Riyadh, indicating a split was emerging within the group.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 10:51:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CRJ2WKRJUBM5NKDJLV3ONIF5UQ.jpg?auth=0531549c42eccba4def23b076a73176ee52f795019c411b46e010fc40d11afb8&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israeli military says it is attacking Hezbollah targets in several areas in Lebanon</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-military-says-it-is-attacking-hezbollah-targets-several-areas-lebanon-2026-01-09/</link><description>Jan 9 (Reuters) - Israeli military said on Friday it is attacking Hezbollah targets in several areas in Lebanon.

Cebu city Mayor Nestor Archival said in a Facebook post that search and rescue operations were ongoing at the Binaliw landfill, where 110 workers were on site when the accident occurred at 4:17 p.m. on January 8.

Photos shared by the mayor on Facebook showed that several structures at the site, including facilities operated by the landfill operator, were damaged during the collapse.

Archival said disaster response units, police, fire brigades, and the military have been deployed, along with ambulances, fire trucks and lighting towers.

Officials are coordinating with national agencies and landfill management to assess the situation and provide assistance to the families of victims, he said.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 10:51:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>At least one killed, dozens missing in landfill collapse in central Philippines</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/least-one-killed-dozens-missing-landfill-collapse-central-philippines-2026-01-09/</link><description /><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 10:52:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Venezuela releases imprisoned opposition figures and activists</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/venezuela-releases-imprisoned-opposition-figures-and-activists</link><description /><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 10:52:49 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/54d74dd2-ed3d-11f0-be1a-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260109-080527-080719-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Khamenei says Iran 'will not back down' in face of 'saboteurs'</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260109-khamenei-says-iran-will-not-back-down-in-face-of-saboteurs</link><description>Iran 's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Friday insisted that the Islamic Republic would "not back down" in the face of protesters who he called "vandals" and "saboteurs", in a speech broadcast on state TV.

Speaking to supporters in his first comments on the escalating protests, Khamenei said US President Donald Trump 's hands "are stained with the blood of more than a thousand Iranians" and predicted the "arrogant" US leader would be "overthrown" like the imperial dynasty that ruled Iran up to the 1979 revolution.

The Iranian leader's snap speech came as protesters shouted and marched through the streets into Friday morning despite the regime cutting off internet and telephone services.

Short online videos shared by activists purported to show protesters chanting against Iran’s government around bonfires as debris littered the streets in the capital, Tehran, and other areas.

Iranian state media broke its silence Friday over the protests, alleging “terrorist agents” of the US and Israel set fires and sparked violence. It also said there were “casualties", without elaborating.

The full scope of the demonstrations could not be immediately determined due to the communications blackout, though it represented yet another escalation in protests that began over Iran’s ailing economy and that has morphed into the most significant challenge to the government in several years. The protests have intensified steadily since beginning December 28.

Iran's fragmented external opposition factions ​called for more protests on Friday evening with Reza Pahlavi, exiled son of the late ruling shah, telling Iranians in a ​social media post: "The eyes of the world are upon you. Take to the streets."

Demonstrations have included cries in support of the shah, something that could bring a death sentence in the past but now underlines the anger fueling the protests that began over Iran’s ailing economy.

So far, violence around the demonstrations has killed at least 42 people while more than 2,270 others have been detained, said the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency.

Internet monitor Netblocks said authorities had imposed a total connectivity blackout late Thursday and added early Friday that the country has "now been offline for 12 hours ... in an attempt to suppress sweeping protests".

AFP verified videos of crowds of people, as well as vehicles honking in support, filling a part of the vast Ayatollah Kashani Boulevard late on Thursday.

The crowd could be heard chanting "death to the dictator" in reference to Khamenei who has ruled the Islamic Republic since 1989.

Other videos showed significant protests in other cities, including Tabriz in the north and the holy city of Mashhad in the east as well as the Kurdish-populated west of the country, including the regional hub Kermanshah.

Several videos said protesters had set fire to the entrance to the regional branch of state television in the central city of Isfahan. It was not immediately possible to verify the images.

Flames were also seen in the governor's building in Shazand, the capital of the Markazi province in central Iran, after protesters gathered outside, other videos showed.

The protests late Thursday were the biggest in Iran since 2022-2023 rallies nationwide sparked by the custody death of Mahsa Amini , who had been arrested for allegedly violating the Islamic Republic's strict dress code.

Iran has faced rounds of nationwide protests in recent years. As sanctions tightened and Iran struggled after the 12-day war, its rial currency collapsed in December, reaching 1.4 million to $1. Protests began soon after, with demonstrators chanting against Iran’s theocracy.

It remains unclear why Iranian officials have yet to crack down harder on the demonstrators. Trump warned last week that if Tehran “violently kills peaceful protesters", America “will come to their rescue".

In an interview with talk show host Hugh Hewitt aired Thursday, Trump reiterated his pledge.

Iran has “been told very strongly, even more strongly than I’m speaking to you right now, that if they do that, they’re going to have to pay hell", Trump said.

Trump demurred when asked if he’d meet with Pahlavi.

“I’m not sure that it would be appropriate at this point to do that as president,” Trump said. “I think that we should let everybody go out there, and we see who emerges.”

Speaking in an interview with Sean Hannity aired Thursday night on Fox News, Trump went as far as to suggest 86-year-old Khamenei may be looking to leave Iran.

“He's looking to go someplace,” Trump said. “It's getting very bad.”</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 10:52:52 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/82d51986-ed37-11f0-91e1-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/05fbcacf9e2755337547defa2a68b5406a6be8e7.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Before fatal ICE shooting, Minnesota had become Trump target</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/before-fatal-ice-shooting-minnesota-had-become-trump-target-2026-01-09/</link><description>Jan 9 (Reuters) - Months before a U.S. immigration agent fatally shot a motorist in Minnesota on Wednesday, President Donald Trump had fixated on the state, repeatedly criticizing its Democratic leaders and the large Somali-American community there.

The president called Somali immigrants “garbage ,” railed against a sprawling welfare-fraud scandal and ridiculed Governor Tim Walz, a Democrat who ran on the party’s ticket in the 2024 presidential election against Trump. Minneapolis also was one of several Democratic-led cities subject to major immigration crackdowns.

The agent who shot Renee Nicole Good , 37 and a U.S. citizen, was among 2,000 federal officers flagged for deployment to the Minneapolis–St. Paul area, home to the largest Somali diaspora in the United States. The Department of Homeland Security has called the operation its most expansive ever. The agent’s name has not been released by DHS.

The shooting, which inflamed the already charged political climate and sparked protests , unfolded against a backdrop of what political analysts describe as mounting animus toward a state led by Walz, whose conflict with the president traces to the unrest that followed George Floyd's killing by a Minneapolis police officer in 2020 during Trump’s first term.

"There's no secret that the president of the United States does not like Governor Walz and has paid particular attention to the fraud that occurred here," said Marc Osler, a professor at the University of St. Thomas School of Law in Minneapolis.

Osler said Minnesota seems to "trigger" Trump in several ways, pointing to his repeated attacks on Representative Ilhan Omar, a Somali-American Democrat representing a Minneapolis district, and his losses in all three presidential elections there.

The White House has defended the shooting of Good as self-defense by a law enforcement officer merely doing his job and says the recent surge in federal resources to Minnesota was aimed at rooting out fraud.

White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said President Trump's "only motivation is doing what’s best for the American people."

Trump spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said in a news conference on Thursday that DHS would "continue to operate on the ground in Minnesota, not only to remove criminal illegal aliens, but also to continue conducting door-to-door investigations of the rampant fraud that has taken place in the state."

Launched in December, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operation in the Minneapolis area follows similarly controversial deportation efforts in Los Angeles, Chicago, Charlotte and New Orleans - all Democratic strongholds.

While California and Illinois governors Gavin Newsom and JB Pritzker emerged from their battles with Trump with larger national profiles, Walz this week said he would end his bid for a third term to focus on welfare fraud allegations that have become a rallying point for Trump and his Republican allies.

Nearly 100 people have been charged with felonies for what federal prosecutors say was an abuse by some nonprofit groups of Minnesota's social service programs. Most of the people prosecuted are from the area's Somali community.

Mike Griffin, a community organizer in Minneapolis, said he believes Trump and his allies are putting a new spotlight on a fraud scandal that dates to the Biden administration to paint the city as corrupt and justify his immigration crackdown.

"We can make sure that we end waste, fraud and abuse, but also make sure that we're supporting our immigrant communities and supporting civilians," Griffin told Reuters. "We can focus on those two things, but those are two separate conversations."

Griffin was one of the thousands of protesters who gathered in the streets of Minneapolis on Wednesday night calling for a prosecution of the agent who killed Good.

In a press conference on Thursday, Walz said he would push for the state to be part of the federal investigation into the shooting and that Minnesotans would not accept an investigation where U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem is the "judge, jury and executioner."

"This is a brazen use of force. They want us to bend the knee. They want us to capitulate," Walz said.

Dan Myers, an associate professor of political science at the University of Minnesota, said the showdown between the federal government and the state reflects a second Trump term marked by a more aggressive use of executive power.

Trump, Myers said, has pushed "well past the boundaries of executive authority," using the machinery of the federal government to target political adversaries, even as some states have so far managed to push back.

Francesca Taylor, who lives near where Good was shot, told Reuters she believed the Trump administration was targeting her city and state because of their openness to immigrants and other marginalized groups.

“I think it’s easy for the Trump administration to target a state that’s politically opposed to them,” she said, adding, “Trump hates Tim Walz.”

Dan Hofrenning, a political science professor at St. Olaf College in Minnesota, said it remains to be seen if the administration can retain enough political support to continue its surge of federal resources to Minnesota after the shooting.

"The political question of the hour is: how is it playing out for Donald Trump?" Hofrenning said. "There seems to be growing opposition to the aggressive ICE tactics."</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 11:20:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/QEJTSBNB3FOOVAKLFLUM4V2AMY.jpg?auth=f3e92236437d4dbe7c886177949e432114f1a8e23fef40082a1aba2d8084c5ee&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Supreme Court set to issue rulings as Trump awaits fate of tariffs</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/supreme-court-set-issue-rulings-trump-awaits-fate-tariffs-2026-01-09/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 9 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court could issue at least one ruling on Friday as several major cases remain pending including litigation testing the legality of President Donald Trump 's sweeping global tariffs.

The court may release opinions in argued cases when the justices take the bench during a scheduled sitting at 10 a.m. ET (1500 GMT), according to the court's website. The court does not announce ahead of time which rulings it intends to issue.

The challenge to Trump's tariffs marks a major test of presidential powers as well as of the court's willingness to check some of the Republican president's far-reaching assertions of authority since he returned to office in January 2025. The outcome will also impact the global economy.

During arguments heard by the court on November 5, conservative and liberal justices appeared to cast doubt on the legality of the tariffs, which Trump imposed by invoking a 1977 law meant for use during national emergencies. Trump's administration is appealing rulings by lower court that he overstepped his authority.

Trump has said tariffs have made the United States stronger financially. In a social media post on January 2, Trump said a Supreme Court ruling against the tariffs would be a "terrible blow" to the United States.

Trump invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose so-called "reciprocal" tariffs on goods imported from individual countries - nearly every foreign trading partner - to address what he called a national emergency related to U.S. trade deficits. He invoked the same law to impose tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico, citing the trafficking of the often-abused painkiller fentanyl and illicit drugs into the United States as a national emergency.

The challenges to the tariffs in the cases before the Supreme Court were brought by businesses affected by the tariffs and 12 U.S. states, most of them Democratic-governed.

Other important cases are also awaiting rulings at the court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, including a challenge to a key section of the Voting Rights Act , the landmark 1965 federal law enacted by Congress to prevent racial discrimination in voting. Another involves a challenge on free speech grounds to a Colorado law banning psychotherapists from conducting " conversion therapy " that aims to change an LGBT minor's sexual orientation or gender identity.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 11:20:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/TE2AH3XU3RMG5PXJPCXMTLLIOA.jpg?auth=a558ef5b4bd90c70e655763fb562e0f55142429f5bcc2f6887f36b5e4dcf2890&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Envoy tapped for Trump's Gaza board meets senior Palestinian official in West Bank</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/envoy-tapped-trumps-gaza-board-meets-senior-palestinian-official-west-bank-2026-01-09/</link><description>RAMALLAH, West Bank, Jan 9 (Reuters) - The former U.N. envoy expected to help lead Donald Trump's so-called Board of Peace for Gaza met a top Palestinian Authority official on Friday as the U.S. president pushes ahead with his plan for the enclave's future.

Trump is expected to announce the composition of the board this month, possibly as early as next week, a U.S. official said. Portrayed as part of a transitional government, the board is an important component of Trump's phased plan to halt the war between Israel and Hamas.

The first phase of Trump's plan, which included a ceasefire and hostage release deal, has been shaken by issues including Israeli airstrikes in Gaza that have killed hundreds of people, a refusal by Hamas to disarm and Israeli delays in reopening Gaza's Rafah border crossing with Egypt.

Although the two sides accuse each other of breaching the deal, Trump says he wants to move on to the second phase, a progression that would entail the establishment of the Board of Peace and a yet-to-be-agreed deployment of peacekeeping forces.

Nickolay Mladenov, the former U.N. Middle East envoy who is expected to represent the board on the ground, met senior Palestinian Authority (PA) official Hussein al-Sheikh in the occupied West Bank city of Ramallah on Friday, the Palestinian leader said on X.

The two men discussed "the situation in the Gaza Strip, ways to move to the second phase, and mechanisms for implementing (Trump's) plan," Sheikh said.

Mladenov was not expected to meet PA President Mahmoud Abbas, a source familiar with the matter said. Under Trump's plan, the PA would eventually take control of Gaza from the Board of Peace.

Israel has rejected any involvement by Hamas, which ran Gaza before the war, but has also opposed rule by the PA, the body set up under the Oslo interim peace accords three decades ago that has limited governing power in the West Bank.

On Thursday, Mladenov met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and some of his top advisers in Jerusalem, Netanyahu's office said in a statement. Netanyahu reiterated Israel's position that Hamas must be disarmed and Gaza should be demilitarised, in line with Trump's plan, the statement said.

Netanyahu's office described Mladenov as "set to become the Director of the Gaza Strip Board of Peace."

The board, expected to also comprise officials from U.S. allies in Europe and the Middle East, would oversee a committee of Palestinian technocrats.

Mladenov, a former Bulgarian politician, served as the U.N.'s Jerusalem-based Middle East envoy from 2015-2020.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 11:20:33 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/DV6MTCH4YFKKTJH3CTHMX3A65U.jpg?auth=87c21966a56123a99c2b4f67cb981d5ce76ececd2fceb78a498cc7aac8deb52a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Meloni rules out U.S. military move on Greenland, urges strong NATO Arctic presence</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/meloni-rules-out-us-military-move-greenland-urges-strong-nato-arctic-presence-2026-01-09/</link><description>ROME, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said on Friday she did not believe the United States would use military force to seize Greenland , warning that such a move would have grave consequences for NATO.

At her traditional New Year's press conference, Meloni added that there was a need for a "serious and significant" NATO presence in the Arctic region, including Greenland.

"I continue not to believe in the hypothesis that the United States would launch a military action to take control of Greenland, an option I would clearly not support," Meloni said.

"I believe it would not be in anyone's interest. I think it would not even be in the interest of the United States of America, to be clear," she added.

A weekend U.S. military operation that seized the leader of Venezuela rekindled concerns about U.S. intentions towards Greenland . The White House said on Tuesday that the U.S. was considering a range of options to acquire Greenland, including the use of military force.

Meloni, who is seen as one of U.S. President Donald Trump's closest allies in Europe, said it was "clear to everyone" that any U.S. move on Greenland would have a significant impact on NATO, adding this was the reason she did not think Washington would act on its threats.

However, she said it was important for NATO to boost its presence in the Arctic region, adding that she understood U.S. concerns for the need to prevent "excessive interference from other actors that could even be hostile".</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 11:21:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/3EYEM5EHFNNCPNO6CLSN4OL7Z4.jpg?auth=8243452ba4c73dddd483e1a4156525163e1ab8019efc685efca811e99def3417&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China's top diplomat Wang Yi postpones visit to Somalia</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-top-diplomat-wang-yi-postpones-visit-somalia-2026-01-09/</link><description>Jan 9 (Reuters) - Somalia's foreign affairs ministry said on Friday that China's top diplomat Wang Yi had postponed his planned visit to the East African country.

With voters disgruntled about rising prices and Trump's handling of the economy, some allies fear the president's intense focus on foreign policy could jeopardize the party's tenuous control of Congress in November's midterm elections.

White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, her deputy James Blair and Vice President JD Vance are pressing Trump to prioritize domestic concerns, said two White House officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal matters.

Vance has been the most persistent voice in meetings, repeatedly steering conversations back to kitchen-table issues, they said.

In the wake of last week's Venezuela operation, some top White House aides are "openly frustrated" that Trump and many senior officials continue to talk so much about foreign affairs, one of the officials said. Despite easing inflation, many voters remain focused on affordability as they face high costs for housing, food and health insurance.

Asked for comment, the White House said Trump has always made the economy his top priority, citing his announcements this week aimed at lowering home prices, and said his foreign policy has "consistently put America First."

"The President will always work to bring investments and deliverables back to our country," said spokeswoman Anna Kelly.

Wiles and Blair did not respond to requests seeking comment. A spokeswoman for Vance declined to comment.

The concerns about Trump's priorities are not new, as his focus on foreign policy predates the Venezuela operation. In recent weeks he has made veiled threats to invade Greenland and Panama, bombed targets in Syria and Nigeria, and pushed for peace between Ukraine and Russia.

But the officials say the concerns have taken on greater urgency as the administration enters a pivotal election year, when the White House had planned to shift more aggressively toward domestic messaging and travel.

Trump, who campaigned on curbing inflation, has recently said the issue of affordability is a Democratic "hoax."

In multiple White House meetings focused on the economy since November, officials have shown him polling, surveys and social media posts highlighting voters' concerns about the cost of living and his handling of the economy and have urged him to focus his public remarks on economic issues, the White House officials said.

Trump, one official said, has countered that the economy is strong, warned that focusing on it could play into a Democratic trap to downplay his achievements and maintained that high inflation stems from his predecessor Joe Biden's policies.

After the president announced on Saturday that the U.S. would "run" Venezuela, Republican lawmakers inundated the White House with calls insisting the "only country Trump should be running is the United States," one official said.

The party of a sitting president typically struggles to hold onto seats in Congress in the midterms, and Trump's Republicans hold only slim majorities in both houses. Voter angst over the economy could make this a particularly tough election for the party.

Trump won reelection with an “America First” agenda, promising to avoid foreign entanglements and strengthen the economy. While his supporters have so far mostly backed his intervention in Venezuela, foreign policy is seldom a winning issue in U.S. congressional elections.

In December, just one in three U.S. adults approved of Trump's handling of the economy, his lowest rating on the matter last year, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll. A poll this week found the same share supported Trump's strike on Venezuela, although initial support among Republicans was 65%.

Republicans on Capitol Hill have privately questioned why Trump is not more focused on domestic priorities, even as they publicly support his actions overseas, said the two White House officials and a Republican strategist who is in close contact with members of the Senate and the House of Representatives.

"He needs to stay focused on things that voters care about, not renaming buildings and other things that are not in the kitchen-table category," said the strategist, who asked to remain anonymous to speak freely about private conversations.

At a retreat for House Republican lawmakers on Tuesday, Trump spent more time during his 84-minute speech wandering through past grievances and cultural issues than outlining specific plans or a broad election-year strategy on how he is addressing voters' affordability concerns.

One of the officials said White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller’s recent TV appearances focused on Venezuela and Trump's renewed interest in seizing Greenland were unhelpful distractions.

Miller did not respond to a request for comment.

He and Secretary of State Marco Rubio argue the political impact of the Venezuela mission will depend on how deeply the U.S. becomes involved and how events unfold on the ground, the White House officials said. They say projecting strength abroad can reinforce, rather than clash with, Trump's "America First" agenda.

To test that theory, the White House has commissioned polling to gauge how Trump's "Make America Great Again" base reacts to his attention on Venezuela and Greenland, according to the two White House officials and a Republican pollster familiar with the effort.

The administration has also sought out right-wing influencers to shape the narrative around the Venezuela actions, they said.

The White House views such outreach as critical, given parts of Trump's MAGA coalition are wary of foreign interventions and have shown how quickly support can erode if core promises are seen as broken, such as when the Justice Department reversed course after promising to release files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

Several prominent conservatives who initially questioned the Venezuela operation have since expressed support, said the officials, who cited that shift as an early sign the strategy is working.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 11:21:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/GH4S62UKMFJN7BOI4MBFMCA7LM.jpg?auth=082f4dcf2280512d45117249aa2e0434df1b53466ce25f229a7f29697df46ca7&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Kurdish groups reject Aleppo withdrawal as US pushes to end fighting</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/kurdish-groups-reject-aleppo-withdrawal-us-pushes-end-fighting-2026-01-09/</link><description>ALEPPO, Syria,  Jan 9 (Reuters) - Kurdish groups in Aleppo vowed to defend their neighbourhoods from government forces on Friday, rejecting ceasefire terms declared by Damascus that demand Kurdish fighters withdraw from the Syrian city where clashes have raged this week.

The violence in Aleppo has exposed a deep faultline between President Ahmed al-Sharaa's Islamist-led government and Kurdish forces, which have resisted its efforts to bring their fighters under centralised authority.

At least nine civilians have been killed and more than 140,000 have fled their homes. Neither the government nor the Kurdish forces have announced a toll of casualties among their fighters.

The ceasefire announced by the defense ministry overnight demanded the withdrawal of Kurdish forces to the Kurdish-held northeast. That would effectively end Kurdish control over pockets of Aleppo held by Kurdish forces since the early days of the Syrian conflict which began in 2011.

But in a statement, Kurdish councils that run the Sheikh Maksoud and Ashrafiyah districts of Aleppo said calls to leave were "a call to surrender" and that Kurdish forces would instead "defend their neighbourhoods", accusing government forces of intensive shelling.

The ceasefire said Kurdish forces should withdraw by 9 a.m. (0700 GMT) on Friday, but no one withdrew overnight, according to Syrian security sources.

Tom Barrack, the U.S. envoy for Syria, had earlier welcomed what he called a "temporary ceasefire" and said Washington was working intensively to extend it beyond the 9 a.m. deadline. "We are hopeful this weekend will bring a more enduring calm and deeper dialogue," he wrote on X.

Washington has been closely involved in efforts to promote integration between the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) - which has enjoyed U.S. military support for more than a decade - and the Damascus government.

However, little has been achieved since the sides signed a framework agreement in March, 2025, which had called for the process to be completed by the end of last year.

A Reuters reporter at the scene in Aleppo saw more than a dozen empty buses entering Sheikh Maksoud on Friday morning. Government security sources said they were expected to carry Kurdish fighters towards eastern parts of Syria held by Kurdish forces.

Neighbouring Turkey views the SDF as a terrorist organisation linked to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), and has warned of military action if the group does not honour the integration agreement.

Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan, speaking on Wednesday before the ceasefire was announced, expressed hope that the situation in Aleppo would be normalized "through the withdrawal of SDF elements".

Kurdish fighters of the People's Protection Units (YPG) established autonomous rule across large areas of northern Syria after the eruption of the war in 2011, later becoming the spearhead of the U.S.-backed SDF.

YPG head of media relations Siamand Ali did not respond to a request for comment on the evacuation.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 11:21:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure

says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/women-bearing-brunt-sudans-acute-hunger-crisis-un-says-2026-01-09/</link><description>GENEVA, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Women are bearing the brunt of the humanitarian crisis in Sudan, with the majority of female-headed households not having enough food to eat, the U.N. said on Friday.

"Female-headed households are now three times more likely to be food insecure. Three quarters of these households report not having enough to eat," Jens Laerke, spokesperson for the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) told reporters in Geneva.

"Hunger is becoming increasingly gendered," he added, pointing to pre-existing gender inequalities in the country being exacerbated by the ongoing conflict, which entered its 1,000th day on Friday.

U.N. Women has previously warned that women face the risk of sexual violence while searching for food.

U.N. agencies called for immediate international action to provide aid to the Darfur city of al-Fashir, taken by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in late October, as well as to Kadugli, another besieged city in Sudan's south. Both cities are facing famine .

More than 100,000 are estimated to have fled al-Fashir since the RSF took control there following an 18-month siege.

OCHA said it is looking to make Sudan the first country to sign an agreement with the United States to receive part of the $2 billion in assistance it pledged at the end of December.

More than 21 million people are currently estimated to be acutely food insecure across the country. Some 34 million people are in need of humanitarian support, half of whom are children, according to the U.N.

OCHA said it did not yet have an update on further plans to visit al-Fashir, after international aid staff accessed the city for the first time in December since its takeover by the RSF.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 12:46:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/IDB5FJMPRVOVPIB4QC2HDICJYI.jpg?auth=5f3956719f3d849ecec40ac27a19c655789799b05cb5fcc205b198c76ec3f35b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Exclusive: Pakistan nears $1.5 billion deal to supply weapons, jets to Sudan, sources say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/pakistan-nears-15-billion-deal-supply-weapons-jets-sudan-sources-say-2026-01-09/</link><description>ISLAMABAD, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Pakistan is in the final phases of striking a $1.5-billion deal to supply weapons and jets to Sudan, a former top air force official and three sources said, promising a major boost for Sudan's army, battling the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces.

Their conflict has stoked the world's worst humanitarian crisis for more than 2-1/2 years, drawing in myriad foreign interests, and threatening to fragment the strategic Red Sea country, a major gold producer.

The deal with Pakistan encompasses 10 Karakoram-8 light attack aircraft, more than 200 drones for scouting and kamikaze attacks, and advanced air defence systems, said two of the three sources with knowledge of the matter, who all sought anonymity.

It was a "done deal", said Aamir Masood, a retired Pakistani air marshal who continues to be briefed on air force matters.

Besides the Karakoram-8 jets, it includes Super Mushshak training aircraft, and perhaps some coveted JF-17 fighters developed jointly with China and produced in Pakistan, he added, without giving figures or a delivery schedule.

Pakistan's military and its defence ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

A spokesman for Sudan’s army did not immediately respond to a message requesting comment.

Assistance from Pakistan, especially drones and jets, could help Sudan's army regain the air supremacy it had towards the start of its war with the RSF, which has increasingly used drones to gain territory, eroding the army's position.

Sudan's army accuses the RSF of being supplied by the United Arab Emirates, which has denied supplying weapons.

The sources did not say how the deal was being funded but Masood said it was possible the finances would come from Saudi Arabia.

"Saudi Arabia may favour and support all the favourable regimes in Gulf for procurement of Pakistani military equipment and training," he said.

One of the sources said the Saudis brokered the deal but added there was no indication they were paying for the weapons. Another source said Saudi was not providing funds.

Reuters has reported that Islamabad is in talks with Riyadh for a defence deal that could be worth between $2 billion and $4 billion.

Masood said the weapons for Sudan could be included in such an agreement, without confirming discussions with Saudi Arabia.

The Saudi government media office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the UAE are part of the U.S.-led quad grouping of nations that has tried to push Sudan's army and the RSF towards peace talks.

On recent visits, Sudan's army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan requested Saudi assistance in the war, according to Sudanese and Egyptian sources.

Riyadh and Abu Dhabi are embroiled in a major feud sparked by recent events in Yemen.

The two most powerful countries in the Gulf have sharp differences on a range of volatile Middle East issues, from geopolitics to oil output.

Their difference burst into the open with an advance of UAE-backed southern Yemeni separatists in early December that brought them into conflict with Saudi-backed forces.

The deal is another feather in the cap for Pakistan's growing defence sector, which has drawn growing interest and investment, particularly since its jets were deployed in a conflict with India last year.

Last month, Islamabad struck a weapons deal worth more than $4 billion with the Libyan National Army, officials said, for one of the South Asian nation's largest arms sales, which includes JF-17 fighter jets and training aircraft.

Pakistan has also held talks with Bangladesh on a defence deal that could includes the Super Mushshak training jets and JF-17s, as ties improve ties with Dhaka.

The government sees Pakistan's burgeoning industry as a catalyst to secure long-term economic stability.

Pakistan is now in a $7-billion IMF programme, following a short-term deal to avert a sovereign default in 2023. It won IMF support after Saudi Arabia and other Gulf allies provided financial and deposit rollovers.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 12:46:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ABJLGNM5GNN6NDP5QX5XK3JVOM.jpg?auth=18b1f46ea9dea8b6d1a7f0487fdd7d60c7b8d7771ba5988261690634a59b1859&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Meloni urges Europe to talk to Russia, sees no swift return to G8</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/meloni-urges-europe-talk-russia-sees-no-swift-return-g8-2026-01-09/</link><description>ROME, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Europe should reopen dialogue with Russia, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said on Friday, adding that it was far too soon to discuss welcoming Moscow back into the Group of Eight leading nations.

Meloni said she agreed with French President Emmanuel Macron, who recently called for Europe to engage with Moscow as efforts continue to end the war in Ukraine .

"I think Macron is right on this. I believe the time has come for Europe to also speak with Russia," she said at her traditional New Year's press conference.

"Because if Europe decides to take part in this phase of negotiations by talking only to one of the two sides, I fear that in the end the positive contribution it can make will be limited," she added.

Talks to bring the almost four-year war to an end have accelerated since November. However, Moscow has yet to signal willingness to make concessions after Kyiv pushed for changes to a U.S. proposal that initially backed Russia's main demands.

Moscow has also given no public sign that it would accept a peace deal with the security guarantees envisaged by Ukraine's allies, including having Western troops inside Ukraine.

Meloni said the European Union should appoint an envoy to deal directly with Russian President Vladimir Putin and avoid confusion.

"If we were to make the mistake of deciding, on the one hand, to reopen dialogue with Russia, and on the other, to proceed in a disorganised way, we would be doing Putin a favour," she said. "We have had this problem from the start. Too many voices speaking, too many formats," she added.

Among proposals put forward by the United States in November was for Russia to be readmitted to the Group of Seven wealthy nations club, reviving the now-defunct G8.

Meloni said it was "absolutely premature" to talk about welcoming Russia back into the G7 fold. She also reiterated that Italy had no intention of sending troops to Ukraine to help guarantee any peace deal.

France and Britain last month signed a declaration of intent on the future deployment of multinational forces into Ukraine once a ceasefire is reached.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 12:47:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/MKORPEJX7FI2NIPZ7RPML4RKCE.jpg?auth=595e881055cf371704687dd27d3b5da9daffd21e1915f2d655d959128ff9cad4&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Munich Security conference head defends inviting German far-right party</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/munich-security-conference-head-defends-inviting-german-far-right-party-2026-01-09/</link><description>BERLIN, Jan 9 (Reuters) - The head of the Munich Security Conference defended a decision to invite the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) to this year's meeting in February after repeated U.S accusations that European states and institutions were suppressing free speech .

The annual gathering of security experts and policymakers comes at a time of exceptional uncertainty for Europe, as its leaders struggle to adjust to the upending of decades of trans-Atlantic policy assumptions by U.S. President Donald Trump .

Wolfgang Ischinger, the former German diplomat who heads the conference, said including two or three foreign policy specialists from the AfD, which has not been invited for the past two years, would do no harm and would be "levelling the playing field".

"It will not allow the AfD to proclaim again that they're being victimised and that they are marginalised and excluded from German political life," he told Reuters in an interview in Berlin late on Thursday.

In a report last year, Germany's intelligence services classified the anti-immigration AfD, which polls indicate has the largest backing of any party in the country, as an " extremist" group .

But Ischinger said the broad support for the party, the main opposition group in Germany's parliament, made it difficult to explain to foreign attendees why it was not possible to meet its representatives at the conference.

He said he was critical of AfD foreign policy, which is opposed to Western military support for Ukraine .

"But maybe by attending some of these speeches in Munich, they'll have an educational experience," he said.

The AfD has been leveraging ties with Trump's MAGA - Make America Great Again - movement over the past year and poses a direct challenge to Chancellor Friedrich Merz's conservatives in a series of state elections in 2026.

Last year's conference was marked by U.S. Vice President JD Vance's attack on European leaders , whom he accused of censoring free speech and failing to control immigration.

The comments by Vance, who met AfD party leader Alice Weidel , were the first of a series of harsh criticisms of Europe by members of the Trump administration over the past year that have deeply unsettled Washington's allies.

European governments have agreed to U.S. demands for increased military spending and accepted the need to shoulder more responsibility for defence.

But open talk by U.S. officials of using military force to seize Greenland, an autonomous territory of NATO ally Denmark, has shocked European leaders .

Ischinger, who said it was not yet clear if Vance would be attending this year's gathering, said the conference existed to "deal with difficult transatlantic issues".

"So I would hope that if he comes, he would use the opportunity to explain current and future U.S. foreign policy decisions, some of which need a lot of explaining here in Europe," he said.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 12:47:22 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Musk's AI bot Grok limits image generation on X to paid users after backlash</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/musks-ai-bot-grok-limits-image-generation-x-paid-users-after-backlash-2026-01-09/</link><description>Jan 9 (Reuters) - Elon Musk's startup xAI has restricted the image generation function on its Grok chatbot on social media platform X to paid subscribers, after the tool's use of AI to create sexualized images sparked a widespread backlash.

The chatbot's image generation had allowed users on X to edit or create sexualized photos, which Reuters found was used to generate images of women and children in minimal clothing, often without the consent of the individuals depicted.

A torrent of semi-nude images on X led to European lawmakers urging legal action, with German media minister Wolfram Weimer describing them as the "industrialisation of sexual harassment" and the European Commission calling them illegal.

Grok told X users on Friday that image generation and editing features were now available only to paying subscribers.

The standalone Grok app, which operates separately from X, still allows users to generate images without a subscription.

A Reuters reporter asked Grok on X to convert a picture of himself into one wearing a bikini, echoing what has become a common request over the last week by users. The bot did not do so and posted in reply that the tool was only available to paying subscribers of the social media platform.

In what seemed to be an automated response, xAI replied to an emailed Reuters request for comment by saying "Legacy Media Lies". X did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The European Commission said on Monday such images circulating on X were unlawful and appalling, while Britain's data regulator said it had asked the platform to explain how it was complying with data protection laws following concerns that Grok was generating sexually abusive images of women.

Musk said last week that anyone using Grok to create illegal content would face the same consequences as uploading such material directly.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 12:47:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/VU3G4YSWZ5IXNEEIEXVW57Q4PY.jpg?auth=2447f678233cef3c084f4db8550947448bcf93a719c4d2a91806742d3df320ac&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Asylum applications drop to 40 year low in Sweden, government says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asylum-applications-drop-40-year-low-sweden-government-says-2026-01-09/</link><description>STOCKHOLM, Jan 9 (Reuters) - The number of people applying for asylum in Sweden dropped by 30% in 2025 to the lowest level since 1985, with the right-of-centre government saying it planned to further tighten rules this year ahead of an election in September.

The ruling minority coalition, which is supported by the anti-immigration Sweden Democrats, has made cutting the number of asylum seekers a key policy platform since taking power in 2022.

It blames a surge in gang crime on decades of loose asylum laws and failed integration measures under previous Social Democrat-led governments.

"The change isn't just about numbers in terms of lower immigration, it's also about the way that's made up, who is coming to Sweden with the proportion from asylum at a record low," Immigration Minister Johan Forssell told reporters.

The number of immigrants, excluding refugees from Ukraine, dropped to 79,684 last year from 82,857 in 2024, figures from the Migration Board showed. Asylum seekers and their family members made up just 6% of the total, compared to 31% in 2018 when total immigration was 133,000.

The number of people either returning voluntarily to another country or expelled by authorities was also up.

"This is an area which is a high priority for us," Forssell said.

The government has cracked down on asylum seekers, made it more difficult to gain residency and citizenship and introduced financial incentives for immigrants to leave the country since it came to power.

Forssell said the government planned to further tighten rules in the coming year including a new law to boost the number of returnees and tighter citizenship rules, among other things.

Swedes will vote in what is expected to be a tight general election in September.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 12:47:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/NE2OU6E4GVJGLNJ7OAEWPPSRUY.jpg?auth=d914c11eab4f5dbf0df0c84c63cf13a327740bd69c49c46a15327ce9b3a0b89b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Widespread power cuts, travel disrupted as Storm Goretti hammers northern Europe</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/widespread-power-cuts-travel-disrupted-storm-goretti-hammers-northern-europe-2026-01-09/</link><description>PARIS/LONDON/BERLIN, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Storm Goretti battered northern Europe on Friday, knocking out power to thousands of homes, shutting schools and suspending rail services in France, Britain and Germany as heavy snow and gale-force winds compounded a week of freezing weather.

Across northern Europe emergency services were left scrambling to deal with heavy snowfall and severe winds from Goretti, which slammed into Britain on Thursday before moving eastwards. In snowbound Germany, one official said it was one of the most severe weather events in the region in recent years.

The powerful storm left around 380,000 households without electricity in France, mainly in Normandy and Brittany, as it rolled into continental Europe.

Some 57,000 homes lost power across Scotland and parts of central England overnight according to the National Grid. In the Netherlands, flights were cancelled as heavy snowfall was set to return after a one-day reprieve.

Winds of more than 150 kph (93 mph) were recorded overnight in France’s northwestern Manche region, with a record 213 kph in Barfleur, forcing the SNCF rail operator to suspend services between Paris and Normandy.

French state-owned energy company EDF said that Storm Goretti had hit electricity production at the Flamanville nuclear plant, taking reactors 1 and 3 offline following the loss of a high-voltage line. The storm's strength, which tore off roofs and uprooted trees, was "exceptional", Manche prefect Marc Chappuis told BFM TV.

In central England, rail operators warned passengers not to travel and suspended some services as the storm moved through.

The disruption spread into northern Germany, where state-owned Deutsche Bahn halted long-distance train services until further notice, citing one of the most severe winter weather events in the region in many years.

"So far, we have been able to avoid situations where passengers are left stranded on the open track for long periods of time," a Deutsche Bahn spokesperson told a press conference at Berlin’s central station, adding that crews were working to clear the tracks quickly and safely.

At Hamburg Airport, northern Germany's busiest air terminal, about 40 flights were cancelled.

The Netherlands' KLM carrier said it had cancelled 80 flights to and from Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport scheduled for Friday. Schiphol had earlier this week cancelled hundreds of flights because of freezing weather.

In Hungary, the military was called out to assist motorists trapped in heavy snow.

Western Balkan countries have seen widespread disruption since Sunday. One person was found dead in Albania on Thursday, which has been hit by extensive flooding, while gale-force winds ripped roofs off buildings in northeastern Turkey.

Hundreds move in unison as Father Guilherme Peixoto looks out over the crowd - not from a pulpit, but from behind turntables.

Peixoto, who hails from Portugal, has played at some of the world's most famous clubs. Now he's touring Latin America, filling venues from Colombia to Mexico - home to the world's second-largest Catholic population.

Each time Peixoto, a career clergyman, steps onto the stage, the moment carries weight.

"It's a different energy and I think in our life the balance is very important," Peixoto said backstage at the downtown Monterrey venue, packed shoulder-to-shoulder with about 300 young revelers and a few priests there to enjoy his set.

"We have time for silence, time to listen to the voice of God ... and also time to share the message of God," he added.

Peixoto is touring Latin America while promoting his latest EP, Si Tuvieras Fe, released on Dec. 5. He has gained international recognition and built a global following as a DJ, particularly among young people in Latin America, where the Church's numbers have been in decline over the past decade.

That balance between "adrenaline" and "contemplation" remains central to how he views his dual roles. His electronic tracks - heavy beats layered with spiritual messages - include hits like "Lift up the fallen" and "Protegeme Senor".

His sets feature religious symbols glowing across the club, videos of the late Pope Francis and, in his Mexico shows, images of the revered Virgin of Guadalupe.

Peixoto's unlikely rise to fame began two decades ago, when he launched a "parish bar" in Portugal to help pay off church debts. As popularity for the events exploded, he enrolled in DJ classes.

For Peixoto, it has never been about breaking Church rules, but about building community. If his sold-out shows are an indication, the message has resonated.

"For me, there is always something special in electronic music. It's the respect, there is no judgment on the dance floor," Peixoto said. "As I always say, it's an amazing image for the world."

In Monterrey, Peixoto plays for a couple of hours, wrapping up around 2 a.m. The night continues, but Peixoto doesn't stay for the after party. Instead, bright and early the next morning, he stands beside Mexican Archbishop Rogelio Cabrera for mass at Monterrey's metropolitan cathedral, just three blocks from the venue of his show the night before.

Passing out the Eucharist in traditional robes, it would be hard to guess that Peixoto was behind the turntables just a few hours earlier.

"I know it is not normal for a priest to have this kind of opportunity," Peixoto said. "So it's gratitude and a responsibility to share something special."</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 12:47:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CODT5LEG55LMJCXRB3CUFMOEQ4.jpg?auth=cc15bad80874196a4343b662bec6e6bcfe72af009b7f4da085d085071de58c02&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Hamburg trial tests German law after US child’s suicide linked to murder charge</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/hamburg-trial-tests-german-law-after-us-childs-suicide-linked-murder-charge-2026-01-09/</link><description /><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 12:48:31 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Munich Security conference head defends inviting German far-right party</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/munich-security-conference-head-defends-inviting-german-far-right-party-2026-01-09/</link><description>BERLIN, Jan 9 (Reuters) - The head of the Munich Security Conference defended a decision to invite the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) to this year's meeting in February after repeated U.S accusations that European states and institutions were suppressing free speech .

The Netherlands' KLM carrier said it had cancelled 80 flights to and from Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport scheduled for Friday. Schiphol had earlier this week cancelled hundreds of flights because of freezing weather.

In Hungary, the military was called out to assist motorists trapped in heavy snow.

Western Balkan countries have seen widespread disruption since Sunday. One person was found dead in Albania on Thursday, which has been hit by extensive flooding, while gale-force winds ripped roofs off buildings in northeastern Turkey.

Hundreds move in unison as Father Guilherme Peixoto looks out over the crowd - not from a pulpit, but from behind turntables.

Peixoto, who hails from Portugal, has played at some of the world's most famous clubs. Now he's touring Latin America, filling venues from Colombia to Mexico - home to the world's second-largest Catholic population.

Each time Peixoto, a career clergyman, steps onto the stage, the moment carries weight.

"It's a different energy and I think in our life the balance is very important," Peixoto said backstage at the downtown Monterrey venue, packed shoulder-to-shoulder with about 300 young revelers and a few priests there to enjoy his set.

"We have time for silence, time to listen to the voice of God ... and also time to share the message of God," he added.

Peixoto is touring Latin America while promoting his latest EP, Si Tuvieras Fe, released on Dec. 5. He has gained international recognition and built a global following as a DJ, particularly among young people in Latin America, where the Church's numbers have been in decline over the past decade.

That balance between "adrenaline" and "contemplation" remains central to how he views his dual roles. His electronic tracks - heavy beats layered with spiritual messages - include hits like "Lift up the fallen" and "Protegeme Senor".

His sets feature religious symbols glowing across the club, videos of the late Pope Francis and, in his Mexico shows, images of the revered Virgin of Guadalupe.

Peixoto's unlikely rise to fame began two decades ago, when he launched a "parish bar" in Portugal to help pay off church debts. As popularity for the events exploded, he enrolled in DJ classes.

For Peixoto, it has never been about breaking Church rules, but about building community. If his sold-out shows are an indication, the message has resonated.

"For me, there is always something special in electronic music. It's the respect, there is no judgment on the dance floor," Peixoto said. "As I always say, it's an amazing image for the world."

In Monterrey, Peixoto plays for a couple of hours, wrapping up around 2 a.m. The night continues, but Peixoto doesn't stay for the after party. Instead, bright and early the next morning, he stands beside Mexican Archbishop Rogelio Cabrera for mass at Monterrey's metropolitan cathedral, just three blocks from the venue of his show the night before.

Passing out the Eucharist in traditional robes, it would be hard to guess that Peixoto was behind the turntables just a few hours earlier.

"I know it is not normal for a priest to have this kind of opportunity," Peixoto said. "So it's gratitude and a responsibility to share something special."</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 12:49:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CODT5LEG55LMJCXRB3CUFMOEQ4.jpg?auth=cc15bad80874196a4343b662bec6e6bcfe72af009b7f4da085d085071de58c02&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Hamburg trial tests German law after US child’s suicide linked to murder charge</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/hamburg-trial-tests-german-law-after-us-childs-suicide-linked-murder-charge-2026-01-09/</link><description>HAMBURG, Jan 9 (Reuters) - The trial of a 21-year-old man accused of forcing children and teenagers to self-harm and commit sexual acts online, leading to a 13-year-old boy taking his own life in the United States, began behind closed doors in Hamburg on Friday.

The trial - which is being held in private due to the age and vulnerability of the victims - marks a precedent in Germany as the first time someone has gone on trial for murder in a suicide that occurred in a different jurisdiction.

The defendant, who allegedly used the online pseudonym "White Tiger," faces charges including one count of murder and five counts of attempted murder, according to the prosecution.

The defendant is accused of 204 offences committed between January 2021 and September 2023 against more than 30 victims.

The trial is scheduled to run until December, with 82 hearings planned. No verdict is expected this year.

If found guilty, the defendant can only be sentenced to between 6 months and 10 years in prison due to the fact that he was a minor at the time the crimes were committed, Judge Marayke Frantzen said shortly before the trial started on Friday.

A murder usually carries a 15-year sentence in Germany.

Also speaking ahead of the trial, defence lawyer Christiane Yueksel said that the fact that her client was being accused of indirectly committing a murder and other crimes "is a construct that is factually incorrect and cannot be proven."

Authorities allege the defendant led a group of cybercriminals named "764" that targeted children aged 11 to 15 across Germany, Canada, Finland and the United States, coercing them to self-harm and recording the acts for blackmail.

Prosecutors say the accused made particularly vulnerable children emotionally dependent on him via social media, exploiting this trust to produce child sexual abuse material and escalate the level of harm.

The case was launched after a tip-off from the FBI, which was investigating the death by suicide of the teenage boy in the United States.

Hamburg police arrested the suspect in his parents' home last summer.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 12:49:54 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4PHPMXWHTJMFNDJFQ5UUPSRWCU.jpg?auth=dd2acc340696759d41246ccbbf0d29f43c813ee7d1e61791f0ef9ca8c397e16f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'Forgotten' French farmers seek justice as they mobilise for fair trade, ecology and local produce</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/forgotten-french-farmers-seek-justice-as-they-mobilise-for-fair-trade-ecology-and-local-produce</link><description /><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 12:51:17 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/94a4f784-ed56-11f0-b5e5-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260109-081209-082005-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US in process of seizing Olina tanker in the Caribbean, US official says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/us-process-seizing-olina-tanker-caribbean-us-official-says-2026-01-09/</link><description>WASHINGTON/SINGAPORE, Jan 9 (Reuters) - The U.S. is in the process of seizing the Olina tanker in the Caribbean near Trinidad in the fifth such interdiction of ships in recent weeks as part of Washington's efforts to control Venezuelan oil exports, two U.S. officials said on Friday.

The Olina, which according to public shipping database Equasis was falsely flying the flag of Timor Leste, had previously sailed from Venezuela and had returned to the region, said an industry source with direct knowledge of the matter.

"The vessel’s AIS (location) tracker was last active 52 days ago in the Venezuelan EEZ, northeast of Curacao," British maritime risk management company Vanguard said separately.

"The seizure follows a prolonged pursuit of tankers linked to sanctioned Venezuelan oil shipments in the region."

The Olina left Venezuela last week fully loaded with oil as part of a flotilla shortly after the U.S. seized Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on January 3, and the vessel was returning fully loaded to Venezuela following the U.S. blockade of Venezuelan oil exports, the industry source said.

The U.S. imposed sanctions on the tanker in January last year, when it was named the Minerva M , opens new tab , for what Washington said was it being part of the so-called shadow fleet of ships that sail with little regulation or known insurance.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 13:38:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Elon Musk's Grok faces global scrutiny for sexualised AI photos</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/elon-musks-grok-faces-global-scrutiny-sexualised-ai-photos-2026-01-09/</link><description>Jan 9 (Reuters) - Governments and regulators from Europe to Asia have condemned and some have opened inquiries into sexually explicit content generated by Elon Musk's xAI chatbot Grok on X, putting pressure on the platform to show what it is doing to prevent and remove illegal content.

Grok said late on Thursday it was restricting image generation and editing to paying subscribers after it said on January 2 that it was fixing safeguard lapses after isolated cases in which it produced sexualised outputs, including depictions of minors in minimal clothing.

Musk said earlier on X that anyone using Grok to make illegal content would suffer the same consequences as if they uploaded illegal content.

Here are some reactions from governments and regulators around the world.

The European Commission extended on Thursday a retention order sent to X last year to retain and preserve all internal documents and data related to Grok until the end of 2026, amid concern over Grok-generated sexualised "undressed" images.

Britain's communications regulator Ofcom said on Monday it had made "urgent contact" with X and xAI and would make a swift assessment of whether the service was meeting its legal duties to protect users under the UK's Online Safety Act framework.

In France, government ministers said on January 2 they had referred sexually explicit Grok-generated content circulating on X to prosecutors and also alerted French media regulator Arcom to check the platform's compliance with the European Union's Digital Services Act.

Germany's media minister Wolfram Weimer called on the European Commission on Tuesday to take legal steps, saying EU rules provided tools to tackle illegal content and alleging the problem risked turning into the "industrialisation of sexual harassment".

Italy's data protection authority warned on Thursday that using AI tools to create "undressed" deepfake imagery of real people without consent could amount to serious privacy violations and, in some cases, criminal offences.

Swedish political leaders condemned on Thursday Grok-generated sexualised "undressing" content after reporting that imagery involving Sweden's deputy prime minister was produced from a user prompt.

India's IT Ministry on January 2 sent X a formal notice over alleged Grok-enabled creation or sharing of obscene sexualised images, directing the content to be taken down and requiring a report on the actions being taken within 72 hours.

Malaysia's communications regulator MCMC said on January 3 it would summon X and open an investigation into alleged misuse of Grok to generate obscene or sexualised "undressing" content, warning it may involve offences under Section 233 of Malaysia's Communications and Multimedia Act 1998.

Australia's online-safety regulator eSafety said on Wednesday it was investigating Grok-generated "digitally undressed" sexualised deepfake images, assessing adult material under its image‑based abuse scheme and noting current child-related examples it had reviewed did not meet the legal threshold for child sexual abuse material under Australian law.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 13:38:43 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7TM34MIBINK4BLYDPHULU7PGUU.jpg?auth=4a028aeccb173b6b42f87bd4dbb434f8e959ad7c0179cecd0f9f3a8c1a01c7b2&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Six on trial in UK charged with membership of banned PKK</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/six-trial-uk-charged-with-membership-banned-pkk-2026-01-09/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Six Kurdish people went on trial in Britain on Friday charged with membership of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a militant group banned in its home country Turkey as well as Britain and elsewhere.

Prosecutors say the defendants, aged between 24 and 63, belonged to or professed to belong to the PKK, which was proscribed as a terrorist organisation in Britain in 2001.

They were charged in December 2024 after a police raid on a Kurdish Community Centre in north London the previous month, with some of the defendants also charged with arranging or addressing meetings in support of the PKK in 2023 and 2024.

The PKK announced last year that it would disarm and disband, and symbolically burned weapons, but it remains widely banned, including in the European Union and the United States.

Ercan Akbal, 57, Ali Boyraz, 63, Agit Karatas, 24, Berfin Kerban, 32, Turkan Ozcan, 60, and Mazlum Sayak, 28, have all pleaded not guilty to membership of a proscribed organisation.

Akbal also denies two counts of arranging a meeting in support of the PKK and two counts of addressing a meeting to encourage support for the PKK.

Ozcan and Sayak deny two counts of arranging a meeting in support of the PKK, and Boyraz and Karatas deny one count of addressing a meeting to encourage support for the PKK.

The PKK fought for four decades for independence or autonomy for Turkey's mainly Kurdish southeast.

"There is nothing wrong with the Kurds wanting self-determination or people campaigning for it ... but it is the means that the PKK used that caused them to be proscribed," Larkin said.

The trial is due to take up to three months.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 13:38:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/Z3ODXBKUNNO67FPJ7I2AH3N7G4.jpg?auth=d4f4d59a21c90384971af5bca51c231e2e912a40cfcd207c8c072fba05ebc17f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'Iranians seek downfall of regime and a new system that respects dignity, freedom, and human rights'</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/iranians-seek-downfall-of-regime-and-a-new-system-that-respects-dignity-freedom-and-human-rights</link><description /><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 13:39:08 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/c04e3d72-ed5c-11f0-9d21-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260109-130054-130933-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US quits global organisation dedicated to preventing violent extremism</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/us-quits-global-organisation-dedicated-preventing-violent-extremism-2026-01-09/</link><description>GENEVA, Jan 9 (Reuters) - A global organisation dedicated to preventing violent extremism said on Friday the U.S. had made a mistake in withdrawing its support while the risk of militant attacks surges in the Middle East and Africa's Sahel.

The Global Community Engagement and Resilience Fund, which supports prevention programmes across dozens of countries with communities vulnerable to extremism - appeared on Wednesday in a White House memo announcing a U.S. pullout from 35 international agencies and 31 U.N. entities it said rejected U.S. interests.

Dr. Khalid Koser, head of the Geneva-based GCERF, said the decision came as a surprise and without explanation and that it reflected a deeper ideological shift under U.S. President Donald Trump's administration away from multilateral prevention programmes toward security-focused counterterrorism measures.

"I think it's a mistake to take out that fundamental piece of prevention. But I don't think this administration believes in prevention," Koser told Reuters.

The White House did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Koser said risks of extremist violence were higher than at any point since the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings, citing as examples Afghanistan, the Sahel and camps in northeast Syria that hold tens of thousands of Islamic State family members - and a new generation at risk of radicalisation after the Gaza war. , opens new tab

"If you don't work on prevention, then in 10 years time, you're going to have lots of terrorists and lots of problems."

Further underlining a U.S. repudiation of multilateral cooperation bodies under Trump's "America First" policy, the White House also announced it was quitting the 30-nation Global Counterterrorism Forum.

The U.S. helped establish GCERF's programme in northeast Syria that helps reintegrate families from former Islamic State militant circles. Koser said that while GCERF's work would go on, it was losing a major player in the U.S., and that Washington's decision was perplexing given GCERF's agenda remained relevant to U.S. national interests.

With other international agencies scaling back following mass U.S. foreign aid cuts last year, GCERF said it now carries much of the global prevention burden alone, and that its $50 million annual budget had not risen to fill the growing gaps.

The 2025 Global Terrorism Index issued by the Institute for Economics and Peace showed the number of countries recording a terrorist attack increased from 58 to 66 in 2024, reversing nearly a decade of improvements.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 14:26:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/XZ3U2V6GOJN67ILNKES5QXPNUE.jpg?auth=d1e0a8a706f4e0b58f85ca21c94db4dc927454b4cf40e0bfa7c69e4b7f9f96f7&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Putin sends warning to Ukraine and West with weapon not used since 2024</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/putin-sends-warning-ukraine-west-with-weapon-not-used-since-2024-2026-01-09/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 9 (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin's launch of an Oreshnik hypersonic missile appears aimed at intimidating Ukraine and sending a signal of Russian military might to Europe and the United States at a crucial juncture in talks to end the war .

Putin has repeatedly boasted of the speed and destructive power of the Oreshnik, which Russia first fired at Ukraine in November 2024. Since then, it has kept the weapon in reserve.

The overnight Oreshnik strike in western Ukraine came after a week of setbacks for Russia. On Saturday, President Donald Trump sent U.S. special forces to capture Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro , a close Putin ally, and on Wednesday U.S. forces seized a Russian-flagged oil tanker in the north Atlantic.

On Tuesday, Britain and France announced plans to deploy troops in Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire - prompting Moscow to respond that it would view foreign soldiers as legitimate combat targets .

Gerhard Mangott, a Russia specialist at the University of Innsbruck in Austria, said Moscow was frustrated at being sidelined during weeks of diplomacy between the U.S., Ukraine and the Europeans, and "particularly mad" about the planned potential troop deployment by Kyiv's European allies. The use of the Oreshnik should be seen in that context, he said.

"It's a signal to the United States and the Europeans about the military capabilities of the Russian army," Mangott said in a telephone interview.

He said Moscow wanted to convey that "Russia is to be taken seriously, given its military arsenal, and that the Europeans and Trump should return to a minimum of respect for the Russian position in the negotiations."

The Oreshnik is capable of carrying nuclear as well as conventional warheads, although there was no suggestion of any nuclear component to the latest attack.

A senior Ukrainian official told Reuters that the missile struck a state enterprise in the western city of Lviv and was likely carrying inert or "dummy" warheads - as in 2024, when Russia first fired it to test the weapon in war.

"It does appear that at this point Russia is using Oreshnik for signaling purposes, so the destruction is not necessarily the goal," Pavel Podvig, director of the Russian Nuclear Forces Project, told Reuters when asked if the use of dummy warheads would diminish the capacity of Moscow's action to intimidate Ukraine and its allies.

"It's probably a general signal of resolve to escalate. My guess is that it will be read this way by the West," he said.

Western reaction to the attack, around 60 km (40 miles) from Ukraine's border with NATO member Poland, was swift. The leaders of Britain, France and Germany called it "escalatory and unacceptable". European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said it was "a clear escalation against Ukraine and meant as a warning to Europe and to the U.S.".

Russia specialist Mangott was sceptical about the official statement from Russia's Defence Ministry that the Oreshnik launch was in response to an alleged Ukraine drone strike targeting one of Putin's residences, in the northern region of Novgorod, late last month. Ukraine has denied any such attack took place, accusing Moscow of lying about it in order to derail peace talks.

Several high-profile Russian war bloggers also criticised the official framing of the strike as a revenge attack. One, Yuri Baranchik, suggested it would have "looked more convincing" if Moscow had fired the missile at President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's bunker in Kyiv.

Mick Ryan, an Australian military expert, linked the weapon's use to Russia's recent setbacks, especially over Venezuela.

He said the point was "to demonstrate that Russia remains a nuclear-armed world power. In this guise, it is a psychological weapon – an instrument of Putin’s cognitive war against Ukraine and the West – rather than a weapon of mass physical destruction."

Russian arch-hawk Dmitry Medvedev, a former president who is now deputy chairman of Putin's Security Council, alluded in a social media post to the capture of Maduro, the oil tanker seizure by the U.S. and the possibility of further U.S. sanctions against Russia, which he said had made for a "stormy" start to the year.

In comments highly critical of Washington, he said international relations had descended into a madhouse and compared the Oreshnik strike to "a life-saving injection of haloperidol", an anti-psychotic drug.

Prominent Russian war blogger Fighterbomber, a former military serviceman, said he thought the use of the Oreshnik was a display of power to convey a message and that Moscow would not be resorting to it often.

He noted that some Oreshnik systems had been transferred to Belarus and that Russia would have some of its own in reserve, but suggested that there was not an endless supply of the relatively new missile.

"Taking all these constants into account, we can assume that we can afford to conduct such demonstrations two or three times a year," he wrote.

He expressed hope that no further launches would be needed for now, concluding: "The signals have been sent and they have been heard."</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 14:51:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/IDEYMVO7JBON5DDXHVRF55KX2M.jpg?auth=e4b9a97aa2661895fc7fd373ff5a98d98df72ede7ed9e1ab8c42f7f859715ced&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Warsaw summons Hungarian envoy to protest after Budapest grants two Poles asylum</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/warsaw-summons-hungarian-envoy-protest-after-budapest-grants-two-poles-asylum-2026-01-09/</link><description>WARSAW, Jan 9 (Reuters) - The Polish Foreign Ministry has summoned the Hungarian ambassador after Budapest granted asylum to two as-yet-unidentified Polish citizens, a spokesperson said on Friday, as relations deteriorate between countries once seen as allies.

News website VSquare reported on Thursday that Budapest's delegation in Brussels had sent a letter to other countries' representatives saying it had granted asylum to two Polish citizens. The letter, which was subsequently published in Polish media, did not identify the two Poles or explain why they were given asylum.

Polish Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maciej Wewior said Warsaw would notify the ambassador of its "objection to this decision". The Hungarian government did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

In 2024, Hungary angered Poland by giving asylum to Marcin Romanowski, a former deputy justice minister from Poland's nationalist Law and Justice Party (PiS) government, which lost power in 2023. Polish prosecutors accuse Romanowski of misusing public funds, which he denies.

In November, former Polish justice minister Zbigniew Ziobro , a key PiS figure, chose to remain in Budapest after Poland's parliament voted to strip him of immunity so he could face charges relating to misuse of public funds. Polish media have speculated that Ziobro too could seek asylum in Hungary.

Hungary's self-styled "illiberal" Prime Minister Viktor Orban was an ally of Poland's government when the PiS was in power, although Orban's decision to maintain warm ties with Moscow after the Russian invasion of Ukraine strained relations with Warsaw even before PiS left office.

Since a pro-European coalition led by centrist Prime Minister Donald Tusk came to office in Poland in 2023, tensions have grown further. Tusk's government has vowed to hold PiS figures accused of wrongdoing to account. Budapest says Warsaw is persecuting political opponents.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 14:51:56 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>EU grants Syria $722 million for recovery, humanitarian aid, von der Leyen says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/eu-grants-syria-722-million-recovery-humanitarian-aid-von-der-leyen-says-2026-01-09/</link><description>BRUSSELS, Jan 9 (Reuters) - The European Union will grant Syria around 620 million euros ($722 million) this year and next for post-war recovery, bilateral support and humanitarian aid, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Friday.

"After years of devastation under the Assad regime, Syria's recovery and reconstruction needs are immense, and I just could see (it) by my own eyes," she said during a visit to the Syrian capital Damascus.

Von der Leyen said the EU wants to start talks on reviving a cooperation accord with Syria and that it will launch a new political partnership with the country, including high-level talks in the first half of 2026.

Last year, the EU lifted economic sanctions on Syria after rebels toppled longtime autocratic President Bashar al-Assad following over a decade of civil war.

Von der Leyen said the recent escalating violence in the northern Syrian city of Aleppo between government forces and Kurdish fighters this week was "worrisome", and that continued dialogue between all parties was "urgently needed".

Prime Minister Rosen Zhelyakov's coalition government, backed by GERB-SDS, resigned last month after weeks of street protests against state corruption and a new budget that would have hiked social security contributions and some taxes.

The resignation came shortly before Bulgaria joined the euro zone on January 1.

President Rumen Radev said in a statement he would hand the mandate on Monday to GERB-SDS, the largest parliamentary group, but it has only 66 seats in the 240-member parliament and seems unlikely to garner enough backing to form a new government.

Under Bulgaria's constitution, Radev would then hand the mandate to the second-largest party and then to the third-largest. If no grouping can build a parliamentary majority, a snap parliamentary election follows.

The GERB-SDS coalition came first in the last election, held in October 2024, though it only took power in January 2025 after months of negotiations and required the support of other parties in the divided legislature.

Bulgaria, the poorest member of the European Union, sorely needs political stability to speed up the uptake of EU funds into its creaking infrastructure, to encourage foreign investment and to root out endemic state corruption.

The move would allow Takaichi, Japan's first female prime minister , to take advantage of the strong approval ratings she has enjoyed since taking office in October. Her tough stance on China has appealed to right-wing voters but has sparked a major diplomatic dispute with Japan's powerful Asian neighbour.

Both February 8 and February 15 are being considered as election dates, the Yomiuri said.

Takaichi's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is in coalition with the right-wing Ishin party. Their coalition is a few seats short of a majority in the lower house.

The dollar rose against the yen following the report.

Takaichi touched off the biggest dispute with China in more than a decade late last year by remarking that a Chinese attack on Taiwan could represent an existential threat to Japan. China claims the democratically ruled island as part of its territory, an assertion Taipei rejects.

Since then, China has urged its citizens not to travel to Japan, cancelled meetings and events and banned exports of dual-use items for Japan’s military, among other measures.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 15:27:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WLXYX4GIXRIXRH3JFSWRIBGVCA.jpg?auth=19d2dbf0f35481b624dcae5d2c3088751618c1902d1118c7fa7fd509f3a580cc&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Bulgaria’s president to hand centre-right coalition mandate to form government</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/bulgarias-president-hand-centre-right-coalition-mandate-form-government-2026-01-09/</link><description /><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 15:27:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Japan PM Takaichi considering snap election in February, Yomiuri newspaper says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/japan-pm-takaichi-considering-snap-election-february-yomiuri-newspaper-says-2026-01-09/</link><description /><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 15:27:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Switzerland holds minute of silence for Crans-Montana fire disaster victims</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/switzerland-holds-minute-of-silence-for-crans-montana-fire-disaster-victims</link><description /><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 15:28:16 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/f184af5a-ed5e-11f0-a22f-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260109-134421-134645-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Spanish citizens released from Venezuela prison arrive in Madrid</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/spanish-citizens-released-venezuela-prison-arrive-madrid-2026-01-09/</link><description>MADRID, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Four Spanish nationals and a prominent Venezuelan-Spanish rights activist arrived in Madrid on Friday a day after they were released from prison in Venezuela in the aftermath of the U.S. capture of President Nicolas Maduro.

U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday Venezuela was freeing a large number of political prisoners as a sign of "seeking peace" - though rights groups there say there have not been any large-scale releases so far.

The five had been reunited with friends and family, Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares said.

"Today is a happy day," the minister wrote on X. "I hope to see them soon and wish them a swift return to normal life."

San Miguel, who was detained in February 2024 at Maiquetia International Airport near Caracas, is a lawyer and expert on security and Venezuela's military.

Two of the others - Andres Martínez Adasme and Jose María Basoa, both from the Basque Country - were detained in September 2024 accused of being members of Spanish intelligence plotting to kill Maduro, a claim the Spanish government has repeatedly denied.

The other freed were named as Ernesto Gorbe and Miguel Moreno.

January 9 marks the date in 1992 when Bosnian Serbs declared independence as then-federal Yugoslavia broke up, triggering a 3-1/2-year war in which 100,000 people were killed and two million made homeless, most of them Muslim Bosniaks.

About 2,000 police officers, wartime veterans and civilians took part in a parade of special forces and armoured vehicles in the streets of the Bosnian Serbs' de facto capital Banja Luka. Only a few hundred supporters turned out to watch in the freezing temperatures.

"They cannot ban this," said Sladjana Bobic, a Banja Luka resident. "This just has to happen."

Dodik's Serb Republic and the Bosniak-Croat Federation, linked via a weak central government, comprise the largely decentralised Bosnia which emerged from that conflict under the U.S.-brokered 1995 Dayton peace accords.

Bosnia's Constitutional Court has twice ruled that the statehood day, which coincides with Serbian Orthodox Christian celebrations of Christmas, is illegal as it discriminates against the region's Catholic Croats and Muslim Bosniaks.

"Do they really think that we will obey them? Do they think that we are afraid? History does not belong to those who fear," Dodik said at a gathering in Banja Luka on Thursday.

Dodik was removed as the region's president for violating the rulings of the Constitutional Court and the international peace envoy for Bosnia.

But despite scrapping a series of separatist laws under Western pressure, Dodik has continued to advocate the Serb Republic's secession from Bosnia.

"When we depart, we will take 49% of Bosnia with us," he said.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 16:30:26 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/SR5Z3O4UXFOLNJWZISMZ2PIH6Q.jpg?auth=8d530f07af0001c57174a62c1864672128b56fffc59687c19184cffa636e1e68&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Dutch parties aiming for rare minority coalition government</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/dutch-parties-aim-form-minority-government-nos-reports-2026-01-09/</link><description>AMSTERDAM, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Government formation talks in the Netherlands will be aimed at forming a rare minority cabinet, leaders of the three prospective coalition parties said on Friday.

Negotiations are set to continue between the centrist, pro-EU D66 party, which won the election last October, the conservative Christian Democrats and the right-wing VVD.

This coalition would hold 66 seats in the 150-seat lower house of parliament, and would have to seek support on a case-by-case basis from other parties for its policies.

The Netherlands is usually led by majority coalitions, but the heavily fractured political landscape has made it increasingly difficult to assemble one.

After the October election, all major mainstream parties ruled out governing with anti-Muslim populist Geert Wilders after he brought down the last government, led by his PVV.

The VVD ruled out working with the left-wing Green/Labour combination, whose inclusion was the only option for a solid majority.

D66, for its part, objected to including the Eurosceptic, conservative JA21, which could have brought up the seat total to 75.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 16:30:31 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4T2N2TDH2FNJ3MHOOUV6L7MWI4.jpg?auth=8d74485ab4bd2fc4a0e812fc14a244ec49c19af795104c951124568e354cb2af&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Poland worried about tensions in NATO over Greenland, says Tusk</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/poland-worried-about-tensions-nato-over-greenland-says-tusk-2026-01-09/</link><description>WARSAW, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Poland's prime minister is worried about the strain the United States' threat to take over Greenland is putting on NATO, he said on Friday, adding that as a loyal ally Warsaw should be honest with Washington about its concerns.

Poland views the United States and NATO as crucial to its security in the face of an increasingly assertive Russia, and policymakers in Warsaw fear divisions in the alliance could embolden Moscow.

A U.S. military seizure of Greenland from a longtime ally, Denmark, would send shockwaves through the NATO alliance and deepen the divide between Trump and European leaders.

"I'm very concerned about the Greenland issue, and I'm also very concerned about events in the United States, and everything that's building such ideological and political tension within NATO and the United States itself," Tusk told a press conference.

"But because we're allies, friends, and Poland is an exceptionally loyal ally of the United States, I also believe that when you're in such a position, you don't do anything on your knees; you just say what you think. Among friends, you should speak honestly about what's right and what's wrong."</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 16:30:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/JILINH2B75PVTKYYGWDHVLTH4A.jpg?auth=6cda89ecdaff085474d8db7b38549a94437d9524a30128ba24f57b4d7f0fedf2&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Dutch parties aiming for rare minority coalition government</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/dutch-parties-aim-form-minority-government-nos-reports-2026-01-09/</link><description /><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 16:31:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Poland worried about tensions in NATO over Greenland, says Tusk</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/poland-worried-about-tensions-nato-over-greenland-says-tusk-2026-01-09/</link><description /><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 16:31:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Switzerland holds memorial service during day of national mourning</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/switzerland-holds-memorial-service-during-day-of-national-mourning</link><description /><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 16:31:42 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/69e2f4c8-ed70-11f0-90f3-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260109-140001-153258-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russian drone strikes hit two foreign vessels in Odesa region, Kyiv says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/russian-drone-strikes-hit-two-foreign-vessels-odesa-region-kyiv-says-2026-01-09/</link><description>KYIV, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Russia has attacked two foreign-flagged civilian vessels with drones in the southern Odesa region, killing a Syrian national and injuring another, Ukrainian officials said on Friday.

Moscow has stepped up attacks on Ukraine's maritime export arteries over the last two months as retaliation for attacks on "shadow fleet" tankers heading to Russia to export its oil.

Deputy Prime Minister Oleksiy Kuleba said in a statement that one ship had been sailing along Ukraine's maritime export corridor to pick up a grain cargo at the port of Chornomorsk, and was under the flag of Saint Kitts and Nevis.

The other, near the Odesa port, was under the flag of the Comoros Islands and was carrying soybeans.

The deep-water seaports in Odesa region are crucial for Ukraine's commodity-heavy economy to export its products.

"This is yet another indication that Russia is deliberately targeting civilian objects, international shipping and food logistics," Kuleba wrote.

He posted images that showed ships bearing the names Ladonna and Wael K on their hulls.

According to MarineTraffic, a ship tracking website, the Ladonna is a 157-metre Comoros-flagged bulk carrier and the Wael K is a 115-metre general cargo ship.

Ukraine's seaport authority told Reuters on Wednesday that the number of Russian attacks on ports in the Odesa region had almost tripled from the previous year to 96 in 2025.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 16:58:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Mercosur bloc to sign EU trade deal on January 17</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/mercosur-bloc-sign-eu-trade-deal-january-17-2026-01-09/</link><description>BUENOS AIRES, Jan 9 (Reuters) - The Mercosur bloc will sign its long-delayed trade agreement with the European Union on January 17, Argentina’s foreign ministry said Friday, marking a breakthrough after years of negotiations.

Frey, a Democrat, accused the Republican Trump administration of trying to predetermine the investigation's outcome after the state's lead investigative agency, the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, said the FBI had reversed its initial cooperation and blocked the BCA's access to scene evidence, witness interviews and other material.

"This is a time to follow the law," Frey said. "This is not a time to hide from the facts." He added that despite the lack of aid from federal authorities, state or local prosecutions of the officer were still "potential."

Kristi Noem, the Homeland Security secretary, said on Thursday that Minnesota authorities had no "jurisdiction" over the investigation.

Frey's comments underscored the extent to which President Donald Trump 's immigration crackdown in mostly Democratic-run cities - despite the opposition of their mayors - has severely frayed the trust between local and federal officials.

Trump administration officials have defended Wednesday's shooting as self-defense and accused the woman, Renee Good , a U.S. citizen and mother of three, of deliberately aiming her car at the officer in an act of "domestic terrorism" - a narrative belied by video evidence and described by Frey as "garbage."

In Portland, Oregon, on Thursday afternoon, a U.S. Border Patrol agent shot and wounded a man and woman in their car after an attempted vehicle stop. As in Minnesota, the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that the driver "weaponized" the car in an effort to run over the agent, who fired in self-defense.

Portland Mayor Keith Wilson, echoing Frey, said he could not be sure the government's account was grounded in fact until an independent investigation took place.

"There was a time when we could take them at their word," Wilson, a Democrat, said of federal officials. "That time is long past."

Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield told CNN on Friday morning that there is cooperation between federal and state investigators so far but that it was too early to draw any conclusions.

In both cases, Democratic mayors and governors have called on the Trump administration to pull federal officers out, arguing that their presence is sowing chaos and needlessly creating tensions on the streets.

The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer who shot Good was one of more than 2,000 federal personnel whom the Trump administration has ordered deployed to Minneapolis in what DHS described as the "largest operation" in its history.

He was identified as Jonathan Ross, based on comments by federal officials that the officer had previously been dragged by a migrant's car during an attempted arrest last summer, suffering serious lacerations. The details matched those reflected in the court records of a case in Bloomington, Minnesota, in June 2025, in which a man was eventually convicted of assaulting Ross.

DHS has declined to confirm the officer's name.

Bystander videos of the shooting appear to show Good turning her wheels away from the officer as she drives forward, while he fires three shots while jumping backward from the front of the car. The final two shots appear to be aimed through the driver's side window, after the car's front bumper has already passed by the officer's legs.

Since the killing, Trump administration officials have doubled down on the government's version of events. Trump said on social media that the car "ran over" the officer, while Vice President JD Vance on Thursday accused Good of "attacking" agents and praised the officer for his actions.

The two shootings have drawn thousands of protesters in Minneapolis, Portland and other U.S. cities. In Minnesota, Democratic Governor Tim Walz has put the state's National Guard on alert.

While the Minnesota operation is part of Trump's broader immigration crackdown, the president has for months aimed political attacks at the state, particularly its large Somali-American community.

Trump has called Somali immigrants "garbage ," railed against a sprawling welfare-fraud scandal and ridiculed Walz, the Democratic vice presidential nominee in 2024. Walz announced earlier this week that he would not run for a third term, citing the time necessary to address the fraud scandal.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 17:27:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4EHDFYRZSFPR5LJYS2F5MSTOGA.jpg?auth=ca9b6b78646474f0e8fe6bec3b0886e94c28e1827b20f9483261ba08dc89e227&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Mexico's Sheinbaum urges closer US coordination after Trump threatens land attacks on cartels</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/mexicos-sheinbaum-urges-closer-us-coordination-after-trump-threatens-land-2026-01-09/</link><description>MEXICO CITY, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum said on Friday she has tasked her foreign minister with strengthening coordination with the United States, after President Donald Trump threatened land strikes on drug cartels, which he said were running Mexico.

"Yesterday, I asked Foreign Minister Juan Ramon de la Fuente to make direct contact with the (U.S.) Secretary of State and, if necessary, speak with President Trump to strengthen coordination," Sheinbaum said during her morning press conference.

Trump’s remarks to Fox News on Thursday marked the latest in a series of escalating threats to deploy U.S. military force against drug cartels within Mexican territory, a move Mexico considers a red line. Trump's threats gained new force after U.S. forces attacked Venezuela last weekend and captured its president, Nicolas Maduro.

"We’ve knocked out 97% of the drugs coming in by water, and we are going to start now hitting land with regard to the cartels,” Trump told Fox News host Sean Hannity on Thursday. “The cartels are running Mexico — it’s very, very sad to watch and see what’s happened to that country."

Sheinbaum has repeatedly warned that any unilateral military action by the U.S. in Mexico would constitute a grave violation of the nation’s sovereignty. At the same time, she has doubled down on bilateral security cooperation with the U.S. to avoid Mexico being in Trump’s crosshairs .

On Thursday, she touted preliminary data that showed homicides have fallen by 40% since she took office in October 2024. She has also sought to placate Washington with two mass expulsions to the U.S. of alleged high-level cartel operatives and by undertaking a year-long military offensive against the Sinaloa Cartel.

Security analysts and Mexican officials say behind the scenes, Sheinbaum is likely to move even closer to Washington after the U.S. attack on Venezuela, hoping that increasingly tight bilateral security cooperation will stave off unilateral U.S. military action.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 17:28:33 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ONNR3BVHYNL3NAIDVY2JHDXFDE.jpg?auth=3e4daacc15685d313f01fe268ac3e4c78802bab8498f80469b2cec4b90f2bce6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Swedish espionage suspect appears to have been working for Russia, prosecutor says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/swedish-espionage-suspect-appears-have-been-working-russia-prosecutor-says-2026-01-09/</link><description>STOCKHOLM, Jan 9 (Reuters) - A man detained in Sweden on suspicion of espionage appears to have been working for Russia, the prosecution authority said on Friday.

All along the US Gulf Coast, a tangle of towering refineries stands ready to receive boatloads of Venezuelan heavy crude oil .

This is what they were built for: almost three-quarters of US refining capacity , built before the Fracking Revolution of the 2010s ripped open the country’s shale bedrock to unleash untapped domestic oil and gas reserves, is set up to process the kind of thick, sulphurous crude buried under Venezuelan soil.

US President Donald Trump has not been coy about his ambitions for these oil reserves, often described as the largest in the world. On Tuesday, the president announced that the Venezuelan government – led by former oil minister Delcy Rodriguez after the armed seizure of President Nicolas Maduro and his wife by American troops – would deliver up to 50 million barrels of oil to the US , who would sell it.

Trump has claimed that he will personally manage the profits, and that any proceeds that go to Venezuela will have to be spent on US-made products.

Speaking at a Goldman Sachs energy conference in Miami Wednesday, former fracking executive and current US Energy Secretary Chris Wright said that US control of the sale of Venezuela’s oil would continue “indefinitely”.

And why not? The US naval blockade on Venezuela remains firmly in place, with US troops boarding and seizing at least five oil tankers allegedly trying to transport oil from the country. US sanctions that have for years throttled the country’s already struggling oil industry – responsible for 90 percent of Venezuela’s exports – have also not budged.

If Trump is to be believed, using force to reroute millions of barrels of crude oil sitting stagnant in Venezuela’s storage facilities is only the first step.

On Friday, the former real estate mogul is meeting with senior US oil executives in the White House to discuss what it will take to open the country’s broken-down oil industry to American capital.

In a Truth Social post ahead of the meeting, Trump claimed that “at least 100 billion dollars will be invested by Big Oil” in the nation’s struggling sector.

But analysts warn that breathing new life back into Venezuela’s oil industry could cost dearly in both time and money – even if the Chavista administration still in place continues to bend under US pressure.

Antulio Rosales, assistant professor at York University’s Department of Social Science, Business and Society programme, said that Venezuela’s oil industry has been hollowed out by years of sanctions and under-investment.

“The Venezuelan oil industry in general has been decimated in terms of investment, but also in terms of technical capacity,” he said. “I think it’s very important to highlight that many workers with the technical knowledge of oil extraction and transportation and so on have left the industry – they’ve migrated to other countries.”

Cut off from international markets and finance by US sanctions during the first Trump administration, Venezuelan oil production has slumped to roughly one million barrels a day, down from roughly three times that in the late 1990s.

Even before the sanctions, former president Hugo Chavez ’s decision in the 2000s to effectively force foreign oil companies to renegotiate their contracts with the government put many to flight – and turned those who stayed into junior partners with the state-owned oil and gas company PDSVA. Some of the companies whose heads have been summoned to the White House Friday are still owed billions of dollars in compensation from Caracas that was awarded under international arbitration.

Accusations of chronic mismanagement and heavy-handed political interference have dogged the company, and Chavez’s programme of ploughing oil profits into social programmes to lift the population out of poverty came crashing down when oil prices collapsed in 2014.

The country’s oil infrastructure is now in ruins. One estimate by Oslo-based energy research agency Rystad Energy suggested Venezuela would need at least $183 billion worth of investments to restore its oil production to 3 million barrels per day by 2040.

“You cannot just set the incentives right and expect things to work immediately,” Rosales said. “And for that you need not only the lifting of sanctions, but the improvement overall of conditions in Venezuela, and those have to do with infrastructure, with public services and so on.”

Luisa Palacios previously served as chairwoman at Citgo Petroleum Corporation, a Houston-based refiner majority-owned by PDVSA. Now an adjunct senior research scholar at Columbia University’s Centre on Global Energy Policy, Palacios said that major multinationals were unlikely to make long-term investments in the country’s oil industry while the way forward remained murky.

"You can still attract investments, because in the oil business there are all kinds of companies with all kinds of risk profiles, but my sense is you cannot attract the kind of investments needed for the kind of economic recovery that the country needs," she said.

She said that oil multinationals would likely be seeking assurances from both the US and Venezuelan governments that their investments would be protected.

“The optimism is because there’s a lot of potential – it is the above-the-ground risk that is really very difficult,” she said.

“My sense is that you would need government guarantees so that if something goes wrong, you can go and claim. And the other part of the deal is you need to make sure that there are assurances on the ground. You actually need minimum guarantees of rule of law and improvements in governance.”

Unnamed sources from US oil giants told the New York Times Friday that the companies were discussing the possibility of receiving financial guarantees from the federal government before they committed to Venezuela. It’s unclear what form these guarantees would take, or who would ultimately foot the bill should those investments go under.

Rosales said that the Trump administration’s blunt announcements that the Venezuelan government was firmly under its thumb could be intended to convince major oil companies that the country was ready to be reshaped to their wishes.

“That is perhaps the kind of image that Donald Trump is trying to send at the moment – that he controls the government of Venezuela, that the government of Venezuela will do whatever they want – in a way, to say that they will have carte blanche to extract as much benefits as possible,” he said.

“Of course, it’s quite hard to see the feasibility of it, because the Venezuelan legal framework requires majority stakes with the Venezuelan state ... [Oil companies] would perhaps like to see changes in the legal framework, and I don’t know to what extent the regime will be willing to do that.”

Under Venezuelan law, the state-owned PDSVA takes a majority stake in all joint ventures around oil and gas production. Palacios said that it was hard to imagine foreign multinationals lining up to work alongside the company.

“PDVSA is a company that has defaulted on its debts, that has lost its technical capacity – it’s a politicised company with a heavy military presence,” she said. “It has become a huge liability.”

Driven into a corner by US sanctions, the Venezuelan government has already shown some willingness to back down from its Bolivarian ideals. Under an Anti-Blockade Law passed in 2020, the executive branch now has broad powers to bypass the country’s National Assembly and secretly sign contracts with foreign corporations on more favourable terms, opening the country up to private investment and paving the way for the privatisation of selected state-owned industries.

Whatever Trump is prepared to promise US oil giants, his administration’s stranglehold on the Venezuelan oil and gas industry could allow for a modest increase in crude oil production in the short term, keeping gasoline prices low as the country’s crucial mid-term elections draw near.

US oil company Chevron continues to pump oil in Venezuela, having been granted a sanctions exemption by the Biden administration after the Ukraine war threw global energy markets into turmoil. Analysts say its now operating well under capacity.

“I do think that you have the ability to bring back some of the oil production that have been lost – I think going back to 1.5 million barrels a day, which is what you had before sanctions, is reasonable,” Palacios said. “They have some capacity to increase oil production without major, big, big changes. Some level of investment is needed, but it’s about brownfield investments – companies on the ground who are going to increase their production.”

Beyond Venezuela’s borders, though, analysts have struggled to make sense of Trump’s single-minded focus on Venezuela’s oilfields. Across the world, demand for oil is still sagging , outstripped by a global glut that threatens to push oil prices below what oil companies need to make large-scale new investments profitable.

And while the US president has made no secret of the fact that falling gas prices would be a welcome sight ahead of the upcoming mid-term elections, heavyweights in the country’s costly oil shale industry – an industry that has turned the US into the world’s leading producer of oil and gas – are worried that a further drop in crude oil prices could be another blow to fracking companies already forced to abandon their less-profitable rigs after failing to break even.

Rosales said that Trump’s desire to give US corporations unrivalled access to Venezuela’s vast reserves could be less about short-term politicking and more about securing resources that companies can pump for decades after the domestic fracking boom has wound down.

“The Trump administration’s view is that Venezuela having the largest oil reserves in the world could mean a way to secure long-term future reserves for American companies,” he said. “Regardless of whatever happens with the global oil market, having long-term certainty of reserves is something that may interest these companies for sure. So that kind of gives them some form of insurance for future oil extraction, regardless of what happens to the demand.”</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 17:29:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/77e71f94-ed6c-11f0-9830-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26008705848391.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuela looks to reestablish diplomatic ties with US</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/venezuela-looks-reestablish-diplomatic-ties-with-us-2026-01-09/</link><description>Jan 9 (Reuters) - Venezuela's government said on Friday it has begun an exploratory diplomatic phase with the United States, with a view to reestablishing diplomatic presence in both countries.

"There's no water, there's no power - there's nothing. But it's warm in those two rooms," said the 58-year-old, pointing across her damaged apartment to the other side of the building.

Revutska's high-rise was one of the latest sites damaged in a sprawling Russian winter campaign to plunge Ukrainians into cold and darkness as their government faces U.S. pressure to end the nearly four-year-old war launched by Moscow .

Officials said on Friday they were racing to restore power to 500,000 consumers and heating to 6,000 buildings in Kyiv as temperatures hovered around -10 degrees Celsius (14 Fahrenheit), after an attack that involved 242 drones and 36 missiles.

Four people were killed in the strikes, which also included a hypersonic Oreshnik missile fired by Russia at the western Lviv region near the EU border.

Revutska's building was left with a sweeping, charred scar across several stories where the drone had struck. Heavy snow fell as residents and workers collected debris to the din of generators.

Twelfth-floor resident Oleg Marasin, 54, described yelling for help to a group of medics below, who had been hit in a second strike.

"One was dead, the others were badly wounded," he said as street noise flooded his apartment, where shattered glass was strewn across a floor littered with children's toys.

Ukrainian officials have warned that a cold snap could further strain the country's energy system, which has come under regular attack since autumn.

Deputy energy minister Mykola Kolisnyk told reporters on Friday that only part of the outages were a result of the overnight attack - with the weather accounting for the greater portion.

On Thursday, Russian strikes on Ukraine's industrial southeast had sparked near-total blackouts across two regions.

Still, residents like Marasin and Revutska appeared largely calm, telling Reuters their spirits have not yet been shattered despite Russia showing little interest in a U.S.-backed peace push.

"We've already survived - so we'll continue living," said Revutska, dressed in a thick gray fleece and tan knit hat.

In recent days Trump has warned Iranian leaders that there will be "hell to pay" if they crack down on the protest movement but has otherwise adopted a wait-and-see attitude.

"I have let them know that if they start killing people, which they tend to do during their riots … we’re going to hit them very hard,” Trump told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt on Thursday.

Human rights groups have alleged that security forces have killed and injured numerous protesters.

But in an interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity on Thursday, Trump only referred to demonstrators being "stomped on" in huge crowds and security forces "shooting the hell out of people" in the past.

The protests are the latest in a series of major demonstrations that have rocked Iran in which the U.S. has spoken up on the side of the opposition.

Trump said he was not inclined now to meet Reza Pahlavi, the exiled crown prince and son of the late Shah of Iran, a sign that he was waiting to see how the crisis plays out before backing an opposition leader.

“I think that we should let everybody go out there and see who emerges,” Trump said. “I’m not sure necessarily that it would be an appropriate thing to do.”

Pahlavi, who lives near Washington, has used social media to call for continued mass demonstrations. In a post on Friday, he called on Trump to get more involved in the crisis with his "attention, support and action."

"You have proven and I know you are a man of peace and a man of your word. Please be prepared to intervene to help the people of Iran," he said.

Earlier this week, a U.S. intelligence community assessment said that the protests were not big enough to challenge the leadership of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, according to a source familiar with U.S. intelligence reports.

But U.S. analysts were watching the situation carefully. The source said: "Prior to the last 24 hours the protests were broadly concentrated in cities where opposition to the regime has always been a thing. Moving to strongholds (like the Supreme Leader's hometown of Mashad) is the significant development."

"We don’t comment on matters of intelligence. As the President has stated repeatedly, if Iran shoots and violently kills peaceful protesters, ‘They will get hit very hard,'" said a White House spokesperson.

The CIA declined to comment.

Iran's unrest has come as Trump is preoccupied with his ouster of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and has been floating the possibility of acquiring Greenland by purchase or military force.

Trump ordered U.S.-led bombing raids on Iranian nuclear facilities last June and has warned he is prepared to do so again if Tehran tries to reconstitute the program.

Asked about his message to the people of Iran, Trump said: "All I can say is you should feel strongly about freedom. There's nothing like freedom. You're brave people. It's a shame what's happened to your country. Your country was a great country."

Alex Vatanka, the director of the Iran program at the Middle East Institute think tank, said Trump appeared to be waiting to see if the protests could succeed in destabilizing Iran’s ruling clerics before he decides to make good on his threats to intervene.

Trump “wants to be on the winning side, but he prefers a quick win, not a win that requires a lot of investment and holding hands, certainly not in the Middle East,” said Vatanka. “To him, that's just against everything he stood for as a politician, going back to when he first ran.”</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 20:25:54 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/K5PDLBPO7VJZFO3GLRLGGNZZHA.jpg?auth=720b77d9e151515c53ea3191cd7005b7a237652c696682a94ef1085b6386f72a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukrainian nationals aboard seized tanker Bella-1, ambassador says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/ukrainian-nationals-aboard-seized-tanker-bella-1-ambassador-says-2026-01-09/</link><description>Jan 9 (Reuters) - Ukraine's ambassador to the United States was quoted as saying on Friday that Ukrainian nationals were among members of the crew of the Russian-flagged tanker Bella-1, seized this week by U.S. forces.

Olha Stefanishyna, quoted by the Interfax Ukraine news agency, said Ukrainian diplomats were in contact with U.S. authorities to ensure consular access to the crew members.

"The embassy has the situation under control and is using all necessary means to maintain contact with the Ukrainian citizens," Stefanishyna was quoted as saying.

The Bella-1, recently renamed the Marinera and registered as a Russian vessel, was seized in the North Atlantic this week.

The U.S. has seized five ships in recent weeks as part of efforts to curb Venezuelan oil exports. The Olina was seized in the Caribbean on Friday.

The Russian Foreign Ministry said on Friday that the United States had released two Russian crew members from the Marinera, expressed gratitude to Washington for the decision and pledged to ensure the return home of crew members.

Russia's Transport Ministry said on Wednesday it had lost contact with the Marinera after U.S. naval forces boarded it near Iceland.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 20:26:12 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Beyond the seized oil tanker Marinera: Growing fleet reflags to Russia</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260109-seized-marinera-fleet-russia-trump</link><description>The United States announced on January 7 that it had “seized” a Russian oil tanker with links to Venezuela as it sailed across the North Atlantic. This news is the latest twist in a drama that began late in December in the Caribbean.

The United States announced on December 21 that it would pursue the oil tanker, then known as the Bella 1, for trying to get around the blockade they imposed in mid-December on oil tankers under sanctions entering or leaving Venezuela.

The Bella 1 has been subject to US sanctions since June 2024 because of its apparent links to Iran and the Lebanese Shiite group Hezbollah . Maritime company Windward reported that the tanker had been participating in trading with Iran and Venezuela since 2021. Windward also tracked multiple instances of deceptive shipping practices.

TankerTrackers , a site specialised in maritime transport, reported that the tanker was not carrying oil when the United States began its pursuit. Analysts say that it was likely going to Venezuela to pick up oil.

The US suspected the Marinera of being part of what’s called a dark or shadow fleet. These are fraudulent or unregistered vessels that smuggle goods that are illegal or subject to sanctions.

American authorities claimed that the tanker, which was flagged to Guyana, was “falsely flagged”. If a boat is stateless or flying under a false flag, then it is not protected under international law and can be boarded. The United States used this legal argument to seize two oil tankers in mid-December as well as the oil tanker M/T Sophia on Wednesday.

The Coast Guard said that they initially attempted to intercept the Bella 1, but it continued on its path.

American authorities interviewed by the New York Times said that the crew of the recently christened Marinera had painted a crude Russian flag on the side of the ship. An officer on the ship also made contact with the Coast Guard via radio to say that the ship was now flagged to Russia.

The oil tanker also now appears in the Russian maritime registry , under the name Marinera, with its home port listed as the Russian city of Sochi. The database Equasis also indicates that the ship’s owner and manager live in Russia.

The Russian government then sent a formal demand for the United States to end their pursuit of the ship, according to the New York Times .

An American official told the New York Times that the United States still considered the ship “stateless” because it was not flying a valid flag when it was approached for the first time by the Coast Guard.

The oil tanker then headed northeast, setting out across the Atlantic Ocean. On January 7, it was located to the south of Iceland, according to information provided by Lloyd’s List Intelligence. A number of analysts interviewed by our team said they believed that the boat was heading towards a Russian port.

In recent days, aviation data seemed to indicate that the Marinera was being closely surveilled by two American P-8 spy planes, who took off from Mildenhall air base in the United Kingdom.

“The vessel is being shadowed by a United States Coast Guard cutter, with supporting surveillance including an RAF Rivet Joint mission and RFA Tideforce operating in the area,” Martin Kelly, head of advisory at the British security company EOS Risk Group, told our team a few hours before the operation took place.

The RAF is an abbreviation for the Royal Air Force, the British Air Force. A Rivet Joint is a spy plane. And the RFA Tideforce is a refuelling ship that belongs to the RAF.

A video posted on January 6, 2026 by Russia Today , which was said to have been filmed by the crew of the Marinera, shows a US Coast Guard Patroller following them. It is impossible to know when and where this video was filmed.

The Bella 1 is not the only ship operating in Venezuela that has reflagged to Russia in recent days.

“Reflagging to Russia is increasingly being used by these tankers to allow them to continue operating and gain some sort of legitimacy and protection,” said Mark Douglas, a maritime analyst with Starboard Maritime Intelligence.

After having dropped off its cargo of Russian naphtha – used to refine crude oil – in Venezuela, the Hyperion oil tanker, which is also under sanction, dropped the false Gambian flag that it was operating under on December 25 and announced that it was now flagged to Russia, according to the publication gCaptain . It then managed to travel into the Atlantic Ocean, making it seem as if it had escaped American seizure.

The oil tanker the Premier also indicated that it had reflagged in late December, going from the Gambian flag to the Russian flag, according to Windward . On Wednesday, it was located in the Caribbean.

According to the New York Times , three other boats under sanction that were recently located in Venezuelan waters have reflagged to Russia in recent days. They are all now also listed in the Russian maritime registry.

“Over the past six months, a dozen or more of the darkest tankers operating globally have switched from open registries to Russia. This trend accelerated in December as the flag state emerged as a critical shield against drone strikes and vessel seizures,” Windward wrote.

Vessels also began to reflag to Russia in the Black Sea after Ukrainian drone attacks on oil tankers carrying false flags.

“This is ultimately about principle,” says Kelly. “The United States cannot allow this to become a template for dozens of other sanctioned tankers off Venezuela to evade enforcement by simply changing flags.”

After Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro was arrested, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that the blockade on sanctioned oil tankers would remain in place.

The risk is also that other boats in the so-called dark or ghost fleet, operating in other regions, will also adopt this strategy.

“If the vessel doesn't get seized, then the remaining near 1,500 dark fleet tankers worldwide will resort to keeping a Russian flag handy in their closet,” said Samir Madani, co-founder of the site TankerTrackers.com , ahead of the US operation.

However, an operation like the seizure of the Marinera is not without risk. The New York Times said Wednesday that Russia had sent a warship to escort the oil tanker.

Kelly explains:

“The presence of Russian warships ‘defending’ a vessel that now declares itself Russian-flagged significantly increases the risk of miscalculation and escalation.

The Russian warship will have specific rules of engagement and is unlikely to use force to oppose any boarding, but it may seek to disrupt or obstruct boarding operations, potentially through unsafe manoeuvring or using laser devices to target aircraft. Any Russian submarine nearby will highly likely conduct surveillance without playing an active part in the incident.”

But why is Russia getting so involved? We spoke to Eric Orsini, global head of compliance at Lloyd's List Intelligence:

What you're seeing is sanctioned actors working together. They're forming their own little ecosystem.

Russia has been providing Venezuela with condensate or diluents [Editor’s note: like naphtha]. Venezuela's oil is heavy crude and it needs to be mixed or blended with diluents in order for it to be refined. So it’s in Russia's interest to continue the flow of their diluents to Venezuela, because Venezuela is buying it.

Russia has an interest in also keeping the shadow fleet on the water. The Marinera is a VLCC – a very large crude carrier, which has a lot of capacity to move oil. The more vessels that come out of the shadow fleet, the less capacity the sanctioned actors have to continue moving the oil and storing it.

It remains to be seen how Western countries will adapt to this new world.

“The reflagging will likely lead to an evolution of the approach taken to these vessels by the likes of Ukraine and the US as they consider what additional actions Russia might be willing to take to protect the tankers and the oil they carry,” concludes Douglas.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 20:27:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/15a46b36-ebf8-11f0-b153-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/hyperion.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iranian regime's 'iron fist': Internet blackout as protests swell to hundreds of thousands</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/iranian-regime-s-iron-fist-internet-blackout-as-protests-swell-to-hundreds-of-thousands</link><description /><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 20:27:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/43c03bee-ed83-11f0-8247-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260109-181116-182553-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>EU greenlights Mercosur trade deal, von der Leyen 'looks forward' to signing 'soon'</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260109-eu-countries-greenlight-mercosur-trade-deal-overriding-france</link><description>The EU gave Friday a long-delayed go ahead to a huge trade deal with South American bloc Mercosur championed by business groups but loathed by many European farmers – overriding opposition led by France.

A majority of the European Union 's 27 nations backed the pact at an ambassadors' meeting in Brussels , diplomatic sources said, paving the way for it to be inked in Paraguay next week.

More than 25 years in the making, supporters see the deal as crucial to boost exports, support the continent's ailing economy and foster diplomatic ties at a time of global uncertainty.

EU chief Ursula von der Leyen Friday hailed the green light given to the bloc's trade deal with South American bloc Mercosur, saying she looked forward to signing the accord "soon".

"This historic trade deal is further proof that Europe charts its own course and stands as a reliable partner," said the European Commission chief, who confirmed she would travel to Paraguay for the signing, without specifying a date.

Argentina's foreign minister said the deal would be signed on January 17.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz also hailed the agreement.

"The approval of the EU-Mercosur Agreement is a milestone in European trade policy and an important signal of our strategic sovereignty and capacity to act," the German leader said.

But the European Commission , which negotiated the text, failed to win over all of the bloc's member states.

Key power France, where politicians across the divide are up in arms against a deal attacked as an assault on the country's influential farming sector, led an ultimately unsuccessful push to sink it.

Ireland , Poland , Hungary and Austria also voted against the accord.

But that was not enough to block it, after Italy , which had demanded and obtained a last-minute delay in December, threw its weight behind the pact.

The deal will create a vast market of more than 700 million people, making it one of the world's largest free trade areas.

Part of a broader push to diversify trade in the face of US tariffs, it will bring the 27-nation EU closer together with Brazil , Paraguay, Argentina and Uruguay , removing import tariffs on more than 90 percent of products.

This will save EU businesses four billion euros ($4.6 billion) worth of duties per year and help exports of vehicles, machinery, wines and spirits to Latin America , according to the EU.

It will also help the bloc reduce its dependency on China for critical raw materials, said Agathe Demarais, of the European Council on Foreign Relations, a think tank.

"The conclusion of the EU-Mercosur trade deal is great news for Europe's global geopolitical and economic clout," she said, describing it one of the "best responses to US tariffs, growing protectionism and trade tensions with China."

Germany, Spain and others were strongly in favour, believing the deal will provide a welcome boost to their industries hampered by Chinese competition and tariffs in the United States.

But France and other critics opposed it over concerns that their farmers would be undercut by a flow of cheaper goods, including meat, sugar, rice, honey and soybean, from agricultural giant Brazil and its neighbours.

Failure to sign off on the deal could have spelt the end of it: Brazil last month threatened to walk if the EU kicked the can down the road.

Over the past months, the commission has been at pains to reassure farmers and their backers that pros outweigh cons.

It stressed the accord is expected to boost EU agri-food exports to South America by 50 percent, in part by protecting more than 340 iconic European products – from Greek feta to French champagne – from local imitations.

It also laid out plans to set up a €6.3 billion crisis fund and safeguards allowing for the suspension of preferential tariffs on agricultural products in case of a damaging surge in imports.

The latter were tightened further at the last minute by member states lowering the threshold for action, in a late concession to Italy.

"It seems to me that the balance that has been created is a sustainable one, and I hope that the agreement will bring benefits in many areas, as I believe it will, and hopefully for everyone," Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni told journalists on Friday.

"There is a lot of pain. There is a lot of anger," Judy Peeters, a representative for a Belgian young farmers group said at a protest on a motorway south of Brussels.

The deal still needs approval from the European Parliament before it can definitively come into force.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 20:27:56 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/4bc2fadc-ed62-11f0-8a86-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/d4ced373109f8f3a83cc98f7c058d2a50adbfeb0.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US oil firms juggle Venezuela opportunity, investor concern ahead of White House summit</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/us-oil-firms-juggle-venezuela-opportunity-investor-concern-ahead-white-house-2026-01-09/</link><description>Jan 9 (Reuters) - U.S. oil executives being summoned to the White House on Friday to discuss potential investment plans in Venezuela will be carefully weighing the country's business potential and enthusiasm from President Donald Trump with a more cautious sentiment being expressed by some of their investors.

Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, speaking at a Goldman Sachs energy conference in Miami this week, repeated a claim from Trump that U.S. oil firms were prepared to spend billions of dollars to rebuild the South American country's oil economy after U.S. forces removed Nicolás Maduro from power on Saturday.

Some energy investors were skeptical, however, and questioned the cost of any such spending in Venezuela, which holds the world's largest estimated crude reserves. They also had ongoing concerns about the country's political stability and whether they could trust the interim government in Caracas being run by Delcy Rodriguez.

"Investors will want to see long-lasting stability and good fiscal terms to protect against the risk of asset nationalization, which we’ve seen from Venezuela in the past," said David Byrns, portfolio manager and senior investment analyst at American Century Investments, which is a major Chevron (CVX.N) , opens new tab and Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) , opens new tab shareholder.

Multiple attendees of private meetings held by Chevron and ConocoPhillips at the Miami conference told Reuters that executives from those companies offered few insights into Venezuela, but made one thing clear: they did not intend to make rash decisions.

Chevron and Conoco did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

On Friday, Trump is expected to urge oil executives to invest and help boost Venezuela’s crude production during a meeting attended by Wright, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and 17 major firms. The companies represented will include ConocoPhillips, Exxon (XOM.N) , opens new tab , Chevron, along with Spain's Repsol and trading firms Vitol and Trafigura , according to sources familiar with the matter.

"The American people, energy companies, and the Venezuelan people will all greatly benefit from these new, unprecedented investments in Venezuela’s oil infrastructure thanks to President Trump,” said White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers.

Chevron already operates in the country, but Exxon and Conoco departed nearly 20 years ago after their assets were nationalized and are still owed billions of dollars.

"The tension is between the compelling geological resource and the obvious business opportunity, and the considerable above-ground risk, uncertainty and unpaid claims," said Geoffrey Pyatt, former Assistant Secretary of State for Energy Resources in the Biden administration.

Foreign embassies in Venezuela are beginning to arrange visits for next week that will include representatives for American and European oil companies, two sources told Reuters on Thursday.

Matthew Sallee, head of investments at fund manager Tortoise Capital, which owns shares in Chevron, said he could support further Venezuela investments if Chevron could show returns paying out, but he would be very cautious because infrastructure in the country is so dilapidated.

"If Chevron says we're going to dedicate multi-billion dollars a year to Venezuela, we would probably sell," he said.

Service companies, which could be among the first to benefit from any rush into Venezuela as infrastructure gets rebuilt, have tried to curb any immediate enthusiasm.

"We have a yard in Colombia, across the border, that could deliver rigs into the region, and we understand what it takes to work there, but we need to make sure that the timing is right and that we have the right customer-partner relationship going in," said Helmerich &amp; Payne President Trey Adams, speaking at the Miami conference.

Ali Moshiri, Chevron's former president of Africa and Latin America, who is now CEO of Amos Global Energy, said his firm planned to enter Venezuela and was in early-stage talks with U.S. government departments for public funding, and with service companies to repair infrastructure and build pipelines. But despite overwhelming interest from investors, the plan would be contingent on the U.S. determining who will manage the transition period in the country, he added.

"That decision must be made, it is the precondition for investors," Moshiri said.

While Trump has said the U.S. intends to control Venezuela, how that plays out on the ground remains unclear, especially given questions about how different spheres of power in Caracas will get along in the absence of Maduro.

The U.S. has a three-step plan for Venezuela that will begin with stabilization, followed by a recovery phase ensuring U.S. oil companies have access to the country and finally a transition, Rubio said on Wednesday.

Some U.S. oil companies may worry they could be pressured to enter Venezuela quickly or potentially face repercussions down the road, said Samantha Carl-Yoder, co-chair of the international practice at lobbying firm Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck.

"Companies may feel they have to go back in to get things they want in other areas. Will the administration hold permits and licensing hostage? Will the administration provide some financial incentives to companies going in? Those are questions I would have if I were an integrated oil company," she said.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 21:21:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/FEPHKIVSURJEHPHUHR4CDYBECM.jpg?auth=18dfa7af69567f77f98bb78fd1ac8320557ac0c1782ab52425db342d44e9da64&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Families anxiously wait for prisoners to be released in Venezuela, just nine freed</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/families-anxiously-wait-prisoners-be-released-venezuela-just-nine-freed-2026-01-09/</link><description>Jan 9 (Reuters) - Nine people considered political prisoners by a leading Venezuelan rights group had been released by Friday afternoon as part of an effort praised by U.S. President Donald Trump, the group said, with families of others anxiously waiting to hear if their relatives would also be freed.

Human rights groups, international bodies and opposition figures - including Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Corina Machado, who has several close allies imprisoned - have long demanded the release from Venezuelan jails of some 800 people they consider political prisoners.

Trump said in a post on Truth Social earlier on Friday that he had canceled a second wave of attacks on Venezuela following cooperation from the South American nation, and that Venezuela was releasing "large numbers of political prisoners."

Both Venezuela's top lawmaker Jorge Rodriguez, the brother of acting President Delcy Rodriguez, and Trump said the releases are a gesture of peace.

There is no official list of exactly how many prisoners will be released nor who they are.

The releases come during a week of political turmoil in Caracas after the U.S. capture of President Nicolas Maduro , his arraignment in a New York court on narcoterrorism charges, the swearing-in of interim President Delcy Rodriguez and the announcement that the U.S. would refine and sell up to 50 million barrels of crude oil stuck in Venezuela under U.S. sanctions.

For years, Venezuela's opposition and human rights groups have said the government uses detentions to stamp out dissent. The authorities have consistently denied that and have said the prisoners were rightfully jailed for committing crimes.

The families of both prominent and little-known detainees gathered outside prisons on Friday, or visited multiple detention centers in an attempt to discover the location and status of their loved ones.

Leading local rights group Foro Penal estimates that after the releases this week there are 811 political prisoners still being held in the country. That figure includes more than 80 foreign detainees, including two from the United States and one with American residency.

Five Spanish citizens, including Venezuelan-Spanish rights activist Rocio San Miguel, were the first confirmed releases on Thursday. They arrived in Madrid the following day.

Also released late on Thursday were former Venezuelan opposition presidential candidate Enrique Marquez, journalist Biagio Pilieri and soldier Larry Osorio, said Alfredo Romero, the director of Foro Penal. Opposition member Aracelis Balza was released on Friday.

"We are waiting to hear what the authorities here have to say. I found out through social media that they were releasing people," said Gregory Trejo, as he waited outside El Rodeo prison in Guatire, near capital Caracas, for news of his father, Jose Gregorio Trejo, detained for nearly a year.

"For there to be a democratic transition in a democratic country, there cannot be political prisoners, and we demand the release of all those who are in all detention centers," said Soraida Gonzalez, who was awaiting the release of her son Jose Miguel Estrada.

Among prominent detained figures are opposition politician Juan Pablo Guanipa and lawyer Perkins Rocha, both close allies of Machado; Rafael Tudares, son-in-law of the opposition's former presidential candidate Edmundo Gonzalez; opposition Voluntad Popular party leaders Freddy Superlano and Roland Carreno; and Javier Tarazona, director of an NGO that tracks alleged abuses by Colombian armed groups and the Venezuelan military.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 21:21:58 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/QSYA4FVWYBKSHH6CYK7IJ6DNOM.jpg?auth=66bec3cee8f164d455fe7710baf8f7b4ef501df5e410f313452cddd5a231aaf6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Washington pipe bomb suspect pleads not guilty</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/washington-pipe-bomb-suspect-pleads-not-guilty-2026-01-09/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 9 (Reuters) - The man accused of planting pipe bombs in Washington the night before the January 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol attack pleaded not guilty on Friday to two explosives-related charges.

Brian Cole, 30, is accused of leaving two explosive devices outside the headquarters of the Democratic and Republican national committees on the evening of January 5.

Cole, wearing a tan prison jumpsuit, entered the plea himself during a brief hearing in Washington federal court.

The bombs, which did not detonate, were discovered the next day shortly before supporters of President Donald Trump streamed into the Capitol nearby in a failed attempt to stop Congress from certifying the 2020 election.

Cole is facing two criminal counts: interstate transportation of explosives and malicious attempt to use explosives.

A judge has ordered him detained to await trial, finding evidence Cole poses a danger to public safety.

FBI investigators struggled for nearly five years to pinpoint a suspect. Cole was arrested and charged last month following a fresh review of evidence ordered by Trump’s top appointees at the FBI.

Cole gave a detailed confession , opens new tab in an interview with FBI agents following his arrest, prosecutors have said. He expressed dissatisfaction with both political parties and also echoed Trump’s false claims of tampering in the 2020 election, according to a court filing.

Cole denied in the FBI interview that the placement of the bombs was related to Congress' certification of the election and the events the next day.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 21:22:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/VAJWJVTBVNNW7A2LU2CNZ4444E.jpg?auth=4ef2a32979395681a8ac49221a00bf365b263e4d5ac0af92f76922db1948d8c1&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UK allocates $270 million to prepare for possible Ukraine deployment</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/uk-allocates-270-million-prepare-possible-ukraine-deployment-2026-01-09/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Britain said it was allocating 200 million pounds ($270 million) to fund preparations for the possible deployment of troops to Ukraine, after pledging its soldiers this week to a multinational force for the country in the event of a ceasefire.

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Tuesday agreed a declaration of intent at a summit of the "coalition of the willing" of Ukraine's allies, outlining a potential future deployment.

Visiting the Ukrainian capital Kyiv on Friday, British defence minister John Healey said the money would be spent on upgrading vehicles and communication systems and counter-drone protection, as well as ensuring troops are ready to deploy.

Britain made the announcement hours after Russia fired a powerful hypersonic missile, in what Kyiv's European allies described as an attempt to intimidate them from supporting Ukraine.

Macron has said France could send thousands of troops to the Multinational Force for Ukraine (MNFU), aimed at firming up security guarantees to reassure Kyiv. Britain has not said how many troops it would send; Starmer said on Wednesday Britain's plans were still being finalised.

Healey said the funding announcement for the MNFU showed the government was "surging investment" into preparations for Ukraine.

"This capital spending is being funded from the core defence budget and sends a clear signal to allies and adversaries of the UK’s intent to lead the MNFU, (and) fulfil our promises to secure the peace in Ukraine," the statement from the Ministry of Defence said.

Healey also told Zelenskiy that production of Octopus interceptor drones, based on a Ukrainian design but made in Britain, would start in January. Britain will send thousands of them back to Ukraine each month to help the country defend itself against Russian drone attacks.

"We are going to do something on Greenland whether they like it or not. Because if we don't do it, Russia or China will take over Greenland, and we're not going to have Russia or China as a neighbor," Trump told reporters at the White House while meeting with oil company executives.

Trump said the U.S. must acquire Greenland, even though it already has a military presence on the island under a 1951 agreement, because such deals are not enough to guarantee Greenland's defense. The island of 57,000 people is an autonomous territory of the Kingdom of Denmark.

"You defend ownership. You don't defend leases. And we'll have to defend Greenland. If we don't do it, China or Russia will," Trump said.

Trump and White House officials have been discussing various plans to bring Greenland under U.S. control, including potential use of the U.S. military and lump sum payments to Greenlanders as part of a bid to convince them to secede from Denmark and potentially join the U.S.

Leaders in Copenhagen and throughout Europe have reacted with disdain in recent days to comments by Trump and other White House officials asserting their right to Greenland. The U.S. and Denmark are NATO allies bound by a mutual defense agreement.

On Tuesday, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, Britain and Denmark issued a joint statement, saying only Greenland and Denmark can decide matters regarding their relations.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 22:23:19 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/IUSZVJR6NFN6BIVKNALV7ZJFB4.jpg?auth=94cfa62f7f036a7d939e12c16c0eb7f17288eb6fd81558aea89a05e24009a8ea&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>North Korea says South Korean drone entered its airspace on Jan 4</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/north-korea-says-south-korea-infringed-its-airspace-with-another-drone-jan-4-2026-01-09/</link><description>SEOUL, Jan 10 (Reuters) - North Korea said on Saturday that South Korea flew another drone into its airspace on January 4, infringing on its sovereignty, according to state media KCNA.

The drone, which originated from an island in the South Korean city of Incheon, flew 8 km (5 miles) before it was shot down inside North Korean airspace, KCNA said, citing a spokesperson for the North Korean military.

The drone was equipped with surveillance cameras to record important North Korean facilities, KCNA said.

"Even after the change of a regime... (South Korea) has continued to commit such acts of provocation by drones near the border," KCNA said, calling South Korea its "enemy most hostile".

Since South Korean President Lee Jae Myung took office in June, North Korea has rebuffed conciliatory gestures from Lee's administration. Lee had pledged to re-engage with Pyongyang to defuse tensions on the Korean Peninsula.

South Korea "can never evade the responsibility for escalating tension" and will be "forced to pay a dear price" KCNA said.

North Korea has previously accused South Korea for sending a drone over Pyongyang in October 2024.

South Korea's former President Yoon Suk Yeol was accused by Seoul's special prosecutor late last year of ordering the Pyongyang drone operation to use military tensions between Pyongyang and Seoul as a justification for declaring emergency martial law.

Yoon has denied the charge, with his legal counsel saying the performance of the president's duties cannot be framed as a crime after the fact.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 22:23:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Colombia's FARC rebel leader calls for guerrilla unity to face US interventionism</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/colombias-farc-rebel-leader-calls-guerrilla-unity-face-us-interventionism-2026-01-09/</link><description>BOGOTA, Jan 9 (Reuters) - The head of the largest dissident branch of the former Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) guerrilla group called on other rebel groups to come together to fight U.S. interventionism in the region, in a video message confirmed by the group as authentic on Friday.

Three people remained missing in the southeastern state of Victoria where more than 50 fires, many at the highest danger rating, were burning out of control on Saturday morning local time.

Authorities have said the fires, which took hold amid a heatwave and have been fanned by strong winds, are the worst to hit the state since the Black Summer blazes of 2019-2020 that destroyed an area the size of Turkey and killed 33 people.

"Australians across the country are facing extreme and dangerous weather conditions with bushfires burning in multiple states but particularly Victoria," Albanese said in televised remarks from Canberra.

"My thoughts are with Australians in these regional communities at this very difficult time."

A disaster declaration was made in 18 areas of Victoria overnight, while the Australian Defence Force had been requested to provide accommodation support for Victorian firefighters, the prime minister added.

The largest fire near the town of Longwood, about 112 km (69.6 miles) north of state capital Melbourne, had burned 35,000 hectares (86,486 acres) of bushland, destroying multiple homes, a community centre and a telephone exchange, authorities said on Friday.

Dozens of communities near the fires have been evacuated and many of the state's parks and campgrounds are closed.

A heatwave warning on Saturday was in place for large parts of Victoria, while fire weather warnings were active for neighbouring New South Wales state and the Australian Capital Territory, the nation's weather forecaster said.</description><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 01:43:43 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/EPFXAGCEZZPSXCDNYHSATVYUKA.jpg?auth=f06afbdc67d54eb7eb209017510c2d5c67b4cc1370878b0dc25c4f6f289f3607&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuela's most prominent prisoners linked to opposition movement</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/venezuelas-most-prominent-prisoners-linked-opposition-movement-2026-01-10/</link><description>Jan 9 (Reuters) - Venezuela has slowly begun releasing some of those held in jail who are considered political prisoners by rights groups and the opposition, in the aftermath of the U.S. capture of President Nicolas Maduro last weekend.

U.S. President Donald Trump said early on Friday: "Venezuela is releasing large numbers of political prisoners as a sign of 'Seeking Peace.'" Venezuelan authorities have not said how many will be released or given their names.

As of Friday evening there had been at least nine confirmed releases , including five Spanish citizens and former opposition presidential candidate Enrique Marquez , said Foro Penal, a leading rights group. Foro Penal estimates there are still more than 800 political prisoners in Venezuela, including at least 80 foreign detainees.

Below are some of the high-profile prisoners in Venezuela:

Juan Pablo Guanipa

This well-known opposition politician - and ally of opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Maria Corina Machado - was arrested in May 2025 after months in hiding after he was accused of leading a terrorist plot , which he denies.

Venezuelan officials regularly accused the opposition of conspiring to commit terrorism, overthrow Maduro or attack the power grid.

Guanipa, a lawyer, was arrested days before Venezuela's parliamentary elections last year.

"I don't know what will happen to me in the coming hours, days and weeks. But I am sure that we will win this long fight against the dictatorship," he said in a statement on social media following his arrest.

Freddy Superlano

Superlano is the former head of the Voluntad Popular party, part of Venezuela's political opposition. He was retroactively disqualified by the Supreme Court from participating in the 2021 governor's race in Barinas, the home state of late socialist President Hugo Chavez, in a contest that pitted him against Chavez's brother. The opposition won the rerun of the vote.

His arrest after the 2024 election , captured on video, showed him being shoved into the back of an unmarked car surrounded by armed security agents.

Roland Carreno

Carreno is a journalist and former operations director for opposition party Voluntad Popular. He was arrested in August 2024 in Caracas by unidentified intelligence agents who approached him in vehicles without license plates, the party said following his detention.

At the time, Venezuela's attorney general, Tarek Saab, said Carreno had been detained for alleged "participation in conspirative plans against the democratic peace."

Carreno had previously been detained in October 2020 on charges of financing terrorism. He was released in October 2023 amid negotiations between Caracas and Washington.

Perkins Rocha

Rocha is a lawyer for the Vente Venezuela opposition movement and a close confidante of Machado. He was detained in August 2024 by unknown individuals who took him by force, the opposition movement said. Rocha also served as the spokesperson for Machado's campaign.

"We keep moving forward, for Perkins, for all those jailed and persecuted and for all of Venezuela," Machado said on X after the arrest.

Rafael Tudares

Tudares, 45, is the son-in-law of the opposition's former presidential candidate Edmundo Gonzalez.

Tudares, an attorney who was not involved in politics and who is married to Gonzalez's daughter Mariana, was detained in January 2025 in Caracas by masked men while driving his two young children to school.

His wife has been visiting detention centers since the releases were announced and says she does not know for sure where her husband is being held.

Javier Tarazona

Tarazona is the former director of local NGO FundaRedes, which tracks alleged abuses by Colombian armed groups and the Venezuelan military along the shared border. He was arrested in July 2021 alongside three other FundaRedes members, including his brother Jose Rafael Tarazona, after reporting to a state prosecutor that their team had been harassed by intelligence service officials.

Unidentified armed men waited for him at his hotel, the organization said on social media following his arrest. The three detainees were charged with instigating hatred, treason and terrorism.</description><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 01:43:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/F2FGYT3QBFIZDCU5OODGBW2SUA.jpg?auth=82c0bd99747ec824b11f6c3f6959864c58b5912162ae1011fe9eded86b0eb148&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Bessent says Australia, India invited to G7 meeting on critical minerals</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/bessent-says-australia-india-invited-g7-meeting-critical-minerals-2026-01-10/</link><description>SAVAGE, Minnesota, Jan 9 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Australia and several other countries would join a meeting of finance ministers from the Group of Seven advanced economies that he is hosting in Washington on Monday to discuss critical minerals.

Bessent said he had been pressing for a separate meeting on the issue since last summer's summit of G7 leaders, and finance ministers had already held a virtual meeting in December.

India was also invited to attend the meeting, Bessent told Reuters in an interview after touring the Minneapolis-area engineering lab of RV and boat maker Winnebago Industries. He said he was unsure if it had accepted the invitation.

It was not immediately clear which other countries had been invited.

The G7 includes the United States, Britain, Japan, France, Germany, Italy and Canada, as well as the European Union, most of whom are heavily dependent on rare earths supplies from China. The group last June agreed on an action plan to secure their supply chains and boost their economies.

Australia signed an agreement with the U.S. in October aimed at countering China's dominance in critical minerals. It included an $8.5 billion project pipeline and leverages Australia's proposed strategic reserve, which will supply metals like rare earths and lithium that are vulnerable to disruption.

Canberra has said it has subsequently received interest from Europe, Japan, South Korea and Singapore.

China dominates the critical minerals supply chain, refining between 47% and 87% of copper, lithium, cobalt, graphite and rare earths, according to the International Energy Agency. These minerals are used in defense technologies, semiconductors, renewable energy components, batteries and refining processes.

Western countries have sought to reduce their dependence on China's critical minerals in recent years, given moves by China to impose strict export controls on rare earths.

Monday's meeting comes days after reports that China had begun restricting exports to Japanese companies of rare earths and powerful magnets containing them, as well as banning exports of dual-use items to the Japanese military.

Bessent said China was still living up to its commitments to purchase U.S. soybeans and ship critical minerals to U.S. firms.</description><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 01:43:54 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/GOZBI5OTVNMVFM6UYR3VVRN6PI.jpg?auth=8e854a9332ea4e9b0b978df34559c2de6b2d97fd0a5b8b71b7d2b9feb73e716d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Bessent says overseas money transfers are fine if people can prove origin of funds</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/bessent-says-overseas-money-transfers-are-fine-if-people-can-prove-origin-funds-2026-01-10/</link><description>SAVAGE, Minnesota, Jan 9 (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department's plan to increase scrutiny of overseas transfers of money should not harm people who can prove the funds did not come from social service payments, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Reuters on Friday.

Bessent on Friday announced the Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) is investigating some money services businesses as part of a crackdown on federal social benefits abuses in Minnesota, while some banks will be audited by the Internal Revenue Service for alleged money laundering.

FinCEN also issued a geographic order increasing scrutiny on banks and money transmitters in Minnesota's Hennepin and Ramsey counties, which will require firms to report additional information on funds transferred outside of the U.S., including FinCEN reports on transactions above $3,000.

Asked if this would have a chilling effect on legitimate remittances made by migrants to families overseas, Bessent said, "No, it shouldn't. Anyone who can prove where the money has come from ... is fine," in an interview after touring the Minneapolis-area engineering lab of RV and boat maker Winnebago Industries (WGO.N) , opens new tab .

Bessent said payments from people who are in the United States legally were usually transferred through the regulated banking system. "You cannot send welfare money from the people of Minnesota to Somalia, right? Like, that just means you're getting too much, or you can't send stolen money."

Remittances account for large percentages of the gross domestic product of many poorer countries, including El Salvador and Somalia.
Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, a Democrat and a vice presidential candidate in the 2024 election, this week announced he will not seek a third term and instead focus on allegations of state welfare fraud that have become a crisis after mounting attacks from Republican U.S. President Donald Trump's administration.

The Trump administration has singled out Walz and Minnesota, including its large population of Somali Americans and Somali immigrants, over allegations of fraud dating to 2020 by some nonprofit groups that administer the state's childcare and other social services programs, backed by federal funding.

At least 56 people have pleaded guilty since federal prosecutors started to bring charges in 2022 under Trump's Democratic predecessor, Joe Biden.</description><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 01:43:56 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BQ32FRM57NLQBBEQCYS3PUQPIU.jpg?auth=425726b6caaf1c5fcc725ecaa14cbf1f3f454760f58433ba49cf0d6dd64281bf&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>NASA, SpaceX set target date for Crew-11’s return to earth</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/nasa-spacex-set-target-date-crew-11s-return-earth-2026-01-10/</link><description>Jan 9 (Reuters) - NASA on Friday said the space agency and SpaceX are targeting to undock the agency’s SpaceX Crew-11 mission from the International Space Station no earlier than 5 p.m. ET (2200 GMT) on Wednesday, January 14, pending weather conditions.

President Donald Trump's threats to seize Greenland have triggered a wave of European solidarity with Denmark. But the crisis has exposed an uncomfortable reality - Denmark is rallying support to protect a territory whose population wants independence, and whose largest opposition party now wants to bypass Copenhagen and negotiate directly with Washington .

"Denmark risks exhausting its foreign policy capital to secure Greenland, only to watch it walk away afterwards," said Mikkel Vedby Rasmussen, a political science professor at University of Copenhagen.

Denmark cannot let Greenland go without losing its geopolitical relevance in the Arctic territory , strategically located between Europe and North America and a critical site for the U.S. ballistic missile defence system.

Yet it may ultimately have nothing to show for its efforts if Greenlanders choose independence - or strike their own deal with Washington.

The stakes extend beyond Denmark's national interests. European allies have rallied behind Denmark not just out of solidarity, but because giving up Greenland would set a dangerous precedent that could embolden other powers to pursue territorial claims against smaller nations, upending the post-1945 world order.

Denmark's foreign ministry declined to comment, but referred to joint remarks by Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and Greenlandic Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen on December 22.

"National borders and the sovereignty of states are rooted in international law," the two leaders said. "They are fundamental principles. You cannot annex another country ... Greenland belongs to the Greenlanders."

This week, Frederiksen said: "If the U.S. chooses to attack another NATO country, everything stops, including NATO and the security the alliance has provided since World War Two."

For now, the Trump administration says all options are on the table, including buying the territory or taking it by force.

Copenhagen professor Rasmussen said any discussion of whether holding on to Greenland is worth the cost has been drowned out by outrage at Trump's threats.

"It is not part of the political debate in Denmark. I fear we have gone into patriotic overdrive," he said.

During the Cold War, Greenland's strategic location gave Denmark outsized influence in Washington and allowed it to maintain lower defence spending than would otherwise be expected of a NATO ally.

This became known as "the Greenland Card", according to a 2017 report by the University of Copenhagen's Centre for Military Studies.

But Greenland's aspirations for self-determination have been brewing since the former colony got greater autonomy and its own parliament in 1979. A 2009 agreement explicitly recognised Greenlanders' right to independence if they choose.

All Greenlandic parties say they want independence, but differ on how, and when, to achieve it.

Trump's pressure has accelerated a timeline that was already in motion, forcing Copenhagen to spend political capital and financial resources on a relationship with an increasingly uncertain endpoint.

"How much should we fight for someone who doesn't really care about us?" Joachim B. Olsen, a political commentator and former Danish lawmaker, told Reuters.

Copenhagen provides an annual block grant of roughly 4.3 billion Danish crowns ($610 million) to Greenland's economy, which is near stagnation with GDP growth of just 0.2% in 2025.

The central bank estimates an annual financing gap of approximately 800 million Danish crowns to make current public finances sustainable. Denmark also covers police, the justice system and defence - bringing total annual spending to just under $1 billion.

In addition, Copenhagen last year announced a 42 billion Danish crowns ($6.54 billion) Arctic defence package in response to U.S. criticism that Denmark has not done enough to protect Greenland.

Some reject framing the relationship in transactional terms , pointing to Denmark's legal and moral obligations under international law and centuries of shared history.

"We're talking about family relations, long history of relations between Denmark and Greenland," said Marc Jacobsen, associate professor at the Royal Danish Defence College. "So this is much more, it's not just about defence and economy, it's about feelings, it's about culture."

Prime Minister Frederiksen faces a difficult balancing act, said Serafima Andreeva, researcher at Oslo-based Fridtjof Nansen Institute.

For now, Denmark has little choice but to stand firm to maintain its diplomatic credibility, but in doing so risks the relationship with the United States at a time "when Russia is an accelerating threat and being on the U.S.'s bad side is no good for anyone in the West".

Frederiksen also faces an election this year, though Greenland has not been a major theme.

"I don't understand why we have to cling to this community with Greenland when they so badly want out of it," Lone Frank, a Danish science writer and broadcaster, told Reuters. "To be completely honest, Greenland doesn't inspire any sense of belonging in me."</description><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 06:31:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/IVB5NKFQ4BLUBPJMTXNK6UZPMI.jpg?auth=ab8d8f4f64245634a5a9c990dddd8202fa4ba300acf60c0bbfa942c80ea98207&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Syrian army resumes operation in Aleppo’s Kurdish district after ceasefire collapses</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260110-syria-urges-kurdish-fighters-to-surrender-after-ramping-up-aleppo-operation</link><description>Syria 's army said its operation in a Kurdish neighbourhood of Aleppo was nearing completion early Saturday and urged fighters from the minority to surrender themselves and their weapons.

Government forces began striking the Sheikh Maqsud district overnight after the Kurdish fighters defied a deadline to withdraw during a temporary ceasefire.

A military source told the official SANA news agency that the combing operation in Sheikh Maqsud was "more than 90 percent" complete, and that "a number of SDF members" had been arrested.

In a statement posted by the Ministry of Defence, Syria's army said "the only remaining option for the armed elements in the Sheikh Maqsud area of Aleppo is to surrender themselves and their weapons immediately".

The violence in Syria's second city erupted after efforts to integrate the Kurds ' de facto autonomous administration and military into the country's new government stalled.

Since the start of the fighting on Tuesday, at least 21 civilians have been killed, according to figures from both sides, and tens of thousands have fled Aleppo.

The clashes, some of the most intense since Syria's new Islamist authorities took power, present yet another challenge as the country struggles to reunify after ousting longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad in December 2024.

Both sides blame the other for starting the violence.

Early Friday, Syrian authorities announced a six-hour window for the Kurdish fighters to leave, but they instead refused to "surrender" and vowed to defend their districts.

In response, Syria's army warned it would renew strikes on military targets in Sheikh Maqsud and urged civilians to get out ahead of the district's takeover by security forces.

An AFP correspondent saw residents laden with belongings fleeing before the two-hour humanitarian corridor closed.

Kurdish forces reported coming under artillery and drone attacks and claimed in a post on social media to be mounting a "fierce and ongoing resistance".

The army said three soldiers had been killed by Kurdish forces, while state television accused them of launching drones on residential areas of Aleppo.

A flight suspension at Aleppo airport was extended until late Saturday.

The SDF controls swathes of Syria's oil-rich north and northeast, and was key to the defeat of the Islamic State group in 2019.

But Ankara views its main component as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which agreed last year to end its four-decade armed struggle against Turkey.

Elham Ahmad, a senior official in the Kurdish administration in Syria's northeast, accused Syria's authorities of "choosing the path of war" by attacking Kurdish districts and of "seeking to put an end to the agreements that have been reached".

"We are committed to them and we are seeking to implement them," she told AFP.

The March integration agreement was meant to be implemented last year, but differences, including Kurdish demands for decentralised rule, have stymied progress.

Ahmad said that "the United States is playing a mediating role... we hope they will apply pressure to reach an agreement".

A diplomatic source told AFP that US envoy Tom Barrack was headed to Damascus.

Turkey, which shares a 900-kilometre (550-mile) border with Syria, has launched successive offensives to push Kurdish forces from the frontier.

UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric expressed alarm over the impact of the fighting on civilians and called on all parties "to swiftly return to negotiations to ensure the full implementation of the 10 March agreement".

Nanar Hawach, senior Syria analyst at the International Crisis Group, said the renewed clashes cast doubt on the government's ability to gain the trust of minority factions and sow the country back together after 14 years of civil war.

"If the fighting escalates, international actors will wonder about Damascus's capacity to govern Syria's heterogeneous society," he added.

Syria's authorities have committed to protecting minorities, but sectarian bloodshed rocked the Alawite and Druze communities last year.</description><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 06:32:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/98de8d5a-edde-11f0-a6bf-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/59c90a692234364fa10c19db42ddc07368fca7f9.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>New video filmed by ICE agent emerges of Minnesota woman’s killing</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260110-new-video-filmed-by-ice-agent-emerges-of-minnesota-woman-s-killing</link><description>A Minnesota prosecutor on Friday called on the public to share with investigators any recordings and evidence connected to the fatal shooting of Renee Good as a new video emerged showing the final moments of her encounter with an immigration officer.

The Minneapolis killing and a separate shooting in Portland, Oregon, a day later by the Border Patrol have set off protests in multiple cities and denunciations of immigration enforcement tactics by the US government. The Trump administration has defended the officer who shot Good in her car, saying he was protecting himself and fellow agents.

The reaction to the shooting has largely been focused on witness cellphone video of the encounter. A new, 47-second video that was published online by a Minnesota-based conservative news site, Alpha News, and later reposted on social media by the Department of Homeland Security shows the shooting from the perspective of ICE officer Jonathan Ross, who fired the shots.

Sirens blaring in the background, he approaches and circles Good’s vehicle in the middle of the road while apparently filming on his cellphone. At the same time, Good’s wife also was recording the encounter and can be seen walking around the vehicle and approaching the officer. A series of exchanges occurred:

“That’s fine, I’m not mad at you,” Good says as the officer passes by her door. She has one hand on the steering wheel and the other outside the open driver side window.

“US citizen, former f---ing veteran,” says her wife, standing outside the passenger side of the SUV holding up her phone. “You wanna come at us, you wanna come at us, I say go get yourself some lunch big boy.”

Other officers are approaching the driver’s side of the car at about the same time and one says: “Get out of the car, get out of the f---ing car.” Ross is now at the front driver side of the vehicle. Good reverses briefly, then turns the steering wheel toward the passenger side as she drives ahead and Ross opens fire.

The camera becomes unsteady and points toward the sky and then returns to the street view showing Good’s SUV careening away.

“F---ing b---,” someone at the scene says.

A crashing sound is heard as Good’s vehicle smashes into others parked on the street.

Federal agencies have encouraged officers to document encounters in which people may attempt to interfere with enforcement actions, but policing experts have cautioned that recording on a handheld device can complicate already volatile situations by occupying an officer’s hands and narrowing focus at moments when rapid decision-making is required.

Under an ICE policy directive, officers and agents are expected to activate body-worn cameras at the start of enforcement activities and to record throughout interactions, and footage must be kept for review in serious incidents such as deaths or use-of-force cases.

The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to questions about whether the officer who opened fire or any of the others who were on the scene were wearing body cameras.

Vice President JD Vance and Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in posts on X that the new video backs their contention that the officer fired in self-defence.

“Many of you have been told this law enforcement officer wasn’t hit by a car, wasn’t being harassed, and murdered an innocent woman,” Vance said. “The reality is that his life was endangered and he fired in self defense.”

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey has said any self-defense argument is “garbage.”

Policing experts said the video didn’t change their thoughts on the use-of-force but did raise additional questions about the officer’s training.

“Now that we can see he’s holding a gun in one hand and a cellphone in the other filming, I want to see the officer training that permits that,” said Geoff Alpert, a criminology professor at the University of South Carolina.

The video demonstrates that the officers didn’t perceive Good to be a threat, said John P. Gross, a professor at the University of Wisconsin Law School who has written extensively about officers shooting at moving vehicles.

“If you are an officer who views this woman as a threat, you don’t have one hand on a cellphone. You don’t walk around this supposed weapon, casually filming,” Gross said.

Ross, 43, is an Iraq War veteran who has served in the Border Patrol and ICE for nearly two decades. He was injured last year when he was dragged by a driver fleeing an immigration arrest.

Attempts to reach Ross at phone numbers and email addresses associated with him were not successful.

Meanwhile, Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty said that although her office has collaborated effectively with the FBI in past cases, she is concerned by the Trump administration's decision to bar state and local agencies from playing any role in the investigation into Good's killing.

She also said the officer who shot Good in the head does not have complete legal immunity, as Vance declared.

“We do have jurisdiction to make this decision with what happened in this case,” Moriarty said at a news conference. “It does not matter that it was a federal law enforcement agent.”

Moriarty said her office would post a link for the public to submit footage of the shooting, even though she acknowledged that she wasn't sure what legal outcome submissions might produce.

Good's wife, Becca Good, released a statement to Minnesota Public Radio on Friday saying, “kindness radiated out of her.”

"On Wednesday, January 7th, we stopped to support our neighbors. We had whistles. They had guns," Becca Good said.

“I am now left to raise our son and to continue teaching him, as Renee believed, that there are people building a better world for him,” she wrote.

The reaction to Good's shooting was immediate in the city where police killed George Floyd in 2020, with hundreds of protesters converging on the shooting scene and the school district canceling classes for the rest of the week as a precaution and offering an online option through Feb. 12.

On Friday, protesters were outside a federal facility serving as a hub for the immigration crackdown that began Tuesday in Minneapolis and St. Paul. That evening, hundreds protested and marched outside two hotels in downtown Minneapolis where immigration enforcement agents were supposed to be staying. Some people were seen breaking or spray painting windows and state law enforcement officers wearing helmets and holding batons ordered the remaining group of fewer than 100 people to leave late Friday.

The Portland shooting happened outside a hospital Thursday. A federal border officer shot and wounded a man and woman in a vehicle, identified by the Department of Homeland Security as Venezuela nationals Luis David Nico Moncada and Yorlenys Betzabeth Zambrano-Contreras.

Police said they were in stable condition Friday after surgery, with DHS saying Nico Moncada was taken into FBI custody.

DHS defended the actions of its officers in Portland, saying the shooting occurred after the driver with alleged gang ties tried to “weaponize” his vehicle to hit them. It said no officers were injured.

Portland Police Chief Bob Day confirmed that the two people shot had “some nexus” to Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang. Day said they came to the attention of police during an investigation of a July shooting believed to have been carried out by gang members, but they were not identified as suspects.

The chief said any gang affiliation did not necessarily justify the shooting by US Border Patrol. The Oregon Department of Justice said it would investigate.

On Friday evening, hundreds of protesters marched to the ICE building in Portland.

The Minneapolis shooting happened on the second day of the immigration crackdown in the Twin Cities, which Homeland Security said is the biggest immigration enforcement operation ever. More than 2,000 officers are taking part and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said they have made more than 1,500 arrests.

The government is also shifting immigration officers to Minneapolis from sweeps in Louisiana, according to documents obtained by The Associated Press. This represents a pivot, as the Louisiana crackdown that began in December had been expected to last into February.

Good's death — at least the fifth tied to immigration sweeps since President Donald Trump took office — has resonated far beyond Minneapolis. More protests are planned for this weekend, according to Indivisible, a group formed to resist the Trump administration.</description><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 07:20:07 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/859074e0-edeb-11f0-936d-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26009843919737.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Fatal ICE shooting of Minneapolis activist sets stage for national protests</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/fatal-ice-shooting-minneapolis-activist-sets-stage-national-protests-2026-01-10/</link><description>MINNEAPOLIS, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Civil liberties and migrant-rights groups called for nationwide rallies on Saturday to protest the fatal shooting of an activist in Minnesota by a U.S. immigration agent, as state authorities opened their own investigation of the killing.

Protest organizers said more than 1,000 weekend events were planned across the country demanding an end to large-scale deployments of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents ordered by President Donald Trump, mostly to cities led by Democratic politicians.

Minneapolis became a major flashpoint of the Republican president's militarized deportation roundups on Wednesday, when an ICE officer shot and killed a 37-year-old mother of three , Renee Good, behind the wheel of her car on a residential street.

The violence came soon after some 2,000 federal officers were dispatched to Minneapolis in what ICE's parent agency, the Department of Homeland Security, called the "largest DHS operation ever." Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, a Democrat, condemned the deployment as a "reckless" example of "governance by reality TV."

At the time, Good was participating in one of numerous "neighborhood patrols" that track, monitor and record ICE activities, according to family and local activists.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and other Trump administration officials said Good was "impeding" and "stalking" ICE agents all day, and that the officer opened fire in self-defense when she tried to ram her car into him in an "act of domestic terrorism."

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, a Democrat, pointed to bystander video he said directly contradicted the federal government's "garbage narrative." Civil liberties advocates said the video showed federal agents lacked any justification for using deadly force.

Amid the sharply differing accounts of the shooting, Minnesota and Hennepin County law enforcement authorities said on Friday they were opening their own criminal inquiry of the incident separate from a federal investigation led by the FBI.

Some Trump administration officials, including Vice President JD Vance, asserted state prosecutors lack jurisdiction to charge a federal officer with a crime, though legal experts say federal immunity in such cases is not automatic.

The crisis atmosphere led Walz - a prominent Trump antagonist who branded Trump and his Republican allies as "weird" during his own run for vice president last year - to put the state's National Guard on alert.

Federal-state tensions escalated further on Thursday when a U.S. Border Patrol agent in Portland, Oregon, shot and wounded a man and woman in their car after an attempted vehicle stop. As in the Minneapolis incident, DHS said the driver had tried to "weaponize" his vehicle and run over agents.

DHS on Friday identified the wounded driver and passenger as suspected gang associates from Venezuela who were in the U.S. illegally. The agency said the woman had been involved in a prior shootout in Portland but provided no evidence of its allegations against the pair.

Portland Mayor Keith Wilson, echoing Frey, said he could not be sure the government's account was grounded in fact without an independent investigation.

The deployment of agents to Minneapolis follows Trump's recent denunciations of Walz and his state's large population of Somali immigrants over allegations of fraud dating back to 2020 by some nonprofit groups administering childcare and other social service programs.

Good was shot dead just a few blocks from where George Floyd was killed by a Minneapolis police officer crushing his neck into the pavement with his knee during a videotaped arrest in May 2020. Floyd's death sparked months of nationwide racial-justice protests during Trump's first term in office.

Bystander video of the Minneapolis incident showed masked officers approaching Good's Honda SUV while it was stopped at a perpendicular angle to the street, partially blocking traffic.

One agent is seen ordering her out of the car and grabbing onto the driver-side front door handle as the car pulls forward and steers away from the officers, one of whom jumps back and fires three shots into the front of the vehicle as it rolls past.

Video filmed by the officer who opened fire, identified through official comment and public records as Jonathan Ross, shows Good appearing calm. She is heard telling him, "That's fine, dude, I'm not mad at you" - moments before he opens fire as she drives forward into the street, steering the car away from him.

Noem has said he was treated at a local hospital for unspecified injuries and released.

The car's front bumper appears in the bystander video to pass Ross before he shot at Good. It is unclear from any of the footage whether the vehicle made contact with him.

In any case, Ross is shown remaining on his feet and can be seen walking after the incident, contradicting Trump's assertion on social media that the woman "ran over the ICE officer."

The two DHS-related shootings this week have drawn thousands of protesters to the streets of Minneapolis, Portland and other U.S. cities, with many more demonstrations under the banner "ICE Out For Good" planned for Saturday and Sunday.

The rallies were being organized by a coalition of groups including the American Civil Liberties Union, MoveOn Civic Action, Voto Latino, and Indivisible, some of which were at the forefront of "No Kings" protests against Trump last year.</description><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 07:40:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5ECQRUDDDZLNZAXMOFN75PUNF4.jpg?auth=52540f51b34d4d208d8adcb907e84a564dee11ac4c8b0a739aa343f9525c7860&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Death toll in Philippines landfill collapse rises to 4</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/death-toll-philippines-landfill-collapse-rises-4-2026-01-10/</link><description>CEBU CITY, Philippines, Jan 10 (Reuters) - The death toll from a landfill collapse in the central Philippines has risen to four, an official said on Saturday, as rescue efforts continued for dozens who remained missing.

The Binaliw landfill in the central city of Cebu collapsed on Thursday, with 110 workers on site at the time. Several structures and facilities inside the landfill were damaged during the collapse.

Cebu City Mayor Nestor Archival said in a Facebook post on Saturday the death toll had risen to four and that 12 others had been sent to hospitals.

"Authorities confirmed ... detected signs of life in specific areas, requiring continued careful excavation and the deployment of a more advanced 50-ton crane," Archival said.

Thirty-six people were missing based on a Friday tally. An update on the number of missing was not immediately available.

Families of the missing workers remained hopeful on Saturday that they would be found alive.

Jerahmey Espinoza, whose husband was among the missing, went to the landfill in hopes of finding him.

"They haven't seen him or located him ever since the disaster happened. We're still hopeful that he's alive," Espinoza said.</description><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 07:40:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/T75O532YAZKZVMH73DR3SZYPSU.jpg?auth=7fb1e6332ecbb692d1c4d51c11f60c9174070de0fea3b3af8d03b960e690e23b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Syrian army says it finished combing through Aleppo neighbourhood, signalling takeover from Kurdish forces</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/syrian-army-says-it-finished-combing-through-aleppo-neighbourhood-signalling-2026-01-10/</link><description>Jan 10 (Reuters) - The Syrian army has combed through Aleppo city's Sheikh Maksoud district, it said on Saturday, signalling it had seized the area from Kurdish fighters by force after a temporary ceasefire failed to end to days of deadly fighting.

The violence in the second city has deepened one of the main faultlines in Syria, where President Ahmed al-Sharaa's promise to unify the country under one leadership after 14 years of war has faced resistance from Kurdish forces wary of his Islamist-led government.

The U.S. and other world powers welcomed a ceasefire earlier in the week, but Kurdish forces refused to leave the last stronghold of Sheikh Maksoud under the deal. Syria's army said late on Friday it would conduct a ground operation to expel them.

Early on Saturday, Syria's army said it had finished combing through the district, but that some Kurdish fighters were still in hiding. In a written statement, Kurdish forces denied the government had captured Sheikh Maksoud and said they were still resisting. Reuters reporters in the city did not hear the sound of clashes.

The takeover of Sheikh Maksoud by the army would end Kurdish control over pockets of Aleppo held by Kurdish forces since Syria's war erupted in 2011. Kurdish forces still hold large parts of Syria's northeast, where they run a semi-autonomous zone.

They have resisted efforts to integrate into Syria's new government, made up of former rebel fighters who ousted longtime leader Bashar al-Assad in December 2024. With negotiations on their merging stalled, fighting erupted in Aleppo on Tuesday, leaving at least nine civilians dead and forcing more than 140,000 to flee.

The move comes after governments and regulators from Europe to Asia have condemned and some have opened inquiries into sexualised content on the app.

xAI, the startup behind Grok, said on Thursday it was restricting image generation and editing to paying subscribers as it tried to fix safeguard lapses that had allowed sexualised outputs including depictions of scantily clad children.

"The government views the practice of non-consensual sexual deepfakes as a serious violation of human rights, dignity, and the security of citizens in the digital space," Communications and Digital Minister Meutya Hafid said in a statement.

The ministry has also summoned X officials to discuss the matter.

Musk said on X that anyone using Grok to make illegal content would suffer the same consequences as if they had uploaded illegal content.

xAI replied to Reuters' email seeking comment with what seemed to be an automated response: "Legacy Media Lies". X did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Indonesia, with the world's biggest Muslim population, has strict rules that ban the sharing online of content deemed obscene.</description><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 07:41:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BBH6UACQQFNVVAQQ6SG5OKMBAY.jpg?auth=ad2d8a1b2af9a85eb649f6d96c50106c6b57c21f437b3fa50788b88116879f37&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israel's Netanyahu hopes to 'taper' Israel off US military aid in next decade</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israels-netanyahu-hopes-taper-israel-off-us-military-aid-next-decade-2026-01-10/</link><description>JERUSALEM, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in an interview published on Friday that he hopes to "taper off" Israeli dependence on American military aid in the next decade.

Netanyahu has said Israel should not be reliant on foreign military aid but has stopped short of declaring a firm timeline for when Israel would be fully independent from the U.S.

"I want to taper off the military within the next 10 years," Netanyahu told the Economist. Asked if that meant a tapering "down to zero," he said, "Yes."

Netanyahu said he told President Donald Trump during a recent visit that Israel "very deeply" appreciates "the military aid that America has given us over the years, but here too we've come of age and we've developed incredible capacities."

In December, Netanyahu said Israel would spend 350 billion shekels ($110 billion) on developing an independent arms industry to reduce dependency on other countries.

In 2016, the U.S. and Israeli governments signed a memorandum of understanding for the 10 years through September 2028 that provides $38 billion in military aid, $33 billion in grants to buy military equipment and $5 billion for missile defence systems.

Israeli defence exports rose 13% last year, with major contracts signed for Israeli defence technology including its advanced multi-layered aerial defence systems.</description><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 08:27:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HYGINXS4IVMODAI7YY2VEKGKPI.jpg?auth=734d1f41f35db01760eb134b58a4dcdf96a7bc553cd8b80cb8c41adea3b42f17&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukraine drone strike causes fire at oil depot in Russia's Volgograd region, authorities say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/ukraine-drone-strike-causes-fire-oil-depot-russias-volgograd-region-authorities-2026-01-10/</link><description>MOSCOW, Jan 10 (Reuters) - A drone strike by Ukraine caused a fire at an oil depot in the Oktyabrskiy district in the southern part of Russia's Volgograd region, regional authorities said on Saturday.

Ukraine has been targeting Russia's energy infrastructure in recent months, aiming to cut off Moscow's ability to finance its military campaign against Kyiv.

"We don't want to be Americans, we don't want to be Danish, we want to be Greenlanders," the leaders of five parties in parliament said in a joint statement.

"The future of Greenland must be decided by Greenlanders," they added.

The statement came hours after Trump once again asserted that the US needs to own Greenland.

"We are going to do something ​on Greenland whether they like it or not. Because ‍if we don't do it, Russia or China will take over Greenland, and we're not ​going to have Russia or China as a neighbour," Trump ​told reporters at the White House while meeting with oil company executives.

Trump said the US must acquire Greenland, even though it already has a military presence on the island under a 1951 agreement. The island of 57,000 people is an autonomous territory of ‍the Kingdom of Denmark.

"You defend ownership. You don't defend leases," Trump added.

Denmark and other European allies have voiced shock at Trump's threats to take control of Greenland, where the US already has a military base.

Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has warned that an invasion of Greenland would end "everything", meaning the transatlantic NATO defence pact and the post-World War II security structure.

On Tuesday, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, Britain and Denmark issued ‌a joint statement, ​saying only Greenland and Denmark can decide matters regarding their relations.

Trump has made light of the concerns of Denmark, a steadfast US ally that joined the United States in the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

"I'm a fan of Denmark, too, I have to tell you. And you know, they've been very nice to me," Trump said.

"But you know, the fact that they had a boat land there 500 years ago doesn't mean that they own the land."

The latest joint statement by Greenland's top political parties comes as US Secretary of State Marco Rubio is due to meet next week with Denmark's foreign minister and representatives from Greenland.

NATO chief Mark Rutte on Friday discussed efforts to bolster Arctic security with Rubio ahead of newt week's discussions.

NATO has sought to deflect Washington's interest in Greenland by emphasising steps it is taking to bolster security in the region.

A NATO spokeswoman said Rutte spoke with Rubio "on the importance of the Arctic to our shared security and how NATO is working to enhance our capabilities in the High North."

While Denmark's prime minister has warned that an armed US attack to take Greenland could spell the end for the 76-year-old Western military alliance, the head of NATO's forces in Europe, US General Alexus Grynkewich, said Friday the alliance was far from being in "a crisis".</description><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 08:30:12 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/476439ba-edf8-11f0-9d68-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/000-89VG9WE.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China, Russia, Iran start 'BRICS Plus' naval exercises in South African waters</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-russia-iran-start-brics-plus-naval-exercises-south-african-waters-2026-01-10/</link><description>JOHANNESBURG, Jan 10 (Reuters) - China, Russia and Iran began a week of joint naval exercises in South Africa's waters on Saturday in what the host country described as a BRICS Plus operation to "ensure the safety of shipping and maritime economic activities".

BRICS Plus is an expansion of a geopolitical bloc originally comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa - and seen by members as a counterweight to U.S. and Western economic dominance - to include six other countries.

Though South Africa routinely carries out naval exercises with China and Russia, it comes at a time of heightened tensions between U.S. President Donald Trump's administration and several BRICS Plus countries, including China , Iran , South Africa and Brazil .

The expanded BRICS group also includes Egypt, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Ethiopia and the United Arab Emirates.

Chinese military officials leading the opening ceremony said Brazil, Egypt and Ethiopia participated as observers.

"Exercise WILL FOR PEACE 2026 brings together navies from BRICS Plus countries for ... joint maritime safety operations (and) interoperability drills," South Africa's military said in a statement.

Lieutenant Colonel Mpho Mathebula, acting spokesperson for joint operations, told Reuters all members had been invited.

Trump has accused the BRICS nations of pursuing "anti-American" polities, and last January threatened all members with a 10% trade tariff on top of duties he was already imposing on countries across the world.

The pro-Western Democratic Alliance, the second largest party in South African President Cyril Ramaphosa's coalition, said the exercises "contradict our stated neutrality" and that BRICS had "rendered South Africa a pawn in the power games being waged by rogue states on the international stage".

Mathebula rejected that criticism.

"This is not a political arrangement ... there is no hostility (towards the U.S.)," Mathebula told Reuters, pointing out that South Africa has also periodically carried out exercises with the U.S. Navy.

"It's a naval exercise. The intention is for us to improve our capabilities and share information," she said.</description><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 08:50:58 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/QRZREBZPAVND5ITNSIAIHQDA6M.jpg?auth=3ecf8efd8c78fdf146d0f02989f113a94b731328db9e138309a28e0ad3b6112b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UN says 53 Congolese refugees have died in Burundi</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/un-says-53-congolese-refugees-have-died-burundi-2026-01-10/</link><description>KINSHASA, Jan 10 - More than 50 refugees fleeing fighting in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo have died in neighbouring Burundi, the United Nations Refugee Agency told Reuters late on Friday.

Of a total 53 deaths recorded, 25 people died due to a cholera outbreak, the agency said, while six others died from anemia and other complications related to malnutrition, it said.

The U.N. said it was working with the health ministry and other partners to investigate the cause of the other deaths.

More than 100,000 Congolese have sought refuge in Burundi since fighting near the border intensified in early December and rebels seized the town of Uvira, the UNHCR said.

Jean Jacques Purusi, governor of South Kivu province where Uvira is located, described the situation in Burundi as "misery" and "a crisis completely forgotten by the international community and media."

Congo's state and social affairs ministry said it was leading a humanitarian mission to help displaced Congolese in Burundi, providing food, medicines, and non-food items.

A spokesperson for Burundi's National Office of Protection of Refugees and Stateless Persons did not answer calls or respond to a texted request for comment.</description><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 09:21:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran's army vows to protect public property as Tehran seeks to quell growing unrest</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/irans-army-vows-protect-public-property-tehran-seeks-quell-growing-unrest-2026-01-10/</link><description>DUBAI, Jan 10 (Reuters) - The Iranian army said on Saturday it would safeguard strategic infrastructure and public property and urged Iranians to thwart "the enemy's plots", as the clerical establishment steps up efforts to quell the country's biggest protests in years.

The Iranian military statement came after U.S. President Donald Trump issued a new warning to Iran's leaders on Friday, and after Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Saturday declared: "The United States supports the brave people of Iran."

Unrest continued overnight. State media said a municipal building was set on fire in Karaj, west of Tehran, and blamed "rioters". State TV broadcast footage of funerals of members of the security forces it said were killed in protests in the cities of Shiraz, Qom and Hamedan.

Authorities continued to impose an internet blackout.

A witness in western Iran reached by phone said the Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) were deployed and opening fire in the area from which they were speaking, declining to be identified for their safety.

The Iranian military operates separately to the IRGC - an elite force tasked with defending Iran's Islamic Revolution and which authorities have deployed to quell previous unrest. Both forces are commanded by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

In a statement published by semi-official news sites, the military accused Israel and "hostile terrorist groups" of seeking to "undermine the country's public security".

"The Army, under the command of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief, together with other armed forces, in addition to monitoring enemy movements in the region, will resolutely protect and safeguard national interests, the country’s strategic infrastructure, and public property," it said.

The protests have spread across much of Iran over the last two weeks, beginning in response to soaring inflation, but quickly turned political with protesters calling for clerical rulers to step down. Authorities have accused the U.S. and Israel of fomenting the "riots".

Iranian rights group HRANA said it had documented 65 deaths including 50 protesters and 15 security personnel as of January 9. The Norway-based human rights group Hengaw said more than 2,500 people had been arrested over the past two weeks.

In a country with a history of fragmented opposition to clerical rule, the son of the last shah of Iran who was toppled in the 1979 Islamic revolution has emerged as a prominent voice abroad spurring on the protests.

In his latest appeal on the X social media platform, U.S.-based Reza Pahlavi said: "Our goal is no longer merely to come into the streets; the goal is to prepare to seize city centres and hold them."

He also called on "workers and employees in key sectors of the economy, especially transportation, and oil, and gas and energy", to begin a nationwide strike.

Trump said on Thursday he was not inclined to meet Pahlavi, a sign that he was waiting to see how the crisis plays out before backing an opposition leader.

Trump, who bombed Iran last summer and warned Tehran last week the U.S. could come to the protesters' aid, issued another warning on Friday, saying: "You better not start shooting because we'll start shooting too."

"I just hope the protesters in Iran are going to be safe, because that's a very dangerous place right now," he added.

Some protesters on the streets have shouted slogans in support of Pahlavi, such as "Long live the shah", although most chants have called for an end to rule by the clerics or demanded action to fix an economy hammered by years of U.S. and other international sanctions and pummelled by the 12-day war in June, when Israel and the U.S. launched air strikes on Iran.

A doctor in northwestern Iran said that since Friday, large numbers of injured protesters had been brought to hospitals. Some were badly beaten, suffering head injuries and broken legs and arms, as well as deep cuts.

At least 20 people in one hospital had been shot with live ammunition, five of whom later died.

On Friday, Khamenei accused protesters of acting on behalf of Trump, saying rioters were attacking public properties and warning that Tehran would not tolerate people acting as "mercenaries for foreigners".

The Revolutionary Guards’ public relations office said three members of the Basij security force were killed and five wounded during clashes with what it described as “armed rioters” in Gachsaran, in the southwest.

Another security officer was stabbed to death in Hamedan, in western Iran. The son of a senior officer, Brigadier General Martyr Nourali Shoushtari, was killed in the Ahmadabad area of Mashhad, in the northeast. Two other security personnel were killed over the past two nights in Shushtar, in Khuzestan province.

The protests pose the biggest internal challenge in at least three years to Iran's clerical rulers, who look more vulnerable than during past bouts of unrest amid a dire economic situation and after last year's war.

The leaders of France, Britain and Germany issued a joint statement on Friday condemning the killing of protesters and urged the Iranian authorities to refrain from violence.

Authorities have described protests over the economy as legitimate while condemning what they call violent rioters and cracking down with security forces.

Iran's clerical establishment has weathered repeated past bouts of unrest, including student protests in 1999, over a disputed election in 2009, against economic hardships in 2019, and the 2022 Woman, Life, Freedom protests.</description><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 10:21:31 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/L7ZSOOIGQRJWXF7KUO67PMR42E.jpg?auth=ad9f7115cc051c0b3f6fa0ca25dfa39eaa660197ac009e0138f26ddadf3aa08e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Exclusive: CIA highlighted Cuba's grim economy but gave mixed view on government falling</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/cia-highlighted-cubas-grim-economy-gave-mixed-view-government-falling-2026-01-10/</link><description>MIAMI/WASHINGTON, Jan 10 (Reuters) - U.S. intelligence has painted a grim picture of Cuba’s economic and political situation, but its assessments offer no clear support for President Donald Trump’s prediction that last weekend’s military action in nearby Venezuela leaves the island nation “ready to fall,” said three people familiar with the confidential assessments.

The CIA’s view is that key sectors of the Cuban economy, such as agriculture and tourism, are severely strained by frequent blackouts, trade sanctions and other problems. The potential loss of oil imports and other support from Venezuela, for decades a key ally, could make governing more difficult for the administration that has ruled Cuba since Fidel Castro led a revolution in 1959.

But the most recent CIA assessments were inconclusive on whether the worsening economy would destabilize the government, said the people familiar with the intelligence, speaking on the condition of anonymity to share sensitive information.

CUBA 'READY TO FALL': TRUMP

These assessments are notable because Trump and other U.S. officials have suggested that shutting off Venezuelan oil to the island after the Caracas operation could topple the government in Havana, a longtime dream of Secretary of State Marco Rubio and some other high-ranking officials in the Trump administration.

"Cuba looks like it is ready to fall," Trump told reporters on Air Force One on Sunday. "I don't know if they're going to hold out, but Cuba now has no income. They got all their income from Venezuela, from the Venezuelan oil."

The White House, the CIA and the Cuban Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not respond to requests for comment. Reuters could not determine if the CIA had produced an updated assessment since U.S. forces arrested Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro last Saturday.

Venezuela is Cuba's top oil supplier. Since Maduro's capture, the U.S. has successfully pressed Venezuelan interim President Delcy Rodriguez to send essentially all of Venezuela's oil to the U.S.

Given the dire assessments of Cuba's energy situation even when Venezuelan oil was flowing to the island, the impacts of Caracas' shifting oil flows on Cuba's economy will be severe, independent analysts say.

Cuba's Communist economy has performed poorly for decades amid rigid state planning and a U.S. embargo.

But a confluence of factors in recent years - including Venezuela's declining economy and a drop-off in tourism following the COVID-19 outbreak - has compounded Cuba's pain.

The people who were familiar with the intelligence and spoke to Reuters said the CIA had described Cuba's economy in very poor terms - although their descriptions differed in degree. One official said the situation described in the assessments was not quite as bad as the "Special Period" of the 1990s, a time of prolonged economic pain following the withdrawal of the Soviet Union's support in the late 1980s and early 1990s.

One of the officials, however, said blackouts were lasting on average 20 hours a day outside of Havana, which had not occurred previously.

Whether or not economic suffering actually leads to government change is unclear - a reality acknowledged in the CIA assessments.

Two U.S. officials said the U.S. government assessed that there has been a demographic collapse on the island in recent years, with large numbers of people under 50 having migrated from Cuba. That could blunt the push for political reform, which in other countries tends to draw energy from young people.

Cuba's census estimated the population at over 10 million in 2023, but one of the officials said it likely now stands at less than 9 million.

Richard Feinberg, a professor emeritus at the University of California San Diego who served in high-ranking U.S. national security roles for decades, said economic conditions in Cuba were "certainly very bad."

He noted that Cuba’s President, Miguel Díaz-Canel, who took office in 2021, does not have the widespread legitimacy enjoyed by former leader Fidel Castro.

"When a population is really hungry, what it does is, your day-to-day is just about survival. You don't think about politics, all you think about is putting bread on the table for your family," Feinberg said.

"On the other hand, people can become so desperate that they lose their fear, and they take to the streets."</description><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 10:21:52 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/VOYHKQ35ZJNXPJL7SGTQNPXTJY.jpg?auth=987a70091ea5b9b3c86cc5fa83d9d19aa74269ef99ab4b677f50337725cff41e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Governor of Russia's Belgorod region says 600,000 without power, heat, or water after Ukrainian strike</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/governor-russias-belgorod-region-says-600000-without-power-heat-or-water-after-2026-01-10/</link><description /><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 10:23:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Swiss canton leader voices anger over lack of checks at bar that caught fire</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/swiss-canton-leader-voices-anger-over-lack-checks-bar-that-caught-fire-2026-01-10/</link><description>ZURICH, Jan 10 (Reuters) - The leader of the Swiss canton where a bar fire killed 40 people voiced anger over local authorities' failure to inspect the venue for six years, as prosecutors step up efforts to hold those responsible to account.

The mayor of the ski resort of Crans-Montana said this week the "Le Constellation" bar had not been inspected since 2019, and Mathias Reynard, head of the Canton Valais government, expressed dismay at this in a local newspaper interview.

"I was angry, obviously," he told Le Temps, when asked about the missing checks. "At these serious failings. And I think it's normal to be angry. But we have to let justice take its course."

This week the Valais head of security said soundproofing foam in the basement of the bar that caught fire during New Year celebrations should have been subject to safety checks by law, contradicting Crans-Montana's mayor. Most victims were teenagers.

Prosecutors on Friday ordered the detention of Jacques Moretti, one of the bar's two French owners. A court will decide soon whether to place him under formal arrest.

Prosecutors are investigating the owners on suspicion of crimes including homicide by negligence. Victims' families have filed legal complaints over the fire.

Jessica Moretti, Jacques' partner, apologised to victims on Friday. The pair have said they are devastated by the tragedy.

Calls have intensified in Switzerland for those responsible to face justice. Critics of the investigation have questioned why both owners were free for so long.

"Those responsible will have to take responsibility, including the relevant authorities," Reynard said.</description><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 10:23:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/UEVJLBXSJ5PFBKWVMG564JPU3I.jpg?auth=2bbee4a48c5dda040e0a078eb9229324d2f2ce19071160e21fe9eb3371d3858d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Greenlanders voice concern after Trump reiterates goal to own island</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/greenlanders-voice-concern-after-trump-reiterates-goal-to-own-island</link><description /><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 10:24:03 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/b9f6245a-ee09-11f0-8c54-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260110-100841-101034-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Protests roil Iran despite nationwide internet blackout</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/protests-roil-iran-despite-nationwide-internet-blackout</link><description /><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 10:24:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/b4757eaa-ee08-11f0-a9b9-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260110-100201-100341-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Greenland's parliament will bring forward meeting to discuss US threats, party leaders say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/greenlands-parliament-will-bring-forward-meeting-discuss-us-threats-party-2026-01-10/</link><description>OSLO, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Greenland's parliament will bring forward a meeting to discuss its response to U.S. threats to take control of the Arctic island, the leaders of the five political parties in the Greenlandic assembly said in a joint statement.

President Donald Trump has said the United States must own Greenland, an autonomous part of the Kingdom of Denmark , to prevent Russia or China occupying the strategically located and minerals-rich territory in the future.

"We emphasise once again our desire for the U.S. contempt for our country to end," the leaders of all five political parties elected to Greenland's parliament said in their joint statement late on Friday.

"We do not want to be Americans, we do not want to be Danes, we want to be Greenlanders," they said in the statement, posted on social media by Greenland's prime minister , Jens-Frederik Nielsen.

A meeting of Greenland's parliament, the Inatsisartut, will be brought forward to ensure that a fair and comprehensive political debate takes place and that the people's rights are secured, the leaders said.

The date of the meeting has not yet been determined. Greenland's parliament last met in November and had been scheduled to meet again on February 3, according to its website.

Trump said on Friday he would "do something on Greenland whether they like it or not" and that the U.S. military presence in the island under a 1951 agreement with fellow NATO member Denmark is not enough to guarantee the island's defence.

Trump's renewed push for Greenland, after U.S. military intervention in Venezuela , worries many of the island's 57,000 inhabitants, whose widely held goal is to eventually become an independent nation.

A 2009 agreement between Greenland and Denmark explicitly recognised Greenlanders' right to independence if they choose, but while all five parties say they want independence, they differ on how and when to achieve it.

"We must decide the future of our country ourselves, without pressure for a quick decision, delay or interference from other countries," the party leaders said, adding that they sought dialogue based on diplomacy and international principles.</description><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 10:45:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/Z56QS4EVEVOFZEVRCO7KPYB7IY.jpg?auth=97b643c9eeffaa5c160914119edd160a10192d90d27b1dfe0cadd88ae83a17f0&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Yemen's main separatist group denies disbanding</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/yemens-main-separatist-group-denies-disbanding-2026-01-10/</link><description>CAIRO, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Yemen's main separatist group, the Southern Transitional Council, denied on Saturday it was disbanding, according to a statement posted on X.

Under Trump’s orders to ramp up deportations, masked immigration officers have surged into Democratic-led cities, sprayed tear gas in residential streets , tackled people in parking lots , opens new tab and pointed guns at bystanders trying to film them.

A federal officer in Minneapolis dragged a woman through a snowy street in an incident last month that the city’s police chief called an “egregious disregard for human dignity.”

These contentious encounters, which have come amid a push to quickly recruit and train thousands of new officers , have stemmed from a dramatic shift in the approach to immigration enforcement, according to current and former immigration officials.

The White House demanded a steep increase in immigration arrests in late May, leading officers to change tactics, embracing showy sweeps over more targeted arrests of people with serious criminal records. Since then, officers have been met with more public backlash and resistance, at times creating tense standoffs.

“It’s this high-visibility, high-footprint, high-contact form of operation that invites danger,” said former ICE official Scott Shuchart, who served in Joe Biden’s administration.

Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem have all defended the ICE officer who killed Renee Good , the 37-year-old mother of three, and portrayed her as an agitator trying to disrupt enforcement operations.

Within hours of the incident, Noem alleged that Good tried to ram the officer with her vehicle in an act of “domestic terrorism.”

In response to a Reuters request for comment, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson accused Democrats and news outlets of demonizing ICE officers and encouraging backlash.

"The Democrats’ lies have directly fueled their supporters to harass and impede law enforcement, which is the cause of any tensions and puts officers at risk," Jackson said.

The ICE officer involved in the fatal shooting, Jonathan Ross, fired the first of three shots as Good's vehicle moved past him, a Reuters analysis of the available visuals showed.

Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin defended the Trump administration's approach and said the officer in Minneapolis feared for his life.

“ICE law enforcement officers are trained to use the minimum amount of force necessary to resolve dangerous situations," she said.

One former ICE official who spoke with Reuters blamed Democratic leaders for fueling the backlash by refusing to cooperate with ICE and publicly criticizing their work. Another said it was jarring to see protesters following officers with whistles, trying to disrupt their work. In Minnesota, they have been pelted with snowballs.

The administration is preparing to spend tens of billions of taxpayer dollars to hire more immigration officers and intensify its operations, raising concerns such violence could grow in the coming year. Several current and former ICE officers, speaking on the condition of anonymity to speak openly about sensitive matters, expressed concerns that ICE could bring on less-qualified candidates with its accelerated hiring push.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said earlier this month that it had hired 12,000 new ICE officers on top of an existing force of 10,000, although some questioned whether that many were actually fully hired and working.

DHS' internal watchdog is conducting a review of ICE’s hiring practices, with staff expected to visit the department’s Georgia training facility in coming weeks, one of the former ICE officials said. The new curriculum cuts involved halving training for firearms and tactics, the former ICE official said.

The training for new ICE officers had previously been five months but the Trump administration reduced it to two months as part of its effort to speed up hires, McLaughlin said, adding that it was done to "cut redundancy" and that candidates still meet the same standards.

Even as immigration enforcement becomes more contentious and ICE adds thousands more officers, the agency will have less oversight than in previous years after several DHS oversight bodies experienced mass staffing cuts last year.

Federal immigration officers have shot people in 16 incidents , opens new tab since Trump intensified his crackdown in June, according to The Trace, a non-profit news outlet that tracks gun violence.

In some of the cases, immigration officials said agents were under threat due to vehicles being used as weapons, though video evidence and judges later raised questions about those claims.

The incidents included the fatal shooting in Chicago of a Mexican father of two after dropping off his kids , the shooting of a TikTok streamer in Los Angeles and a U.S. citizen in Chicago .

John Tsoukaris, a former top ICE official who retired in July, said the ICE officer who fired the fatal shots in Minneapolis may have been within the bounds of protocol and that an investigation would be needed to determine the facts.

"In these very stressful and challenging situations, officers have to make a split-second decision," said Tsoukaris, who was a field office director for ICE’s office in Newark, New Jersey. "We should not rush to judgment of the officer’s actions without the full picture."

The Supreme Court in September said the Trump administration could stop people in U.S. cities for reasonable suspicion of violating immigration laws based on factors such as having brown skin or speaking Spanish, a position defended by Justice Brett Kavanaugh in a concurrence at the time.

Opponents of Trump’s aggressive enforcement say such “Kavanaugh stops” by ICE and Border Patrol have inflamed tensions.

Darius Reeves, a former ICE field office director who retired in 2025, said the Trump administration's confrontational approach is putting officers at risk and increasing the likelihood of violent interactions.

Reeves, who spent more than two decades at the agency, said ICE historically tried to minimize its public presence and operate in a more targeted manner.

"We should not be flooding these neighborhoods and antagonizing people," Reeves said. "This is not going to go well.”</description><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 11:17:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/65VZI5UZ3ZI2TBI7ZEBT7CQ7LQ.jpg?auth=d8ae571723f5da02bc209bc3256245d5f74d6b9c43f065f22ba1cecbc489e274&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Kyiv's power, water and heat systems turned off for repairs amid intense cold</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/kyivs-power-water-heat-systems-turned-off-repairs-amid-intense-cold-2026-01-10/</link><description>Jan 10 (Reuters) - Kyiv's electricity system, severely damaged by a winter campaign of Russian bombardment including a strike two nights ago, has been turned off for repairs at the orders of the state grid operator, the city administration said on Saturday amid intense cold weather.

The city's water and heat distribution systems, as well as electrified public transport, have also stopped working as a result of the power outage, the administration said on Telegram. It said repairs were underway, but did not indicate how long the systems would remain shut down.

The architect described a life in Venezuela shaped by fear and violence . “I saw elderly people beaten. I saw friends die,” he said. “Almost all of them have left the country.”

When news broke that Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro had been captured by US forces , Jesus was stunned. Like millions of Venezuelans in exile, he had never truly believed this moment would come – least of all in this way. “I’m not entirely comfortable with it, particularly from a legal standpoint,” he said. “But given Venezuela’s reality, there were few alternatives.”

For others, relief outweighed any hesitation. Maria*, a Venezuelan who has lived in the United Kingdom for nearly 30 years, told The Observers she has long been fiercely opposed to Maduro. For her, his capture marked a long-awaited turning point.

Watch more China loses, but also gains a lot from Trump's Venezuela move, analyst says

“I know everything is not over,” she said. “This doesn't mean we are free yet: chavismo is still in power. But this is the beginning of the end.”

According to Maria, those opposing Maduro’s arrest are mainly people who benefited from the regime, or “ideologues who refuse to see the damage caused to the country over the past 25 years".

She believes a US‑led transition could help stabilise Venezuela’s battered economy – something that, in her view, has not happened in more than two decades. “We don’t have anyone today who is trustworthy or capable of governing the country,” she said. “The United States recognised that there is a political vacuum. A transition will take time, because corruption is massive, both within the regime and parts of the opposition.”

Maria said she would consider returning to Venezuela with her husband one day to “help rebuild” the country, where she still has family.

In Bogota, Colombia – home to one of the world’s largest Venezuelan diaspora – Derwin described scenes of celebration. “People went out to celebrate. I didn’t see anyone supporting Maduro.” He adds that online expressions of support for Maduro leave him baffled. “I don’t understand how that’s possible. These are the people who destroyed Venezuela.”

Several refugees, however, stressed that such celebrations are largely limited to those outside the country. “My people still cannot celebrate,” said Edgarlys Castaneda, a 27-year-old Venezuelan living in New York . A vocal opposition activist, she fled Venezuela after facing threats for her political engagement and spent several months in ICE detention in El Paso, Texas . She was released through habeas corpus and now lives under electronic monitoring in New York.

Edgarlys emphasises that the regime’s grip on power remains strong, highlighting the new laws criminalising sharing content perceived as favourable to Maduro’s capture.  “Only a few political prisoners have been released,” she said. “Many remain in jail. Things haven’t changed much inside Venezuela – it may even be more dangerous now.”

For many exiles, support for US intervention follows years of failed attempts to bring change through protests and elections. Juan Jose Cardenas Lopez, a Venezuelan oceanographer now living in Spain , left the country in 2024, largely due to a lack of work. He saw Maduro’s removal as inevitable.

“Maduro is the leader of a criminal system that led our country into disaster,” he said, citing repression, restrictions on free speech, electoral fraud allegations and accusations of drug trafficking . “Faced with the inaction of international justice and multilateral organisations, intervention by a superior force was the only option left.”

Cardenas Lopez believes Venezuela now faces a long transition that will require international support, particularly from Europe. While acknowledging that Washington acted in line with its geopolitical and economic interests, he said this does not invalidate the outcome.

“This has happened before,” he said. “Venezuela’s past economic development was largely linked to American industry. I don’t see another realistic option if the country is to recover in the short term and if people are to benefit.”

In Lyon , 20‑year‑old Samantha, whose family fled Venezuela in 2021 and was later granted political asylum in France, recalled the night the news broke. “My mother woke me up, everyone was awake that night,” she said. “When we realised Maduro had been captured, we cried, we danced, and we even opened a bottle of sangria.”

The initial joy was soon tempered by anxiety. “We have hope, but we don’t know what will happen next,” she said. “Trump has his interests, of course. But after so many deaths and failed attempts, we were desperate to get out of this situation.”

That ambivalence is echoed by former opposition figures now in exile.

Zeneida Gonzalez, 49, a lifelong political activist with the opposition party Vente Venezuela, fled the country in 2019 and now lives near Paris. She said constant surveillance, threats, and violence were an everyday reality for opponents of the regime.  “Everyone in Venezuela knows someone who was tortured,” she said. “I have friends who were shot in the head just for protesting.”

She insisted that recent political prisoner releases – though limited – would not have happened without US pressure. “People talk about oil,” she said. “We talk about the dead.”

For others, the capture of Maduro is just the beginning of a long road. Thanya Faverial, a former Venezuelan civil servant now working as a data project manager in France, recalled witnessing corruption and drug trafficking involving state-owned companies, alongside shortages so severe she struggled to find milk for her young child.

“Seeing those photos of Maduro on this plane felt like a Hollywood movie,” she said. “I cried both from joy and from the fear of being disappointed again.” She believes Maduro’s fall marks a rupture, but not a resolution. “This is a fracture in the dictatorship,” she said. “But some people who are even worse than Maduro are still in the government.”

The Iranian military statement came after US President Donald Trump issued a new warning to Iran's leaders on Friday, and after Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Saturday declared: "The United States supports the brave people of Iran."

Unrest continued overnight. State media said a municipal building was set on fire in Karaj, west of Tehran, and blamed "rioters". State TV broadcast footage of funerals of members of the security forces it said were killed ​in protests in the cities of Shiraz, Qom and Hamedan.

Saturday marks the start of the work week in Iran, but many schools and universities reportedly held online classes, Iranian state TV reported. Internal Iranian government websites are believed to be functioning.

State TV repeatedly played a driving, martial orchestral arrangement from the “Epic of Khorramshahr” by Iranian composer Majid Entezami, while showing pro-government demonstrations. The song, aired repeatedly during the 12-day war launched by Israel, honours Iran's 1982 liberation of the city of Khorramshahr during the Iran-Iraq war. It has been used in videos of protesting women cutting away their hair to protest against the 2022 death of Mahsa Amini as well.

With the internet down in Iran and phone lines cut off, gauging the demonstrations from abroad has grown more difficult. But the death toll in the protests has grown to at least 65 people killed and over 2,300 others detained, according to the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency. Iranian state TV is reporting on security force casualties while portraying control over the nation.

A witness in western Iran reached by phone told Reuters the Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) ‍were deployed and opening fire in the area from which they were speaking, declining to be identified for their safety.

The military, which operates separately to the IRGC but is also commanded by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, announced it would "protect and safeguard national interests, the country’s strategic infrastructure, and public property".

In a statement published by semi-official news sites, the military accused Israel and "hostile terrorist groups" of seeking to "undermine the country's public security".

"The Army, under the command ​of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief, together with other armed forces, in addition to monitoring enemy movements in the region, will resolutely protect and safeguard national interests, the country’s strategic infrastructure, and public property," it said.

The protests have spread across much of Iran over the last two weeks, beginning in response to soaring inflation, but quickly turned political with protesters calling for clerical rulers to step down.

In a country with a history of fragmented opposition to clerical rule, the son of the last shah of Iran who was toppled in the 1979 Islamic revolution has emerged as a prominent voice abroad spurring on the protests.

In his latest appeal on the X social media platform, US-based Reza Pahlavi said: "Our ‍goal is no longer merely to come into the streets; the goal is to prepare to seize city centres and hold them."

He also called on "workers and employees in key sectors of the economy, especially transportation, and oil, and gas and energy", to begin a nationwide strike.

Trump said on Thursday he was not ​inclined to meet Pahlavi, a sign that he was waiting to see how the crisis plays out before backing an opposition leader.

Trump, who bombed Iran last summer and warned Tehran last week that the US could come to the protesters' aid, issued another warning on Friday, saying: "You better not start shooting because we'll start shooting too."

"I just hope the protesters in Iran are going to be safe, because that's a very ‌dangerous place right now," he added.

Some protesters on the streets have shouted slogans in support of Pahlavi, such as "Long live the shah", although most chants have called for an end to rule by the clerics or demanded action to fix an economy hammered by years of US and other international sanctions and pummelled by the 12-day war in June, when ‍Israel and the US launched air strikes on Iran.

A doctor in northwestern Iran said that since Friday, large numbers of injured protesters had been brought to hospitals.

Some were badly beaten, suffering head injuries and broken legs and arms, as well as deep cuts.

At least 20 people in one hospital had been shot with live ammunition, five of whom later died.

On Friday, Khamenei accused protesters of acting on behalf of Trump, saying rioters were attacking public properties and warning that Tehran would not tolerate people acting as "mercenaries for foreigners".

The Revolutionary Guards’ public relations office said three members of the Basij security force were killed and five wounded during clashes with what it described as “armed rioters” in Gachsaran, in the southwest.

Another security officer was stabbed to death in Hamedan, in western Iran. The son of a senior officer, Brigadier General Martyr Nourali Shoushtari, was killed in the Ahmadabad area of Mashhad, in the northeast. Two other security personnel were killed over the past two nights in Shushtar, in ‍Khuzestan province.

The protests pose the biggest internal challenge in at least three years to Iran's clerical rulers, who look more vulnerable than during past bouts of unrest amid a dire economic situation and after last year's war.

The leaders of France, Britain and Germany issued a ‌joint statement on Friday condemning the killing of ​protesters and urged the Iranian authorities to refrain from violence.

Authorities have described protests over the economy as legitimate while condemning what they call violent rioters and cracking down with security forces.

Iran's clerical establishment has weathered repeated past bouts of unrest, including student protests in 1999, over a disputed election in 2009, against economic hardships in 2019, and the 2022 Woman, Life, Freedom protests.</description><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 11:41:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/4912dabe-e62d-11f0-8568-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25363525413736.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Four tankers that had left Venezuela in 'dark mode' are back in its waters</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/four-tankers-that-had-left-venezuela-dark-mode-are-back-its-waters-2026-01-10/</link><description>Jan 10 (Reuters) - At least four tankers, most of them loaded, that had departed from Venezuela in early January in 'dark mode' - or with their transponders off amid a strict U.S. blockade - are now back in the South American country's waters, according to state company PDVSA and monitoring service TankerTrackers.com.

A flotilla of about a dozen loaded vessels and at least three other empty ships left Venezuelan waters last month in apparent defiance of an embargo imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump since mid-December, which has dragged down the country's oil exports to minimum.

One of the ships, the Panama-flagged supertanker M Sophia, was intercepted and seized by the U.S. this week when returning to the country; while another, the Aframax tanker Olina with a flag from Sao Tome And Principe, was intercepted but released to Venezuela on Friday, state company PDVSA said.

Three more of the vessels that had departed in that flotilla, Panama-flagged Merope, Cook Islands-flagged Min Hang and Panama-flagged Thalia III, were spotted by Tankertrackers.com in Venezuelan waters late on Friday through satellite images.

U.S. authorities had said on Friday that Olina -previously known as Minerva M - would be freed. The next step for the country, which remains under strict U.S. supervision after it captured and extracted President Nicolas Maduro last week, would be the beginning of organized crude exports as part of a $2 billion oil supply deal Caracas and Washington are negotiating, they said.

In a meeting with top oil company executives on Friday, U.S. President Donald Trump said arrangements for the supply had progressed. Global trading houses Vitol and Trafigura received this week the first U.S. licenses to negotiate and carry Venezuela's exports, and naphtha supplies to the OPEC country also are expected, sources said.</description><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 13:48:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>South Africa president urges ANC to fix poor local government ahead of poll</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/south-africa-president-urges-anc-fix-poor-local-government-ahead-poll-2026-01-10/</link><description>JOHANNESBURG, Jan 10 (Reuters) - South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa on Saturday urged his co-ruling African National Congress to address its dismal record on providing basic services, ahead of local elections in which the ANC's share of the vote is widely expected to slide.

Africa's most industrialised country must hold local elections before November, and the ANC often does worse in local polls than national, as voters vent their frustrations over leaky water pipes, sewage discharges and crumbling roads.

"The first task for our movement in 2026 is to fix local government and improve services," Ramaphosa told his party at a televised event in Rustenburg, Northwest Province, to celebrate its 114th birthday.

In the 2021 local election , the ANC won less than half of the votes for the first time since the 1994 end of white minority rule, in what turned out to be a forerunner for national polls less than three years later when the party lost its majority.

"Municipalities must ... fulfill their basic obligations," Ramaphosa said. "They must fix potholes, remove refuse regularly (and) provide clean water and sanitation".

The ANC was celebrated for unifying a country divided along race lines, and for one of the world's most progressive constitutions and judiciaries.

It punches above its weight diplomatically, bringing a genocide case against Israel and securing a G20 summit declaration despite a U.S. boycott.

At the same time, its record on more mundane tasks, such as repairing drains and staffing schools, has been poor.

Ramaphosa said chronic power shortages had ended, but some municipalities continued to have local outages. He pledged 54 billion rand ($3.28 billion) in state funding for water and power infrastructure.

Though growth has improved, unemployment remains high, and many young people were starting to "question whether our democracy ... and indeed our movement really work for them," Ramaphosa said.

There were no immediate reports of casualties, regional Gov. Andrei Bocharov was quoted as saying in a Telegram post published on the channel of the local administration. The post did not specify the damage, but said that people living near the depot may have to be evacuated.

Ukraine’s long-range drone strikes on Russian energy sites aim to deprive Moscow of the oil export revenue it needs to pursue its full-scale invasion. Russia wants to cripple the Ukrainian power grid, seeking to deny civilians access to heat, light and running water in what Kyiv officials say is an attempt to “weaponise winter".

Saturday's attack came the day after Russia bombarded Ukraine with hundreds of drones and dozens of missiles overnight into Friday, according to Ukrainian officials, killing at least four people in the capital. For only the second time in the nearly 4-year-old war, it used a powerful, new hypersonic missile that struck western Ukraine on Friday in a clear warning to Kyiv’s NATO allies.

The intense barrage and the launch of the nuclear-capable Oreshnik missile followed reports of major progress in talks between Ukraine and its allies on how to defend the country from further Moscow aggression if a US-led peace deal is struck.

Russia’s Defence Ministry said Saturday that its forces used aviation, drones , missiles and artillery to strike Ukrainian energy facilities and fuel-storage depots on Friday and overnight. It did not immediately specify the targets or damage.

⁠Kyiv's ‍electricity system was ​turned off for ‍repairs at the orders of the ​state grid operator, the city ​administration said on Saturday.

The city's water and heat distribution systems, as well as electrified public transport, have also ‍stopped working as a result of the ​power outage, the administration said on Telegram.

It said repairs were ‌under way, but did not indicate how long ‍the systems would remain shut down amid intense cold weather.

Half of Kyiv's apartment blocks were without heat on Friday after the latest Russian attack, as ‍temperatures sank below minus 10 degrees ‌Celsius (14 degrees ​Fahrenheit).

Overnight into Saturday, Russia struck Ukraine with 121 drones and one Iskander-M ballistic missile, according to the Ukrainian air force. It said 94 drones were shot down.</description><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 14:21:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/e24e6cc2-ee28-11f0-8b51-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-10T082521Z-1498693124-RC2TXIAQ0X37-RTRMADP-3-UKRAINE-CRISIS-ATTACK-BELGOROD-BLACKOUT.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Cuba on edge after US captures Venezuela's Maduro</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/cuba-on-edge-after-us-captures-venezuela-s-maduro</link><description /><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 14:21:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/fed9c8e6-ee28-11f0-9ec5-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260110-131348-131611-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Protest erupts in Minneapolis after fatal ICE shooting of activist</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/protest-erupts-in-minneapolis-after-fatal-ice-shooting-of-activist</link><description /><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 14:21:58 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/fbbf82a2-ee16-11f0-9c44-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260110-120613-120812-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Suspect detained after six killed in Mississippi, say law enforcement, local media</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/suspect-detained-after-six-killed-mississippi-say-law-enforcement-local-media-2026-01-10/</link><description>Jan 10 (Reuters) - At least six people were fatally shot on Friday night in Clay County, Mississippi, and the suspect is in custody, according to local news outlets and law enforcement, without providing additional details.

The deaths occurred at three different shooting locales, according to WTVA, an NBC News affiliate.

The suspect is in custody "and no longer poses a threat to our community," Eddie Scott, the Clay County sheriff, posted on social media.

His post did not provide a specific figure for the number of fatalities, but WTVA said six people died.

Scott and the sheriff's department did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

"I ask that you lift our victims and their families in your prayers," Scott wrote on Facebook.

Located in northeastern Mississippi, Clay County has a population of nearly 20,000.</description><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 15:20:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Yemen completes evacuation of stranded tourists on Socotra island</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/yemen-completes-evacuation-stranded-tourists-socotra-island-2026-01-10/</link><description>Jan 10 (Reuters) - Yemen completed on Saturday the evacuation of more than 600 tourists who had been stranded on the remote Yemeni island of Socotra after the United Arab Emirates withdrew its troops from Yemen last week amid a rift with Saudi Arabia.

Four flights operated by Yemenia Airways, Yemen's national carrier, transported 609 tourists to Saudi Arabia's city of Jeddah, the Yemeni Foreign Ministry said in a statement.

Air traffic at the island's main airport came to a halt as a deepening crisis between the UAE and Saudi Arabia translated into fresh conflict on Yemen's mainland, where the two Gulf powers now back opposing groups in the country's civil war.

Socotra, which lies more than 300 km (186 miles) south of Yemen's coast and until recently was mainly accessible by air via the UAE, has been a haven of tranquillity through the years of conflict on the mainland.</description><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 15:21:54 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Storm Goretti kills man in UK and leaves 100,000 French homes without power</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260110-storm-goretti-kills-man-in-uk-and-leaves-100-000-french-homes-without-power</link><description>A man was killed after a tree fell on a caravan in England after record winds brought by Storm Goretti, as 100,000 homes in France were still without power on Saturday.

Some 15 people have died in weather-related accidents this week across Europe as gale-force winds and storms caused travel mayhem, shut schools, and cut power to hundreds of thousands in freezing temperatures.

The storm barrelled through southwestern Cornwall and parts of Wales overnight Thursday to Friday, with gusts of up to 160 kilometres per hour (100 miles per hour) downing trees and leaving tens of thousands of homes without power.

A man was found dead in the town of Helston in Cornwall on Friday after a tree fell onto a caravan, UK police said.

"Tragically, a man aged in his 50s was located deceased within the caravan," Devon and Cornwall police said in a statement.

Most of the UK remains under a weather warning for snow and ice on Saturday, the Met Office national weather agency said, warning that black ice could cause "disruption" in Scotland and northern England.

Heavy snowfall followed by the storm meant that some 250 schools in Scotland were closed for the much of the first week back after the Christmas break.

Around 28,000 homes were still without power at the start of the weekend in southwestern England and the Midlands, according to the network operator National Grid.

Storm Goretti also ploughed through other parts of northern Europe, with nearly 100,000 homes in France still without power on Saturday morning.

Meanwhile long-distance rail traffic slowly resumed on Saturday in northern Germany , after being completely suspended on Friday due to another storm named Elli, rail operator Deutsche Bahn said.

In the far north of the country, the port city of Hamburg, heavily affected by a large amount of snow, remains particularly impacted by the disruptions, it added.

A number of rail services will still not be restored on Saturday, notably those linking Hamburg to Copenhagen , Amsterdam and Hanover.

Services from Hamburg to the western Ruhr region or to Berlin are expected to be restored over the course of Saturday, it said.</description><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 15:22:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/a3e3bf64-ee32-11f0-96f6-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26009372666881.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Egypt announces results of last seats in parliament vote that gave Sisi strong majority</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/egypt-announces-results-last-seats-parliament-vote-that-gave-sisi-strong-2026-01-10/</link><description>Jan 10 - Egypt’s National Elections Authority declared the results on Saturday of the last 49 seats in a parliamentary election that began more than three months ago and gave President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi the super-majority he needs to amend the constitution.

The results of the final seats had been held up by reruns of voting in constituencies where initial results had been annulled.

Although the Elections Authority did not list the party affiliations of the elected candidates, the results are not believed to alter the overall composition of parliament, which will be overwhelmingly controlled by Sisi's supporters.

Last week, Egypt’s State Information Service said opposition parties and independents were on track to hold 158 of the 568 elected seats, about 28%. The president also appoints a further 5% of seats, bringing the total to 596. A two-thirds majority is needed to amend the constitution.</description><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 16:25:32 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/X66KP5DW5RIERG5DGWGBYHV2LE.jpg?auth=865f13b75e65854d688919ce60ff3925f619a14270476ad38f30c3f77c59f735&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'Nothing to Lose': Nationwide protests challenge Iran’s regime</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/nothing-to-lose-nationwide-protests-challenge-iran-s-regime</link><description /><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 16:25:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/8bca8878-ee2c-11f0-b670-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260110-130340-131323-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Protests sweep Iran as authorities intensify crackdown on demonstrators</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/protests-sweep-iran-as-authorities-intensify-crackdown-on-demonstrators</link><description /><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 16:26:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/67ef2b56-ee37-11f0-a442-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260110-160128-160334-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump presses top oil executives to invest in Venezuela's reserves</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/trump-presses-top-oil-executives-to-invest-in-venezuela-s-reserves</link><description /><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 16:26:02 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/d013a444-ee2a-11f0-a38b-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260110-140706-140856-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Police arrest 29 people during overnight protests in Minneapolis</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/police-arrest-29-people-during-overnight-protests-minneapolis-2026-01-10/</link><description>MINNEAPOLIS, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Twenty-nine people were arrested overnight as police responded to protests against federal immigration enforcement in Minneapolis, Mayor Jacob Frey said at a press conference on Saturday.

Nine released prisoners had been confirmed as of Friday afternoon.

Venezuela has started releasing high-profile prisoners, including opposition figures, in an effort to appease the Trump administration.

On Friday, U.S. President Donald Trump said the release of political prisoners in Venezuela was a sign of "seeking peace" and that he had canceled a planned second wave of attacks against the country.</description><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 17:43:33 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/TL4COTAVFVMKHJBXJ6EI2FNZKE.jpg?auth=5c90f2f83a338f50a8f1ed6b7ace5ae4f7a9e030e99264c5a7e8353c40afdc62&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Nobel Institute says Peace Prize cannot be transferred after Machado suggestion</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/nobel-institute-says-peace-prize-cannot-be-transferred-after-machado-suggestion-2026-01-10/</link><description>PALM BEACH, Florida, Jan 10 (Reuters) - The Norwegian Nobel Institute said the Nobel Peace Prize cannot be transferred, shared, or revoked, following remarks by Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado suggesting she might give her 2025 award to U.S. President Donald Trump.

In a statement, the institute said the decision to award a Nobel Prize is final and permanent, citing the statutes of the Nobel Foundation, which do not allow appeals. The organization also noted that committees awarding the prizes do not comment on the actions or statements of laureates after receiving awards.

“Once a Nobel Prize is announced, it cannot be revoked, shared or transferred to others,” the Norwegian Nobel Committee and the Norwegian Nobel Institute said on Friday. “The decision is final and stands for all time.”

On Monday, Machado, speaking to Sean Hannity on Fox News, said that presenting the prize to Trump would be an act of gratitude from the Venezuelan people for the removal of Nicolás Maduro, the country’s president, who was captured last week by the United States.

“Did you at any point offer to give him the Nobel Peace Prize?” Hannity asked. “Did that actually happen?”

She responded, “Well, it hasn’t happened yet."

Trump, who has long expressed interest in winning the prize and has at times linked it to diplomatic achievements, said he would be honored to accept the prize if offered by Machado during a planned meeting in Washington next week.

Machado, a former National Assembly member, was barred from running in Venezuela’s 2024 general election by authorities aligned with Maduro.

She backed a stand‑in candidate who was widely considered to have won the vote, although Maduro claimed victory. Ballot audits by independent observers showed irregularities in the official results.</description><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 18:30:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/K43D24RYXZNYLDPMCY4A6VJ2IU.jpg?auth=b090f00fedc07189d92d9d26e9ba2c5057d18c5908b88d2351ba39242f5947e2&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran's Guards arrest foreigner accused of spying for Israel</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/irans-guards-arrest-foreigner-accused-spying-israel-2026-01-10/</link><description>Jan 10 (Reuters) - Iran's Revolutionary Guards' intelligence wing said it had arrested a foreigner suspected of spying for Israel, the semi-official Tasnim news agency reported on Saturday.

Slovakia, which currently has five nuclear power reactors at two plants, has been in talks with Washington since last year to build a large plant with U.S. group Westinghouse.

Fico said on Saturday the plant would have capacity of almost 1,200 megawatts (MW), bigger than existing units.

"In cooperation with American partners, we want to build a new huge block in purely state ownership on the grounds of the existing nuclear power plant in Jaslovske Bohunice," he said, without elaborating.

Fico said he wanted to participate in the signing of the more general agreement on U.S.-Slovak cooperation in the nuclear sector in Washington on Friday. He did not give more details on the signing.

The Slovak government approved an inter-governmental deal with the U.S. in October for the construction of a new unit, and Fico said in December U.S. President Donald Trump had invited him to the United States during this year's soccer World Cup for the signing of a nuclear power deal between the two countries.</description><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 18:30:56 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/FAQSOBJFNNPFXHA7AGLBI6BN34.jpg?auth=38611e85acdb1e6b86ec77b99f99a1a5e3252f6bd72d6cd1f9b42babc47706e1&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Anti-ICE protesters plan rallies across US after killing of Minneapolis woman</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260110-anti-ice-protesters-plan-rallies-across-us-after-killing-of-minneapolis-woman</link><description>Hundreds of rallies were planned for Saturday and Sunday across the United States to protest actions of the federal immigration agency after the fatal shooting of a 37-year-old woman in Minneapolis.

Organizers said more than 1,000 events were planned under the slogan "ICE, Out for Good" – referring to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency that is drawing growing opposition over its execution of President Donald Trump 's crackdown on illegal immigration.

The slogan is also a reference to Renee Good, the motorist shot dead by an ICE agent in the midwestern US city of Minneapolis on Wednesday.

Her death has sparked strong emotions in this Democratic stronghold, and further afield. Protests are planned across the country, including around Washington, D.C., Philadelphia and Los Angeles.

The calls to protest are being amplified by the "No Kings" movement, a network of left-wing organizations that mounted nationwide demonstrations against Trump last year.

The Trump administration has sought to paint Good as a "domestic terrorist," insisting that the agent who fatally shot her was acting in self-defense. This narrative is strongly disputed by local officials, who say footage of the shooting shows Good's vehicle was turning away from the agent and did not pose a threat to him.

Cell phone footage apparently taken by the officer who fired the fatal shots shows him interacting with Good as he approaches and circles her car, and her saying, "I'm not mad at you."

After he passes in front of the car, another agent can be heard ordering Good to exit the vehicle before she tries to drive off and shots ring out.

The agent filming the video can be heard saying "fucking bitch" at the end of the clip.

The White House insisted the video gave weight to the officer's claim of self-defense – even though the clip does not show the moment the car moved away, or him opening fire.

On Friday evening, hundreds of people gathered noisily in front of Minneapolis hotels believed to be housing ICE agents, equipped with whistles, loudspeakers, and musical instruments.

Twenty-nine ​people were arrested ⁠overnight as police responded to ​protests, ​Mayor Jacob Frey said at a press conference on Saturday.

Minneapolis ‍Police Chief ​Brian O'Hara said one police officer was ‌injured during the ‍protest response.

Officials and residents in Minnesota have expressed concern that local law enforcement agencies have been shut out of the FBI investigation into Minneapolis shooting.

"When the FBI, when the federal agencies, say they won't share evidence with the local authorities, the public can't trust that it's going to be a true, transparent investigation," Patrick O'Shaughnessy, a 43-year-old unemployed resident interviewed by AFP on Friday.

According to The Trace, a media outlet focusing on gun violence, reported that Good was the fourth person killed by federal immigration agents since the launch of the Trump administration's deportation policy, and seven others have been injured.

In a separate incident, two people were injured on Thursday in Portland, Oregon, by shots fired by federal border police during a traffic stop.</description><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 18:31:44 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/77134a50-ee4f-11f0-a61d-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26010546411712.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'Limited clashes' still ongoing in Aleppo neighborhood</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/limited-clashes-still-ongoing-in-aleppo-neighborhood</link><description /><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 18:31:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/701c7d88-ee41-11f0-9e51-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260110-170748-171134-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Nicaragua announces release of dozens of prisoners, one day after U.S. demands</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/nicaragua-announces-release-dozens-prisoners-one-day-after-us-demands-2026-01-10/</link><description>MEXICO CITY, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Nicaragua's government announced on Saturday that it had freed dozens of people from its national penitentiary system, a day after the United States demanded the release of more than 60 political prisoners in the country.

The releases comes at the same that Venezuela is in the process of releasing political prisoners under U.S. pressure.

In a statement, the authoritarian government of Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega announced the inmates' release without confirming the exact number of people freed or whether they had been detained for political reasons. It's unclear whether those released will be restricted to house arrest.

Opposition leader and former prisoner Ana Margarita Vijil, head of the UNAMOS political movement, told Reuters that those released “are political prisoners, and several of them are our friends.”

Vijil said she did not know the number of those involved but said they include former mayor Oscar Gadea and Christian pastor Rudy Palacios along with four of his relatives.

The U.S. has long exerted its influence in Latin America, but the pressure has been especially intense since the Trump administration attacked Venezuela a week ago and captured its president, Nicolas Maduro.

On Friday, the U.S. embassy in Nicaragua praised the release of opposition figures in Venezuela and called on Ortega's government to follow in their steps.

"In Nicaragua, more than 60 people remain unjustly detained or missing, including pastors, religious workers, the sick, and the elderly. Peace is only possible with freedom!," the embassy tweeted.</description><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 20:24:12 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Crans-Montana bar owner says service door was locked during deadly New Year blaze</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260110-crans-montana-bar-owner-says-service-door-was-locked-during-deadly-new-year-blaze</link><description>The French owner of the Swiss bar where 40 people died in a fire during New Year celebrations told investigators a service door had been locked from the inside.

Jacques Moretti, co-owner of the Constellation bar in the Swiss resort of Crans-Montana was taken into custody Friday, as prosecutors investigate the tragedy.

Most of the 40 people who died were teenagers, and another 116 people were injured .

Moretti told the Vallais public prosecutor's office that he had found out about the locked door just after the deadly fire.

When he arrived at the scene, he forced open the door, according to excerpts from police reports published by several French and Swiss media outlets confirmed to AFP by a source close to the case.

Moretti said he had found several people lying behind the door after opening it.

Initial findings suggest that the fire was caused by sparklers coming into contact with soundproofing foam installed on the ceiling of the establishment's basement.

Questions are also being raised regarding the presence and accessibility of fire extinguishers, and whether the bar's exits were in compliance with regulations.

"We always add a sparkler candle when we serve a bottle of wine in the dining room," said his wife and co-owner, Jessica, who was released after Friday's hearing.

Jacques Moretti told investigators that he had carried out tests and the candles were not powerful enough to ignite the acoustic foam.

Moretti said he bought the foam in a DIY store and installed it himself during renovations carried out after buying the establishment in 2015.

Regarding the presence of numerous underage kids in the bar at the time of the tragedy, Jacques Moretti said the establishment prohibited anyone under the age of 16 and that customers aged 16 to 18 had to be accompanied by an adult.

He said he had given these "instructions" to the security staff, but acknowledged that "it is possible that there was a lapse in protocol".

The couple is suspected of "negligent homicide, negligent bodily harm, and negligent arson".</description><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 20:25:02 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/4e50a228-ee60-11f0-993e-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26006576644548.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US military says it carried out strikes across Syria targeting Islamic State</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-military-says-it-carried-out-strikes-across-syria-targeting-islamic-state-2026-01-10/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 10 (Reuters) - The U.S. military said on Saturday it carried out multiple strikes in Syria targeting the Islamic State militant group.

Anxious relatives meanwhile camped outside jails, awaiting the promised release of political prisoners by the interim government.

Despite the shock of Maduro's capture during deadly nighttime raids on January 3, signs emerged Friday of cooperation with Washington after US President Donald Trump 's claim to be "in charge" of the South American country.

Venezuela's foreign minister said Friday it had launched talks with the United States on restoring diplomatic ties, which were severed in 2019 during Trump's first term.

Washington said US diplomats had visited Caracas to discuss reopening the American embassy.

A State Department official told AFP on Saturday they had left again on Friday "as scheduled."

"The Trump Administration remains in close contact with interim authorities" in Venezuela, the official addded.

Venezuela's interim president Delcy Rodriguez has pledged to cooperate with Trump over his demands for access to Venezuela's huge oil reserves after Maduro's ouster.

But she also moved to placate the powerful pro-Maduro base by insisting Venezuela is not "subordinate" to Washington.

In a gesture of ongoing defiance, organisers scheduled a rally of activists from the ruling leftist "Chavista" movement on Saturday.

The demo caps a week of angry protests after the United States launched airstrikes on Caracas, seized Maduro and took him to New York to face trial on drug-trafficking charges alongside his wife, Cilia Flores.

Rodriguez's camp on Thursday began releasing prisoners jailed under Maduro, promising a "large" number would be freed in a gesture of appeasement pending talks with Washington.

However, prisoners' rights groups said on Saturday that so far fewer than 20 had been freed, including several prominent opposition figures.

Families slept out overnight under blankets near El Rodeo prison east of Caracas, hoping for the release of their loved ones.

"I am tired and angry," Nebraska Rivas, 57, told AFP, as she waited for the release of her son.

"But I have faith that they will hand him over to us soon," she said, after sleeping out on the pavement for two nights.

"I have been fighting for this for seven years and I feel encouraged now because this is the home stretch. But I am also disappointed because nothing is happening."

The exiled opposition candidate from the 2024 elections , Edmundo Gonzalez Urritia, who was hoping for the release of his son-in-law, complained on X that "fewer than one percent of the announced releases" had taken place.

"Each hour that goes by without answers is a new form of violence against the families," he wrote.

Following Maduro's capture, Trump vowed to secure access for US companies to Venezuela's vast oil reserves.

Chevron is currently the only US firm licensed to operate in Venezuela, through a sanctions exemption.

The White House said Saturday Trump had signed an emergency executive order protecting US-held revenues derived from sales of Venezuelan oil, to prevent them from being seized by courts or creditors.

At a White House meeting on Friday, Trump pressed top oil executives to invest in Venezuela's reserves, but was met with a cautious reception.

ExxonMobil chief executive Darren Woods dismissed the country as "uninvestable" without sweeping reforms.

Experts say Venezuela's oil infrastructure is creaky after years of mismanagement and sanctions.

Trump said foreign firms had enjoyed no meaningful protections under Maduro, "but now you have total security. It's a whole different Venezuela."

He stressed that the companies would deal only with Washington, not Caracas, when exploiting Venezuela's oil resources.

Washington has maintained maritime pressure on oil tankers in the Caribbean, where it seized a fifth tanker carrying Venezuelan crude on Friday. Trump said that oil would be sold.

A sustained increase in Venezuelan oil production would take "months to years," Latin America specialist Orlando J. Perez, of the University of North Texas at Dallas, told AFP.

"It requires legal clarity on who can sign contracts, predictable sanctions relief, credible security conditions for firms, and major capital/technical inputs in a degraded sector."</description><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 21:47:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/fd0ebdaa-ee69-11f0-bfab-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26010714825096.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>North Korea's Kim Yo Jong urges South Korea to investigate drone incidents</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/north-koreas-kim-yo-jong-urges-south-korea-investigate-drone-incidents-2026-01-10/</link><description>SEOUL, Jan 11 (Reuters) - North Korea's Kim Yo Jong, the powerful sister of leader Kim Jong Un, urged South Korea to investigate recent drone incidents for detailed explanations, in a statement carried by state media KCNA on Sunday.

Kim said she personally appreciates Seoul for making a wise decision to announce its official stance that it has no intention of provocation, warning that any provocations will result in terrible situations.

Drones were flown from South Korea into North Korea earlier this month, after another intrusion in September, North Korea's military said on Saturday, which was soon followed by South Korea's response that they were not operated by the military.

South Korea also said there would be a thorough investigation of a civilian possibly having operated the drones, making clear its stance of having no intention of provocation.

"Clear is just the fact that the drone from the ROK violated the airspace of our country," Kim said. ROK stands for the Republic of Korea, South Korea's official name.

"No matter who is the perpetrator and whether it is a deed by any civilian organization or individual, the authorities responsible for national security can never evade their responsibility for it," she said.</description><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 22:20:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4RVEYTU7RJNXFJCTBX3WCEJU2M.jpg?auth=53ce2d10e4cebd161fb1b986a7b81a491ae6b05daa085b6b657919882ea13008&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukrainian drone attack injures four, damages buildings in Russia's Voronezh, governor says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/ukrainian-drone-attack-injures-four-damages-buildings-russias-voronezh-governor-2026-01-10/</link><description>Jan 10 (Reuters) - An overnight Ukrainian drone attack injured at least four people and damaged several buildings in Russia's southern city of Voronezh, governor of the Voronezh region said on Sunday.

Bessent said in an interview late on Friday that almost $5 billion worth of Venezuela's currently frozen IMF Special Drawing Rights monetary assets could be deployed to help rebuild the country's economy.

"We're de-sanctioning the oil that's going to be sold," Bessent said during a visit to a Winnebago Industries engineering facility. The Treasury was examining changes that would facilitate the repatriation of sale proceeds of the oil stored largely on ships back to Venezuela.

"How can we help that get back into Venezuela, to run the government, run the security services and get it to the Venezuelan people?" he said of the Treasury's sanctions analysis.

Asked when more sanctions could be removed from Venezuela, Bessent said, "It could be as soon as next week," but did not identify which ones.

The moves are part of the Trump administration's effort to stabilize Venezuela and encourage the return of U.S. oil producers to the country a week after U.S. forces captured Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro in Caracas and brought him to New York to face drug trafficking charges.

U.S. sanctions have banned international banks and other creditors from engaging with the Venezuelan government without a license. The institutions have cited this as an impediment to a complex $150 billion debt restructuring widely viewed as a key to the return of private capital to Venezuela.

On Friday evening, President Donald Trump signed an executive order blocking courts or creditors from impounding Venezuelan oil revenue held in U.S. Treasury accounts, declaring that these funds should be safeguarded to help Venezuela create "peace, prosperity and stability."

Bessent, who controls the dominant U.S. shareholding in the IMF and World Bank, said that the two institutions had already reached out to him about Venezuela.

The Treasury chief said that the U.S. Treasury would be willing to convert Venezuela's IMF Special Drawing Rights held at the Fund to dollars for use in rebuilding Venezuela.

Venezuela currently has about 3.59 billion SDRs, which are worth about $4.9 billion at Friday's exchange rate, but it cannot currently access them. SDRs are made up of dollars, euros, yen, sterling and Chinese yuan.

The Treasury last year agreed to back a $20 billion swap line for Argentina partly with that South American country's SDRs in an effort to stabilize the peso and help Argentine President Javier Milei's party win in parliamentary elections.

An IMF spokesperson said that the Fund was closely monitoring developments in Venezuela and declined comment on Bessent's mention of a meeting next week.

The IMF has not engaged with Venezuela for more than two decades, with the last formal IMF assessment of Venezuela's economy completed in 2004. Venezuela paid off its last World Bank loan in 2007, when Maduro's predecessor, the late Hugo Chavez declared that Venezuela "will no longer have to go to Washington" for funding.

A source familiar with the World Bank's internal discussions on Venezuela said that the development lender was in the early stages of exploring how it could be helpful to Venezuela, noting that the bank moved in quickly with assistance to Afghanistan and Syria after regime changes and provided early support to Gaza and Ukraine.

Bessent said that he believed that smaller, privately held companies would move swiftly back into Venezuela's oil sector, despite reluctance voiced by some oil majors including Exxon Mobil, whose past Venezuelan assets were nationalized twice.

"I think it's going to be the typical progression where the private companies can move quickly and will come in very quickly. They haven't talked about financing at all," Bessent said.

"Chevron has been there a long time and will continue to be there, so I believe that their commitment will greatly increase."

Bessent added that he believed there was a role for the U.S. Export-Import Bank in guaranteeing financing for Venezuela's oil sector, echoing previous comments from U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright.</description><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 22:21:47 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BQ32FRM57NLQBBEQCYS3PUQPIU.jpg?auth=425726b6caaf1c5fcc725ecaa14cbf1f3f454760f58433ba49cf0d6dd64281bf&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US carries out 'large scale' retaliation strikes against Islamic State group in Syria</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260110-us-carries-out-large-scale-retaliation-strikes-against-islamic-state-group-in-syria</link><description>US and allied forces carried out "large-scale" strikes against the Islamic State jihadist group in Syria on Saturday, the US military said, in the latest response to an attack last month that left three Americans dead.

Washington said a lone gunman from the militant group carried out the December 13 attack in Palmyra – home to UNESCO-listed ancient ruins and once controlled by jihadist fighters – that killed two US soldiers and a US civilian interpreter .

"The strikes today targeted ISIS throughout Syria" and were part of Operation Hawkeye Strike, which was launched "in direct response to the deadly ISIS attack on US and Syrian forces in Palmyra," US Central Command said in a statement on X, using an acronym for the jihadist group.

The United States and Jordan carried out a previous round of strikes as part of the same operation last month, hitting dozens of Islamic State group targets.

The Palmyra attack was the first such incident since the overthrow of Syria's longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad in December 2024.

The US personnel who were targeted were supporting Operation Inherent Resolve, the international effort to combat IS, which seized swaths of Syrian and Iraqi territory in 2014.

The jihadists were ultimately defeated by local ground forces backed by international air strikes and other support, but IS still has a presence in Syria, especially in the country's vast desert.

US President Donald Trump has long been skeptical of Washington's presence in Syria, ordering the withdrawal of troops during his first term but ultimately leaving American forces in the country.

The Pentagon announced in April that the United States would halve the number of US personnel in Syria in the following months, while US envoy for Syria Tom Barrack said in June that Washington would eventually reduce its bases in the country to one.</description><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 22:26:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/1d6a9110-dd93-11f0-88bf-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2025-12-20T005800Z-709279996-RC22JIAC0V5U-RTRMADP-3-USA-TRUMP-SYRIA-STRIKES.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Bangladesh seeks to join international force in Gaza</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/bangladesh-seeks-join-international-force-gaza-2026-01-10/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Bangladesh said on Saturday it has told the United States that it wants to join the international stabilization force that would be deployed in Gaza.

Bangladesh said its national security adviser, Khalilur Rahman, met U.S. diplomats Allison Hooker and Paul Kapur in Washington.

Rahman "expressed Bangladesh's interest in principle to be part of the international stabilization force that would be deployed in Gaza," a Bangladeshi government statement added. It did not mention the extent or nature of its proposed involvement. The State Department had no immediate comment.

A U.N. Security Council resolution, adopted in mid-November , authorized a so-called Board of Peace and countries working with it to establish a temporary International Stabilization Force in Gaza where a ceasefire began in October.

The truce has not progressed beyond its first phase, and little progress has been made on the next steps. More than 400 Palestinians and three Israeli soldiers have been reported killed since the ceasefire took effect, and nearly all of Gaza's more than 2 million people live in makeshift homes or damaged buildings in a sliver of territory where Israeli troops have withdrawn and Hamas has reasserted control.

Both Israel and Hamas remain far apart on the more difficult steps envisaged for the next phase of the ceasefire and have accused each other of violations.

Israel's military assault on Gaza since late 2023 has killed tens of thousands, caused a hunger crisis and internally displaced Gaza's entire population. Multiple rights experts , scholars and a U.N. inquiry say it amounts to genocide. Israel called its actions self-defense after a 2023 Hamas attack in which 1,200 were killed and over 250 taken hostage.</description><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 23:21:58 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BOEAARKZNFIW5HUHWMCFYRG4HU.jpg?auth=1c79eabdbefd506bec28772ab329a45f6983266734988585e0290943bd35d1a1&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Australia bushfires to burn out of control for weeks, authorities say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/australia-bushfires-burn-out-control-weeks-authorities-say-2026-01-10/</link><description>SYDNEY, Jan 11 (Reuters) - Australian authorities said on Sunday it would take firefighters weeks to get on top of bushfires in the country's southeast that have razed homes, cut power to thousands of homes and burned swathes of bushland.

The blazes have torn through more than 300,000 hectares (741,316 acres) of bushland in Victoria state since the middle of the week, destroying more than 130 properties, including homes, and leaving thousands without power.

There were more than 30 fires burning in Victoria on Sunday morning, Premier Jacinta Allan said. In neighbouring New South Wales state, several fires close to the Victorian border were burning at emergency level, the highest danger rating, the state's Rural Fire Service said.

Authorities have said the fires are the worst to hit the southeast since the Black Summer blazes of 2019-2020 that destroyed an area the size of Turkey and killed 33 people.

Chief Fire Officer of Forest Fire Management Victoria, Chris Hardman, said it would likely take firefighters weeks to get the upper hand on the fires.

"These fires will not be contained before it gets hot, dry and windy again," Hardman told Australian Broadcasting Corporation television.

Allan said on social media platform X that a total fire ban was in place for Victoria as thousands of firefighters and more than 70 aircraft battled the blazes.

"Bushfire smoke is impacting air quality in many areas across Victoria, including metropolitan Melbourne," she added.

One of the largest fires, near the town of Longwood, about 112 km (70 miles) north of Melbourne, has burned 130,000 hectares (320,000 acres) of bushland, destroying 30 structures, vineyards and agricultural land.

"My thoughts are with Australians in these regional communities at this very difficult time," Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said in televised remarks on Saturday.</description><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 23:41:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/D3QCVDOGBVLLJN5BLMUCZSZAQI.jpg?auth=74c4aa4265c1102a56565fcb51b787ea7ba56ccaf4f8592f1c02363c89c8d246&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Japan PM Takaichi may call early election, coalition partner says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/japans-coalition-partner-head-signals-snap-election-may-be-nearing-2026-01-11/</link><description>TOKYO, Jan 11 (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi may call an early general election, the head of her party's coalition partner, Hirofumi Yoshimura, said on Sunday, after media reported she was considering a February vote.

An early election could allow Takaichi, Japan's first female prime minister, to take advantage of the strong approval ratings she has enjoyed since taking office in October. Her tough stance on China has appealed to right-wing voters but has sparked a major diplomatic dispute with Japan's powerful Asian neighbour.

Yoshimura, leader of the Japan Innovation Party, known as Ishin, told public broadcaster NHK he had met with Takaichi on Friday and felt her view on the timing of an election had shifted to a new "stage".

"I won't be surprised if she made the decision as reported by media," Yoshimura said. The Yomiuri newspaper reported on Friday, citing government sources, that Takaichi was considering holding a snap election on February 8 or 15.

Yoshimura said he and Takaichi did not discuss the specific timing of any election.

Takaichi, a hard-line conservative and advocate of big spending, was mum on when she would call an election during an interview with NHK recorded on Thursday and aired on Sunday.

She said she had just instructed her cabinet ministers to ensure the timely execution of the supplementary budget for this fiscal year and parliamentary approval of the budget for the fiscal year beginning in April.

"At present, I am focusing on the immediate challenge of ensuring that the public feels the benefits of our stimulus policies aimed at cushioning the blow of inflation," she said.</description><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 01:55:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/JKQEE5JED5NMJEMZ3GIIUWB7JU.jpg?auth=0bb878ef298ad0b994651e8ea4ad79aefce1f7bd261b30c15038ef54a827a33c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Myanmar votes in second phase of military-run election</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/myanmar-votes-second-phase-military-run-election-2026-01-11/</link><description>Jan 11 (Reuters) - Voters in war-torn Myanmar queued up on Sunday to cast their ballots in the second stage of a military-run election, following low turnout in the initial round of polls that have been widely criticised as a tool to formalise junta rule.

Myanmar has been ravaged by conflict since the military ousted a civilian government in a 2021 coup and detained its leader, Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi , sparking a civil war that has engulfed large parts of the impoverished nation of 51 million people.

Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy party, which swept the last election in 2020, has been dissolved along with dozens of other anti-junta parties for failing to register for the latest polls, while rebel groups have refused to take part.

The United Nations, many Western countries and human rights groups say the election is a sham exercise that is neither free, fair nor credible in the absence of a meaningful opposition.

The military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party is leading by a huge margin after winning 90 of the 102 lower house seats contested in the first phase on December 28, which saw only 52.13% voter turnout , much lower than elections in 2020 and 2015.

"The USDP is on track for a landslide victory, which is hardly a surprise given the extent to which the playing field was tilted in its favour. This included the removal of any serious rivals and a set of laws designed to stifle opposition to the polls," said Richard Horsey, Senior Myanmar Adviser for Crisis Group.

A final round will take place on January 25. In all, there will be voting in 265 of Myanmar's 330 townships, including areas where the junta does not have full control.

The junta has said the election will bring political stability and a better future for the country, which is facing one of the most serious humanitarian crises in Asia.

At least 16,600 civilians have died in the conflict since the coup, according to Armed Conflict Location &amp; Event Data Project, and the U.N. estimates that 3.6 million people have been displaced.

However, analysts warn that the junta's attempt to form a stable administration amid raging conflict is fraught with risk and any military-controlled government is unlikely to gain broad international recognition.

Junta chief Min Aung Hlaing last month sidestepped a question from a reporter about his political ambitions.

He hailed the election as a success during a visit last week to central Myanmar township, where he urged authorities to work to further boost turnout.

"In phase one of the election, a large number of votes were cast, showing that the people have a strong desire to participate in the democratic process," state media quoted him as saying.

"Therefore, the election can be considered a successful one."</description><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 01:55:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/X3UBNTV5AZIADCSXLOU4YGQ6VE.jpg?auth=04c89bbd54f9d8090350b0cf651c4351051eca9dc6f9e6a54e8d2cfbd5803151&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Bob Weir, Grateful Dead co-founder and rhythm guitarist, dead at 78</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/bob-weir-grateful-dead-co-founder-has-died-age-78-2026-01-11/</link><description>Jan 10 (Reuters) - Veteran rock musician Bob Weir, the Grateful Dead's rhythm guitarist who helped guide the legendary jam band through decades of change and success, has died at age 78, according to a statement posted to his verified Instagram account on Saturday.

He was diagnosed with cancer in July and "succumbed to underlying lung issues" surrounded by loved ones, the statement said. It did not mention when or where he died.

Along with his late fellow Grateful Dead co-founder and lead guitarist Jerry Garcia, who was at the center of the Deadhead universe, Weir was one of the group's two frontmen and main vocalists for most of the band's history.

It was Weir who sang the verses on the band's trademark boogie anthem, "Truckin'," and who wrote such key songs as "Sugar Magnolia," "Playing in the Band" and "Jack Straw."

The youthful, ponytailed "Bobby" grew into an eclectic songwriter whose handsome appearance and diverse musical influences helped broaden the band's appeal. British newspaper The Independent called Weir "arguably rock's greatest, if most eccentric, rhythm guitarist."

After Garcia's death at age 53 in 1995, Weir carved out an interesting if somewhat neglected solo career - much of it with his band, RatDog - and participated in reunions of surviving Dead members in different configurations.

"As the one good-looking guy in the Dead, baby-faced Weir was always what passed for the band's sex symbol," the San Francisco Chronicle's Joel Selvin wrote in 2004. "He didn't care about that, either. In fact, he always seemed to secretly relish subverting that image."

Weir was the subject of the 2014 documentary "The Other One: The Long, Strange Trip of Bob Weir," which made a case for the Dead's "other" guitarist as a musical force. Though some diehard Dead fans, or "Deadheads," adopted the trappings of tie-dyed psychedelia, the group itself was deeply attached to American roots music and was credited with bringing experimental improvisation to rock music.

Weir's own musical tastes ranged from Chuck Berry to cowboy songs to R&amp;B and reggae.

Thanks to relentless touring, constant musical evolution and a passionate fan base, the Grateful Dead - who existed from 1965 to 1995 - did not have to rely on producing hit records.

"Bob was the wild one," journalist Blair Jackson wrote in 2012. "He was the rock 'n' roller, but also the confident, smooth-voiced narrator on all those dramatic country-rock numbers about desperadoes and fugitives; a perfect fit for those tunes. He was the guy who would screech and scream himself hoarse at the end of the show, whipping us into a dancing frenzy."

Weir, whose birth name was Robert Hall Parber, was born on October 16, 1947, and raised by adoptive parents in Atherton, California. He did not excel in school, due in part to his undiagnosed dyslexia. In 1964 at age 16, he met Bay Area folk musician Garcia, with whom he formed the Warlocks, who soon morphed into the Grateful Dead.

The athletic Weir, who enjoyed football, was the youngest member of the original band and was sometimes referred to as "the kid."

He was still in high school when he joined up with Garcia, bass guitarist Phil Lesh, organist-vocalist-harmonica player Ron "Pigpen" McKernan and drummer Bill Kreutzmann.

Lesh recalled in his 2005 autobiography that he and Garcia had to make a promise to young Bob's mother. "The long and short of it was that if Jerry and I promised to make sure that Bob got to school every day, and that he got home all right after the gigs, she would allow him to remain in the band," wrote Lesh, who died in October 2024 at age 84. "We somehow convinced her that we would indeed see that he got to school every day. In San Francisco. At 8:00 a.m."

Eventually Weir moved in to the communal Dead house at 710 Ashbury Street in San Francisco. The group's first album, "The Grateful Dead," was released in March 1967.

According to some accounts, Weir was briefly fired from the band in 1968 because his guitar skills were deemed lacking. But he either redoubled his efforts or the others had second thoughts, because he was soon back in. By the time of the band's two famous 1970 albums, "Workingman's Dead" and "American Beauty," Weir was a key contributor.

His 1972 solo album, "Ace," was a de facto Grateful Dead album that featured Garcia and the others and included well-regarded Weir songs including "Cassidy," "Black-Throated Wind," "Mexicali Blues" and "Looks Like Rain." Many of his best-known songs were co-written with his old school friend, John Perry Barlow, who died in 2018.

As the band's rhythm guitarist, Weir often played little fills, riffs and figures instead of straight chords. "I derived a lot of what I do on guitar from listening to piano players," he told GQ magazine in 2019, citing McCoy Tyner's work with saxophonist John Coltrane. "He would constantly nudge and coax amazing stuff out of Coltrane."

Even decades after Garcia's death, Weir never forgot the influence of his old friend. He told GQ that Garcia was still present when Weir played guitar. "I can hear him: 'Don't go there. Don't go there,' or 'Go here. Go here,'" Weir said. "And either I listen or I don't, depending on how I'm feeling. But it's always 'How's old Jerry going to feel about this riff?' Sometimes I know he'd hate it. But he'd adjust."

Koji, a category one cyclone, crossed the coast between the towns of Ayr and Bowen in the state of Queensland, about 500 km (310 miles) north of state capital Brisbane.

Koji has "weakened below tropical cyclone intensity", the nation's weather forecaster said on its website.

It said the system was now a tropical low, bringing wind gusts of up to 95 kph (59 mph) and heavy rainfall between the towns of Ayr and Mackay, a tourist hub and gateway to the Great Barrier Reef.

Koji could still spark "dangerous and life-threatening flash flooding" in the region, the weather bureau said.

Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Koji was "expected to bring large amounts of rainfall to coastal areas of north Queensland and potentially inland areas".

"Flash flooding is a major risk along a significant stretch of Queensland's coast," Albanese said in televised remarks.

Queensland state Premier David Crisafulli said the cyclone had already brought rainfall of up to 200 mm (7.8 inches) to some areas overnight and was expected to result in heavy downpours over the next 24 to 48 hours.

"I do believe that people have prepared brilliantly for the rain that will come," Crisafulli said on social media platform X.

Townsville Airport, which closed on Saturday as a precaution, said on Facebook that it planned to reopen on Sunday "if safety and weather conditions allow."

Koji's approach comes after the state was hit in March by Alfred, a downgraded tropical cyclone, brought damaging winds and heavy rains, cutting power to hundreds of thousands.</description><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 01:56:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Last SDF fighters leave Syria's Aleppo, Ekhbariya TV reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/last-sdf-fighters-leave-syrias-aleppo-ekhbariya-tv-reports-2026-01-10/</link><description /><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 01:56:53 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Cyclone Koji downgraded to storm after crossing Australia's northeast coast; flooding warning risks issued</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/australias-queensland-state-braces-tropical-cyclone-koji-2026-01-10/</link><description /><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 01:56:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Rubio and Netanyahu spoke by phone on Saturday, US official says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/rubio-netanyahu-discuss-iran-syria-gaza-axios-reports-2026-01-11/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 10 (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke over the phone with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Saturday, a U.S. official said, without providing additional details.

While the American official did not mention the topics discussed in the call, Axios reported earlier that the two of them spoke about Gaza, Syria and the protests in Iran.

Iran, which had a 12-day war with Israel last year and whose nuclear facilities were bombed by the U.S. in June, is seeing its biggest anti-government demonstrations in years.

In Gaza, a fragile ceasefire has not progressed beyond its first phase since it began in October, with Israel and Hamas accusing each other of major breaches of the deal. The two sides remain far apart on the more difficult steps envisaged for the next phase.

Earlier this week, Israel and Syria agreed during U.S.-mediated talks in Paris to set up a communication mechanism to coordinate on security and commercial issues.

Since U.S. President Donald Trump took office in January 2025, Netanyahu has visited the United States five times to meet the Republican president while Trump visited Israel in October.</description><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 03:52:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/MZ5DO7N7SFKK3IQKQDVSVVYJ5E.jpg?auth=216bdcf9f1bc57dde36fb4d048f08d7c5a00ddf135e832e70a682a10c4575fae&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israel on high alert for possibility of US intervention in Iran, sources say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-high-alert-possibility-us-intervention-iran-sources-say-2026-01-11/</link><description>Jan 11 (Reuters) - Israel is on high alert for the possibility of any U.S. intervention in Iran as authorities there confront the biggest anti-government protests in years, according to three Israeli sources with knowledge of the matter.

President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to intervene in recent days and warned Iran’s rulers against using force against demonstrators. On Saturday, Trump said the U.S. stands “ready to help”.

The sources, who were present for Israeli security consultations over the weekend, did not elaborate on what Israel’s high-alert footing meant in practice. Israel and Iran fought a 12-day war in June, in which the U.S. joined Israel in launching airstrikes.

In a phone call on Saturday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio discussed the possibility of U.S. intervention in Iran, according to an Israeli source who was present for the conversation. A U.S. official confirmed the two men spoke but did not say what topics they discussed.

Israel has not signalled a desire to intervene in Iran as protests grip the country, with tensions between the two arch-foes high over Israeli concerns about Iran’s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.

In an interview with the Economist published on Friday, Netanyahu said there would be horrible consequences for Iran if it were to attack Israel. Alluding to the protests, he said: “Everything else, I think we should see what is happening inside Iran."</description><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 06:33:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WNQFAFCEE5KNLFNGKABJP6S4TY.jpg?auth=168e301cd6ca2c7b74e56d9bf2e9780278ee1c226e923d343a9a719516f00e25&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>‘ICE, Out for Good’ protests over fatal shooting erupt in Minneapolis, other US cities</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260111-ice-out-for-good-protests-over-fatal-shooting-erupt-in-minneapolis-other-us-cities</link><description>Thousands of demonstrators took to the streets of Minneapolis on Saturday chanting the name of the woman killed by a federal agent in the city, amid widespread anger at use of force in the Trump administration's immigration crackdown.

Organisers said more than 1,000 events were planned across the United States under the slogan "ICE, Out for Good" – referring to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency that is drawing growing opposition over its execution of President Donald Trump 's effort at mass deportations .

The slogan is also a reference to Renee Good, the 37-year-old mother shot dead in her car by an ICE agent on Wednesday.

Thousands braved frigid weather and streamed toward a snow-covered park to mobilize near the scene of the shooting. They carried signs demanding "ICE OUT" of Minnesota.

At the start of the protest, a voice called out, "Say her name!" The crowd shouted back: "Renee Good!"

Her death has sparked strong emotions in this Democratic stronghold, and across the nation.

"We got ICE shooting women in the face for self-defense. It doesn't make any sense," said Alex Vega, a protester in Boston.

"Let them come around here with that, and let's see what's really going to happen to ICE."

In Philadelphia, protesters marched in the rain from City Hall to the ICE field office. Others mobilized in New York, Washington and Boston, with the gatherings drawing dozens to hundreds of demonstrators.

More protests were planned for Sunday.

The calls to protest were being amplified by the "No Kings" movement, a network of left-wing organizations that mounted nationwide demonstrations against Trump last year.

The Trump administration has sought to paint Good as a "domestic terrorist," vigorously insisting the agent who fatally shot her was acting in self-defense.

This narrative is strongly disputed by local officials, who say footage shows Good's vehicle turning away from the agent and did not pose a threat to his life.

Cell phone footage apparently taken by the officer who fired the fatal shots shows him interacting with Good, who had blocked the road with her car in an apparent effort to impede the agents.

He approaches and circles Good's car, as she says to him: "I'm not mad at you."

Another agent can be heard ordering Good to exit the vehicle before she tries to drive off and shots ring out.

The agent filming the video can then be heard saying "fucking bitch."

The White House insisted the video gave weight to the officer's claim of self-defense -- even though the clip does not clearly show the moment the car moved away, or him opening fire.

Drew Lenzmeier, 30, said he joined the protest in Minneapolis "because I feel our rights are being taken away from us and we are turning into an authoritarian dictatorship."

"No one is stopping the Trump administration from now murdering citizens and stealing, kidnapping human beings. It's time to stop," he said.

On Friday evening, hundreds gathered noisily in front of Minneapolis hotels believed to be housing ICE agents, equipped with whistles, loudspeakers and musical instruments.

Several people were arrested and then quickly released, according to police.

Officials and residents in Minnesota have expressed concern that local law enforcement agencies have been shut out of the FBI investigation into the Minneapolis shooting.

According to The Trace, a media outlet focusing on gun violence, Good was the fourth person killed by federal immigration agents since the launch of the Trump administration's deportation campaign. Seven people have been injured.

In a separate incident, two people were injured Thursday in Portland, Oregon, by shots fired by federal border police during a traffic stop.</description><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 06:35:08 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/d0b182a4-eeb1-11f0-a14d-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/000-92BA87H.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran warns Washington it will retaliate against any attack</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-warns-washington-it-will-retaliate-against-any-attack-2026-01-11/</link><description>DUBAI, Jan 11 (Reuters) - Iran warned President Donald Trump on Sunday that any U.S. attack would lead to Tehran striking back against Israel and regional U.S. military bases as "legitimate targets", Parliament Speaker Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf told parliament.

Hours earlier, Syria's military said it had finished operations in the Kurdish-held Sheikh Maqsud neighbourhood with state television reporting that Kurdish fighters who surrendered were being bused to the north.

The military had already announced its seizure of Aleppo's other Kurdish-held neighbourhood, Ashrafiyeh.

Kurdish forces had controlled pockets of Syria's second city Aleppo and operate a de facto autonomous administration across swathes of the north and northeast, much of it captured during the 14-year civil war.

The latest clashes erupted after negotiations to integrate the Kurds into the country's new government stalled.

"We reached an understanding that led to a ceasefire and secured the evacuation of the martyrs, the wounded, the trapped civilians and the fighters from Ashrafiyeh and Sheikh Maqsud neighbourhoods to northern and eastern Syria," the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) wrote in a statement.

Syria's official SANA news agency reported that "buses carrying the last batch of members of the SDF organisation have left the Sheikh Maqsud neighbourhood in Aleppo, heading towards northeastern Syria".

The SDF initially denied its fighters were leaving, describing the bus transfers as forced displacement of civilians.

An AFP correspondent saw at least five buses on Saturday carrying men out of Sheikh Maqsud, but could not independently verify their identities.

According to the SDF statement, the ceasefire was reached "through the mediation of international parties to stop the attacks and violations against our people in Aleppo".

The United States and European Union both called for the Syrian government and Kurdish authorities to return to political dialogue.

The fighting, some of the most intense since the ousting of long-time ruler Bashar al-Assad in December 2024, has killed at least 21 civilians, according to figures from both sides, while Aleppo's governor said 155,000 people fled their homes.

Both sides blamed the other for starting the clashes on Tuesday.

On the outskirts of Sheikh Maqsud, families who had been trapped by the fighting were leaving, accompanied by Syrian security forces.

An AFP correspondent saw men carrying children on their backs board buses headed to shelters.

Dozens of young men in civilian clothing were separated from the crowd, with security forces making them sit on the ground before transporting them to an unknown destination, according to the correspondent.

A Syrian security official told AFP on condition of anonymity that the young men were "fighters" being "transferred to Syrian detention centres".

At the entrance to the district, 60-year-old Imad al-Ahmad was heading in the opposite direction, trying to seek permission to return home.

"I left four days ago...I took refuge at my sister's house," he told AFP. "I don't know if we'll be able to return today."

Nahed Mohammad Qassab, a 40-year-old widow also waiting to return, said she left before the fighting to attend a funeral.

"My three children are still inside, at my neighbour's house. I want to get them out," she said.

A flight suspension at Aleppo airport was extended until further notice.

US envoy Tom Barrack met Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa on Saturday, and afterwards called for a "return to dialogue" with the Kurds in accordance with the integration framework agreed in March.

The deal was meant to be implemented last year, but differences, including Kurdish demands for decentralised rule, stymied progress as Damascus repeatedly rejected the idea.

The fighting in Aleppo raised fears of a regional escalation, with neighbouring Turkey, a close ally of Syria's new Islamist authorities, saying it was ready to intervene. Israel has sided with the Kurdish forces.

The clashes have also tested the Syrian authorities' ability to reunify the country after the brutal civil war and commitment to protecting minorities, after sectarian bloodshed rocked the country's Alawite and Druze communities last year.</description><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 07:23:47 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/867dc41e-eeb5-11f0-a231-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26010396872489.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran warns US troops, Israel will be ‘legitimate targets’ if America strikes over protests</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260111-iran-warns-us-troops-israel-will-be-legitimate-targets-if-america-strikes-over-protests</link><description>Iran 's parliament met on Sunday to discuss deadly, nationwide protests that have raged for over two weeks. During a parliamentary session broadcast live on state TV, Speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf warned that the US military and Israel would be “legitimate targets” if America strikes the Islamic Republic, as threatened by President Donald Trump .

Ghalibaf, a hard-liner who has run for the presidency in the past, gave a speech applauding police and Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, particularly its all-volunteer Basij, for having “stood firm” during the protests.

“The people of Iran should know that we will deal with them in the most severe way and punish those who are arrested,” he said.

He went on to directly threaten Israel, “the occupied territory” as he referred to it, and the US military, possibly with a preemptive strike.

“In the event of an attack on Iran, both the occupied territory and all American military centres, bases and ships in the region will be our legitimate targets,” said the speaker. “We do not consider ourselves limited to reacting after the action and will act based on any objective signs of a threat.”

The parliamentary session, which saw lawmakers rush the dais, shouting: “Death to America,” came as US news website Axios reported that US Secretary ⁠of State Marco Rubio on Sunday discussed Gaza, Syria and the protests in Iran in a phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu .

While US and Israeli officials confirmed the phone call, details of the topics were not revealed.

Anti-regime rallies have continued in several Iranian cities and towns, with the death toll linked to the protests rising to more 116, according to Iranian rights group HRANA.

Meanwhile the internet shutdown in Iran remains in place and has now lasted more than 60 hours, monitor Netblocks said on Sunday.

"The censorship measure presents a direct threat to the safety and wellbeing of Iranians at a key moment for the country's future," it said on X, adding that the blackout is "now past the 60 hour mark".

Online videos sent out of Iran, likely using Starlink satellite transmitters, purportedly showed demonstrators gathering in northern Tehran's Punak neighborhood. There, it appeared authorities shut off streets, with protesters waving their lit mobile phones. Others banged metal while fireworks went off.

Other footage purportedly showed demonstrators peacefully marching down a street and others honking their car horns on the street.

“The pattern of protests in the capital has largely taken the form of scattered, short-lived, and fluid gatherings, an approach shaped in response to the heavy presence of security forces and increased field pressure,” said HRANA. “At the same time, reports were received of surveillance drones flying overhead and movements by security forces around protest locations, indicating ongoing monitoring and security control.”

In Mashhad, Iran's second-largest city, some 725 kilometers (450 miles) northeast of Tehran, footage purported to show protesters confronting security forces. Flaming debris and dumpsters could be seen in the street, blocking the road. Mashhad is home to the Imam Reza shrine, the holiest in Shiite Islam, making the protests there carry heavy significance for the country's theocracy.

Protests also appeared to happen in Kerman, 800 kilometers (500 miles) southeast of Tehran.

Iranian state television on Sunday morning took a page from demonstrators, having their correspondents appear on streets in several cities to show calm areas with a date stamp shown on screen. Tehran and Mashhad were not included. They also showed pro-government demonstrations in Qom and Qazvin.

Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has signaled a coming clampdown, despite US warnings. Tehran escalated its threats Saturday, with Iran’s attorney general, Mohammad Movahedi Azad, warning that anyone taking part in protests will be considered an “enemy of God,” a death-penalty charge. The statement carried by Iranian state television said even those who “helped rioters” would face the charge.

Iran’s theocracy cut off the nation from the internet and international telephone calls on Thursday, though it allowed some state-owned and semiofficial media to publish. Qatar’s state-funded Al Jazeera news network reported live from Iran, but they appeared to be the only major foreign outlet able to work.

Iran’s exiled Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi, who called for protests Thursday and Friday, asked in his latest message for demonstrators to take to the streets Saturday and Sunday. He urged protesters to carry Iran’s old lion-and-sun flag and other national symbols used during the time of the shah to “claim public spaces as your own.”

Pahlavi’s support of and from Israel has drawn criticism in the past — particularly after the 12-day war. Demonstrators have shouted in support of the shah in some protests, but it isn’t clear whether that’s support for Pahlavi himself or a desire to return to a time before the 1979 Islamic Revolution .

The demonstrations began December 28 over the collapse of the Iranian rial currency, which trades at over 1.4 million to $1, as the country’s economy is squeezed by international sanctions in part levied over its nuclear program. The protests intensified and grew into calls directly challenging Iran’s theocracy.</description><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 08:30:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/7cd6676c-ee89-11f0-945c-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26010842324226.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>International law applies to everyone, including US, says German finance minister</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/international-law-applies-everyone-including-us-says-german-finance-minister-2026-01-11/</link><description>BERLIN, Jan 11 (Reuters) - The principles of international law apply to everyone, including the United States, German Finance Minister and Vice Chancellor Lars Klingbeil said on Sunday, in reference to President Donald Trump's threats to seize Greenland .

"It is solely up to Denmark and Greenland to decide about Greenland's future. Territorial sovereignty and integrity must be respected," Klingbeil said ahead of his departure to Washington for a meeting of finance ministers from the Group of Seven advanced economies.

A U.S. military seizure of the mineral-rich Arctic island from Denmark, a long-time ally, would send shockwaves through NATO and deepen the divide between Trump and European leaders.

"We increase security in the Arctic together as NATO allies, not in opposition to one another," Klingbeil said.

Monday's G7 meeting will focus on access to critical minerals as Western countries seek to reduce their dependence on China given moves by Beijing to impose strict export controls on rare earths.

Klingbeil said Germany has a strong interest in expanding international cooperation in this area in order to strengthen security of supply, reduce dependencies and ensure reliable economic framework conditions.

"That is why it is important that we consult with our international partners and - wherever possible - act together," he said.

China dominates the critical minerals supply chain, refining between 47% and 87% of copper, lithium, cobalt, graphite and rare earths, according to the International Energy Agency.</description><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 09:22:21 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/TTJ5WYYRZBMBRKX73AHNHD7EEY.jpg?auth=7c9e35e00df73fc0c4f1fc47984e2d47ea7da5507a4a67163376f83afcf14bb1&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Myanmar’s junta holds second phase of widely slammed elections</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260111-myanmar-s-junta-holds-second-phase-of-widely-slammed-elections</link><description>Myanmar 's junta held the second phase of elections on Sunday that democracy watchdogs warn will let the military prolong its rule, opening polling in the constituency of deposed democratic leader Aung San Suu Kyi .

The armed forces have ruled Myanmar for most of its post-independence history, snatching back power in a 2021 coup after a decade-long democratic thaw, nullifying the previous poll, detaining Suu Kyi and plunging the country into civil war.

With Suu Kyi sidelined and her massively popular party dissolved, democracy advocates say the vote has been rigged by a crackdown on dissent and a ballot stacked with military allies.

Polls opened on Sunday morning in dozens of constituencies, including Suu Kyi's former seat of Kawhmu south of commercial hub Yangon.

Farmer Than Than Sint acknowledged Myanmar's "many problems" but told AFP she voted in pursuit of peace.

"We know it will not come right away. But we need to go step-by-step for our future generations," the 54-year-old said after voting.

The junta has pledged the three-phase election will return power to the people after it ends on January 25.

The Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP), described by many analysts as the military's prime proxy, won nearly 90 percent of lower house seats in the first phase late last month.

"I think the results lie only in the mouth of the military," a 50-year-old resident of Yangon, where voting also took place, told AFP.

"This election has absolutely nothing to do with escaping this suffering," said the resident, who spoke on condition of anonymity for security reasons.

The first phase had a turnout of around 50 percent, far below the roughly 70 percent of the 2020 election when most voters backed Suu Kyi's party.

A truck blasted loudspeaker messages along the main road in Kawhmu, urging voters to come out.

Kyaw Than, a 72-year-old farmer, said it was better to vote. "It would be weird to sit by and do nothing," he said.

There is no polling in large enclaves carved out by rebel factions, who the military accused of staging drone, rocket and bomb attacks during the first phase of voting that killed five people.

Analysts say the junta is attempting to launder its image, aiming to improve diplomatic relations, increase foreign investment and sap momentum from rebels.

"The junta engineered the polls to ensure victory for its proxy, entrench military domination in Myanmar, and manufacture a facade of legitimacy while violence and repression continue unabated," UN rights expert Tom Andrews said in a statement on Thursday.

The military justified its coup by alleging that Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) won a landslide over pro-military parties in 2020 through massive voter fraud.

Election monitors say those claims were unfounded.

Parties that won 90 percent of seats in 2020 – including the NLD – have been dissolved, according to the Asian Network for Free Elections.

Regardless of the vote, a quarter of parliamentary seats will be reserved for the armed forces under a constitution drafted during a previous period of military rule.

More than 330 people are being pursued under junta-enacted laws, including clauses that punish protest or criticism of the poll with up to 10 years in prison.

There are more than 22,000 political prisoners in junta jails, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners advocacy group.

Security forces put down pro-democracy protests since the coup but activists formed ragtag guerrilla units, often fighting alongside ethnic minority armies long opposed to central rule.

Voting has been cancelled in dozens of constituencies, many of them battlegrounds or regions where rebels run parallel administrations beyond the junta's reach.

The military waged offensives, which witnesses said included air strikes targeting civilian sites, in an attempt to claw back ground before the voting.

There is no official toll for Myanmar's civil war but monitoring group ACLED, which tallies media reports of violence, estimates that 90,000 people have been killed on all sides.</description><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 10:23:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/866c3c76-ee92-11f0-81df-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/10dea1022dc7b75827eedf75f7a4f879319b73c5.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Confronting protests, Iran vows to strike back if U.S. attacks</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/confronting-protests-iran-vows-strike-back-if-us-attacks-2026-01-11/</link><description>DUBAI/JERUSALEM, Jan 11 (Reuters) - Tehran threatened on Sunday to retaliate against Israel and U.S. military bases in the event of U.S. strikes on Iran, issuing the warning as Israeli sources said Israel was on high alert for the possibility of any U.S. intervention.

With Iran's clerical establishment facing the biggest anti-government protests since 2022, U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to intervene in recent days, warning Iranian leaders against using force against demonstrators. On Saturday, Trump said the U.S. stands "ready to help".

Iranian Parliament Speaker Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf, speaking in parliament on Sunday, warned against "a miscalculation".

"Let us be clear: in the case of an attack on Iran, the occupied territories (Israel) as well as all U.S. bases and ships will be our legitimate target," said Qalibaf, a former commander in Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards.

Authorities have stepped up efforts to quell the unrest that has spread across Iran since December 28. A U.S.-based rights group, HRANA, reported the death toll stood at 116, mostly protesters but including 37 members of the security forces.

The protests began in response to soaring inflation , before turning against the clerical establishment that has ruled since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. The government accuses the U.S. and Israel of fomenting unrest.

Three Israeli sources, who were present for Israeli security consultations over the weekend, said Israel was on a high-alert footing, but did not elaborate on what that meant.

An Israeli government spokesperson declined to comment. The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Israel and Iran fought a 12-day war in June last year, in which the U.S. joined Israel in launching airstrikes. Iran retaliated for those U.S. strikes by firing missiles at an American air base in Qatar.

The flow of information from Iran has been hampered by an internet blackout imposed by the authorities since Thursday. Internet monitoring watchdog Netblocks reported national connectivity levels remained about 1% of the norm.

A social media video posted on Saturday showed large crowds gathered in Tehran's Punak neighbourhood at night, drumming rhythmically on the railings of a bridge or other metal objects in an apparent sign of protest. Reuters verified the location.

Iranian state TV broadcast funeral processions in western Iranian cities such as Gachsaran and Yasuj for members of the security forces killed in the protests. The authorities have not said how many have been killed.

State TV reported that 30 members of the security forces would be buried in the central city of Isfahan, and that six security force members were killed by "rioters" in Kermanshah in the west. State TV also reported a mosque was torched by "rioters" in Mashhad, in the northeast, on Saturday night.

The Revolutionary Guards on Saturday accused "terrorists" of attacking security facilities.

Ahmad-Reza Radan, Iran's police chief, said security forces had stepped up efforts to confront "rioters".

Iran's rulers have quelled previous bouts of unrest, most recently in 2022 over the death in custody of a woman accused of violating dress codes.

Trump, posting on social media on Saturday, said: "Iran is looking at FREEDOM, perhaps like never before. The USA stands ready to help!!!"

In a phone call on Saturday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio discussed the possibility of U.S. intervention in Iran, according to an Israeli source who was present for the conversation.

A U.S. official confirmed the two men spoke but did not say what topics they discussed.

A senior U.S. intelligence official on Saturday described the situation in Iran as an "endurance game". The opposition was trying to keep up pressure until key government figures either flee or switch sides, while the authorities were trying to sow enough fear to clear the streets without giving the United States justification to intervene, the official said.

Israel has not signalled a desire to intervene, with tensions between the two arch-foes high over Israeli concerns about Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.

In an interview with the Economist published on Friday, Netanyahu said there would be horrible consequences for Iran if it were to attack Israel. Alluding to the protests, he said: "Everything else, I think we should see what is happening inside Iran."</description><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 10:45:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LXPVYSCAFZP3JGF3U55PQJ3BJE.jpg?auth=5922b85ce3d69c32b10f74090ea704a36bb61f328cce12ab550df0b45c0a4383&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US to push for quicker action in reducing reliance on China for rare earths</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/us-push-quicker-action-reducing-reliance-china-rare-earths-2026-01-11/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 11 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will urge Group of Seven nations and others to step up their efforts to reduce reliance on critical minerals from China when he hosts a dozen top finance officials on Monday, a senior U.S. official said.

The meeting, which kicks off with a dinner on Sunday evening, will include finance ministers or cabinet ministers from the G7 advanced economies, the European Union, Australia, India, South Korea and Mexico, said the official who was not authorized to speak publicly.

Together, the grouping accounts for 60% of global demand for critical minerals.

"Urgency is the theme of the day. It's a very big undertaking. There's a lot of different angles, a lot of different countries involved and we really just need to move faster," the official said.

Bessent on Friday told Reuters that he had been pressing for a separate meeting on the issue since a G7 leaders summit in Canada in June, where he delivered a rare earths presentation to gathered heads of state from the U.S., Britain, Japan, Canada, Germany, France, Italy and the European Union.

Leaders agreed to an action plan at the summit to secure their supply chains and boost their economies, but Bessent has grown frustrated about the lack of urgency demonstrated by attendees, the official said.

Aside from Japan, which took action after China abruptly cut off its critical minerals supplies in 2010, G7 members remain heavily dependent on critical minerals from China, which has threatened to impose strict export controls.

China dominates the critical minerals supply chain, refining between 47% and 87% of copper, lithium, cobalt, graphite and rare earths, according to the International Energy Agency. These minerals are used in defense technologies, semiconductors, renewable energy components, batteries and refining processes.

The U.S. is expected to issue a statement after the meeting, but no specific joint action is likely, the official added.

“The United States is in the posture of calling everyone together, showing leadership, sharing what we have in mind going forward," said the official. "We're ready to move with those who feel a similar level of urgency ... and others can join as they come to the realization of how serious this is."

The official gave no details on what further steps were planned by the Trump administration, which is pushing forward to boost domestic production and reduce reliance on China through agreements with Australia, Ukraine and other producers.

The U.S. signed an agreement with Australia in October aimed at countering China's dominance in critical minerals that includes an $8.5 billion project pipeline. The deal leverages Australia's proposed strategic reserve, which will supply metals like rare earths and lithium that are vulnerable to disruption.

The official said there had been progress, but more work was needed. "It's not solved," they added.

Canberra has said it has subsequently received interest from Europe, Japan, South Korea and Singapore.

Monday's meeting comes days after reports that China had begun restricting exports to Japanese companies of rare earths and powerful magnets containing them, as well as banning exports of dual-use items to the Japanese military.

The meeting was planned well before that action, U.S. officials said. China was still living up to its commitments to purchase U.S. soybeans and ship critical minerals to U.S. firms.</description><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 11:18:21 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/DNNIYDYMOJJ3DD2ZR4G2NAJ4RM.jpg?auth=0e2f4fab61e8491689d12d8347e5de74d7c1206aaef10e440804fe3ae77903dd&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>A thousand Kyiv apartment blocks still without heating after Russian strike</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/thousand-kyiv-apartment-blocks-still-without-heating-after-russian-strike-2026-01-11/</link><description>KYIV, Jan 11 (Reuters) - More than 1,000 apartment buildings in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv are still without heating following a devastating Russian attack earlier this week, local authorities said on Sunday.

Russia has intensified bombardments of Ukraine's energy system since it invaded its neighbour in 2022.

On Friday, a missile strike on Kyiv left virtually the entire city without power and heating amid a sharp cold snap, and it was not until Sunday that authorities restored water supplies and partially restored electricity and heating.

The war's fourth winter could be the coldest and darkest yet, with the accumulated damage to the grid bringing utilities to the brink and temperatures, already below minus 12 degrees Celsius (10.4 F), set to plunge to minus 20 degrees (-4 F) later this week.

"Restoration work is ongoing. However, the energy supply situation in the capital remains very difficult," Kyiv Mayor Vitalii Klitschko said on Telegram.

"According to forecasts, the severe frosts are not expected to subside in the coming days. Therefore, the difficult situation in the capital will continue," he added.

Ukraine's energy ministry said Russian forces had attacked the country's power system again during the night, briefly cutting off electricity to the south-eastern Dnipropetrovsk and Zaporizhzhia regions.

"Not a single day passed this week without attacks on energy facilities and critical infrastructure. A total of 44 attacks were recorded," Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko said on Telegram.</description><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 11:18:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HC3IH3DKKBMRZJDV7UWXIL7TUE.jpg?auth=6e3dab74ad6ebcd695928dc441ea692d8c6582dcc973bc28c12a1c44c656085e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Son of Iran's toppled shah seeks a role as protests expand</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/son-irans-toppled-shah-seeks-role-protests-expand-2026-01-11/</link><description>Jan 11 (Reuters) - In a nation where opposition to almost half a century of clerical rule has long been fragmented, the son of the last shah of Iran has become a prominent voice spurring on protesters staging the biggest anti-government demonstrations in years.

Reza Pahlavi, 65, has sought to speak as a national leader despite living outside Iran since before his father was toppled in the 1979 Islamic Revolution.

In messages sent from his home in the United States, he has repeatedly praised Iranians demanding change and, like those who ended his father's rule, calling for an end to repression.

"We will completely bring the Islamic Republic and its worn-out, fragile apparatus of repression to its knees," he said in one of his most recent messages, in a video posted on X.

How much public support Pahlavi now commands in Iran, where he has not set foot for decades, is difficult to gauge.

Some protesters have voiced support for him in verified videos circulating on social media, with some chants of "Long live the shah", suggesting his messages may be galvanising some people.

Many others simply call for sweeping political change, with slogans such as "Down with the dictator", a reference to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , who under Iran's system of clerical rule has the final say in all state matters.

Others shout slogans demanding action to fix an economy hammered by years of international sanctions and pummelled by a 12-day war in June, when Israel and then the U.S. launched airstrikes on Iran.

The dire economy was the catalyst for the latest protests.

"Everything Reza Pahlavi learned about ruling a country came from his own father who failed for a reason. We had Pahlavis, now it is time for a democratic country," said Azadeh, 27, in a message from northern Iran.

Pahlavi has frequently called for change, particularly during bouts of unrest, including mass demonstrations in 2009 over a contested election and nationwide protests in 2022 over the death of Mahsa Amini , a young woman who died while in detention for allegedly violating Islamic dress codes.

In those protests, there were few obvious signs of momentum in support for a man who the exiled royal court in 1980 declared shah after his father's death from cancer in a Cairo hospital.

Unlike in the 1979 revolution, there is no single voice driving the opposition.

Five decades ago, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini became the voice of revolutionary fervour, spurring on demonstrators - even those who wanted a secular system to prevail in Iran. Khomeini's recorded speeches smuggled in on cassette tapes from his exile abroad stoked opposition to Pahlavi's father.

In his messages over the past two weeks, which have been blocked as the government has shut down the internet , Pahlavi has told Iranians he is ready to lead a transition.

He has long said he would let the people decide on who should rule them, but he has been clear that he wants an end to theocratic rule.

"There is only one way to achieve peace: a secular, democratic Iran. I am here today to submit myself to my compatriots to lead them down this road to peace and a democratic transition," he said in a speech posted on X on June 23, shortly before the end of last year's 12-day war.

Born in 1960, Pahlavi was declared crown prince in 1967 at his father's coronation in Tehran. Images show him sitting beside his father's jewel-encrusted throne in a child's version of the shah's uniform, peaked cap on his lap and gold brocades on his small shoulders.

The monarchy's lavish style at that time helped fuel discontent when Iranians compared it to their own hardships, with surging inflation and a big wealth divide as the shah's bid to modernise the oil-powered economy left many people behind.

Iranians also sought an end to repression by the shah and his feared security apparatus, SAVAK.

Pahlavi left Iran before his father was forced out, heading to the United States to train as a fighter pilot. He later wrote that he offered to serve in the war with Iraq in the 1980s when the young theocratic Iranian state came under attack, but that his offer was turned down.

He studied political science at university.

From exile, Pahlavi, who is married with three children, has garnered support in the diaspora, including Iranians in the U.S., with his criticism of Iran's rulers and calls for change.

In 2023, he visited Israel, a close ally of Iran in his father's day and an implacable foe of the Islamic Republic now, and met Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other officials.

He supported the Israeli and U.S. strikes in June that mainly hit Iran's nuclear facilities, but said more action was needed to support Iran's people. Israel and Western states accuse Iran of seeking nuclear weapons, which Iran denies.

But he has gained little traction in winning personal support from Western governments abroad - neither in Washington, a close ally of Iran in the shah's time, nor in European capitals, which have long been critical of the Islamic Republic and its nuclear programme.

As the latest protests have unfolded, U.S. President Donald Trump has said he would support Iranians if security forces fire on them, but also said on Friday he was "not sure that it would be appropriate" to meet Pahlavi.</description><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 11:19:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/DY6IIQ6UEVMUNJQR2OZWSGDCH4.jpg?auth=bae9405471e25a22fbeb0cc22bd841affe70a635faedc4cb33925a74554563b8&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Hollywood stars battle for trophies at Sunday's Golden Globes</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/hollywood-stars-battle-trophies-sundays-golden-globes-2026-01-11/</link><description>BEVERLY HILLS, California, Jan 11 (Reuters) - Leonardo DiCaprio, Timothee Chalamet and other top names in show business will compete for prizes on Sunday at the Golden Globes, one of the major film contests on Hollywood's journey to the Academy Awards.

Medics said one Palestinian was killed in the Tuffah neighbourhood in Gaza City, in an area under Palestinian control, while two others were killed in the town of Bani Suhaila east of Khan Younis, an area Israel still occupies.

There was no comment from the Israeli military on the two incidents.

Fighting has largely abated since Israel and Palestinian militant group Hamas agreed to a ceasefire in October, two years into the war, but it has not stopped entirely. Israel and Hamas have traded blame over the violations of the deal.

A Hamas official told Reuters on Sunday that the group urged mediators to intervene to stop "daily Israeli killings that aim to derail the ceasefire deal."

More than 440 Palestinians, most of them civilians according to Gaza health officials, have been killed since the truce, as well as three Israeli soldiers.</description><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 11:40:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>German foreign minister puts emphasis on close ties before US trip</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/german-foreign-minister-puts-emphasis-close-ties-before-us-trip-2026-01-11/</link><description>BERLIN, Jan 11 (Reuters) - German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul emphasised the importance of transatlantic relations on Sunday as he left for a trip to Washington that takes place at a delicate time due to tensions over U.S. interests in Greenland and Venezuela .

"Never before has it been so crucial to invest in the transatlantic partnership in order to remain capable of shaping the world order," Wadephul said in Berlin before his departure.

He said he would address what he called "differences of opinions" between Germany and the United States during a meeting on Monday with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

"Where there are differences of opinion, we want to address these differences through dialogue in order to fulfil our shared responsibility for peace and security," Wadephul said.

On his way to Washington, Wadephul plans to stop over in Iceland on Sunday, where a meeting on Arctic security is scheduled with his Icelandic counterpart in Reykjavik.

"We support the Iranian people's struggle for freedom and wish them success," Saar said in a video interview posted on his X account.

Iran’s president has said his government will listen to protesters, but rioters were trying to “destroy the entire society”.

President Masoud Pezeshkian's comments represent a hardening tone from the reformist leader, who so far has been unable to assuage the public, as anger over the country’s ailing economy exploded into a direct challenge to the nation’s theocracy.

“People have concerns, we should sit with them and if it is our duty, we should resolve their concerns,” Pezeshkian said. “But the higher duty is not to allow a group of rioters to come and destroy the entire society.”

Iranian state television aired an interview with the president on Sunday. It had suggested it would be aired Saturday, but ended up not airing it.

Iranians living overseas rallied in London, Berlin, and other major cities over the weekend in a show of solidarity with the mass demonstrations in Iran.

At least 192 people have been killed in two weeks of protests against the government and economic strain in Iran, according to a Norway-based rights group.

"Since the start of the protests, Iran Human Rights has confirmed the killing of at least 192 protesters," the Norway-based NGO said, warning that the toll could be much higher as a days-long internet blackout hampered verification.

Israel's Foreign Minister Gideon Saar has urged the European Union to designate Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corps as a "terrorist organisation", as rights groups suspect the Islamic republic of using violence against protesters.

Saar said on X that he told visiting German Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt "that now is the time to designate Iran's Revolutionary Guards as a terrorist organisation within the European Union".

"This has long been Germany's position, and today the importance of this matter is clear to all," Saar added.

Iran has made significant arrests of key figures in the protest movement that has swept the Islamic republic over the last two weeks, the national police chief said Sunday.

"Last night (Saturday evening), significant arrests were made of the main elements in the riots, who, God willing, will be punished after going through legal procedures," Ahmad-Reza Radan told state TV, without giving details on the number or identities of those arrested.

Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian is set to  address economic plans and "people's demands" in an interview on Sunday, after two weeks of protests sparked by anger over the rising cost of living, state TV said.

"In a conversation with the national media, the president laid out the status of the government's major economic plan to reform the subsidy system, and also discussed recent events and the government's approach to responding to the people's demands," IRIB state TV said, noting the interview would be broadcast later Sunday.

For at least two decades, Beijing has sought to build influence in Latin America, not only to pursue economic opportunities but to gain a strategic foothold on the doorstep of its top geopolitical rival.

China's progress - from satellite tracking stations in Argentina and a port in Peru to economic support for Venezuela - has been an irritant for successive U.S. administrations, including that of Donald Trump .

Several Trump administration officials told Reuters the U.S. president's move against Maduro was intended in part to counter China's ambitions, and Beijing's days of leveraging debt to get cheap oil from Venezuela were "over."

Trump made the message explicit on Friday, expressing discomfort with China and Russia as a "next-door neighbor," in a meeting with oil executives.

“I told China and I told Russia, 'We get along with you very well, we like you very much, we don’t want you there, you’re not gonna be there,'" Trump said. Now, he said, he will tell China that “we are open for business” and that they can “buy all the oil they want from us there or in the United States.”

The success of the January 3 early morning raid, in which U.S. commandos swept into Caracas and grabbed the Venezuelan president and his wife, was a blow to China's interests and prestige.

The air defenses that U.S. forces quickly disabled had been supplied by China and Russia, and Trump said 30 million to 50 million barrels of oil under sanctions, much of it previously bound for Chinese ports, will now be sent to the U.S.

Analysts say Maduro's capture exposed Beijing's limited ability to exert its will in the Americas.

The attack exposed the gulf between China's "great-power rhetoric and its real reach" in the Western Hemisphere, said Craig Singleton, a China expert at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies think tank.

"Beijing can protest diplomatically, but it cannot protect partners or assets once Washington decides to apply direct pressure," he said.

In a statement to Reuters, the Chinese embassy in Washington said it rejected what it called the United States' "unilateral, illegal, and bullying acts."

"China and Latin American and Caribbean countries maintain friendly exchanges and cooperation. No matter how the situation may evolve, we will continue to be a friend and partner," said Liu Pengyu, the embassy's spokesperson.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

But one administration official said "China should be concerned about their position in the Western Hemisphere," adding that their partners in the region increasingly realize China cannot protect them.

The Trump administration's policy toward Beijing appears contradictory, with concessions aimed at calming a trade war on one hand and more assertive U.S. support for Taiwan on the other.

The Venezuela operation appeared to tilt U.S. policy in a more hawkish direction.

Indeed, the timing of the U.S. attack amplified Beijing's embarrassment.

Just hours before being toppled, Maduro met China's special envoy for Latin America, Qiu Xiaoqi, in Caracas, his last public appearance before becoming a U.S. captive.

The meeting, staged on camera even as U.S. military forces were secretly poised to launch their operation, suggested Beijing was blindsided, said another U.S. official.

"If they knew, they wouldn't have gone so publicly," the U.S. official told Reuters.

For years, Beijing poured money into Venezuela's oil refineries and infrastructure, providing an economic lifeline after the U.S. and its allies tightened sanctions from 2017.

Along with Russia, China has also provided funding and equipment for Venezuela's military, including radar arrays recently billed as able to detect advanced U.S. military aircraft. Those systems did little to impede a raid U.S. officials boasted had been conducted without any losses.

"Any nation around the world with Chinese defense equipment is checking their air defenses and wondering how safe they actually are from the United States," said Michael Sobolik, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute think tank.

"They are also noticing how China's diplomatic assurances to Iran and Venezuela resulted in zero meaningful protection when the U.S. military arrived."

China is now studying what went wrong with those defenses so they can shore up their own systems, according to a person briefed on intelligence about their response.

China may soon be under pressure elsewhere in the region.

It has sought to increase its influence in Cuba , and the U.S. suspects Beijing runs an intelligence-gathering operation there. China denies this, but last year pledged better intelligence sharing with Cuba.

In the days after the Venezuela operation, Trump said U.S. military intervention in Cuba, which has suffered from the loss of Venezuelan oil , was likely unnecessary because it appeared ready to fall on its own.

The Trump administration also continues to push Chinese companies away from port operations around the Panama Canal, the critical waterway linking the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.

A State Department official said the U.S. "remains concerned" about Chinese influence near the canal, but appreciates Panama's actions to curb this, including by exiting Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative and auditing the Panama ports concession under contract to Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison (0001.HK) , opens new tab .

While China may be on the back foot in the region, analysts caution that extended U.S. military involvement in Venezuela or deterioration in the security situation there could open a door for Beijing to reassert itself.

Daniel Russel, a former senior State Department official now with the Asia Society, said the dramatic shift in Washington under Trump from a rule-of-law posture to a “spheres-of-influence logic focused on the Western Hemisphere” could play into China’s hands.

“Beijing wants Washington to accept that Asia is in China’s sphere, and no doubt hopes that the U.S. will get bogged down in Venezuela,” he said.</description><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 13:31:04 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/IOEDAY7DMJL3ZA7Y3SFVH6YVVI.jpg?auth=f535836b5fef6dd8cbfb3185a7bb5dc7e836e11a7003db3e76f8c4aa4e36d763&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Nordics reject Trump's claim of Chinese and Russian ships around Greenland, FT reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/nordics-reject-trumps-claim-chinese-russian-ships-around-greenland-ft-reports-2026-01-11/</link><description>Jan 11 (Reuters) - Nordic diplomats rejected U.S. President Donald Trump's claims of Russian and Chinese vessels operating near Greenland, the Financial Times reported on Sunday.

There have been no signs of Russian or Chinese ships or submarines around Greenland in recent years, the FT said, citing two senior Nordic diplomats with access to NATO intelligence briefings.

Reuters could not immediately verify the report. The White House and NATO did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.

“It is simply not true that the Chinese and Russians are there. I have seen the intelligence. There are no ships, no submarines,” the FT quoted one senior diplomat as saying.

Another Nordic diplomat said claims that waters around Greenland were “crawling” with Russian and Chinese vessels were unfounded, adding that such activity was on the Russian side of the Arctic.

Trump has repeatedly said Russian and Chinese vessels are operating near Greenland, a claim Denmark disputes. He has not provided evidence to support it.

Trump said on Friday the U.S. must own Greenland , an autonomous part of the Kingdom of Denmark , to prevent Russia or China from occupying the strategically located and mineral-rich territory.

"The image that's being painted of Russian and Chinese ships right inside the Nuuk fjord and massive Chinese investments being made is not correct," Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said earlier this week.

Vessel tracking data from MarineTraffic and LSEG show no Chinese or Russian ship presence near Greenland.

Greenland's assembly said late on Friday it would bring forward a meeting to discuss its response to U.S. threats to take control of the island.

Trump's renewed push for Greenland, after U.S. military intervention in Venezuela , worries many of the island's 57,000 inhabitants, whose widely held goal is to eventually become an independent nation.</description><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 13:31:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WICV5CFXWFM7NLY6IOE5WTAWVE.jpg?auth=5c48cff09b0ca9da937e82261a07f88cb13ca7c7bd7e81083867be9ed2d6aebc&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Sweden 'highly critical' of US rhetoric on Greenland and Denmark, says PM</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/sweden-highly-critical-us-rhetoric-greenland-denmark-says-pm-2026-01-11/</link><description>SALEN, Sweden, Jan 11 (Reuters) - Sweden is highly critical of the "threatening rhetoric" against Greenland and Denmark from U.S. President Donald Trump's administration, Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said on Sunday.

Kristersson said in a speech on Sunday that the rules-based world order was under greater threat than for many decades.

"We are highly critical of what the United States is now doing and has done in Venezuela, in regards to international law, and probably even more critical of the rhetoric that is being expressed against Greenland and Denmark," he said at an annual security conference in northern Sweden.

"On the contrary, the United States should thank Denmark, which has been a very loyal ally over the years."

President Donald Trump said on Friday that the U.S. needs to own Greenland to prevent Russia or China from occupying it in the future.

Itamaraty said that both governments have now been notified of the decision officially. Brazil has not issued a formal statement or provided additional details.

Sweden has, like most European countries, invested heavily in defence following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. However, Sweden's vast territory has remained vulnerable to aerial threats.

"The experience from the war in Ukraine clearly shows how crucial a robust and resilient air defence is," Defence Minister Pal Jonson told reporters at a security conference in northern Sweden.

He said Sweden would buy short-range air defence systems to protect cities, bridges, power plants and other critical infrastructure.

On Sunday Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson criticized the U.S. administration's "threatening rhetoric" against Greenland and Denmark, saying the U.S. should thank Denmark for being a loyal ally.

"Chariots of the Gods?", published in 1968, sold millions of copies with its thesis that advanced aliens had repeatedly visited Earth, leaving their mark in the form of Inca and Egyptian ruins, cave drawings and other physical monuments.

"It took courage to write this book, and it will take courage to read it," the work begins.

It acknowledged that scholars would dismiss it as nonsense, but insisted that "the past teemed with unknown gods who visited the primeval earth in manned spaceships".

Academics wrote books refuting his theories, criticising him as a purveyor of some of the more fantastical notions of pseudoscience. German news magazine Der Spiegel even had a 1973 cover story titled "The Daeniken Hoax".

Nevertheless, legions of fans snapped up his more than 40 books and watched his television specials and documentary films. The over 70 million books that he sold were translated into more than 30 languages.

Von Daeniken spent the early part of his working life managing a hotel in eastern Switzerland, where a fraud conviction landed him in jail for 18 months.

But as his book took off, he emerged from prison as a best-selling author.

Still, he never presented the smoking gun to fulfil astronomer Carl Sagan's famous adage that "extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence".

"He ... says that the astonishing astronomical information ancient civilizations, such as the Mayan, had is proof that there were some space travelers around to teach it to them. This fits in with his general questioning of the ability of the Egyptians to build the pyramids, or the Easter Islanders to erect those massive stone heads," the New York Times wrote in 1974.

"His method is to use a negative - ancient peoples couldn't have done or thought all the things they did - to prove a positive - that the ancient people were the beneficiaries of some kind of cosmological Point 4 (development assistance) programme."

Such criticism never knocked von Daeniken off his stride.

"We owe it to our self-respect to be rational and objective," he wrote. "At some time or other every daring theory seemed to be a Utopia. How many Utopias have long since become everyday realities!"

Television specials about his books made him a well-known figure in Europe and the United States. In 2003 he opened a Mysteries of the World theme park in Interlaken - although it went bust after three years.

In a treatise on his website, von Daeniken said he was not an esoteric, and that his work served to debunk "a world of religious and unfortunately often scientific humbugs".

"From countless old written records I know that these 'gods' promised to return. Then we will experience the god shock, a total catastrophe in religion and science. And everything would have been so easy to understand - without this god shock. The evidence speaks a clear language. That is what drives me."

The release in July 2021 of a watershed U.S. government UFO report that did not rule out extraterrestrial origins gave him hope.

"In future, anyone who talks about UFOs and extraterrestrials can no longer simply be ridiculed. People will slowly realise that many things are possible that they previously considered impossible," he told the Neue Zuercher Zeitung newspaper.

"As soon as we are prepared and get used to the idea that we are not alone in the universe, the extraterrestrials will come to us. I expect that to be the case within the next 10 years."</description><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 15:21:58 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'No more oil or money': Trump urges Cuba to cut deal with US 'before it's too late'</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260111-no-more-oil-or-money-trump-urges-cuba-to-cut-deal-with-us-before-it-s-too-late</link><description>US President Donald Trump on Sunday suggested Cuba should strike a ⁠deal with Washington, warning that the island nation would no longer receive oil or money from Venezuela.

Venezuela is Cuba's biggest oil supplier, but since ​the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro by US forces, ‍Trump has successfully pressed interim President Delcy Rodriguez to send Venezuelan oil to the United ​States.

"THERE WILL BE NO MORE OIL OR MONEY GOING ​TO CUBA – ZERO! I strongly suggest they make a deal, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE," Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social on Sunday.

" Cuba lived, for many years, on large amounts of OIL and MONEY from Venezuela," Trump said.

US intelligence has painted a grim picture of Cuba's economic and political ‍situation, but its assessments offer no clear support for Trump's prediction that the island is "ready ​to fall", Reuters reported on Saturday, citing three people familiar with the confidential assessments.

The CIA’s view is that key sectors of the Cuban ‌economy, such as agriculture and tourism, are severely strained by frequent blackouts, trade sanctions and other problems. The potential ‍loss of oil imports and other support from Venezuela, for decades a key ally, could make governing more difficult for the administration that has ruled Cuba since Fidel Castro led a revolution in 1959.

For Cuba, the loss of Venezuelan oil is devastating. Between January and November of last year, Venezuela ‍sent an average of 27,000 barrels per day (bpd) to the island, covering roughly 50% of ‌Cuba's oil ​deficit, according to shipping data and documents from Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA.</description><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 15:22:33 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/bb274260-ecb4-11f0-8f02-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-07T223444Z-627251180-RC2SBEA20ART-RTRMADP-3-USA-TRUMP-UN.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Conditions not met for oil firms to invest in Venezuela, expert says</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/conditions-not-met-for-oil-firms-to-invest-in-venezuela-expert-says</link><description /><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 15:22:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/0546dc28-eefb-11f0-b731-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260111-090401-091523-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuela releases political prisoners in deal with Washington</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/venezuela-releases-political-prisoners-in-deal-with-washington</link><description /><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 15:22:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/4acddfc6-eefb-11f0-b192-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260111-150515-150725-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Salah, Osimhen and Mané aim to deny Morocco AFCON title</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/africa/20260111-salah-osimhen-and-man%C3%A9-aim-to-deny-morocco-afcon-title</link><description>The Africa Cup of Nations has reached the semi-final stage and a tournament devoid of shocks now offers up two mouthwatering ties with hosts Morocco looking to see off the challenges of their fellow continental heavyweights.

Mohamed Salah 's Egypt , Victor Osimhen's Nigeria and Sadio Mané' s Senegal all remain in contention to win the trophy in Rabat next Sunday, even if home advantage still makes Morocco favourites.

World Cup semi-finalists in 2022, Morocco are Africa's top-ranked team and approach Wednesday's semi-final against Nigeria in the capital defending an unbeaten record since losing to South Africa at the last AFCON.

Walid Regragui's side have conceded just one goal in five matches here and doubts about their ability to handle the enormous pressure of playing at home were blown away with their performance in beating Cameroon 2-0 in the quarter-finals.

Captain and current African player of the year Achraf Hakimi is fit again after injury, and in Real Madrid winger Brahim Diaz – scorer of five goals in five games – they have probably the tournament's outstanding player.

"He can become the best player in the world if he wants to," remarked Regragui after the Cameroon game.

Morocco are Africa's leading power right now and, unlike Nigeria, are gearing up for the World Cup .

But their Cup of Nations record down the years has been underwhelming. This is their first semi-final since 2004, when they lost the final to Tunisia .

Going further back, Morocco beat Nigeria en route to lifting the trophy in 1976 – half a century on, that remains their only continental title.

Nigeria returned to Morocco with much to prove after a penalty shoot-out defeat by the Democratic Republic of Congo in a November play-off in Rabat ended their hopes of World Cup qualification.

There might be 10 African countries participating at the World Cup and it is remarkable that Nigeria – with its footballing pedigree and the largest population on the continent – will not be among them.

However, their performances over the last three weeks have shown that to be an anomaly.

Nigeria were runners-up at the last Cup of Nations in 2024. Led by two former African players of the year in Osimhen and Ademola Lookman, they are this tournament's top scorers with 14 goals.

So what has changed from the failed World Cup qualifying campaign?

"Nothing," said coach Eric Chelle, appointed exactly a year ago. "This is the same team. The difference is just that they have improved because they know what I want."

Shocks have been effectively non-existent at this AFCON but Nigeria's presence means four of the five top-ranked African teams are in the semis – the exception is Algeria, beaten by the Super Eagles on Saturday.

Wednesday's other semi-final in Tangiers between Egypt and Senegal is a repeat of the 2022 final, which the Lions of Teranga won on penalties.

Senegal, ranked second in Africa and 19th in the world, were seen as the biggest threat to Morocco before the tournament and stand one game away from a third final appearance in four editions.

They have an experienced side which includes Mané, who will come up against his old Liverpool teammate Salah.

Their presence means the last five players to win the African player of the year prize are all in the semi-finals.

Salah, who like Osimhen has four goals at the tournament, has never won AFCON, having twice been a losing finalist.

He came to Morocco having fallen from favour at his club but seems to have found happiness again with his national team as he looks to fire Egypt to a record-extending eighth title.

"I have won almost every honour, but this is the one I am waiting for," said Salah after the quarter-final win over Ivory Coast, before insisting the Pharaohs are now the outsiders.

"We are coming up against really good teams, most of whose players are based in Europe , which makes it easier for them. We have very good players but most play in Egypt. We have three players playing abroad but all of them are in a difficult situation – none of them are playing for their clubs just now," he added, with a nod to his own problems at Anfield.</description><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 16:25:07 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/780fa9d4-eeff-11f0-966d-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/2025-12-27T152209Z-1035249010-MT1SIPA000M249NZ-RTRMADP-3-SIPA-USA.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran protest deaths rise to more than 500, rights group says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-protest-deaths-rise-more-than-500-rights-group-says-2026-01-11/</link><description>DUBAI, Jan 11 (Reuters) - Deaths from two weeks of protests in Iran have risen to more than 500, U.S.-based rights group HRANA said on Sunday.

In the early days of the regular military 's war with the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in April 2023, the army-aligned government fled the capital, which was quickly overrun by rival troops.

It has pursued a gradual return to Khartoum since the army recaptured the city last March.

"Today, we return, and the Government of Hope returns to the national capital," Idris told reporters in Khartoum, promising "better services" for residents.

For close to two years, the Sudanese capital – composed of the three cities of Khartoum, Omdurman and Khartoum North (Bahri) – was an active battlefield.

Entire neighbourhoods were besieged, rival fighters shot artillery across the Nile River and millions of people were displaced from the city.

Between March and October, 1.2 million people returned to Khartoum, according to the UN.

Many found a city with barely functioning services, their homes destroyed and neighbourhoods pockmarked by makeshift cemeteries authorities are now exhuming.

The war is estimated to have killed tens of thousands of people in the capital alone, but the complete toll is unknown, as many families are forced to bury their dead in makeshift graves.

Idris said the government was committed to improving electricity, water, healthcare and education services.

According to the UN , the rehabilitation of the capital's essential infrastructure would cost some $350 million.

In recent months, the government has held some cabinet meetings in Khartoum and launched reconstruction efforts.

The city has witnessed relative calm, though the RSF has carried out drone strikes, particularly on infrastructure.

Battles rage elsewhere across the vast country. South of Khartoum, the RSF has pushed through the Kordofan region, after dislodging the army from its last stronghold in Darfur last year.

The conflict has left 11 million people displaced internally and across borders, and created the world's largest displacement and hunger crises.</description><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 16:50:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/b0629372-ef05-11f0-b9ca-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/000-88274T6.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Hundreds killed in protests in Iran, rights group says</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/hundreds-killed-in-protests-in-iran-rights-group-says</link><description /><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 16:50:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/9a3d61ee-ef0a-11f0-addd-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260111-170139-170708-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump briefing on Iran options planned for Tuesday, WSJ reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-briefing-iran-options-planned-tuesday-wsj-reports-2026-01-11/</link><description>Jan 11 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump is scheduled to be briefed by senior officials in his administration on Tuesday on specific options to respond to the protests in Iran, the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday, citing U.S. officials.

The White House said it had no comment on the report.

Trump, who has repeatedly threatened to intervene in recent days, posted on social media on Saturday: "Iran is looking at FREEDOM, perhaps like never before. The USA stands ready to help!!!

The strikes came days after the Lebanese military said it had completed disarming Hezbollah south of the Litani River, the first phase of a nationwide plan, though Israel has called those efforts insufficient.

Lebanon's official National News Agency (NNA) reported that "enemy warplanes launched more than 10 raids on the threatened location" in the town of Kafr Hatta, which lies north of the Litani, noting "significant damage" to buildings there.

The Israeli military said it was "striking Hezbollah infrastructure in several areas" shortly after issuing an evacuation warning for Kafr Hatta.

Israel has kept up regular strikes in Lebanon despite a November 2024 ceasefire that sought to end more than a year of hostilities between it and Hezbollah.

Earlier on Sunday, the Israeli army announced it had carried out strikes on what it said was Hezbollah infrastructure elsewhere in the south "in response to Hezbollah's continuous violations of the ceasefire understandings".

The NNA reported "a series of violent Israeli strikes" on Jezzine, Mahmudiyeh and Al-Dimasqiyeh, as well as "more than 10 strikes" on Al-Bureij, all in southern Lebanon.

Most of the targeted areas are located north of the Litani.

Under heavy US pressure and fearing expanded Israeli strikes, Lebanon has committed to disarming the Iran-backed militant group, which was badly weakened by its war with Israel.

Lebanon's army said Thursday that it had "achieved the objectives of the first phase" of its disarmament plan, covering the area south of the Litani – around 30 kilometres (20 miles) from the Israeli border – with the intention to extend it to the rest of the country.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 's office said in response that the ceasefire "states clearly, Hezbollah must be fully disarmed".

Lebanon's efforts, it added, "are an encouraging beginning, but they are far from sufficient, as evidenced by Hezbollah's efforts to rearm and rebuild".

Despite the truce , Israel has also maintained troops in five south Lebanon areas it deems strategic.</description><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 17:20:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/ac50aa8a-d1e6-11f0-ba27-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/2025-12-04T152038Z-1695848887-RC2Q9IA6O1M8-RTRMADP-3-ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS-LEBANON-EVACUATION.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Homeland Security to send hundreds more officers to Minnesota, Noem says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/homeland-security-send-hundreds-more-officers-minnesota-noem-says-2026-01-11/</link><description>Jan 11 (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Homeland Security is sending "hundreds" more officers to Minnesota a day after tens of thousands of people marched through Minneapolis to protest the fatal shooting of a woman by an immigration agent, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in remarks that aired on Sunday.

The officers would be deployed on Sunday and Monday to bolster the safety of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Border Patrol officials already in Minnesota, Noem said on Fox News' "Sunday Morning Futures" program. Some 2,000 federal officers have already been dispatched to the Minneapolis-St. Paul area in what DHS has called its largest operation ever.

The new deployments were scheduled to begin even as more than 1,000 rallies were planned nationwide this weekend to protest the federal government's deportation push and Wednesday's fatal shooting of 37‑year‑old Renee Good by an ICE officer.

Minnesota officials have called the shooting unjustified, pointing to bystander video they say showed Good's vehicle turning away from the agent as he fired.

Noem and other U.S. officials have maintained that the agent acted in self-defense because Good, a volunteer in a community network that monitors and records ICE operations in Minneapolis, drove forward in the direction of the agent who then shot her, after another agent had approached the driver's side and told her to get out of the car.

In a separate Sunday appearance on CNN's "State of the Union," Noem said other video footage showed Good protesting ICE agents at other locations earlier on Wednesday morning, but did not say if or when it would be publicly released.

Minnesota authorities on Friday said they were opening their own criminal investigation into the incident, after some state law enforcement officials said the FBI was refusing to cooperate with state investigators.

White House Border Security Czar Tom Homan said on "Fox News Sunday" that he wanted to let the investigation play out, but that he "truly believe[s] that officer thought his life was in danger to take that action."</description><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 18:30:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/OK5Y3U52ZJP3PKFUJMW7XAXJ7M.jpg?auth=9f7d11b9ba1433dbe35170e384cb8d83f4c81efc659ca8d7f7ac575f775c8056&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Onus now on Russia to show it wants peace in Ukraine, says EU's von der Leyen</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/onus-now-russia-show-it-wants-peace-ukraine-says-eus-von-der-leyen-2026-01-11/</link><description>BRUSSELS, Jan 11 (Reuters) - It is now up to Russia to show it is interested in peace, after Kyiv and its allies agreed on a peace plan and security guarantees that would take effect following a ceasefire, the head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said.

Speaking to reporters, she said the peace plan was the 20-point proposal that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy discussed with U.S. President Donald Trump at the end of last year.

She added that, alongside the plan, there were substantial, robust, and well-defined security guarantees for Kyiv from the United States and Europe.

"Now, Russia has to show that they are interested in peace," von der Leyen said.

She said the security guarantees would rely first on Ukraine's armed forces, which she said were well-trained and battle-experienced. It would be the task of the Europeans to make sure the Ukrainian army is also well equipped, she said.

The second line of defence would be the so-called Coalition of the Willing -- 35 states including most EU countries as well as Canada, Britain, Australia, New Zealand and Turkey.

"Here it is very good that the Americans are involved, specifically in the verification and the monitoring, but also with a backstop," von der Leyen said.

She said that the EU was working on plans to ensure Ukraine's economic prosperity after a ceasefire, with ideas to be spelled out in a forthcoming "prosperity paper". The document would set out measures for the short-term and over the next decade to boost Ukraine's economy and support its recovery.</description><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 18:31:43 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/QXIBPVVLXZPI5FZ674HJ62NBGM.jpg?auth=5799ad347a2d0511fc19e23b671b22e3c0f7555e3b47605fe1d7d5134f69311f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UK, Germany discuss NATO forces in Greenland to calm US threat, Bloomberg News reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk-germany-discuss-nato-forces-greenland-calm-us-threat-bloomberg-news-reports-2026-01-11/</link><description>Jan 11 (Reuters) - A group of European countries, led by Britain and Germany, is discussing plans to boost their military presence in Greenland to show U.S. President Donald Trump that the continent is serious about Arctic security, Bloomberg News reported on Sunday.

The Telegraph reported on Saturday that military chiefs from Britain and other European countries were drawing up plans for a possible NATO mission in Greenland, which U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly said he wanted to acquire .

The newspaper said British officials had begun early-stage talks with Germany, France and others on plans that could involve deploying British troops, warships and aircraft to protect Greenland from Russia and China.

British transport minister Heidi Alexander, asked on Sky News whether Britain was discussing troop deployments, said talks on how to deter Russian President Vladimir Putin in the Arctic were "business as usual".

"It's becoming an increasingly contested geopolitical region, with Russia and China ... you would expect us to be talking to all our allies in NATO about what we can do to deter Russian aggression in the Arctic Circle," Alexander said.

Asked about the Telegraph report, a government spokesperson said Britain was "committed to working with NATO allies to strengthen NATO's Arctic deterrence and defence".

Trump has said the U.S. must own Greenland , an autonomous part of the Kingdom of Denmark, to prevent Russia or China occupying the strategically located and minerals-rich territory in the future, arguing U.S. military presence there was not enough.

Bloomberg News reported on Sunday that a group of European countries, led by Britain and Germany, is discussing plans to boost their military presence in Greenland.

Citing people familiar with the plans, the report said Germany will propose setting up a joint NATO mission to protect the Arctic region.

The Financial Times reported on Sunday that Nordic diplomats rejected Trump's claims of Russian and Chinese vessels operating near Greenland.

Trump has not provided any evidence to back up his claims, which Denmark disputes. Vessel tracking data from MarineTraffic and LSEG show no Chinese or Russian ship presence near Greenland.

The Telegraph reported that European nations hoped a stronger military presence in the Arctic would convince Trump to drop his plans to seize the island.</description><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 18:53:07 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/44AGMJI53JPZTDR4UC6JNNXN5U.jpg?auth=c4d2f3c9680b40b2db54f066b9e314b405be09ac3d39752f785d0d011ffd1804&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>French Socialists won't vote with Mercosur no-confidence motions</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/french-socialists-wont-vote-with-mercosur-no-confidence-motions-2026-01-11/</link><description>PARIS, Jan 11 (Reuters) - The French Socialist party will not vote in favour of two no-confidence motions filed by far-right and far-left opposition parties over France's failure to block the EU's Mercosur trade deal , its leader said on Sunday, giving some breathing space to the country's fragile government.

"It would be absurd to censure the government on Mercosur," Olivier Faure told BFM TV. The Mercosur deal- 25 years in the works - is between the EU and the Mercosur group of South American countries.

Analysts had said last week that approval chances of these motions were few, especially the one filed by the far-right National Rally (RN), the biggest party in the National Assembly, as left-wing parties never vote for any of its initiatives.

Still, the threats underline the political tightrope Macron's administration continues to walk just over a year before the 2027 presidential election, with polls showing the RN has a shot at victory next year.

Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu wants neither censure nor dissolution of the National Assembly, Le Parisien newspaper reported on Saturday.

At the same time, his office announced it had asked the Interior Ministry to prepare for possible legislative elections on the same dates as municipal elections, on March 15 and 22, in the event of his government's collapse.

"Let's be clear. I want neither censure, nor dissolution. My fight is for stability and to ward off disorder," Lecornu told Le Parisien.

"The motion of no-confidence would send a dramatic signal at a time when we are seeking compromise and an even more dramatic message in view of the international political situation," he told the daily newspaper, after denouncing "cynical partisan posturing" in a message on X on Friday .

Lecornu said the no confidence motions sent a negative signal abroad. They will be put to the vote early next week while budget talks are supposed to resume Tuesday.

Over the weekend, a parliamentary committee rejected the budget bill in its present form, another sign of the uphill struggle the government is facing to secure the euro zone's second-largest economy a working budget.

The government has invited parties except RN and the hard-left France Unbowed to a last-resort meeting at the finance ministry to find a deal on the budget.

"There is a meeting tomorrow ... with those who are willing to discuss ... I hope for a compromise," Faure said.</description><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 18:53:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/UGQZQVTCOJO3TNFKXQ7QRRCLTM.jpg?auth=015668a17718c41cf6bce2a1940a8eb98b02576cc9837210d42729c844b6778c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Some US senators skeptical about military options for Iran</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/some-us-senators-skeptical-about-military-options-iran-2026-01-11/</link><description>Jan 11 (Reuters) - Some U.S. lawmakers in both major parties on Sunday questioned whether military action against Iran is the best approach for the United States as Iranian authorities face growing turmoil.

U.S. President Donald Trump in recent days has left open the possibility of American intervention in Iran, where the biggest anti-government protests in years have led to the Revolutionary Guards blaming unrest on terrorists and vowing to safeguard the governing system.

But at least two U.S. senators sounded notes of caution during interviews on TV networks’ Sunday morning programs.

"I don’t know that bombing Iran will have the effect that is intended,” Republican Senator Rand Paul said on ABC News’ "This Week" show.

Rather than undermining the regime, a military attack on Iran could rally the people against an outside enemy, Paul and Democratic Senator Mark Warner said.

Warner, appearing on "Fox News Sunday," warned that a military strike against Iran could risk uniting Iranians against the United States "in a way that the regime has not been able to." History shows the dangers of U.S. intervention, said Warner, who argued that the U.S.-backed 1953 overthrow of Iran's government set in motion a chain of events that gradually led to the rise of the country's Islamic regime in the late 1970s.

The Wall Street Journal on Sunday reported that U.S. military and diplomatic officials will brief Trump on Tuesday about options for Iran, including cyberattacks and potential military action.

Iran has said it will target U.S. military bases if the United States launches an attack. But Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, who has often touted a muscular approach to foreign policy, said Trump "needs to embolden the protesters and scare the hell out of the [Iranian] regime."

"If I were you, Mr. President, I would kill the leadership that are killing the people," Graham said on Fox News' "Sunday Morning Futures" show. "You’ve got to end this."

Reza Pahlavi, the U.S.-based son of the Iranian shah who was ousted in 1979, said on Sunday he is prepared to return to Iran to lead a shift to a democratic government.

"I'm already planning on that," Pahlavi said on "Sunday Morning Futures." "My job is to lead this transition to make sure that no stone is left unturned, that in full transparency, people have an opportunity to elect their leaders freely and to decide their own future."</description><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 19:39:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/B2GDYHETWFITZESJSIA7BDLJYQ.jpg?auth=8ad81f2dd19c6c7e6d3cb455a6752370d4bc82486f58695881ad333860940247&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>NATO should launch operation to boost security in Arctic, Belgian minister says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/nato-should-launch-operation-boost-security-arctic-belgian-minister-says-2026-01-11/</link><description>BRUSSELS, Jan 11 (Reuters) - NATO should launch an operation in the Arctic to address U.S. security concerns, Belgium's defence minister told Reuters on Sunday, urging transatlantic unity amid growing European unease about U.S. President Donald Trump's push to take control of Greenland.

"We have to collaborate, work together and show strength and unity," Theo Francken said in a phone interview, adding that there is a need for "a NATO operation in the high north".

Trump said on Friday that the U.S. needs to own Greenland to prevent Russia or China from occupying it in the future.

European officials have been discussing ways to ease U.S. concerns about security around Greenland, an autonomous territory of the Kingdom of Denmark.

Francken suggested NATO's Baltic Sentry and Eastern Sentry operations, which combine forces from different countries with drones, sensors and other technology to monitor land and sea, as possible models , opens new tab for an "Arctic Sentry".

He acknowledged Greenland's strategic importance but said "I think that we need to sort this out like friends and allies, like we always do".

A NATO spokesperson said on Friday that alliance chief Mark Rutte spoke with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio about the importance of the Arctic for shared security and how NATO is working to enhance its capabilities in the high north.

Denmark and Greenland's leaders have said that the Arctic island could not be annexed and international security did not justify such a move.

The officers would be deployed on Sunday and Monday to bolster ​the safety of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Border Patrol officials already in ​Minnesota, Noem said on Fox News ' "Sunday Morning Futures" program. Some 2,000 federal officers have already been dispatched to the Minneapolis-St. Paul area in what DHS has called its largest operation ever.

The new deployments were scheduled to begin even as more than 1,000 rallies were planned nationwide this weekend to protest the federal government's deportation push and Wednesday's fatal shooting of 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good by an ICE officer.

Minnesota officials have called the ‍shooting unjustified, pointing to bystander video they say showed Good's vehicle turning away from the agent as he fired.

Noem and ​other US officials have maintained that the agent acted in self-defense because Good, a volunteer in a community network that monitors and records ICE operations in Minneapolis, drove forward in the ‌direction of the agent who then shot her, after another agent had approached the driver's side and told her to get out of the ‍car.

In a separate Sunday appearance on CNN 's "State of the Union," Noem said other video footage showed Good protesting ICE agents at other locations earlier on Wednesday morning, but did not say if or when it would be publicly released.

Minnesota authorities on Friday said they were opening their own criminal investigation into the incident, after some state law enforcement officials said the FBI was refusing to cooperate with state ‍investigators.

White House Border Security Czar Tom Homan said on "Fox News Sunday" that he wanted to let the investigation ‌play out, but that ​he "truly believe that officer thought his life was in danger to take that action."</description><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 20:47:47 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/60edb7e0-ef28-11f0-affe-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-10T220515Z-1169860487-RC2KYIA5TRK8-RTRMADP-3-USA-TRUMP-MINNESOTA.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Hong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai's mitigation hearing set to begin ahead of sentencing</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/hong-kong-media-tycoon-jimmy-lais-mitigation-hearing-set-begin-ahead-sentencing-2026-01-11/</link><description /><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 22:21:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Denmark warns of ‘decisive moment’ as Trump renews threat of force over Greenland</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260111-denmark-trump-greenland</link><description>Denmark's prime minister on Sunday said her country faces a "decisive moment" in its diplomatic battle with the United States over Greenland , after President Donald Trump again suggested using force to seize the Arctic territory.

Ahead of meetings in Washington from Monday on the global scramble for key raw materials, Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said that "there is a conflict over Greenland".

"This is a decisive moment" with stakes that go beyond the immediate issue of Greenland's future , she added in a debate with other Danish political leaders.

Frederiksen posted on Facebook that "we are ready to defend our values -- wherever it is necessary -- also in the Arctic. We believe in international law and in peoples' right to self-determination."

Germany and Sweden backed Denmark against Trump's latest claims to the self-governing Danish territory.

Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson condemned US "threatening rhetoric" after Trump repeated that Washington was "going to do something on Greenland, whether they like it or not".

"Sweden, the Nordic countries, the Baltic states, and several major European countries stand together with our Danish friends," he told a defence conference in Salen where the US general in charge of NATO took part.

Kristersson said a US takeover of mineral-rich Greenland would be "a violation of international law and risks encouraging other countries to act in exactly the same way".

Germany reiterated its support for Denmark and Greenland ahead of the Washington discussions.

Before meeting US counterpart Marco Rubio on Monday, German Foreign Minister Johann Wadehpul held talks in Iceland to address the "strategic challenges of the Far North", according to a foreign ministry statement.

"Security in the arctic is becoming more and more important" and "is part of our common interest in NATO", he said at a joint news conference with Icelandic Foreign Minister Thorgerdur Katrin Gunnarsdottir.

"If the American president is looking at what threats might come from Russian or Chinese ships or submarines in the region, we can of course find answers to that together," he added.

But "the future of Greenland must be decided by the people of Greenland" and Denmark, he said.

Asked about a possible strengthening of NATO's commitment in the Arctic, Wadephul said Germany was "ready to assume greater responsibilities".

Earlier Sunday, German Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil said: "We are strengthening security in the Arctic together, as NATO allies, and not against one another."

He was speaking ahead of an international meeting on critical raw materials in Washington.

European nations have scrambled to coordinate a response after the White House said this week that Trump wanted to buy Greenland and refused to rule out military action.

On Tuesday, leaders of seven European countries including France, Britain, Germany and Italy signed a letter saying it is "only" for Denmark and Greenland to decide the territory's future.

Trump says controlling the island is crucial for US national security because of the rising Russian and Chinese military activity in the Arctic.

NATO Supreme Allied Commander General Alexus Grynkewich told the Swedish conference that alliance members were discussing Greenland's status.

While there was "no immediate threat" to NATO territory, the Arctic's strategic importance was fast growing, the US general added.

Grynkewich said he would not comment on "the political dimensions of recent rhetoric" but talks on Greenland were being held at the North Atlantic Council.

"Those dialogues continue in Brussels. They have been healthy dialogues from what I've heard," the general said.

A Danish colony until 1953, Greenland gained home rule 26 years later and is contemplating eventually loosening its ties with Denmark. Polls indicate that Greenland's population strongly oppose a US takeover.

"I don't think there's an immediate threat to NATO territory right now," Grynkewich told the conference.

But he said Russian and Chinese vessels had been seen patrolling together on Russia's northern coast and near Alaska and Canada, working together to get greater access to the Arctic as ice recedes due to global warming.</description><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 23:42:07 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/cbe470fc-e9b5-11f0-86d5-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25297625966686.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'Unhinged' or savvy? Meet Li Chenggang, who leads China’s trade talks with the US</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/unhinged-or-savvy-meet-li-chenggang-who-leads-chinas-trade-talks-with-us-2026-01-12/</link><description>BEIJING/GENEVA/WASHINGTON, Jan 12 (Reuters) - When U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent described China's lead trade negotiator Li Chenggang as " unhinged " for breaching diplomatic niceties shortly before a critical summit in October, he painted a picture of an erratic junior bureaucrat who had "gone rogue."

Neither a “wolf warrior” nor a wallflower, Li is a chain-smoking, porcelain-collecting career diplomat with an encyclopedic knowledge of trade law and excellent English who alternates between charm and delivering Beijing's tough messages, sources say.

After playing a crucial role in steadying the U.S.-China trade relationship in 2025, he is set to be at the forefront of further negotiations this year. U.S. President Donald Trump has made clear he wants to visit China in April and said he would host President Xi Jinping for a state visit later in the year.

More than a dozen diplomats, businesspeople and current and former U.S. officials described the man at the heart of the world’s most important trade negotiations as smart and pragmatic, with a tough edge that helps China achieve its goals.

Trade officials and Western diplomats who have interacted with the vice commerce minister in recent months described him as commanding rooms. One American business figure said he had an "executive presence," a contrast from the stereotypical Chinese bureaucrat: A stoic, script-bound delivery that allows little room for personal flair.

They said he is well-prepared, with a deep understanding of China's economic structure and U.S. trade demands. One former U.S. official who negotiated with Li on an Obama-era investment deal called him a "rising star."

From April through October, Li helped steer months of stop-start negotiations across European capitals - from Geneva to Stockholm to London - that tested the limits of economic diplomacy between the U.S. and China.

The 58-year-old, who earlier represented China at the World Trade Organization before taking on his current role , navigated subjects spanning export curbs on rare earths , agricultural purchases and semiconductor access - issues that underpin $660 billion in annual bilateral trade.

The October negotiations produced an uneasy truce that has held to this day, with China deferring expansive controls on rare earth exports for a year and agreeing to buy 12 million tons of U.S. soybeans by March.

“Li's near-term priority is to maintain the bilateral trade truce and create a positive environment for Trump's visit to China,” said Neil Thomas of the Asia Society, a New York-based think tank.

"The Chinese trade team's biggest challenge is to get the Trump administration to relax more U.S. export controls without generating an overwhelming backlash in Washington."

It was in the weeks ahead of the October talks that Li drew a public rebuke from Bessent when the Chinese negotiator sought meetings in Washington with officials who outranked him and "lectured" them about China's position in the talks, according to four senior U.S. businesspeople briefed on the trip. The sources spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private exchanges.

Li tried to meet U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, one of the businesspeople told Reuters, but ended up speaking to Commerce Department Undersecretary William Kimmitt and a lower-level Treasury official who matched his rank in protocol terms, though they were not authorised to negotiate on trade with China, according to another person briefed on the exchanges.

Regardless, he still "read the riot act" to his counterparts and conveyed demands from China's leadership to change their behaviour to get negotiations back on track, the person said.

In terms of ranking, Li is second only to the commerce minister, making him China's No. 2 commerce official. Vice Premier He Lifeng remains Xi's point person for overseeing the U.S.-China economic and trade relationship and is Bessent's counterpart in terms of seniority.

In public remarks, Bessent later called Li "very disrespectful." He also said Li threatened that China would “unleash chaos” on the global economic system if the U.S. imposed port-entry fees on Chinese vessels.

The comments, which included Bessent calling Li “unhinged,” threatened to derail a planned presidential summit in South Korea in October, after both sides took a series of retaliatory moves.

But Li and Bessent regrouped days later at the ASEAN summit in Kuala Lumpur, where they hashed out a framework trade agreement that successfully deferred 100% tariffs on Chinese goods and expanded export controls on rare earths.

In response to Reuters questions on Li, a White House official said: “He did come uninvited in August and did seek meetings above his level, which were denied.”

The U.S. Commerce and Treasury departments did not respond to Reuters requests for comment. The WTO declined to comment. China's commerce ministry did not respond to a request for comment.

Born in rural Anhui province, Li read law at the elite Peking University as well as Germany's University of Hamburg. He climbed the ranks at the Ministry of Commerce, including a period running its department of treaty and law from 2010 to 2017. In his current role, Li also oversees the export controls and anti-dumping probes that China uses with foreign companies to protect its rights and ensure a level playing field.

During his time as China's WTO representative in Geneva from 2021 to 2025, Li was a prolific networker who regularly hosted dinners and smoked Chinese cigarettes with other ambassadors in between meetings, four WTO sources told Reuters.

At the weekends, Li frequently scoured Swiss flea markets for discounted Chinese porcelain and could identify which dynasty the items came from, they said.

Norway's WTO ambassador Petter Olberg, who worked closely with Li, told Reuters he was "extremely well liked and respected" and "very constructive about seeking solutions."

"He's not one of those who shouts the loudest," Olberg said. "He thinks things through. He would always listen before he spoke at meetings."

As a token of his appreciation, Li threw a lavish farewell banquet for the Mauritian WTO representative at his residence in December 2024, Olberg and other attendees said.

Guests were served artfully presented hors d'oeuvres on plates hand-painted with karst mountains illustrating an ancient Chinese poem, according to a photograph provided by one attendee. A well-known poem by Tang dynasty scribe Li Bai celebrated the poet's profound love of friendship over natural beauty.

At the WTO, Li's tactics were not limited to poems and dinner parties. One aide recalled him getting “angry and agitated” while pursuing the Investment Facilitation for Development Agreement – a landmark deal that China played a key role in creating.

He is an advocate of Beijing's efforts to reshape the multilateral trade order, pitching China as a stabilising force in the face of turmoil created by Trump’s tariffs, said the Beijing-based Western trade diplomat.

In negotiations with the U.S., he would have a good grasp of policy details and how to advance China’s aims under the WTO legal framework, said one Western trade diplomat who met Li multiple times last year.

Li's competence in meetings has led some observers to say that China has a stronger, more cohesive team that is empowered to implement directives from the leadership.

One U.S. businessperson who met Li in September said Chinese negotiators “go in knowing what they can and cannot accept," while their American counterparts require Trump’s final approval after negotiating a framework.

"Li is someone who skillfully deploys legal instruments in the trade war," said Henry Gao, an associate law professor at Singapore Management University.

"I expect him to remain a leading figure in the U.S.-China trade negotiations for years to come."</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 01:52:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/TGINQS7D3BPIBKTY22YGCPGI64.jpg?auth=2435c173c712c2538640b0296463a55f1f0b76552f1a00be63dbe853a44aaa18&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Landmark Myanmar Rohingya genocide case to open at UN's top court</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/landmark-myanmar-rohingya-genocide-case-open-uns-top-court-2026-01-12/</link><description>THE HAGUE, Jan 12 (Reuters) - A landmark case accusing Myanmar of committing genocide against minority Muslim Rohingya will open at the United Nations' top court on Monday.

It will be the first genocide case the International Court of Justice (ICJ) will hear in full in over a decade. The outcome will have repercussions beyond Myanmar, likely affecting South Africa’s genocide case at the ICJ against Israel over the war in Gaza.

Myanmar has denied accusations of genocide.

"The case is likely to set critical precedents for how genocide is defined and how it can be proven, and how violations can be remedied," Nicholas Koumjian, head of the U.N.'s Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar, told Reuters.

The predominantly Muslim West African country of Gambia filed the case at the ICJ - also known as the World Court - in 2019, accusing Myanmar of committing genocide against the Rohingya, a mainly Muslim minority in the remote western Rakhine state.

Myanmar's armed forces launched an offensive in 2017 that forced at least 730,000 Rohingya from their homes and into neighbouring Bangladesh, where they recounted killings, mass rape and arson.

A U.N. fact-finding mission concluded the 2017 military offensive had included "genocidal acts" .

Myanmar authorities rejected that report , saying its military offensive was a legitimate counter-terrorism campaign in response to attacks by Muslim militants.

In 2019 preliminary hearings in the ICJ case, Myanmar's then leader, Aung San Suu Kyi , rejected Gambia's accusations of genocide as "incomplete and misleading".

The hearings at the ICJ will mark the first time that Rohingya victims of the alleged atrocities will be heard by an international court although those sessions will be closed to the public and the media for sensitivity and privacy reasons.

The hearings start at 10 a.m. (0900 GMT) on Monday and will span three weeks.

Myanmar has been in further turmoil since 2021, when the military toppled the elected civilian government and violently suppressed pro-democracy protests, sparking a nationwide armed rebellion.

The country is currently holding phased elections that have been criticised by the United Nations, some Western countries and human rights groups as not free or fair.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 01:52:47 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/SCLK5Z3RJJJWJOJS5XOTMSP76Q.jpg?auth=4aaa199d2bd9e533c989820dcf619ed6f011dabea9c8d86703ff84b450cee41f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russian overnight attack sparks fire in Kyiv, Ukraine military says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-overnight-attack-sparks-fire-kyiv-ukraine-military-says-2026-01-12/</link><description>KYIV, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Russia launched an overnight air attack on Kyiv, sparking a fire in one of the city's districts, Ukrainian military said on Monday.

"He's very good at that kind of thing, he's got a very good company," Trump told reporters in response to a question about whether he would engage with Musk's SpaceX company, which offers a satellite internet service called Starlink that has been used in Iran.

Musk and Trump have held an on-again, off-again relationship after the billionaire helped fund Trump's winning presidential campaign and subsequently orchestrated massive cuts to the federal government.

The pair had a public falling-out last year as Musk opposed Trump's signature tax bill, but the two men appear to have rekindled their relationship, eating dinner together at Trump's Mar-A-Lago resort this month.

Musk and SpaceX did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 01:53:12 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BOS7ZH75BJLZ7H4JXGHNVLDEW4.jpg?auth=455614811f0253bc61f20a2a7d76732f4f8b86cabf252efadaf69ea085f3898a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Truck plows into Los Angeles rally to support Iran demonstrations, KNBC reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/truck-plows-into-los-angeles-rally-support-iran-demonstrations-knbc-reports-2026-01-12/</link><description>CHICAGO, Jan 11 (Reuters) - A truck plowed into a crowd gathered in Los Angeles to show support for Iranian protesters, the KNBC news outlet reported on Sunday.

The move represents an unprecedented escalation in President Donald Trump's battle with the Fed, an independent agency he has repeatedly attacked for not cutting its key interest rate as quickly as Trump prefers.

The subpoena relates to his testimony before the Senate Banking Committee in June, Powell said, regarding the Fed's $2.5 billion renovation of two office buildings, a project that Trump criticised as excessive this summer.

In a video statement, Powell said the threat of criminal charges are “pretexts” to undermine the Fed's independence when it comes to setting interest rates.

“This is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions—or whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation,” Powell said.

The Justice Department in a statement Sunday said it can’t comment on any particular case, but added that Attorney General Pam Bondi “has instructed her US Attorneys to prioritise investigating any abuse of tax payer dollars.”

A spokesperson for US Attorney Jeanine Pirro’s office didn’t immediately respond Sunday to a text message and phone call seeking comment.

The potential indictment has already drawn concern from one Republican senator, who said he’ll oppose any future nominee to the central bank, including any replacement for Powell, until “this legal matter is fully resolved.”

“If there were any remaining doubt whether advisers within the Trump Administration are actively pushing to end the independence of the Federal Reserve, there should now be none,” said North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis, who sits on the Banking Committee, which oversees Fed nominations. “It is now the independence and credibility of the Department of Justice that are in question.”</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 01:53:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/634f5dd0-d610-11f0-bb0e-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/69117ba4596397f8d76fec1e3941ce63962d168d.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Australia PM Albanese recalls parliament early in wake of Bondi attack</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/australia-pm-albanese-recalls-parliament-early-wake-bondi-attack-2026-01-12/</link><description>SYDNEY, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Australia Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on Monday that Parliament would be recalled early to sit next week in the wake of the Bondi attack.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 03:50:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/L2UN5KORXVJU5GDPMJAQEWFUXY.jpg?auth=d4cca4c07cee8d05537383467521692b219d89438515fb79969ebe32e659950d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Cambodian, South Korean police arrest 26 for alleged scams, sex crimes, Blue House says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/cambodian-south-korean-police-arrest-26-alleged-scams-sex-crimes-blue-house-says-2026-01-12/</link><description>SEOUL, Jan 12 (Reuters) - A joint investigative team of Cambodian and South Korean police has arrested 26 suspects over alleged online scams and sex crimes targeting South Korean citizens, the Korean presidential office said on Monday.

The bilateral task force found that the suspects allegedly extorted about 26.7 billion won ($18.25 million) from 165 South Koreans through online scams, in which they pretended to be police or financial regulators, Kang Yu-jung, a spokeswoman at the Blue House, said at a briefing.

The suspects also allegedly coerced multiple female victims into filming sex videos and photos for distribution, Kang said, declining to elaborate on details.

Cambodian police made the arrests with assistance from the task force and South Korea's intelligence agency, she added.

The suspects will be extradited to South Korea to face punishment, she said.

The Cambodian government could not immediately be reached for comment on the arrests and allegations.

Midway through the ceremony, it had collected awards for best director, best screenplay, and best supporting actress for Teyana Taylor.

But its star missed out to Chalamet's performance as an ambitious 1950s table tennis player in "Marty Supreme."

"Thank you so much from the bottom of my heart. I'm in a category with many greats -- this category is stacked. I look up to all of you," said Chalamet, who also bested the likes of George Clooney ("Jay Kelly") and Ethan Hawke ("Blue Moon").

Chalamet said his four previous Globes losses "make this moment that much sweeter" before thanking his girlfriend Kylie Jenner.

The lavish Globes ceremony is a key stepping point in Hollywood's awards season, which culminates in March with the Oscars.

As the night progresses, the politically charged "One Battle After Another" is still expected to convert more of its nominations into wins, including best comedy or musical film.

A rollicking ride featuring violent leftist radicals, immigration raids and white supremacists, the film has connected with audiences and critics at a time when the United States is deeply polarized.

The Globes offer separate awards for dramas and comedies/musicals -- widening the field of stars in attendance.

"Sinners," Ryan Coogler's period horror film about the segregated South of the 1930s, is expected to be the toughest competition for "One Battle" at the Oscars.

But at the Globes, they are in separate categories.

"Sinners" surprised moviegoers with its eclectic mix of vampires, politics, race relations and blues music.

It won best score and best cinematic and box office achievement, and is the frontrunner for the best drama film Globe, against rival "Hamnet," which stars Paul Mescal as William Shakespeare.

Jessie Buckley, playing Shakespeare's grief-stricken wife who struggles to cope with the death of their won, is the favorite for best drama actress honors.

"Sentimental Value," the Norwegian family dramedy starring Stellan Skarsgard, earned a strong eight nominations and is also in the running.

Skarsgard took home the award for best supporting actor.

Rose Byrne won for best comedy actress for "If I Had Legs I'd Kick You." Netflix's animated mega-hit "KPop Demon Hunters" won for best song.

The Globes also honor the best in television, with HBO's black comedy anthology "The White Lotus," sci-fi office thriller "Severance" leading the contenders, and searing teen murder saga "Adolescence" winning early awards.

Host Nikki Glaser kicked off the evening with jokes on wide-ranging topics, including the release of redacted US government files about convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

"The Golden Globe for best editing goes to the Justice Department," she said.

"There are so many A-listers, and by A-listers, I do mean people who are on a list that has been heavily redacted," Glaser added, referring to Epstein's many celebrity friends.

Several celebrities including Mark Ruffalo, Natasha Lyonne and Wanda Sykes walked the red carpet sporting pins with the message "BE GOOD."

The badges are part of a tribute to Renee Good, the US woman whose fatal shooting by a federal agent has sparked renewed protests against President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown.

"Let's do the right thing," said Jean Smart, after winning best comedy series actress for "Hacks." She also was wearing a pin.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 03:51:19 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/b4be9836-ef63-11f0-ac0b-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26012085378409.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Vietnam's Communist Party chief Lam seeks presidency in China-style expanded power mandate</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/vietnams-communist-party-chief-lam-seeks-presidency-china-style-expanded-power-2026-01-12/</link><description>HANOI, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Vietnam's Communist Party chief To Lam is seeking to combine his party role with the state presidency, officials said, in a move that would align Vietnam's political structure more closely to China's where President Xi Jinping heads the party and state.

Next week some 1,600 delegates will gather in Hanoi to kick off a week-long Communist Party congress , held every five years to select new leaders and set policy goals for the single-party state.

Lam, 68, bid for both top positions at a party meeting in December , seeking initial party approval ahead of the congress, three people briefed by the delegates and another three officials familiar with the matter told Reuters.

While the sources said the party meeting backed Lam to remain party chief, the three people briefed by delegates gave differing accounts on the question of the presidency, a largely ceremonial role but one currently held by the military.

Two said Lam won support for his bid, while the third said the conclusion was unclear. In any case, the final decision rests with delegates who will be elected at the congress.

The party's secretariat did not immediately reply to a request for comment.

The combination of the two top jobs for the next five years would mark a significant departure from Vietnam's traditional power-sharing model. Only in exceptional periods after the death of incumbents have the positions been merged, including in 2024 when Lam held both positions for about three months.

Should Lam succeed, the military, a powerful faction within the party, would give up the presidency in exchange for maintaining a broad autonomy over the promotion of its senior officers, two sources said.

One official said military leaders are negotiating "safeguards" to limit Lam's authority. The defence ministry was not immediately available for comment.

In possible signs of early concessions, some controversial economic policies pursued under Lam's first term were revised or faced unexpected hurdles ahead of the congress, including on credit growth and a high-speed railway.

Supporters of combining the two roles argue all other communist countries - China, North Korea, Cuba and Laos - vest both positions in a single leader, and note the move would bolster Lam's economic reform agenda and strengthen his standing in meetings with foreign leaders.

Sceptics see the change as emboldening a leader seen as a risk-taker who has already vastly expanded the powers of the security apparatus.

The merger would be "the natural outcome of streamlining Vietnam's political structure," said Carl Thayer, a senior expert on Vietnam at the Australian Defence Force Academy, noting Lam has already effectively taken over some of the president's powers with frequent overseas trips last year.

Starting January 19, the week-long congress will elect 200 members of the new central committee, with a large number of newcomers expected to join, raising questions about whether they will confirm decisions made by the roughly 140 delegates who voted in December.

The central committee will elect the party chief and the politburo. Lam in July said the new politburo will have 17-19 members, but the size will depend on delegates' votes on a pre-arranged shortlist.

The politburo will then nominate the president, prime minister and speaker of the parliament, whose appointments lawmakers must confirm.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 04:51:22 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/D2DSO5UUI5LAJG7ZGBDSAUZJFQ.jpg?auth=094f9a482ff33ee08d32b8fd3854e29e62c2dd850d953ff2f3850b74090a7478&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>South Korea to probe drones North Korea says violated its airspace</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/south-korea-probe-drones-north-korea-says-violated-its-airspace-2026-01-12/</link><description>SEOUL, Jan 12 (Reuters) - South Korean authorities have launched an investigation focused on the possibility civilians may have flown drones that North Korea said violated its airspace , the Defence Ministry said on Monday.

President Lee Jae Myung has vowed a swift probe and said on Saturday if civilians had indeed operated the unmanned aircraft, it would be a "serious crime" that threatened South Korea's security and peace on the Korean peninsula.

South Korea is willing to jointly conduct the investigation with North Korea but has not made the proposal, a defence ministry spokesperson said citing Minister Ahn Gyu-back.

North Korea has not responded to previous attempts by Lee's government to initiate dialogue.

North Korea's military on Saturday accused the South of "acts of provocation" by sending the drones, saying it had shot down the aircraft and disclosed what it said were pieces of the drones and aerial photos they took.

South Korea's military said it did not operate the drone model in question or operate any on the date cited by the North of the intrusion. It had no intention to provoke the North, it said.

Tensions frequently flare up between South Korea and its nuclear-armed northern neighbour.

Former South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol went on trial on Monday on charges of trying to provoke North Korea in 2024 as a pretext for declaring martial law later that year. He is facing a separate trial for insurrection over the martial law attempt.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 04:52:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5IKCYHHSNZOMPPR7SKX7MB7L2M.jpg?auth=187f33e75fc1e7bb558f5552dcfa3a182eaceb1c456645ca085c7871c88f9e3e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Australian arts festival decision to bar Palestinian author after Bondi attack spurs boycott</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/australian-arts-festival-decision-bar-palestinian-author-after-bondi-attack-2026-01-12/</link><description>SYDNEY, Jan 12 (Reuters) - A top Australian arts festival has seen the withdrawal of dozens of writers in a backlash against its decision to bar an Australian Palestinian author after the Bondi Beach mass shooting, as moves to curb antisemitism spur free speech concerns.

The shooting which killed 15 people at a Jewish Hanukkah celebration at Sydney's Bondi Beach on December 14 sparked nationwide calls to tackle antisemitism. Police say the alleged gunmen were inspired by the Islamic State militant group.

The Adelaide Festival board said last Thursday it would disinvite Dr Randa Abdel-Fattah from February's Writers Week in the state of South Australia because "it would not be culturally sensitive to continue to program her at this unprecedented time so soon after Bondi".

A Macquarie University academic who researches Islamophobia and Palestine, Abdel-Fattah responded saying it was "a blatant and shameless act of anti-Palestinian racism and censorship", with her lawyers issuing a letter to the festival.

Around 50 authors have since withdrawn from the festival in protest, leaving it in doubt, local media reported.

Among the boycotting authors, Kathy Lette wrote on social media the decision to bar Abdel-Fattah "sends a divisive and plainly discriminatory message that platforming Australian Palestinians is 'culturally insensitive'."

The Adelaide Festival said in a statement on Monday that three board members and the chairperson had resigned.

The festival's executive director, Julian Hobba, said the arts body was "navigating a complex and unprecedented moment" after the "significant community response" to the board decision.

In the days after the Bondi Beach attack, Jewish community groups and the Israeli government criticised Prime Minister Anthony Albanese for failing to act on a rise in antisemitic attacks and criticised protest marches against Israel's war in Gaza held since 2023.

Albanese said last week a Royal Commission will consider the events of the shooting as well as antisemitism and social cohesion in Australia. Albanese said on Monday he would recall parliament next week to pass tougher hate speech laws.

On Monday New South Wales state premier Chris Minns announced new rules that would allow local councils to cut off power and water to illegally operating prayer halls and impose bigger fines to curb "hate preachers".

Minns said the new rules were prompted by the difficulty in closing a Muslim prayer hall in Sydney linked to a cleric found by a court to have made statements intimidating Jewish Australians.

The mayor of the western Sydney suburb of Fairfield, which has a large Muslim community, said the rules were ill-considered and councils should not be responsible for determining hate speech.

"Freedom of speech is something that should always be allowed, as long as it is done in a peaceful way," Mayor Frank Carbone told Reuters.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 04:52:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/SRBRP4J7IBLIFCRFPEOZJWI5BM.jpg?auth=c7da7cbb03d844398c5f5eef42c310ab03349aa935fa9975cd487d6257007332&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump’s Justice Department subpoenas Fed Chair Powell over building renovation</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/economy/20260112-trump-s-justice-department-subpoenas-fed-chair-powell-over-building-renovation</link><description>Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Sunday that the central bank had been subpoenaed by the US Justice Department, blasting the move as part of President Donald Trump 's extraordinary pressure campaign on US monetary policy decisions.

Powell added in a statement that the bank received grand jury subpoenas "threatening a criminal indictment" on Friday related to his Senate testimony in June, which had been about a major renovation project of Federal Reserve office buildings.

He dismissed the possible threat of indictment over his testimony or the renovation project as "pretexts."

"The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President," Powell said.

"This unprecedented action should be seen in the broader context of the administration's threats and ongoing pressure," Powell said.

The Fed has a dual mandate to keep prices stable and unemployment low, and its main tool in doing so is by setting a key interest rate that influences the cost of borrowing across the economy.

Trump has consistently pressured Powell and the central bank to move faster in lowering interest rates, in a breach of the long-standing independence of the institution.

Trump on Sunday denied any knowledge of the Justice Department's investigation into the Federal Reserve.

"I don't know anything about it, but he's certainly not very good at the Fed, and he's not very good at building buildings," NBC quoted Trump as saying.

Senators from both sides of the aisle blasted the investigation.

"It is now the independence and credibility of the Department of Justice that are in question," Republican Thom Tillis said.

"I will oppose the confirmation of any nominee for the Fed - including the upcoming Fed Chair vacancy - until this legal matter is fully resolved," he added.

Democrat Elizabeth Warren accused Trump of trying "to complete his corrupt takeover" of the central bank by pushing Powell out and installing a "sock puppet" instead.

Powell's term as chairman of the Federal Reserve ends in May, and Trump told Politico in an interview last month that he would judge Powell's successor on whether they immediately cut rates.

The US president has openly spoken about ousting Powell but stopped short of doing so, and focused instead on cost overruns for renovation of the Fed's Washington headquarters.

In July, the cost of the Fed's facelift of its 88-year-old Washington headquarters and a neighboring building were up by $600 million from an initial $1.9 billion estimate.

That month, Trump made an unusual visit to the construction site during which the two men, clad in hard hats, bickered over the price tag for the makeover.

A significant driver of the cost is security, including blast-resistant windows and measures to prevent the building from collapsing in the event of an explosion.

The Federal Reserve, the world's most important central bank, makes independent monetary policy decisions and its board members typically serve under both Republican and Democratic presidents.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 04:53:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/634f5dd0-d610-11f0-bb0e-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/69117ba4596397f8d76fec1e3941ce63962d168d.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Top UN court to hear landmark Rohingya genocide case against Myanmar</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260112-top-un-court-rohingya-genocide-myanmar</link><description>Did Myanmar commit genocide against its Rohingya Muslim minority? That's what judges at the International Court of Justice will weigh during three weeks of hearings starting Monday.

The Gambia brought the case accusing Myanmar of breaching the 1948 Genocide Convention during a crackdown in 2017.

Legal experts are watching closely as it could give clues for how the court will handle similar accusations against Israel over its military campaign in Gaza, a case brought to the ICJ by South Africa.

Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims fled violence by the Myanmararmy and Buddhist militias, escaping to neighbouring Bangladesh and bringing harrowing accounts of mass rape, arson and murder.

Today, 1.17 million Rohingya live crammed into dilapidated camps spread over 8,000 acres in Cox's Bazar in Bangladesh.

From there, mother-of-two Janifa Begum told AFP: "I want to see whether the suffering we endured is reflected during the hearing."

"We want justice and peace," said the 37-year-old.

The Gambia, a Muslim-majority country in West Africa, brought the case in 2019 to the ICJ, which rules in disputes between states.

Under the Genocide Convention, any country can file a case at the ICJ against any other it believes is in breach of the treaty.

In December 2019, lawyers for the African nation presented evidence of what they said were "senseless killings... acts of barbarity that continue to shock our collective conscience".

In a landmark moment at the Peace Palace courthouse in The Hague , Nobel Peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi appeared herself to defend her country.

She dismissed Banjul's argument as a "misleading and incomplete factual picture" of what she said was an "internal armed conflict".

The former democracy icon warned that the genocide case at the ICJ risked reigniting the crisis, which she said was a response to attacks by Rohingya militants.

Myanmar has always maintained the crackdown by its armed forces, known as the Tatmadaw, was justified to root out Rohingya insurgents after a series of attacks left a dozen security personnel dead.

The ICJ initially sided with The Gambia, which had asked judges for "provisional measures" to halt the violence while the case was being considered.

The court in 2020 said Myanmar must take "all measures within its power" to halt any acts prohibited in the 1948 UN Genocide Convention.

These acts included "killing members of the group" and "deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part".

The United States officially declared that the violence amounted to genocide in 2022, three years after a UN team said Myanmar harboured "genocidal intent" towards the Rohingya.

The hearings, which wrap up on January 30, represent the heart of the case.

The court had already thrown out a 2022 Myanmar challenge to its jurisdiction, so judges believe they have the power to rule on the genocide issue.

A final decision could take months or even years and while the ICJ has no means of enforcing its decisions, a ruling in favour of The Gambia would heap more political pressure on Myanmar.

Suu Kyi will not be revisiting the Peace Palace. She has been detained since a 2021 coup, on charges rights groups say were politically motivated.

The ICJ is not the only court looking into possible genocide against the Rohingya.

The International Criminal Court, also based in The Hague, is investigating military chief Min Aung Hlaing for suspected crimes against humanity.

Another case is being heard in Argentina under the principle of universal jurisdiction, the idea that some crimes are so heinous they can be heard in any court.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 05:31:02 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/e88a2bee-af4e-11f0-8190-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/2025-10-22T134432Z-1072716441-RC21HHAPE782-RTRMADP-3-ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS-WORLD-COURT.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>South Korea's Lee to head for Japan summit a week after meeting China's Xi</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/south-koreas-lee-head-japan-summit-week-after-meeting-chinas-xi-2026-01-12/</link><description>SEOUL, Jan 12 (Reuters) - South Korean President Lee Jae Myung is set for a summit with Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi on Tuesday, a week after one with Chinese President Xi Jinping, as Seoul seeks to balance ties with both neighbours.

The summit in Japan's Nara City comes amid a growing diplomatic dispute between Beijing and Tokyo , and analysts expect Takaichi to highlight the stability of three-way ties between the United States, Japan and South Korea.

Lee has taken an approach of "pragmatic diplomacy" in seeking to balance ties with China and Japan, which could making it easier to reach pacts in business fields such as artificial intelligence (AI).

"Historically, disputes between China and Japan go on for a long time," said Yang Kee-ho, a Japanese studies professor at South Korea's Sungkonghoe University.

"It is very likely that the Sino-Japanese relationship will deteriorate throughout (Takaichi's) term in office."

Beijing was infuriated after Takaichi said in November a Chinese attack on democratically governed Taiwan could be deemed an existential threat to Japan, which could trigger a military response from Tokyo.

China regards Taiwan as part of its territory, a claim the island's government rejects.

In the face of the tension with China, Japan may seek to bolster diplomatic ties with South Korea, possibly through a strategic partnership, said Lee Chang-min, another Japan expert at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies.

"Not only has Japan's relationship with China deteriorated, the United States has also put a little distance from Japan in its (Taiwan) stance," said Lee.

South Korea's Lee and Takaichi may discuss the Japan-China dispute during their meeting, a security adviser to Lee, Wi Sung-lac said on Friday. However, South Korea is unlikely to take sides, analysts said.

"Our relationship with Japan is as important as our relationship with China," Lee told reporters during his state visit to China last week.

Perennial concerns, such as the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula and the fate of Japanese nationals abducted by neighbouring North Korea are also expected to figure on the agenda.

However, analysts said the areas offering the easiest scope for concrete agreements may lie in business, such as cooperation in artificial intelligence and chips, and easing travel for business executives between the countries.

The two leaders are expected to extensively discuss "areas directly related to people's livelihoods ... such as intellectual property and AI," Wi said.

The summit in Takaichi's home prefecture of Nara also offers Lee an opportunity to take up issues of regional cooperation, as part of a pledge to spur development in areas outside Seoul.

Ties are still plagued by longstanding tension on topics such as Japan's colonisation of Korea, including the treatment of Korean women forced to work in its wartime military brothels .

Such historical issues have moved from the centre stage of relations for now, analysts said, though some in South Korea still want them to stay high on the agenda.

Lee's two-day visit to Japan, shorter than his four-day trip to China, is part of "shuttle diplomacy" efforts that the two countries agreed last year.

Even if the trip has no tangible outcome, said Yang, "The most important thing is to keep the shuttle meetings going ... and eventually reaching concrete results."</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 05:56:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/2Q7HSYT5K5IJJIB25U7W5KY2RQ.jpg?auth=fd4135155c3f47f3b75f02c31edb28c679c182e21fbcf79de6f3bbf19811b32c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Le Pen's political fate hangs in the balance as French appeal begins</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/le-pens-political-fate-hangs-balance-french-appeal-begins-2026-01-12/</link><description>PARIS, Jan 12 (Reuters) - French far-right leader Marine Le Pen begins a crucial appeal in Paris this week that will determine whether she can run in the 2027 presidential election, after being barred from public office over a conviction for misusing EU funds.

Le Pen, the long-time leader of the far-right National Rally (RN), was seen as a likely frontrunner in the 2027 race until she was found guilty last year of misappropriating more than 4 million euros ($4.7 million) of EU funds and given a five-year ban from running for public office, effective immediately.

Le Pen appealed, as did the RN and 10 others found guilty of diverting European Parliament funds. The hearing begins on Tuesday and should end on February 12.

A ruling is expected before the summer, meaning her hopes of running in 2027 remain alive if her five-year ban is revoked or drastically curtailed.

If she cannot run, Le Pen has said her protege, 30-year-old RN party president Jordan Bardella, will do so in her stead.

U.S. President Donald Trump and senior members of his team voiced support for Le Pen after her conviction, and any move to stop her from running would likely be seized on by them in their campaign to portray European courts and officials as seeking to unfairly block far-right politicians from power.

Trump officials last year held internal discussions about sanctioning French prosecutors and judges involved in barring Le Pen, four sources told Reuters, although those talks no longer appear to be active.

The news, first reported by German magazine Der Spiegel, was denied by Under Secretary of State Sarah B. Rogers on X on Thursday, describing it as a "fake story".

A State Department spokesperson said: "We do not preview potential actions."

French government spokeswoman Maud Bregeon said on Thursday the government would remain vigilant to potential U.S. meddling after Peimane Ghaleh-Marzban, the president of the Paris judicial court, said any move against a French judge would "constitute an unacceptable and intolerable interference in the internal affairs of our country".

Over the past year, the U.S. has imposed sanctions against 11 International Criminal Court judges involved in cases against Israel.

Le Pen's lawyers, Rodolphe Bosselut and Sandra Chirac Kollarik, declined to comment ahead of the trial.

Following her conviction, Le Pen accused the judiciary of politically motivated targeting, echoing rhetoric used in the U.S.

"In the country of human rights, judges have implemented practices that we thought were reserved for authoritarian regimes," Le Pen told French TV channel TF1 at the time.

The judges explained in their ruling that they had decided to make the ban effective immediately "to avoid irreparable harm to democratic public order".

Opinion polls indicated that most French people supported the ruling.

The European Parliament's lawyer Patrick Maisonneuve said he hoped Le Pen and her co-defendants' convictions would be upheld, including more than 3 million euro awarded in damages to the European Parliament. The RN was also ordered to pay a 2 million euro fine, with half the amount suspended.

Judges said in last March's ruling that, between 2004 and 2016, Le Pen and others had used funds destined for work at the European Parliament to pay staff who were actually working for the party.

Le Pen said the way she and her co-defendants used the money was legitimate.

Le Pen's legal woes appear to have benefited Bardella. A poll last autumn found Bardella would win the presidency, no matter who his opponent was in the second round.

"French people have turned the page on Marine Le Pen," Stewart Chau, an analyst with Verian Group, told Reuters.

Trump said Iran called to negotiate its nuclear programme, which Israel and the U.S. bombed in a 12-day war in June. Trump has warned Iran's leaders that the United States would attack if security forces open fire on protesters.

U.S.-based rights group HRANA said it had verified the deaths of 490 protesters and 48 security personnel, with more than 10,600 people arrested.

Iran has not given an official toll and Reuters was unable to independently verify the tallies.

Trump was to meet with senior advisers on Tuesday to discuss options for Iran, a U.S. official told Reuters on Sunday. The Wall Street Journal had reported that options included military strikes, using secret cyber weapons, widening sanctions and providing online help to anti-government sources.

"The military is looking at it, and we're looking at some very strong options," Trump told reporters travelling on Air Force One on Sunday night.

Iranian Parliament Speaker Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf warned Washington against "a miscalculation."

"Let us be clear: in the case of an attack on Iran, the occupied territories (Israel) as well as all U.S. bases and ships will be our legitimate target," said Qalibaf, a former commander in Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards.

The protests began on December 28 in response to soaring prices , before turning against the clerical rulers who have governed since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.

Iranian authorities accused the U.S. and Israel of fomenting trouble and called for a nationwide rally on Monday to condemn "terrorist actions led by the United States and Israel," state media reported.

The flow of information from Iran has been hampered by an internet blackout since Thursday. Trump said on Sunday he would talk to Elon Musk about restoring internet access in Iran through his Starlink satellite service.

Footage posted on social media on Saturday from Tehran showed large crowds marching at night, clapping and chanting. The crowd "has no end nor beginning," a man is heard saying.

State TV showed dozens of body bags on the ground at the Tehran coroner's office, saying the dead were victims of events caused by "armed terrorists", as well as footage of loved ones gathered outside the Kahrizak Forensic Medical Centre in Tehran waiting to identify bodies.

Reuters verified the locations.

Authorities on Sunday declared three days of national mourning "in honour of martyrs killed in resistance against the United States and the Zionist regime," according to state media.

Three Israeli sources, who were present for Israeli security consultations over the weekend, said Israel was on a high-alert footing for the possibility of any U.S. intervention.

Israel and Iran fought a 12-day war in June 2025, which the United States briefly joined by attacking nuclear installations. Iran retaliated by firing missiles at Israel and an American air base in Qatar.

While Iranian authorities have weathered previous protests, the latest have unfolded with Tehran still recovering from last year's war and with its regional position weakened by blows to allies such as Lebanon's Hezbollah since the October 7, 2023 attacks against Israel .

Iran's unrest comes as Trump flexes U.S. muscles internationally, having ousted Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro , and discussing acquiring Greenland by purchase or force.

Alan Eyre, a former U.S. diplomat and Iran expert, thought it unlikely the protests would topple the establishment.

"I think it more likely that it puts these protests down eventually, but emerges from the process far weaker," he told Reuters, noting that Iran's elite still appeared cohesive and there was no organised opposition.

The Multilateral Sanctions Monitoring Team , opens new tab , composed of 11 countries including South Korea and the United States, is aimed at monitoring and reporting Pyongyang's violations and evasions of sanctions imposed by United Nations Security Council Resolutions.

A press statement by North Korea's permanent mission to the United Nations said that the United States was planning to hold a briefing session at U.N. headquarters, KCNA reported.

It said the body was "recklessly formed" outside the U.N. system and could not be recognised by the international community.

The mechanism under the new team was introduced after Russia in 2024 rejected the annual renewal of a U.N. panel of experts that had over the past 15 years overseen the implementation of sanctions aimed at curbing North Korea's nuclear and missile programs. China abstained from the vote.

In October 2025, the team issued , opens new tab a report on "deep connections" between U.N.-designated North Korean entities and Pyongyang's malicious cyber activities.

Iranian state television also said it complained about a “certain terrorist organisation that, under the guise of media, spread lies and promote violence and terrorism”. Britain is home to offices of the BBC’s Persian service and Iran International, both which long have been targeted by Iran.

Reza Pahlavi, the US-based son of Iran’s ousted shah, who has emerged as an anti-government figurehead, is prepared to return to his homeland and lead a democratic transition.

“I’m already planning on that,” he told Fox News on Sunday.

He later urged Iran’s security forces and government workers to join the demonstrators.

“Employees of state institutions, as well as members of the armed and security forces, have a choice: stand with the people and become allies of the nation, or choose complicity with the murderers of the people,” he said in a social media post.

The Norway-based NGO Iran Human Rights (IHR) has confirmed that at least 192 protesters have been killed so far, but fears that the actual toll could be much higher, perhaps in the thousands.

“Unverified reports indicate that at least several hundreds, and according to some sources, more than 2,000 people may have been killed,” IHR said.

The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, which has accurately reported on past unrest in Iran, said at least 544 people have been killed, including 496 protesters and 48 people from the security forces.

A video circulating on Sunday showed dozens of bodies accumulating outside a morgue south of Tehran. The footage, geolocated by AFP to Kahrizak, showed bodies wrapped in black bags, with what appeared to be grieving relatives searching for loved ones.

US President Donald Trump said Iran’s leadership has called him seeking “to negotiate” amid US threats to intervene militarily after reports that Tehran has killed hundreds of anti-government protesters.

“The leaders of Iran called” yesterday, Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One, adding that “a meeting is being set up... They want to negotiate”. He added, however, that “we may have to act before a meeting”.

The US-based Center for Human Rights in Iran (CHRI) has warned that “a massacre is unfolding”, saying it has received “eyewitness accounts and credible reports indicating that hundreds of protesters have been killed across Iran during the current internet shutdown”.

A former rebel leader who overthrew his predecessor in 1986, Museveni is now 81 and faces seven challengers. He says another four years in power - his seventh term - would allow him to "protect the gains" of Uganda's relative peace and stability.

The main opponent among his seven challengers is 43-year-old pop star Bobi Wine , who won 35% of the vote in the last election in 2021 and has energised young voters angry about widespread unemployment and corruption.

Museveni has changed the constitution twice to remove age and term limits, and his dominance of Ugandan institutions means there is little prospect of an upset in the East African country of 46 million, political analysts say.

But the election, and any unrest that accompanies the voting, will be an important test of his political strength at a critical moment, four years after the United States denounced the last election as neither free nor fair.

Uganda is a significant geopolitical player in East Africa and has troops deployed in Somalia, South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Equatorial Guinea as part of peacekeeping, anti-insurgency or military cooperation missions.

Economic growth, traditionally reliant on coffee, tourism and agro-processing, is expected to surge into double digits when crude oil production from fields run by France's TotalEnergies (TTEF.PA) , opens new tab and China's CNOOC (600938.SS) , opens new tab begins later this year.

Museveni is widely believed to favour his son, military chief Muhoozi Kainerugaba, to be his successor, though the president has denied grooming Kainerugaba for the role.

Kainerugaba, a prolific social media presence who often posts threats of violence against opposition leaders, has openly declared his desire to succeed his father.

But Kainerugaba's status as heir apparent is not accepted by all within the ruling National Resistance Movement and other party heavyweights are also positioning themselves for Museveni's eventual departure, analysts say.

As in previous elections, the campaign has been marred by violence, with security forces repeatedly using teargas and live bullets at Wine's campaign events. At least one person has been killed and hundreds arrested.

The government has defended the security forces' actions as a justified response to lawless conduct by opposition supporters.

Fears of unrest around the poll have been amplified by violent protests around Tanzania's elections in October, in which the United Nations estimates hundreds of people were killed. Anti-government protests over the past two years in Kenya, which also borders Uganda, have also been deadly.

"The possibility of a contagion effect in Uganda, inspired by its two neighbours, cannot be ruled out," said Kampala-based political analyst Timothy Kalyegira.

The first round of voting will be held alongside a parliamentary election. A presidential run-off will be held within a month if no candidate wins an outright majority.

Despite concerns about his human rights record, Museveni has won favour with Western countries by sending troops to regional hotspots such as Somalia and taking in millions of refugees.

More recently, he has curried favour with U.S. President Donald Trump by agreeing to take in U.S. deportees who are nationals of third countries.

Sarah Rusoke, a 26-year-old owner of a vehicle-washing business credited Museveni with building an "economy that allows us to start businesses and ... create our own footprints".

Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, has tapped into dissatisfaction among young people in a country where more than 70% of the population is under 30.

He has described the election as a "protest vote" against what he calls Museveni's "dictatorship", while pledging a wholesale clean-up of official corruption if he wins.

"I am inspired by his bravery," Simon Walusimbi, a 21-year-old mechanic, said of Wine. "He has put up with all the persecution the government has thrown at him."</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 07:29:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/MOX46BKJ2NNQDA6AF4T2TKONK4.jpg?auth=af541c819ea76be86c36640b5952eb592dffa283bd07f8979c9a1b7cf9529731&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Former Polish Minister Ziobro says he has been granted asylum in Hungary</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/former-polish-minister-ziobro-says-he-has-been-granted-asylum-hungary-2026-01-12/</link><description>WARSAW, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Former Polish Minister of Justice Zbigniew Ziobro said on Monday that he decided to use asylum granted to him by Hungarian government.

Trentini, a charity worker from Venice, was the most well-known among the more than 20 Italian nationals held in Venezuelan prisons.

Venezuela's leadership said on January 8 it was going to release a significant number of prisoners , including foreign nationals, as a gesture of goodwill.

The move, heeding demands from human rights groups, international bodies and opposition figures, came after the U.S. attacked Venezuela and captured its president, Nicolas Maduro .

"I welcome with joy and satisfaction the release of our compatriots Alberto Trentini and Mario Burlo, who are now safely at the Italian Embassy in Caracas," Meloni said in a statement.

Trentini was arrested in November 2024 with his Venezuelan driver Rafael Machado. He was working for Humanity &amp; Inclusion, an NGO that assists disabled people.

Burlo, a businessman from Turin, was also arrested in November 2024 and held in Trenitini's same prison, the El Rodeo I facility in Caracas.

Two other Italian nationals, journalist Biagio Pilieri and businessman Luigi Gasperin, were freed last week.

In her statement, Meloni thanked Venezuela's authorities, starting from interim President Delcy Rodriguez, "for the constructive cooperation demonstrated in recent days."</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 07:29:49 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/MJWYGIO7VVKIXDQWJJI4TST3YQ.jpg?auth=d14c4759c2b063b9c2a0e1ef74729684cfc023783940a1200ca1eeb655422bb9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China focuses anti-corruption drive on misconduct, highlighting former minister's conviction</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/china-focuses-anti-corruption-drive-misconduct-highlighting-former-ministers-2026-01-12/</link><description>BEIJING, Jan 12 (Reuters) - China will focus its corruption crackdown on preventing misconduct from escalating into graft, according to a state broadcaster documentary series that highlighted the crimes of a disgraced former minister.

The first episode of the CCTV-produced series titled "Unwavering in Our Resolve, Unyielding in Our Step" aired late Sunday, a day before China's top anti-graft watchdog, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) kicked off its three-day annual meeting.

The video heavily showcased former Agriculture Minister Tang Renjian who was convicted and sentenced for bribery last September, detailing how he enjoyed lavish banquets, entertainment and benefits for his family as some of the rural projects he was involved in were largely abandoned.

Tang appeared in the video clad in a plain black t-shirt, speaking remorsefully about his actions.

"Whether it was eating and drinking in violation of regulations or having fun, I was constantly thinking about such things at that time. In fact, in the end, it wears down your will," said Tang, who was given a suspended death sentence after admitting to receiving bribes worth more than 268 million yuan ($38 million).

The documentary also made examples of an official from central Henan province who died of excessive alcohol consumption after a banquet in March, held against the Communist Party rules, as well as a case of two grassroots officials who took advantage of vulnerabilities in China's pension fund system to commit embezzlement.

Last year, revised austerity regulations targeting Communist Party members and public sector workers banned lavish banquets, "white elephant" infrastructure projects, luxurious car fittings and ornamental plants in work meetings.

"We must cut off the chain of interests that spreads from misconduct to corruption and build a work chain to rectify corruption," a CCDI official, Wang Xinqi, said in the video.

Chinese President Xi Jinping last year called corruption " the biggest threat " to China's Communist Party in a signal that the ruling party would continue tackling the long-running problem entrenched in many strata of Chinese society.

Beijing has maintained a "high-pressure campaign" that has led to probes into high-profile individuals last year ranging from the former securities regulator chief Yi Huiman , ex-chairman of China Eastern Airlines Liu Shaoyong, to nine top military leaders including the country's No.2 general He Weidong .

"The Party's conduct is its image, affecting public support and even its very survival," the CCTV video said.

While political analysts say Museveni's stranglehold on Ugandan institutions makes victory for him and his National Resistance Movement (NRM) party a near certainty in presidential and parliamentary elections, how the vote unfolds could have important implications for the country's path forward.

Museveni, who came to power at the head of a rebellion in 1986, is aiming for a seventh term in office.

His main challenger is 43-year-old Bobi Wine, who finished runner-up in the 2021 election with 35% of the vote and is popular with young voters.

Other notable candidates are former military chief Mugisha Muntu, an anti-corruption campaigner, and Nandala Mafabi, a lawmaker who was previously the opposition leader in parliament.

Museveni has campaigned on a slogan of "protecting the gains", touting a record of relative peace and stability.

He has said he wants to make Uganda a middle-income country by boosting manufacturing, adding value to agricultural exports such as coffee and cotton and capitalising on the start of oil production expected later this year.

Wine has focused on restoring political freedoms, accusing Museveni of "40 years of dictatorship". The government has denied allegations of widespread human rights abuses.

Wine has also vowed to stamp out corruption, bolster youth employment and review production-sharing agreements with international oil firms if they do not favour Ugandan interests.

Successive elections in Uganda have been marred by violence and crackdowns on government opponents.

Security forces killed more than 50 people before the last election in 2021 while responding to protests triggered by Wine's arrest.

Hundreds of opposition supporters have been detained in the run-up to this year's vote, and at least one was killed at a campaign event.

Violent youth-led protests in neighbouring Kenya and Tanzania over the past two years have underscored the risks to the government of young people's frustration with political systems they see as corrupt and unresponsive to their needs.

Last week, Ugandan authorities said they were banning live broadcasts of riots, "unlawful processions" and other violent incidents.

Museveni's Uganda has been a strategic ally of Western countries, sending troops to fight Somalia's al Shabaab and other militant groups in the region. It also hosts the largest number of refugees in Africa.

The United States criticised the 2021 elections as neither free nor fair and imposed visa bans on some Ugandan officials, but Washington is unlikely to weigh in on this year's poll after U.S. diplomats were instructed in July not to comment on the integrity of foreign elections.

Museveni's government has curried favour with U.S. President Donald Trump's administration by entering an agreement in August to take in deportees from the U.S. who are nationals of third countries.

Uganda has expanded its economic ties with China and non-Western powers such as Russia and the United Arab Emirates in recent years. China National Offshore Oil Corporation [RIC:RIC:SASACY.UL] is one of the two lead partners in Uganda’s Lake Albert oil fields, which are due to start commercial crude production later this year.

There may be little suspense about the election outcome, but political observers will be watching the vote for what it says about a future presidential succession.

Museveni is widely thought to be lining up his son, military chief Muhoozi Kainerugaba, to succeed him.

Kainerugaba has fuelled the speculation by openly discussing his presidential ambitions, although Museveni has denied grooming his son to succeed him.

Political analysts say Kainerugaba's status as heir apparent is a source of controversy within the NRM and that other party heavyweights are also positioning themselves for Museveni's eventual departure from the scene.

One important metric will be Museveni's margin of victory. In 2021, he registered his lowest score in a presidential election with 58% of the vote. Any further slippage could weaken his political standing before a possible succession battle, analysts say.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 07:50:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/VTJTS67KOFOQDBN5GZV5QLDDR4.jpg?auth=77c03b1fac8625a4440ffc3ff7e1bf07ec03b2c5a7324304dfaf9578fd5be98e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Thailand's liberal opposition tops polls as election looms</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/thailands-liberal-opposition-tops-polls-election-looms-2026-01-12/</link><description>BANGKOK, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Thailand's progressive opposition People's Party and its leader are most favoured among voters for next month's general election , two surveys showed, underlining the stiff challenge facing Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul 's bid to stay in power.

Thailand's February 8 election could usher in a new round of turmoil in Thailand, and will be a showdown between the anti-establishment People's Party, Anutin's conservative Bhumjaithai and the former ruling party Pheu Thai , with bitter histories of betrayal that could complicate efforts to form a government.

The People's Party was backed by 34.2% of respondents in a January 6-9 poll by Suan Dusit released on Sunday, with Bhumjaithai second on 16.2% and the once-dominant Pheu Thai on 16.0%.

People's Party head and opposition leader Natthaphong Ruengpanyawut was the top choice for prime minister among 32% of the 2,682 people surveyed, followed by Pheu Thai's Yodchanan Wongsawat on 17.4% and Anutin third on 15.1%.

With huge support among young and urban Thais for its bold reform agenda, the People's Party's predecessor Move Forward won the most votes in the 2023 election but was blocked from power by lawmakers allied with the royalist military.

Move Forward was later dissolved by a court, one of a series of dramatic twists in an unrelenting cycle of upheaval that has seen three Thai premiers in less than three years.

Anutin called a snap election on December 12 after less than 100 days in office during a turbulent parliamentary session that could have led to a no-confidence vote and the collapse of his fragile minority government. It came also as Thailand's military was embroiled in a fierce three-week border conflict with Cambodia.

A poll released on Sunday by the National Institute for Development Administration also showed Natthaphong as the top choice for premier, backed by 24.7% of the people surveyed, followed closely by Anutin with 20.8% and Yodchanan fifth on 9.6%.

NIDA's January 5-8 survey of 2,500 people showed the People's Party as the most popular with about 30.5% of support, followed by Bhumjaithai at 22.3%.

The billionaire Shinawatra family's Pheu Thai was third, picked by 15.4% of respondents, indicating declining support for the populist outfit following the collapse of its government in September after Paetongtarn Shinawatra's sacking by a court and the jailing its influential founder, Thaksin Shinawatra .</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 09:35:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ENS4MLYHWZN77HUMW5TTLH7PVY.jpg?auth=bb0788efbac4f836bf04058e1162cdaf18685f0658562ac7386bd2de93713307&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump Greenland threat triggers search for shelter beyond gold, defence</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/trump-greenland-threat-triggers-search-shelter-beyond-gold-defence-2026-01-12/</link><description>LONDON/NEW YORK, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Investors have piled fresh bets on gold and European defence stocks in response to U.S. President Donald Trump's threats to take control of Greenland , fearing a geopolitical rift that could end NATO, shatter the global order and damage the dollar.

Although gains in both are expected to continue regardless of what happens to Greenland , investors face the dilemma of how to position for any longer-term fallout.

Trump wants to gain control of the Danish territory, through a purchase or even military means , while Greenland does not want to be part of the U.S., a stance supported by Europe and Canada .

While investors have previously largely ignored these aspirations, the U.S. seizure of Venezuela's Nicolas Maduro in a surprise military raid has suddenly made them more tangible.

For investors hoping for less risk after last year's tariff turmoil , the news makes for an uncomfortable start to 2026.

Trump has also weighed intervening in unrest in Iran , while the U.S. administration's threat to indict Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has reignited concerns about its independence.

Gold jumped more than 4% last week after Maduro's capture and hit a new record high on Monday. European defence stocks (.SXPARO) , opens new tab hit fresh all-time highs on Monday and last week posted their biggest weekly jump in over five years, with a 10% gain.

"You look at gold prices and they are just screaming that markets are concerned about geopolitical risk," Matthew Miskin, co-chief investment strategist at Manulife John Hancock Investments, said of the most recent rise in bullion.

Non-yielding gold is traditionally seen as a safe haven for investors during wider market uncertainty or volatility.

Many investors have already been calling for a large exposure to gold, including hedge fund manager Ray Dalio , who last year noted a big relative underperformance by U.S. stocks.

U.S. ambitions on acquiring Greenland could have far-reaching implications, not just for NATO but also efforts to end war in Ukraine and China's tensions with Japan and Taiwan.

If the U.S. forcibly took Greenland from fellow NATO member Denmark, it would likely not only mark the end of the military alliance but the wider balance of power, analysts say.

"It would call into question much more the global order that's essentially largely been established since Bretton Woods II, (or) the end of World War Two, when NATO was created," said Steve Kolano, CIO at Integrated Partners.

If Europe must rely less on the U.S. for its defence, it is no surprise that investors are buying European defence stocks, a sector that's more than tripled since Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine.

German tank maker Rheinmetall (RHMG.DE) , opens new tab rallied 19% last week, while Sweden's Saab (SAABb.ST) , opens new tab surged 22%.

"With the rhetoric about Greenland, the rally is being sustained," said Jeremie Peloso, chief European strategist at BCA Research.

Beyond buying gold and defence stocks, other trades are more difficult for investors to pick.

"Political (and) geopolitical risk is very hard to price and markets typically do a very poor job of it, given that these are big-impact, but low-probability events," said Idanna Appio, portfolio manager at First Eagle Investments, who does own some gold as a hedge against geopolitics.

"If you're positioning your portfolio for something that has a 1%, 5% chance of being realized, then you're already sort of saying: 'well, 95% of the time I'm going to be wrong.'"

That helps explain why there has been little broader impact, with world stocks at near record highs and Danish government bonds rallying alongside European peers.

Denmark's closely managed crown currency has been weakening, but rate differentials are a major factor and it is still close to the central rate at which it is pegged to the euro .

Things could change quickly if the U.S. took a military approach to Greenland, which Cresset Capital CIO Jack Ablin said, unlike Venezuela, "would be a big deal, sparking risk aversion in equities and (the) dollar ".

Traders reacted immediately when Moscow acted on its Ukraine threats, sparking major moves in oil, the euro and stocks.

"If the U.S. were to seize Greenland by force, or maybe not by force, but under some sort of coercion, ... you would have a rally towards Treasuries, you'd have a selloff in European government bonds, which quality investors wouldn't see as a haven," said Natixis' head U.S. economist Christopher Hodge.

Investors reckon that short-term, the dollar and Treasuries would benefit from a rush to safety.

However, a breakdown in transatlantic relations could see that U.S. pull fade and a return of worries about the dollar's status , which flickered around last April's tariff announcement.

It is too soon to see any signs of that shifting on the back of the U.S. action in Venezuela or its Greenland threats, with some saying it could prompt money to move out of the U.S.

The Baltic Sea region is on high alert after a string of power cable, telecom link and gas pipeline outages since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, and NATO has boosted its military presence with frigates, aircraft and naval drones.

Finland seized the Fitburg cargo ship on December 31 while en route from Russia to Israel, and detained one crew member as part of the investigation. The ship will leave Finland's territorial waters on Monday, police said in a statement.

"Finnish and Estonian police have completed their work on board the vessel, and the seizure can therefore be lifted," head of the investigation at Finland's National Bureau of Investigation, Risto Lohi, said in the statement.

Some of the ship's crew remain under a travel ban, he added.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 10:27:19 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/P6USGJPGMRMLNCZUAZ7QZNWTFY.jpg?auth=99afd78878c4d34f1c7b57d3066dadab2ce983fdffce451bf6bed2b8f7b9b0d6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UK police chief says London getting safer despite Trump and others' remarks on crime wave</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-police-chief-says-london-getting-safer-despite-trump-others-remarks-crime-2026-01-12/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Britain's most senior police officer said on Monday that London's homicide rate had fallen to its lowest for more than a decade, showing the city was becoming safer, despite remarks by U.S. President Donald Trump and others on violent crime in the capital.

Mark Rowley, commissioner of London's Metropolitan Police, said the homicide rate in London was at an all-time low on a per capita basis and the city was safer than Los Angeles and New York as well as many other European capitals.

Rowley said serious violent crime in London was declining, according to police data and information from hospital admissions.

"Despite claims circulated online, including AI‑generated videos creating fictional violent scenarios, some commentators promote a narrative that suits them, regardless that the facts tell a very different story," he wrote in The Times newspaper.

Trump had suggested in November that there were "no-go" areas for police in London and accused Mayor Sadiq Khan of "letting crime go". The U.S. president has been critical of Khan for years.

"Look at the crime you have in London," Trump told British broadcaster GB News in November. "Today you have people being stabbed in the ass or worse."

In September, X owner Elon Musk told a large right-wing demonstration in the city via video link that "violence is coming".

Met police figures showed there were 97 homicides in London in 2025, an 11% reduction on 2024, and that violent incidents resulting in injury have fallen by a fifth since 2014.

"In London, the evidence is clear, we’re winning the battle against violent crime," Sadiq Khan wrote in the Guardian newspaper on Monday.

The figures covered violent crime, but many British people's perception of crime is the opposite given a jump in crimes such as shoplifting, which hit an all-time high last year.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 10:27:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/UYTXSDBMXFIE7PMH4FAZL43OKA.jpg?auth=a70cba43a48c8f03fb221c91e4191ed17ff9978bb8db8f8e0555a7f8d8c3b7fb&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Former French player, coach and commentator Courbis dies at 72</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sports/soccer/former-french-player-coach-commentator-courbis-dies-72-2026-01-12/</link><description>PARIS, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Former French footballer, coach and outspoken media commentator Rolland Courbis has died aged 72, his employer said on Monday.

Born in Marseille, Courbis dedicated his life to the game, ending up as one of the most recognisable voices in French sports media.

A former defender, he played for several clubs including Olympique de Marseille, AC Ajaccio, Olympique Lyonnais and AS Monaco before moving into management.

As a coach, he worked with clubs including Bordeaux, Montpellier, Rennes, Ajaccio and Marseille, which he led to the UEFA Cup final in 1999.

French radio station RMC announced Courbis' death without giving more details.

"His passion was expressed through his emblematic Marseille accent and a very direct closeness with listeners — a freedom of tone that preserved the language of supporters while sharing their questions and emotions," RMC said in tribute.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 10:28:08 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/F4BLA2J3BBMMHO2LTOPRLCXAAE.jpg?auth=1c5cad37b665d3c9919b318f8dabf06a028eeea109c5a29fe579c9cd05257b4e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Bulgaria's biggest party rejects offer to form new government, snap election likely</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/bulgarias-biggest-party-rejects-offer-form-new-government-snap-election-likely-2026-01-12/</link><description>SOFIA, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Bulgaria's biggest parliamentary grouping, the centre-right GERB-SDS, declined a request on Monday from the president to try and form a new government, increasing the likelihood of a snap election in the European Union's poorest member state.

Prime Minister Rosen Zhelyazkov's coalition government, backed by GERB-SDS, resigned last month after weeks of street protests against state corruption and a new budget that would have increased some taxes.

In line with the constitution, Bulgarian President Rumen Radev on Monday formally asked Zhelyazkov to try and build a new coalition, the local BTA news agency reported. However, Zhelyazkov immediately returned the mandate, it said, as he lacks enough support in parliament to build a stable majority.

Radev is now expected to offer the second largest grouping, the reformist PP-DB, a chance to govern but it is also likely to turn down the offer. Radev will then hand the mandate to a party of his choice and if no grouping can secure a parliamentary majority, he will dissolve the assembly and call a snap election, Bulgaria's eighth in just four years.

Despite such uncertainty, Bulgaria joined the euro zone on January 1 as scheduled. It needs political stability, however, to speed up the uptake of EU funds into its creaking infrastructure, to encourage foreign investment and to root out endemic state corruption.

The GERB-SDS coalition won the last election in October 2024 but only took power in January 2025 after months of talks and needed the support of other parties in the divided legislature.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 10:52:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US ramps up pressure on Cuba after Maduro capture</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/us-ramps-up-pressure-on-cuba-after-maduro-capture</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 10:55:08 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/b66a400a-ef7b-11f0-a637-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/063-2255277374.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Landmark genocide case against Myanmar to be heard by UN top court</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/landmark-genocide-case-against-myanmar-to-be-heard-by-un-top-court</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 10:55:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/069373b8-ef9e-11f0-ac48-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260112-103801-103953-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Son of Iran's shah remains divisive figure despite presenting as rallying figure</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/son-of-iran-s-shah-remains-divisive-figure-despite-presenting-as-rallying-figure</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 10:55:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/f36ccbf2-ef77-11f0-867e-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-11T192042Z-1032452122-RC26ZIAH78XA-RTRMADP-3-IRAN-ECONOMY-PROTESTS-BRITAIN.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuela says it has released 'large' number of political prisoners</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/venezuela-says-it-has-released-large-number-of-political-prisoners</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 10:55:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/d0d01166-ef9b-11f0-b6b3-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260112-101909-102042-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>What we know about the deadly anti-regime protests in Iran</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260112-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-unrest-in-iran</link><description>Nationwide protests in Iran sparked by the Islamic Republic’s ailing economy are putting new pressure on its theocracy as it has shut down the internet and telephone networks.

Tehran is still reeling from a 12-day war launched by Israel in June that saw the United States bomb nuclear sites in Iran. Economic pressure, which has intensified since September when the United Nations reimposed sanctions on the country over its atomic programme, has sent Iran’s rial currency into a free fall, now trading at over 1.4 million to $1.

Meanwhile, Iran’s self-described “ Axis of Resistance ” — a coalition of countries and militant groups backed by Tehran — has been decimated since the start of the Israel-Hamas war in 2023.

A threat by President Donald Trump warning Iran that if Tehran “violently kills peaceful protesters”, the US “will come to their rescue”, has taken on new meaning after American troops captured Venezuela’s Nicolas Maduro , a longtime ally of Tehran.

“We’re watching it very closely,” Trump has warned. “If they start killing people like they have in the past, I think they’re going to get hit very hard by the United States.”

More than 500 protests have taken place across all of Iran’s 31 provinces, the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency reported early Monday. The death toll had reached at least 544, it said, with more than 10,600 arrests. The group relies on an activist network inside of Iran for its reporting and has been accurate in past unrest.

The Iranian government has not offered overall casualty figures for the demonstrations. Foreign media have been unable to independently assess the toll, given that internet and international phone calls are now blocked in Iran.

Understanding the scale of the protests has been difficult. Iranian state media has provided little information about the demonstrations. Online videos offer only brief, shaky glimpses of people in the streets or the sound of gunfire. Journalists in general in Iran also face limits on reporting such as requiring permission to travel around the country, as well as the threat of harassment or arrest by authorities. The internet shutdown has further complicated the situation.

But the protests do not appear to be stopping, even after Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said “rioters must be put in their place”.

The collapse of the rial has led to a widening economic crisis in Iran. Prices are up on meat, rice and other staples of the Iranian dinner table. The nation has been struggling with an annual inflation rate of some 40 percent.

In December, Iran introduced a new pricing tier for its nationally subsidised gasoline, raising the price of some of the world’s cheapest gas and further pressuring the population. Tehran may seek steeper price increases in the future, as the government now will review prices every three months. Meanwhile, food prices are expected to spike after Iran’s Central Bank in recent days ended a preferential, subsidised dollar-rial exchange rate for all products except medicine and wheat.

The protests began in late December with merchants in Tehran before spreading. While initially focused on economic issues, the demonstrations soon saw protesters chanting anti-government statements as well. Anger has been simmering over the years, particularly after the 2022 death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody that triggered nationwide demonstrations.

Some have chanted in support of Iran’s exiled Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi, who called for protests Thursday and Friday night.

Iran’s “Axis of Resistance”, which grew in prominence in the years after the 2003 US-led invasion and subsequent occupation of Iraq, is reeling.

Israel has crushed Hamas in the devastating war in the Gaza Strip. Hezbollah , the Shiite militant group in Lebanon, has seen its top leadership killed by Israel and has been struggling since. A lightning offensive in December 2024 overthrew Iran’s longtime stalwart ally and client in Syria, former president Bashar al Assad, after years of war there. Yemen’s Iranian-backed Houthi rebels also have been pounded by Israeli and US airstrikes.

China meanwhile has remained a major buyer of Iranian crude oil, but hasn’t provided overt military support. Neither has Russia , which has relied on Iranian drones in its war on Ukraine .

Iran has insisted for decades that its nuclear programme is peaceful. However, its officials have increasingly threatened to pursue a nuclear weapon. Iran had been enriching uranium to near weapons-grade levels before the US attack in June, making it the only country in the world without a nuclear weapons programme to do so.

Tehran also increasingly cut back its cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ), the UN’s nuclear watchdog, as tensions increased over its nuclear programme in recent years. The IAEA’s director-general has warned Iran could build as many as 10 nuclear bombs, should it decide to weaponise its programme.

US intelligence agencies have assessed that Iran has yet to begin a weapons programme, but has “undertaken activities that better position it to produce a nuclear device, if it chooses to do so”.

Iran recently said it was no longer enriching uranium at any site in the country, trying to signal to the West that it remains open to potential negotiations over its atomic programme to ease sanctions. But there’s been no significant talks in the months since the June war.

Iran decades ago was one of the United States’ top allies in the Middle East under Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who purchased American military weapons and allowed CIA technicians to run secret listening posts monitoring the neighbouring Soviet Union. The CIA fomented a 1953 coup that cemented the shah’s rule.

But in January 1979, the shah fled Iran as mass demonstrations swelled against his rule. Then came the Islamic Revolution led by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, which created Iran’s theocratic government.

Later that year, university students overran the US Embassy in Tehran, seeking the shah’s extradition and sparking the 444-day hostage crisis that saw diplomatic relations between Iran and the US severed.

During the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s, the US backed Saddam Hussein . During that conflict, the US launched a one-day assault that crippled Iran at sea as part of the so-called “Tanker War”, and later shot down an Iranian commercial airliner that the US military said it mistook for a warplane.

Iran and the US have seesawed between enmity and grudging diplomacy in the years since. Relations peaked with the 2015 nuclear deal, which saw Iran greatly limit its programme in exchange for the lifting of sanctions. But Trump unilaterally withdrew America from the accord in 2018, sparking tensions in the Mideast that intensified after Hamas’s October 7, 2023, attack on Israel.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 10:55:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/7ecfa6aa-ed62-11f0-a0df-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26009447003699.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Syrian government forces take control of Aleppo after clashes with Kurdish fighters</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/syrian-government-forces-take-control-of-aleppo-after-clashes-with-kurdish-fighters</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 10:55:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/bd43e088-ef9f-11f0-82cc-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/000-92CV8KJ.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Number of prisoners released in Venezuela rises to 41, says rights group</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/number-prisoners-released-venezuela-rises-41-says-rights-group-2026-01-12/</link><description>Jan 12 (Reuters) - The number of prisoners released in Venezuela has risen to 41, local rights group Foro Penal said on Monday, after 24 people were freed overnight.

The meeting, listed among the pope's appointments for Monday in a daily Vatican statement, had not been included in an earlier advisory to the press about Leo's planned schedule for the day.

Leo, the first U.S. pope, has called for Venezuela to remain an independent country after the capture by U.S. forces of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on the orders of President Donald Trump.

In a major foreign policy speech on Friday, the pope decried the use of military force as a means of achieving diplomatic goals and called for human rights to be protected in Venezuela.

Machado a former National Assembly member, was barred from running in Venezuela’s 2024 general election by authorities aligned with Maduro.

She backed a stand‑in candidate who was widely considered to have won the vote, although Maduro claimed victory. Ballot audits by independent observers showed irregularities in the official results.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 11:42:56 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/6E52F3UYSRITBNSH74RQRIXLOQ.jpg?auth=fdf504d63c102f75b309abae2b938c0ffd3250d1b91032420da82a0b6295b91b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Norway gives $400 million to Ukraine for energy sector, administration</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/norway-gives-400-million-ukraine-energy-sector-administration-2026-01-12/</link><description>Jan 12 (Reuters) - Norway said on Monday it was providing 340 million euros ($397 million) in emergency funding to support Ukraine's energy sector and help the government maintain critical services, as part of the Nordic country's wider aid to the war-torn nation in 2026.

Russian attacks have long targeted Ukraine's energy network and have become more intense in recent months at a time of plunging winter temperatures.

The Norwegian parliament late last year allocated 85 billion crowns ($8.45 billion) for aid to Ukraine, with 70 billion going to military support and 15 billion to civilian and humanitarian aid.

The civilian package allotted 4.8 billion crowns to energy security and supply, followed by 4 billion for budget support and reconstruction and 3.5 billion for humanitarian assistance, with additional funding designated for business development, civil society and governance reforms, and support for Moldova.

European countries are backing Ukraine in its defence against Russia, with EU leaders recently agreeing to a 90 billion euro loan.

“Due to public strikes, the Musee du Louvre is closed today,” the museum said in a message posted on its website , informing disappointed tourists and art lovers that their entry tickets would be automatically reimbursed.

The museum closed for a full day last month and has been only partially open on several other days since.

Nearly three months after a daylight heist , which has heaped pressure on Louvre bosses, staff are calling for more recruitment and better maintenance of the vast former royal palace.

Questions continue to swirl since the October 19 break-in over whether it was avoidable and why thieves were able to steal crown jewels worth more than $100 million.

Two intruders used a truck-mounted extendable platform to access a gallery containing the jewels, slicing through a glass door with disk-cutters in front of startled visitors before stealing eight priceless items.

As well as the robbery, two other recent incidents have highlighted maintenance problems inside the building, which chief architect François Chatillon has described as “not in a good state”.

A water leak in November damaged hundreds of books and manuscripts in the Egyptian department, while management had to shut a gallery housing ancient Greek ceramics in October because ceiling beams above it risked giving way.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 11:43:48 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/4e3b473c-efa7-11f0-b652-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25349355343444.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israeli-backed group kills a senior Hamas police officer in Gaza, threatens more attacks</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-backed-group-kills-senior-hamas-police-officer-gaza-threatens-more-2026-01-12/</link><description>CAIRO, Jan 12 (Reuters) - An Israeli-backed Palestinian militia said on Monday it had killed a senior Hamas police officer in the southern Gaza Strip, an incident which Hamas blamed on "Israeli collaborators".

A statement from the Hamas-run interior ministry said gunmen opened fire from a passing car, killing Mahmoud Al-Astal, head of the criminal police unit in Khan Younis, in the south of the enclave. It described the attackers as "collaborators with the occupation".

Hussam Al-Astal, leader of an anti-Hamas group based in an area under Israeli control east of Khan Younis, claimed responsibility for the killing in a video he posted on his Facebook page. The surname he shares with the dead man, Al-Astal, is common in that part of Gaza.

"To those who work with Hamas, your destiny is to be killed. Death is coming to you," he said, dressed in a black military-style uniform and clutching an assault rifle.

Reuters could not independently verify the circumstances of the attack. An Israeli military official said the army was not aware of any operations in the area.

The emergence of armed anti-Hamas groups, though still small and localised, has added pressure on the Islamists and could complicate efforts to stabilise and unify a divided Gaza, shattered by two years of war.

These groups remain unpopular among the local population as they operate in areas under Israeli control, although they publicly deny they take Israeli orders. Hamas has held public executions of people it accuses of collaboration.

Under a ceasefire in place since October, Israel has withdrawn from nearly half of the Gaza Strip, but its troops remain in control of the other half, largely a wasteland where virtually all buildings have been levelled.

Nearly all of the territory's two million people now live in Hamas-held areas, mostly in makeshift tents or damaged buildings, where the group has been reasserting its grip. Four Hamas sources said it continues to command thousands of fighters despite suffering heavy losses during the war.

Israel has been allowing rivals of Hamas to operate in areas it controls. In later phases, U.S. President Donald Trump's plan for Gaza calls for Israel to withdraw further and for Hamas to yield power to an internationally backed administration, but there has so far been no progress towards those steps.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged Israeli backing for anti-Hamas groups in June, saying Israel had "activated" clans, but has given few details since then.

The ceasefire has ended major combat in Gaza over the past three months, but both sides have accused the other of regular violations. More than 440 Palestinians and three Israeli soldiers have been killed since the truce took effect.

Gaza health authorities said on Monday Israeli drone fire killed at least three people near the centre of Khan Younis.

The Israeli military did not have an immediate comment on the drone incident.

The war erupted on October 7, 2023 when Gazan militants invaded Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking some 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.

Israel’s subsequent military assault on Gaza has killed more than 71,000 Palestinians, according to the enclave’s health ministry, and led to accusations of genocide and war crimes, which Israel denies.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 12:50:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/OOH2FTVWPVJCFC6LCI2GBUK2I4.jpg?auth=c469e35e61abe68d9558124374332e2c6feef558454281794e7708e95d779d6b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UK regulator launches investigation into X over Grok sexualised imagery</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/uk-regulator-launches-investigation-into-x-over-grok-sexualised-imagery-2026-01-12/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Britain's media regulator launched an investigation into Elon Musk's X on Monday to determine whether sexually intimate deepfakes produced by its Grok AI chatbot violated its duty to protect people in the UK from content that could be illegal.

"There have been deeply concerning reports of the Grok AI chatbot account on X being used to create and share undressed images of people – which may amount to intimate image abuse or pornography – and sexualised images of children that may amount to child sexual abuse material," Ofcom said in a statement.

The regulator is under pressure to act after Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the images produced by Grok were "disgusting" and "unlawful".

Musk's X had to "get a grip" on Grok, Starmer said on Thursday, adding that Ofcom had the government's full support to take action.

Creating or sharing non-consensual intimate images or child sexual abuse material, including AI-generated sexual imagery, is illegal in Britain.

Additionally, tech platforms must prevent British users from encountering illegal content and remove it once they become aware of it.

X has faced condemnation in other countries over the feature, which can produce images of women and minors in skimpy clothing.

French officials have reported X to prosecutors and regulators, calling the content " manifestly illegal ," while Indian authorities have also demanded explanations.

X has restricted the feature to paying users . It said last week that it removes all illegal content on the platform and permanently suspends accounts involved.

"Anyone using or prompting Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content," it said.

Asked about the subject recently, xAI told Reuters: "Legacy Media Lies."

Ofcom will investigate whether X failed to assess the risk that people in Britain would see illegal content, and whether it considered the risk to children.

Ofcom said in the most serious cases of non-compliance it could ask a court to require "payment providers or advertisers to withdraw their services from a platform", or make internet service providers block access to a site in Britain.

X did not immediately reply to a request to comment on the Ofcom investigation.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 12:50:31 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/VU3G4YSWZ5IXNEEIEXVW57Q4PY.jpg?auth=2447f678233cef3c084f4db8550947448bcf93a719c4d2a91806742d3df320ac&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>France launches recruitment campaign for new voluntary military service</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/france-launches-recruitment-campaign-new-voluntary-military-service-2026-01-12/</link><description>PARIS, Jan 12 (Reuters) - France said on Monday it was launching a campaign to recruit thousands of young people for a new 10-month voluntary national military service, with the first participants starting their service in September.

The scheme , unveiled by President Emmanuel Macron in November, is open to all young French citizens aged 18-25 eager "to play a part in the nation's capacity to resist in an uncertain environment," the chief of staff of the armed forces, General Fabien Mandon told a press conference.

The move is part of a broader shift across Europe, where nations that for decades have had U.S. security guarantees are fretting about President Donald Trump's shifting priorities and what they see as Russia's aggressive posture.

From September, 3,000 young people will join either the army, navy or air force for missions on French soil, rising to 4,000 in 2027 and 10,000 annually by 2030.

They will receive about 800 euros ($935) a month and conduct tasks ranging from assistance during natural disasters to surveillance against terrorism, and serve in jobs ranging from drone operator to baker, mechanic, electrician and member of medical staff.

After the program, participants could integrate into civilian life, become a reservist, or stay in the armed forces, reflecting the "long-term evolution of the army toward a hybrid model," Defense Minister Catherine Vautrin told the same news conference.

The scheme is expected to cost 150 million euros in 2026 and a total of 2.3 billion euros between 2026-2030, she said.

Prosecutors for the Valais canton initially ordered the detention of Jacques Moretti on Friday after a lengthy hearing with him and his wife Jessica, pending a decision on whether it was warranted.

The couple have expressed their grief over the fire and said they would cooperate fully with the investigation.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 12:50:47 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7XLGTPIENRP4LBQGA76XERVLUE.jpg?auth=eaf695f31d2a1feb85b6a41e7a6964d78528947464c181265d943bdd2aed2e2b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>European commissioner says U.S. military takeover of Greenland would be end of NATO</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/european-commissioner-says-us-military-takeover-greenland-would-be-end-nato-2026-01-12/</link><description>SALEN, Sweden, Jan 12 (Reuters) - It would be the end of NATO if the U.S. took Greenland by force and European Union member states are under obligation to come to Denmark's assistance if it was faced with military aggression, the European Commissioner for Defence and Space said on Monday.

Trump has said the U.S. must own Greenland , an autonomous

part of the Kingdom of Denmark, to prevent Russia or China

occupying the strategically located and minerals-rich Arctic territory, arguing U.S. military presence there was not

enough.

Both Greenland and Denmark have said that Greenland is not for sale but Trump has not ruled out taking it by force.

"I agree with the Danish Prime Minister that it will be the end of NATO, but also among people it will be also very, very negative," Commissioner Andrius Kubilius told Reuters at a security conference in Sweden.

Kubilius also said that the European Union Treaty article 42.7 obliged member states to come to Denmark's assistance if faced with military aggression.

"It will depend on very much on Denmark, how they will react, what will be their position, but definitely there is such an obligation of member sates to come for mutual assistance if another member state is facing military aggression," he said.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 12:50:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CTMJUW4WEFN7HH5XE33G2NKIEQ.jpg?auth=2a363ba77c84f3cdd739f0ca716617758d13ba12d24fda0d598046b37faf2700&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>South Korea president says Japan-China dispute not desirable for regional peace</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/south-korea-president-says-japan-china-dispute-not-desirable-regional-peace-2026-01-12/</link><description>SEOUL, Jan 12 (Reuters) - South Korean President Lee Jae Myung said that a dispute between China and Japan was not desirable for regional peace, adding that Seoul would not meddle in the ongoing row.

Grok is facing growing international backlash for allowing users to create and share sexualised pictures of women and children using simple text prompts.

Ofcom described the reports as "deeply concerning".

It said in a statement that the undressed images of people "may amount to intimate image abuse or pornography – and sexualised images of children ... may amount to child sexual abuse material".

Watch Global anger over Grok undressing women online

Britain's Technology Minister Liz Kendal welcomed the probe.

“It is vital that Ofcom complete this investigation swiftly because the public – and ‍most importantly the victims – ​will not accept any delay,” she said in ‌a statement.

“The content created and ‍shared using Grok in recent days has been deeply disturbing,” adding that she would ‍update parliament later on ‌Monday.

Contacted by AFP, X did not immediately respond.

Ofcom said it had contacted X on January 5, asking it to explain the steps it has taken to protect UK users.

Without sharing details of the exchange, the regulator said that X did respond within the given timeframe.

The formal investigation will determine whether X "failed to comply with its legal obligations".

Under Britain's Online Safety Act, which came into force in July, websites, social media and video-sharing platforms hosting potentially harmful content are required to implement strict age verification through tools such as facial imagery or credit card checks.

It is also illegal for media sites to create or share non-consensual intimate images or child sexual abuse material, including sexual deepfakes created with AI.

Ofcom has the power to impose fines of 10 percent of worldwide revenue for breaches of these rules.

Grok appeared to deflect the international criticism with a new monetisation policy at the end of last week, posting on X that the tool was now "limited to paying subscribers", alongside a link to a premium subscription.

UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has condemned the move as an affront to victims and "not a solution".

On Saturday, Indonesia became the first country to deny all access to the tool, with Malaysia following suit on Sunday.

The European Commission has said it is reviewing complaints about Grok.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 12:51:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/6499d4b8-ed49-11f0-b042-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/de7789c4b51d7945de475c9caf06632eef38256c.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'International influence' over 2026 edition of the Golden Globes</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/international-influence-over-2026-edition-of-the-golden-globes</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 12:51:52 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/abe51946-efaa-11f0-8b3d-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260112-120813-121218-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>There is a 'range of options' for US intervention in Iran as tension grows</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/there-is-a-range-of-options-for-us-intervention-in-iran-as-tension-grows</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 12:52:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/bda1a6e6-efa9-11f0-8c13-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260112-120116-120720-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>School resumes in tents under shadow of Gaza's 'yellow line'</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/school-resumes-tents-under-shadow-gazas-yellow-line-2026-01-12/</link><description>GAZA/CAIRO Jan 12 (Reuters) - She spends her lessons in the wintry cold on the floor of a crowded tent, her teacher interrupted by regular gunfire and explosions from Israeli-controlled territory less than 1,000 metres away. But Toulin Al-Hindi, 7, is grateful to be in school at last after more than two years of war.

She is one of some 400 children attending lessons at the makeshift North Educational School, set up in blue plastic tents in the ruins of northern Gaza's community of Beit Lahiya, within eyesight of the "yellow line" held by Israeli forces.

During a recent lesson, more than a dozen girls sat on the floor in two rows in one small tent, keeping warm in sweaters and puffy jackets, their notebooks out in front of them on a handful of slatted wooden crates. They cheerfully sang out numbers while their teacher drew shapes on a chalkboard.

"Although we do not sit on chairs, thank God we started attending school," said Toulin. "During the war, there were no schools, and we were bored."

Her mother, Yasmine Al-Ajouri, says she worries from the moment her daughter leaves for school until she comes home.

"Take care, take cover next to a wall, be quick on the road," Yasmine said she tells her daughter.

Under the ceasefire in place since October, Israel still occupies more than half of the Gaza Strip and bars civilians from other areas. Nearly all buildings in the Israeli-controlled sector have been levelled and residents driven out.

That leaves virtually the entire population of more than 2 million people confined to around a third of Gaza's territory, mostly in makeshift tents and damaged buildings, where life has resumed under control of an administration led by Hamas.

Although major fighting has been halted, Israel has routinely opened fire at Palestinians it accuses of approaching the yellow line, saying it aims to eliminate threats to troops.

More than 440 Palestinians have been killed since the October deal came into effect, while militants have killed three Israeli soldiers. Palestinians say Israeli forces have been moving some of the yellow concrete markers westward, encroaching into unoccupied territory. Israel denies this.

Staff at Toulin's school said they hear fire daily.

"We taught the children that as soon as we hear fire...to lie down. This is not safe, and safety depends on God, but this is what we can do," said Yara Abu Ghalweh, a school supervisor.

Israel’s assault on Gaza has killed more than 71,000 people, according to the enclave’s health ministry. The war was triggered by a Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on October 7, 2023, which killed about 1,200 people, according to Israeli tallies.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 13:44:04 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/RYFCSHA7OBKQRB75NODNMQJ5KQ.jpg?auth=713176fb6ba89068aff46e9635e6a5eb53eb1f36956d126689951df0338e4770&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Spain to tighten rental rules with room rent caps, seasonal lease curbs</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/spain-tighten-rental-rules-with-room-rent-caps-seasonal-lease-curbs-2026-01-12/</link><description>MADRID, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Spain's leftist government will further tighten rental rules and restrict medium-term leases to contain soaring rents and prevent price abuse under a decree to be approved in the coming weeks, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said on Monday.

One of the world's most-visited countries by tourists, Spain suffers from a severe housing shortage exacerbated by a tourism boom, and has faced mass protests undefined in the past years over soaring housing costs.

"We will continue intervening in the rental market," Sanchez said at an event marking the start of works at Spain's largest public housing project.

The long-delayed Campamento project will transform a former military site in western Madrid into 10,700 state-owned, affordable homes.

Sanchez said the decree would include a 100% personal income tax rebate for landlords who renew leases without raising rents.

It would also set a limit for combined room rents at the level of a full apartment to rein in room rentals and apply rent controls in designated high-pressure areas.

In addition, the government would also tighten conditions for seasonal rental contracts and introduce sanctions for their use as a substitute for long-term leases, Sanchez said.

Homeowners' associations and experts say that the current regulations favour short-term leases over long-term rentals.

However, most housing measures must be enforced by the regions, many of which are run by the opposition that may be reluctant to comply.

Still, wealthy northeastern Catalonia has adopted ceilings for seasonal and room rents, and several cities, including Madrid, have curbed tourist apartment rentals.

Average Spanish rents have doubled over the past decade, far outpacing salary growth.

According to the Bank of Spain, there is a housing deficit of 500,000 homes, and official data show that only about 120,000 new homes are built in Spain every year - a sixth of the levels before the 2008 financial crisis.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 13:44:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KJX45ADGTNKMRMCONRJT7KZZCI.jpg?auth=a2d1f5e278059c980ee3c72a305f752d9aaac606cf029c1b4e0a8a89b6d935ed&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Spanish police seize record 10 tons of cocaine hidden in cargo of salt</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/spanish-police-seize-record-10-tons-cocaine-hidden-cargo-salt-2026-01-12/</link><description>MADRID, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Spanish police have made their largest-ever cocaine seizure on the high seas, intercepting a vessel carrying almost 10 metric tons of the drug concealed in a shipment of salt en route from Brazil to Europe, police said on Monday.

The operation led to the arrest of 13 people on board. The vessel, which ended up running out of fuel, had to be towed to port by coastguards in Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Canary Islands, police said in a statement.

Officers recovered 294 bales of the drug and a handgun.

Footage showed police officers using shovels and digging with their hands to remove cocaine from beneath the salt, and then forming a line to move the bales to the pier.

The international effort also involved the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, Brazil's Federal Police, Britain's National Crime Agency and authorities in France and Portugal.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 13:44:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Sweden urges EU ban on support to Russian oil, gas-shipping fleet</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/sweden-urges-eu-ban-support-russian-oil-gas-shipping-fleet-2026-01-12/</link><description>STOCKHOLM, Jan 12 (Reuters) - The European Union should ban companies from providing any support to Moscow's oil and gas-shipping fleet, introduce sanctions against Russian fertilisers and stop luxury goods exports to Russia, Sweden's foreign minister said on Monday.

The 27-nation bloc is currently preparing its 20th sanctions package aimed at punishing Russia for its war in Ukraine . Previous sanctions have focused heavily on hobbling its oil and gas sector, the Kremlin's primary source of revenues.

"The pressure on Russia has to be increased," Foreign Minister Maria Malmer Stenergard said at an annual security conference in the town of Salen, in western Sweden.

Stenergard said the EU's next sanctions package should include a total ban on European companies providing services to Russian ships carrying oil, gas and coal.

"No transport, no reloading of goods between ships, no insurance and no port repairs," she said.

The EU should also impose sanctions on exports of Russian fertiliser , Russia's third-biggest export to the EU.

The EU imposed tariffs on fertiliser imports from Russia in July last year. Russia produces more than 20% of the world's fertiliser and supplies around 25% of the EU's fertiliser imports.

"And we want to put an end to exports of luxury goods from the EU to Russia," she said. "It irritates me that rich Russian consumers can wear expensive Italian clothing brands and drink fine French wines."

The EU has imposed 19 packages of sanctions against Russia since its invasion of Ukraine in 2022.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 13:44:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4UY7LSNVXVMPDBNFQR4T23OONE.jpg?auth=90f9facf8ff89b2f6ac4e4aed66d878ef57565b5d38ab413e7fa2623974499b8&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuela says it has released 116 prisoners</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/venezuela-says-it-has-released-116-prisoners-2026-01-12/</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 13:44:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Spanish police seize record 10 tons of cocaine hidden in cargo of salt</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/spanish-police-seize-record-10-tons-cocaine-hidden-cargo-salt-2026-01-12/</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 13:44:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Sweden urges EU ban on support to Russian oil, gas-shipping fleet</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/sweden-urges-eu-ban-support-russian-oil-gas-shipping-fleet-2026-01-12/</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 13:44:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Venezuela says it has released 116 prisoners</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/venezuela-says-it-has-released-116-prisoners-2026-01-12/</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 13:44:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Co-owner of Swiss bar that caught fire to remain in preventive detention for three months</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260112-co-owner-of-swiss-bar-that-caught-fire-to-remain-in-preventive-detention-for-three-months</link><description>The court said in a statement ‍that Jacques Moretti ​will be held for a provisional period of ‌three months, but this could ‍be reviewed if measures are taken to counter the risk of flight, such as ‍demanding a security deposit.

Moretti was taken into custody after he and his wife, Jessica, who co-owned Le Constellation bar in the ski resort of Crans-Montana, were interviewed by prosecutors in Switzerland 's southwestern Wallis canton on Friday.

The Morettis are under criminal investigation, facing charges of manslaughter by negligence, bodily harm by negligence and arson by negligence.

The fire broke out early on New Year's Day when the bar was filled with partygoers, killing 40 people and injuring 116, most of them teenagers.

In Switzerland, the presumption of innocence applies until a final conviction is pronounced.

Initial findings suggest that the fire was caused by sparklers igniting soundproofing foam installed on the ceiling of the establishment's basement.

Questions are also being raised regarding the presence and accessibility of fire extinguishers and whether the bar's exits were in compliance with regulations.

Moretti told investigators a service door had been locked from the inside and that he had found out about the locked door just after the deadly fire.

When he arrived at the scene, he forced open the door, according to excerpts from police reports published by several French and Swiss media outlets.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 13:45:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/dc4cd2cc-ed2a-11f0-8c43-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-07T110415Z-489520278-RC2AWIAYPPYA-RTRMADP-3-SWISS-BLAST.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israel prepares for potential Iranian attack as tension grows with US</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/israel-prepares-for-potential-iranian-attack-as-tension-grows-with-us</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 13:45:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/6277c6e6-efb4-11f0-8d01-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260112-133358-133520-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'One Battle After Another' and 'Hamnet' win top Golden Globe awards</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/one-battle-after-another-and-hamnet-win-top-golden-globe-awards</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 13:45:17 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/3f3568ba-ef77-11f0-a855-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-12T050151Z-1400113544-HP1EM1C0DEPT1-RTRMADP-3-AWARDS-GOLDEN-GLOBES.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Cuba's Diaz-Canel says there are no current talks with US government</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/cubas-diaz-canel-says-there-are-no-current-talks-with-us-government-2026-01-12/</link><description>HAVANA,  Jan 12 (Reuters) - Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel said on Monday there are no talks with the United States government in an apparent response to comments the day before by U.S. President Donald Trump suggesting the two longtime rivals were in conversations.

Images of the attack showed the mangled wreckage of the vehicle overturned on the roadside.

Tank deputy police chief Pervez Shah said five police personnel were killed on the spot after the remote-controlled bomb went off, while two others had died in hospital.

"The brave policemen sacrificed their today for the peaceful future of the nation," Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said in a statement.

No group has claimed responsibility for Monday's blast.

Pakistan's northern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where Tank is located, has battled a resurgence of militant violence carried out primarily by the Islamist Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan.

Pakistan has blamed the Afghan Taliban for providing a safe haven to TTP militants, saying they use Afghan soil to plan their strikes on targets in Pakistan. Kabul has denied the charges, saying Pakistan's security is an internal problem.

Pakistan and Afghanistan are in the midst of a fragile truce following border clashes in October that killed dozens, their worst fighting since the Taliban took power in 2021.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 14:28:21 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Exclusive: Israel poised to launch defence privatisations in months, says government official</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-poised-launch-defence-privatisations-months-says-government-official-2026-01-12/</link><description>JERUSALEM, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Israel plans to begin the long-awaited privatisation of two of its largest defence companies as early as the second quarter of this year, a senior government official said.

Roi Kahlon, director of the Government Companies Authority, said union and regulatory issues should be resolved in the next few months to allow initial public offerings by Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) (ISRAI.UL) and Rafael Advanced Defense Systems in the second quarter.

Defence privatisation has been discussed on and off for the past 20 years, but robust financial results bolstered by Israel's two-year war with Palestinian militant group Hamas in Gaza have strengthened the case to act now.

The government plans an initial sale of 25-30% of each company on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange in small tranches this year and next to avoid overwhelming the market and to retain controlling stakes for now.

"If you want to maximise valuation of the sale, we must make it in steps," Kahlon told Reuters, adding that the companies and Defence Ministry were in agreement on this.

IAI, which makes missile defence and unmanned aerial systems, is valued at about $20 billion. Rafael, which makes the Iron Dome anti-missile system as well as a new Iron Beam anti-missile laser, is valued at about $10 billion.

"We have an opportunity now ... because of the high value of both companies," Kahlon said.

Accountant General Yali Rothenberg said in November that plans to privatise IAI were taking shape after a ministerial panel approved a plan to sell up to 49% through an IPO.

Rafael has also begun IPO preparations, Kahlon said, citing discussions with company officials and the company's desire not to hand any advantage to rivals.

A Rafael spokesperson declined to comment.

IAI Chief Executive Boaz Levy told Reuters an IPO is crucial to the company's expansion plans. "We should look toward the future," he said. "It's very important for the company because (IAI) needs to grow."

Private ownership will also free the companies of bureaucracy that can hamper decision-making, Kahlon said, pointing to the success Israel Military Industries since it was bought by Elbit (ESLT.TA) , opens new tab in 2018. IMI is now valued at four times its 1.8 billion shekel ($571 million) purchase price, he said.

Ashdod port could also be privatised next year, Kahlon added without disclosing further detail.

Garibashvili, who served as prime minister from 2021 to 2024 and previously from 2013 to 2015, had been a longtime loyalist of Bidzina Ivanishvili , the billionaire ex-prime minister widely regarded as Georgia's de facto ruler.

His jailing marks the first time a senior figure from the governing elite has faced prosecution during a broader crackdown targeting opposition leaders.

Law enforcement raided Garibashvili's home - and those of two other associates of Ivanishvili - in October and said they had recovered $6.5 million in cash at the former business executive's residence.

Garibashvili, who has not publicly commented on the raid or the charges, was not available for comment on Monday. His lawyer told local media that he had been taken into custody.

Prosecutors said Garibashvili, 43, would also be fined 1 million lari ($375,230).

The ruling Georgian Dream party has cracked down on its pro-Western opponents over the past year, jailing opposition figures and launching a process to ban the three largest opposition groups outright. Anti-government street protesters are regularly arrested and dozens remain in jail.

Georgian Dream, in power since 2012, has broadly defended law enforcement's response to the demonstrations and accuses the opposition of trying to stage violent coups d'etat . The parties reject those charges as politically motivated.

This clampdown has run concurrently with a slate of prosecutions targeting ex-officials and associates of Ivanishvili, who briefly served as premier from 2012 to 2013.

Alongside Garibashvili, former State Security Service chief Grigol Liluashvili faces up to 15 years in a bribery case.

Georgia was once the former Soviet Union's most democratic and pro-Western successor state, but its ties with the West have soured since the 2022 start of the war in Ukraine over what the European Union casts as the country's authoritarian turn .

Garibashvili, who spent his career before politics working for Ivanishvili's businesses, helped engineer Georgia's anti-Western pivot, declaring in a speech in Slovakia in 2023 that NATO expansion was to blame for Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

The NATO member will buy unmanned systems including long-range attack drones, electronic warfare systems and surveillance drones as well as marine surveillance and minesweeping drones.

"No one knows what the next war will look like but one thing is clear, the future battle field will be characterised by unmanned systems and long-range capacity," Jonson said at Sweden's annual defence conference in Salen, northern Sweden.

"Anyone who doesn't understand that is going to be either dead or defeated. War is, as we know, a cruel teacher."

In addition, the government will invest 1.3 billion crowns in new military satellites, Jonson said.

European Union member Sweden, which joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in March 2024, has been ramping up permanent military spending since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

The Swedish government is also borrowing 300 billion crowns to speed up the acquisition of new equipment such as air defence systems, submarines and surface ships .

Sheinbaum said on X the two leaders discussed security with respect for Mexico's sovereignty, reducing drug trafficking, as well as trade and investment.

On Sunday, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke with Mexican Foreign Minister Juan Ramon de la Fuente about the need for stronger cooperation to dismantle Mexico's violent narco-terrorist networks and stop the trafficking of fentanyl and weapons, State Department spokesperson Tommy Pigott said in a statement.

Trump last week in remarks to Fox News said cartels were running Mexico and suggested the U.S. could strike land targets to combat them.

His comments were the latest in a series of escalating threats to deploy U.S. military force against drug cartels within Mexican territory.

Sheinbaum said in her post on X that "collaboration and cooperation within a framework of mutual respect always yield results."</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 14:56:27 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/EI4PK36HWBKVFL6ROLDPYCRYZA.jpg?auth=09116e109e6540a164114f6859e070b9f8014ce450be50dc3013ea9a260be3ff&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Germany's Klingbeil, on Powell probe, says central bank independence is 'clear line'</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/germanys-klingbeil-powell-probe-says-central-bank-independence-is-clear-line-2026-01-12/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 12 (Reuters) - German Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil on Monday said that central bank independence was a "clear line" for him, when asked about the U.S. Justice Department's probe into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.

"We in Germany attach great importance to the independence of central banks," Klingbeil said in Washington. "For me, as finance minister, this is a clear line."

President Donald Trump's administration has ramped up its pressure campaign on the Federal Reserve, threatening to indict Powell over comments to Congress about a building renovation project , an action Powell called a "pretext" to gain more influence over interest rates Trump wants cut dramatically.

The finance minister, who defined himself as "very transatlantic", said Germany is using every possibility to stay in dialogue with American partners but discussions are becoming more difficult and differences are getting larger.

"I believe it is bad for the world if Europe and the U.S. are divided from one another, and that is why I am here, to send a clear signal: We want cooperation, we want collaboration," said Klingbeil.

The German minister is in Washington for a meeting of finance ministers from the Group of Seven advanced economies, in which Australia, Mexico, South Korea and India will also participate.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 14:56:33 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/XKPQIT7RKBNXDOEQHRTJVOH5TQ.jpg?auth=971608fa20f9fefb57639917e6fee235f96c07fa00d5f872e5f1395fd82487ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Sweden to spend $440 million on unmanned military drone systems</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/sweden-spend-440-million-unmanned-military-drone-systems-2026-01-12/</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 14:57:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Mexico’s Sheinbaum says had 'good conversation' with Trump on security, drugs</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/mexicos-sheinbaum-says-had-good-conversation-with-trump-security-drugs-2026-01-12/</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 14:57:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Germany's Klingbeil, on Powell probe, says central bank independence is 'clear line'</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/germanys-klingbeil-powell-probe-says-central-bank-independence-is-clear-line-2026-01-12/</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 14:57:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Cuba's Diaz-Canel says there are no current talks with US after Trump threats</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260112-cuba-diaz-canel-says-there-are-no-current-talks-with-us-after-trump-threats</link><description>Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel said on Monday there are no talks with ​the United States government in ‍an apparent response to comments the day before by ​US President Donald Trump suggesting the ​two longtime rivals were in conversations.

Vincent Lemire was head of the French Research Centre in Jerusalem from 2019 to August 2023, before Palestinian militant group Hamas led an attack against Israel on October 7, 2023 , triggering an Israeli military response that has ravaged Gaza and killed more than 70,000 Palestinians in the besieged territory, according to the Gaza health ministry.

The academic, who specialises in the history of Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories, has since publicly spoken out about the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza and called for France to sanction Israel over the conflict's mounting death toll.

He was due to travel to Israel on Sunday with a two-year electronic travel authorisation for the country (ETA-IL) that he had previously obtained, but four days earlier, he received an email.

"Due to a change in circumstances in your case, the ETA-IL approval ... which was granted to you as of 27/02/2025 is revoked," it read, according to a screenshot Lemire sent AFP.

Contacted by AFP, the Israeli authorities did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

"My positions are not new, but I have never boycotted Israel. I have regularly issued invitations to Israeli academics and I have been going to Israel for 25 years, so I am very surprised," Lemire said.

"In terms of academic freedom, it's very problematic," said the researcher, who had planned some 20 meetings and seminars with Israeli and Palestinian researchers and students during his trip.

His ban comes after Israel at the start of the month banned 37 foreign humanitarian organisations from accessing the Gaza Strip after they refused to share lists of their Palestinian employees with government officials.

"As with the 37 NGOs banned from working in Gaza, it feels like we're in a dynamic of settling scores," said Lemire, who is trying to have the ban revoked.

Lemire and former Israeli ambassador to France Elie Barnavi in August urged President Emmanuel Macron in French daily newspaper Le Monde to slap sanctions on Israel to avoid having to recognise a "graveyard" as a Palestinian state.

Macron recognised Palestinian statehood in September, before a fragile ceasefire took hold in Gaza the following month.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 14:57:58 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/c0ee9462-efbd-11f0-b481-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/71ff0180ae3c0a249cf7dd2ecd1e967224be7409.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Exclusive: Pakistan and Indonesia closing in on jets and drones defence deal, sources say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/pakistan-indonesia-closing-jets-drones-defence-deal-sources-say-2026-01-12/</link><description>ISLAMABAD/JAKARTA Jan 12 (Reuters) - Indonesia's defence minister met Pakistan's air force chief in Islamabad to discuss a potential deal that includes the sale of combat jets and killer drones to Jakarta, three security officials with knowledge of the meeting on Monday said.

The talks come as Pakistan's defence industry moves forward with a series of defence procurement negotiations, including deals with Libya's National Army and Sudan's army , and looks to establish itself as a sizable regional player.

Indonesia's Defence Ministry confirmed the meeting between Defence Minister Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin and Pakistan's Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu.

"The meeting focused on discussing general defence cooperation relations, including strategic dialogue, strengthening communication between defence institutions, and opportunities for mutually beneficial cooperation in various fields in the long term," defence ministry spokesperson Brigadier General Rico Ricardo Sirait told Reuters, adding the talks had not yet led to concrete decisions.

One source said the talks revolved around the sale of JF-17 jets, a multi-role combat aircraft jointly developed by Pakistan and China, and killer drones designed for surveillance and striking targets. The other two sources said the talks were in an advanced stage and involved more than 40 JF-17 jets. One of them said Indonesia was also interested in Pakistan's Shahpar drones.

The sources did not share any discussions about delivery timelines and the number of years a proposed deal would span.

The Pakistani military's public relations wing did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

One additional security source with knowledge of military procurement talks said Pakistan was discussing the sale of JF-17 Thunder jets, air defence systems, training for junior, mid-level, and senior Indonesian air force officials, and engineering staff.

"The Indonesia deal is in the pipeline," retired Air Marshal Asim Suleiman, who remains briefed on air force deals, told Reuters, adding that the number of JF-17 jets involved was close to 40.

Indonesia's President Prabowo Subianto was in Pakistan last month for a two-day visit for talks on improving bilateral ties, including defence.

Indonesia has put in a slew of orders for jets in the past few years, including 42 French Rafale jets worth $8.1 billion in 2022 and 48 KAAN fighter jets from Turkey last year to strengthen its air force and replace its ageing air force fleet.

Jakarta has also considered buying China's J-10 fighter jets and is in talks to purchase U.S.-made F-15EX jets.

Interest in the Pakistani military's weapons development programme has surged since its jets were deployed in a short conflict with India last year.

The JF-17s have been at the centre of that growing attention, figuring in a deal with Azerbaijan and the $4 billion weapons pact with the Libyan National Army.

Pakistan is also eyeing a defence pact with Bangladesh that could include the Super Mushshak training jets and JF-17s, as ties improve with Dhaka.

Reuters has also reported that Islamabad was in talks with Riyadh for a defence deal that could be worth between $2 billion and $4 billion and involves the conversion of Saudi loans into military supplies.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 15:27:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/FSB4ZX6KHJMRZAHYKG7KFUVKX4.jpg?auth=7249ec8a02b59889ff68ca2ab1e378f001f6a6251c2607c1ef7e3a3018759c72&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Turkey cautions against foreign intervention in Iran</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/turkey-cautions-against-foreign-intervention-iran-2026-01-12/</link><description>ANKARA, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Turkey said on Monday that any foreign intervention in neighbouring Iran would lead to greater crises in the country and the region, and it called for U.S. and Iranian negotiations to resolve existing problems.

Iran is facing its biggest demonstrations since 2022 and U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to get involved if force is used against protesters.

NATO member Turkey does not wish to see chaos in Iran despite "certain problems within Iranian society and government", Omer Celik, spokesperson for Turkey's ruling AK Party, said.

"As Iranian President (Masoud) Pezeshkian has stated, these problems must be resolved through the internal dynamics of Iranian society and the national will of Iran," Celik told a press conference after a meeting of the ruling party.

"We believe that foreign intervention will lead to even worse consequences, and that intervention provoked by Israel in particular will lead to even greater crises."

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Saturday that Israel was closely monitoring the protests in Iran, adding: "We all hope that the Persian nation will soon be freed from the yoke of tyranny."

Trump and Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan have close personal ties.

Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan has said the protests, which evolved from complaints over dire economic hardships to defiant calls for the fall of the deeply entrenched clerical establishment, send a very strong message to Tehran.

"These demonstrations, stemming from genuine reasons and structural problems, are also being manipulated from abroad by Iran's rivals," Fidan told Turkish state broadcaster TRT on Friday.

"What we're trying to do... is to support an agreement with Iran that benefits both sides, primarily the Americans, because the stability of the region depends on it."

U.S.-based rights group HRANA said it had verified the deaths of 544 people and the arrests of 10,681 people since the protests began on December 28.

Ukraine and its European backers condemned the Russian missile strike on Friday, which they said was intended to intimidate the West in a week when European countries offered troops for a potential post-war reassurance force in Ukraine.

It was only the second time Russia has used the intermediate-range ballistic missile during the war. A Ukrainian official told Reuters the missile, capable of carrying nuclear weapons, was armed with inert dummy warheads and damaged a workshop at a state enterprise in Lviv, near the Polish border.

Russia's defence ministry said the Lviv State Aviation Repair Plant was disabled as a result of the strike, which it said hit production workshops and warehouses.

"This enterprise carried out repairs and maintenance of Ukrainian armed forces aviation equipment, including F-16 and MiG-29 aircraft transferred by Western countries," the ministry said.

"The company also produced long- and medium-range attack drones used to strike Russian civilian targets deep within Russian territory."

Russia said on Friday that the missile strike was a response to a Ukrainian attack on one of President Vladimir Putin's residences in northern Russia at the end of December. Kyiv has denied carrying out such an attack.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 15:27:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/YLTTQF4NEBLEDAJPACTBQQUE2U.jpg?auth=633c5465babb47e00b404b446d79a67fa5de7c0735473359b3f6b540e02501a8&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Greenland says it should be defended by NATO</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/greenland-says-it-will-boost-efforts-ensure-its-defence-is-supported-by-nato-2026-01-12/</link><description>STOCKHOLM, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Greenland's government said on Monday it will increase its efforts to ensure that the defence of the Arctic territory takes place under the auspices of NATO, and again rejected U.S. President Donald Trump's ambition to take over the island.

Trump has said the United States must own Greenland, an autonomous part of the Kingdom of Denmark , to prevent Russia or China occupying the strategically located and minerals-rich territory in the future.

"All NATO member states, including the United States, have a common interest in the defence of Greenland," the island's coalition government said in a statement.

The European Union's Commissioner for Defence and Space Andrius Kubilius warned on Monday that a U.S. military takeover of Greenland would be the end of NATO.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 15:27:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LAQWRRETSRNODJBYUKL4VYSNCQ.jpg?auth=2ca1f0b23dfb6f6bd803995ebcb8926472d40ab64bbecb8ba5e9f76f6f0f549d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Who is Zbigniew Ziobro, Poland's ex-justice minister given asylum by Hungary?</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/who-is-zbigniew-ziobro-polands-ex-justice-minister-given-asylum-by-hungary-2026-01-12/</link><description>WARSAW, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Zbigniew Ziobro, a former Polish justice minister who has been granted asylum in Hungary , is no stranger to conflict, regularly unleashing tirades against the "losers" and "softies" who opposed his judicial reforms or approach to the European Union.

However, the tough-talking, gun-carrying nationalist has observed the latest battle in his turbulent career from afar, choosing not to return to Poland to face 26 charges that include abuse of power and leading a criminal group.

Ziobro, 55, says he is the victim of a witch hunt waged by the pro-EU government of Prime Minister Donald Tusk, who has vowed to bring to justice members of the right-wing former Law and Justice (PiS) administration accused of wrongdoing.

The ex-minister, who denies any wrongdoing, has been preparing for a showdown ever since PiS lost power in 2023.

Then, in a fiery address to parliament, he taunted his opponents over a previous failed attempt to prosecute him for exceeding his authority during his first stint as justice minister in 2005-2007.

"I'm counting on you," he cried, addressing the benches of Tusk's Civic Coalition (KO). "I hope you won't turn out to be the same losers you were during the time of the State Tribunal!"

Prosecutors say Ziobro and several of his deputies misused millions of zlotys from a fund intended for victims of crime.

They say the cash went towards purchasing Pegasus spyware that was used against political opponents or buying everything from fire engines to equipment for country housewives' associations to curry favour with rural voters.

Ziobro does not deny that money from the fund went towards Pegasus, but says that this and all the other spending was in Poland's national interests. He accuses the KO government of seeking revenge because he had investigated suspected corruption among Tusk's associates.

Ziobro studied law at the prestigious Jagiellonian University in his native Krakow. He joined PiS at its inception in 2001 and rose to prominence during an inquiry into bribery allegations involving the centre-left government of the time.

His no-nonsense approach to sittings of the commission formed in 2003 to investigate the allegations gained him the nickname "the sheriff".

In 2006 the event that many political observers say had the biggest effect on him took place.

Ziobro's father Jerzy died after a heart operation and his family blamed the doctors involved. Now Poland's justice minister, he directly attacked surgeon Miroslaw Garlicki, telling reporters: "No one will ever again be deprived of life by this man."

Garlicki sued Ziobro and the minister was forced by a court to issue a public apology.

Critics said Ziobro sought to influence the investigation into his father's death and that his exasperation with judges who failed to pin responsibility on Garlicki fuelled his confrontational approach to a profession he said regarded itself as an "exceptional caste".

The judicial reforms he spearheaded when he returned as justice minister in 2015 were central to a conflict between Warsaw and Brussels over democratic standards that resulted in billions of euros in EU funds being withheld.

Critics said the changes politicised the process for appointing and disciplining judges.

Ziobro also combined the roles of prosecutor general and justice minister, a move critics said compromised prosecutors' independence. PiS said the reforms removed communist influence in the judicial system and improved efficiency.

The clashes with the EU caused disputes within government, especially between Ziobro and then-Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, who favoured a more conciliatory approach towards Brussels.

"In negotiations you can't be... a softy, you have to be tough," Ziobro said in 2020.

His decision to seek asylum in Hungary from the right-wing government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban - another long-term critic of the EU - prompted a senior minister in Tusk's administration, Tomasz Siemoniak, to say Ziobro was fleeing Polish justice "like a coward".

On the day the new parliament was sworn in in 2023, Ziobro was diagnosed with oesophageal cancer.

While a parliamentary commission in Warsaw examined his role in alleged wrongdoing relating to Pegasus spyware, Ziobro underwent multiple operations and chemotherapy in Belgium.

PiS leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski said putting a man in Ziobro's condition in prison would be "equivalent to a death sentence".

But Ziobro himself has remained typically combative.

"For using brutal and unlawful methods, members of Donald Tusk's regime currently ruling Poland will face severe consequences," he said in a post on X on Monday. "I will personally contribute to this fight."</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 15:28:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/YXO6ORA7ZVPN5H6S5HXTLRDK6Q.jpg?auth=ed5bd1ba687e8fffd23ebcff05922f07ea77943ad2386bd9168460ec9f1d0167&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>German military rocked by abuse reports as recruitment drive starts</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/german-military-rocked-by-abuse-reports-recruitment-drive-starts-2026-01-12/</link><description>BERLIN, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Germany's military has been rocked by reports of widespread sexual harassment and right-wing extremism in an elite paratroop unit, as an initiative begins to expand the armed forces with thousands of new recruits.

Extensive reporting by the weekly Der Spiegel and the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung in recent days of allegations of sexual harassment, the use of Nazi greetings and drug abuse have put pressure on the military's leadership, just as new measures begin to register 18-year-olds for military service.

The German military confirmed the reported abuse, which it said emerged last year after female soldiers from the 26th Parachute Regiment relayed their experiences to the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Armed Forces, the military ombudsman.

A spokesperson said extensive investigations had identified 55 suspects, of whom 19 would be dismissed from the armed forces, while 16 cases had been referred to prosecutors and a number of other disciplinary procedures instituted.

It said a package of measures had been introduced aimed at improving command structures, strengthening prevention and resilience and improving education and reinforcing values.

The latest case comes as authorities have begun registering 18-year-olds as part of a series of measures to increase the size of the serving military from around 182,000 uniformed troops to 255,000 to 270,000, with another 200,000 reservists.

Military service will not be compulsory, so long as recruitment targets are met, and the government is offering a range of inducements, including higher pay and training offers to boost interest among young people.

The military said it expected soldiers and civilian personnel to actively support Germany's democratic order and took consequential steps when this did not happen, including disciplinary and, where applicable, legal action.

"Our aspiration and goal is to protect the internal structures of the military and offer all members a secure environment within a solid community of values," the spokesperson said in an emailed statement.

According to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, female soldiers regularly reported being subject to abusive and degrading comments of a sexual nature and said numerous cases where soldiers used Nazi terms and expressions had also been reported.

Over the years, the German military has faced similar scandals, one of which almost saw its KSK special forces unit disbanded before the then-defence minister ruled that efforts to stamp out right-wing extremism in the unit were enough to ensure its survival.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 15:51:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/DLGNTKRE6BLVDGRVVSXIQI2PGE.jpg?auth=cbc908a0d06cce361352bd28f50bbcbe7486fec5bbcf54936b18d2952cd076c7&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Oscar predictions are on as voting for awards starts</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/oscar-predictions-are-on-as-voting-for-awards-starts</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 15:53:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/8ab78a8a-ef71-11f0-8726-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-12T034846Z-1432563267-HP1EM1C0AL7Q5-RTRMADP-3-AWARDS-GOLDEN-GLOBES.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Key French budget talks to resume as government faces two no-confidence motions</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/key-french-budget-talks-to-resume-as-government-faces-two-no-confidence-motions</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 15:53:17 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/1a12d66c-d73f-11f0-a546-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/000-87RQ2Z2.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump 'open' to meeting with Venezuelan interim leader a week after capture</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/trump-open-to-meeting-with-venezuelan-interim-leader-a-week-after-capture</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 15:53:19 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/9ae0873e-efc3-11f0-b094-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260112-143438-144129-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>What is Starlink, the satellite service Iranians use to post about the protests?</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/what-is-starlink-the-satellite-service-iranians-use-to-post-about-the-protests</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 15:53:21 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/a69de5d2-efc1-11f0-83f1-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260112-143236-143437-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>French government faces no-confidence motions despite Mercosur opposition</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/french-government-faces-no-confidence-motions-despite-mercosur-opposition</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 15:53:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/cf5f53cc-efc4-11f0-ab58-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260112-152506-152642-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Civilian casualties in Ukraine up sharply in 2025, UN monitor says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/civilian-casualties-ukraine-up-sharply-2025-un-monitor-says-2026-01-12/</link><description>ZURICH, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Last year was the deadliest for civilians in Ukraine since 2022, driven by intensified hostilities along the front line and the expanded use of long-range weapons, the U.N. Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine said on Monday.

Conflict-related violence in Ukraine killed 2,514 civilians and injured 12,142 in 2025, a 31% rise in the number of victims from 2024, the monitor said in a monthly update on civilian harm.

The vast majority of the casualties verified by the watchdog occurred in Ukrainian government-controlled territory from attacks launched by Russian armed forces, the statement added. Ukrainian officials generally cite the U.N. figures as accurate.

Increased efforts by Russian armed forces to capture territory in 2025 resulted in the killing and injuring of civilians, destruction of vital infrastructure, halting of essential services and new waves of displacement in frontline areas, the monitor said.

Almost two-thirds of all casualties last year occurred in frontline areas, with older persons particularly affected as they remained in their villages. Civilian casualties caused by short-range drones also increased sharply, it added.

"The expanded use of short-range drones has rendered many areas near the frontline effectively uninhabitable," said Danielle Bell, head of the monitoring mission.

"In 2025, many people who had endured years of hostilities were ultimately compelled to leave their homes."

Hundreds of thousands of soldiers on both sides are believed to have been injured or killed in Europe's deadliest war since World War Two, although neither side releases full figures.

Thousands of Ukrainian civilians have been killed, particularly in 2022, the war's first year, during a long Russian siege of the port of Mariupol and assaults on cities before the front line hardened in place.

Since then, Moscow has continued to use missiles and drones to strike cities across Ukraine. Russia denies deliberately targeting civilians, but says its attacks on Ukrainian civil infrastructure are justified because it hinders the war effort. Ukraine also targets civil infrastructure in Russia and Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine, though on a far smaller scale.

The U.N. statement said an increase in the use of long-range weapons by the Russian armed forces starting in June 2025 also caused an increase in civilian harm in urban centres across Ukraine.

"The sharp increase in long-range attacks and the targeting of Ukraine's national energy infrastructure mean that the consequences of the war are now felt by civilians far beyond the frontline," Bell said.

Russian authorities reported that attacks by Ukrainian armed forces killed 253 civilians and injured 1,872 in the Russian Federation last year, the monitor said. Due to lack of access and limited publicly available information, the watchdog could not verify these numbers, it added.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 16:28:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/UTNLS3RWKNNC5LSVOIB43QANP4.jpg?auth=1addd758168aa3edf048dc27bb03934cc403346d2e8ac2ff3e28333172c991c4&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Nigeria reopens some schools in the north, defying threats of kidnap</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/nigeria-reopens-some-schools-north-defying-threats-kidnap-2026-01-12/</link><description>MAIDUGURI, Nigeria, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Schools across parts of northern Nigeria started reopening on Monday, after months of closure triggered by the abduction of hundreds of students in November.

The abductions last year had underlined the vulnerability of education facilities in a region plagued by criminal gangs and Islamist insurgents.

Schools resumed academic activities this term after the federal government said in a circular last month that enhanced security measures had created a safer environment for students to return. It did not provide details.

In northern Kaduna state, a 17-year-old student said it was difficult for her to return to school after two months away.

"What I love most about our school is being together at lunchtime and spending time with my teachers and friends. I miss it so much," she said at her home before leaving for Federal Government College boarding school in the state.

Her father, Haruna Danjuma, said the decision to return his daughter to school was difficult, but fear of kidnapping should not deprive children of their right to education.

“A child is a gift from Almighty Allah, and it is my responsibility to educate her,” he said. “But it is the responsibility of government to secure the children.”

In Niger State, central Nigeria, where more than 300 students and staff were abducted in November, a majority of the schools remained shut for security reasons, state officials said.

Saint Mary’s Catholic School in the Papiri hamlet was among those that would not reopen yet, the Christian Association of Nigeria said, citing a statement from the state government directing areas facing security challenges to remain closed until further notice.

Explaining the continued closure of schools, Niger commissioner for education Hadiza Mohammed said "the safety of students, teachers, and school communities remains paramount."</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 16:28:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/3L3KYLG44FOB7ME5OEK2UNC7TA.jpg?auth=e8a9b8645a2e5f66d6b9534528a07514b85ccbf6fed8d412ee191a2fe6b22630&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran's traders, frustrated by economic losses, turn against clerics</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/irans-traders-frustrated-by-economic-losses-turn-against-clerics-2026-01-12/</link><description>DUBAI, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Iran's bazaar merchants, the trader class who were the financial backbone of the 1979 Islamic Revolution, have turned against the clerics they helped bring to power, fuelling unrest over an economy that has morphed into full-blown anti-government protests .

Frustration among bazaar merchants, from small-scale shopkeepers to large wholesale traders, has grown as their political and economic clout in Iran has diminished over the decades while the elite Revolutionary Guards have tightened their grip on the economy, building sprawling and tightly held networks of power.

"We are struggling. We cannot import goods because of U.S. sanctions and because only the Guards or those linked to them control the economy. They only think about their own benefits," said a trader at Tehran’s centuries-old Grand Bazaar, speaking on condition of anonymity.

The wave of protests that has engulfed the country, posing one of the toughest challenges ever to the clerical leadership, erupted in late December in Tehran's Grand Bazaar, where hundreds of shopkeepers denounced the sharp fall in the rial currency.

The demonstrations quickly swelled and turned political, challenging the Islamic Republic's legitimacy. Protesters burned images of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and chanted "Death to the dictator" - undeterred by security forces armed with tear gas, batons, and, in many cases, live ammunition.

Iran’s rulers, while acknowledging economic difficulties, have blamed their longtime foes the U.S. and Israel for fomenting the unrest. They appear intent on holding onto power at any cost, backed by a security apparatus refined over decades of suppressing ethnic revolts, student movements, and protests over economic hardship and social freedoms.

A combination of international sanctions and the Guards' sprawling economic empire has limited the government's ability to ease the dire economic situation.

Tehran-based analyst Saeed Laylaz said the government has lost control over the situation.

"What is striking is that the unrest began in the bazaar. For merchants, the core issue isn’t inflation - it’s price volatility, which leaves them unable to decide whether to buy or sell," he said.

Economic disparities between ordinary Iranians and the clerical and security elite, along with economic mismanagement and state corruption - reported even by state media - have fanned discontent at a time when inflation is pushing the price of many goods beyond the means of most people.

Iran's rial currency has lost nearly half its value against the dollar in 2025, with official inflation reaching 42.5% in December.

Created by the Islamic Republic's late founder Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the Guards first secured an economic foothold after the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s, when clerical rulers allowed them to invest in leading Iranian industries.

Their influence expanded exponentially over decades, benefiting from Khamenei's full backing and from opportunities created by Western sanctions, which effectively excluded Iran from the global financial and trading system.

The Guards now control vast sectors of the economy, from oil to transportation, communications, and construction.

Another trader said the crisis was not over, as the Guards have long proved adept at defending their economic interests.

"The government wants to resolve the problem, but it lacks the means and power in this system. The economy is not controlled by the government," said the trader, a 62-year-old carpet seller in Tehran.

All aspects of the country's sanctions-hit oil business have come under the growing influence of the Guards - from the shadow fleet of tankers that secretly ship sanctioned crude, to logistics and front companies selling the oil, mostly to China.

"No one knows how much of the oil money that the Guards get from selling Iran’s oil returns to the country ... they are too powerful to be questioned about it,” said a senior Iranian official, who asked not to be named.

During his 2013–2021 presidency, pragmatist Hassan Rouhani repeatedly clashed with the Guards, accusing them publicly of resisting budget cuts, while his attempts to curb their commercial networks and assets were largely frustrated.

Even as it has relinquished economic power, the clerical establishment has relied on its loyal forces - the Guards and its affiliated Basij paramilitary - to violently crush ethnic uprisings, student unrest, and protests over economic hardship, preserving the political order.

"Given the sensitive circumstances when the country faces foreign threats, Khamenei cannot upset the Guards by curbing their economic influence. The establishment needs them to quell the protests and confront foreign threats," said an insider, close to Rouhani.

U.S.-based rights group HRANA said it had verified the deaths of 544 people - 496 protesters and 48 security personnel - with 10,681 people arrested since the protests began on December 28 and spread around the country. Reuters was unable to independently verify the tallies.

The authorities have not given numbers of casualties, but officials say many members of the security forces have been killed by "terrorists and rioters" linked to foreign foes, including the U.S. States and Israel.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 16:28:49 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/VFBEXTWBJVOF3HW7ELSTFH5RUA.jpg?auth=c92566d658da40d35fc2c293d32644ff52d8dbff10f2e1a6040e3d2f4240acc6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia says hypersonic Oreshnik missile hit Ukrainian aircraft repair plant</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260112-russia-says-hypersonic-oreshnik-missile-hit-ukrainian-aircraft-repair-plant</link><description>Russia 's defence ‍ministry said on ​Monday that the target it hit last week in ⁠ a strike with a hypersonic Oreshnik missile was a Ukrainian aircraft repair plant, which was disabled.

Ukraine and its European backers ​condemned the Russian missile strike on Friday, which ‍they said was intended to intimidate the West in a week when ​European countries offered troops for a potential post-war reassurance ​force in Ukraine.

It was only the second time Russia has used the intermediate-range ballistic missile during the war. Russian President Vladimir Putin has claimed that Oreshnik, an intermediate-range missile that can reach targets between 3,000 and 5,500 kilometres away, is "impossible" to intercept by modern air defences.

A Ukrainian official said the missile, capable of carrying nuclear weapons , was armed with inert dummy warheads and damaged a workshop at a state ‍enterprise in Lviv, near the Polish border.

Russia's defence ministry said the ​Lviv State Aviation Repair Plant was disabled as a result of the strike, which it said hit production workshops and ‌warehouses.

"This enterprise carried out repairs and maintenance of Ukrainian armed forces aviation equipment, including ‍F-16 and MiG-29 aircraft transferred by Western countries," the ministry said.

"The company also produced long- and medium-range attack drones used to strike Russian civilian targets deep within Russian territory."

Asked about Russia's claim on Monday, Ukrainian air force spokesman Yuriy Ignat said: "We never comment on where the hit was."

Russia said on Friday that the missile strike was a response to a Ukrainian attack ‍on one of Putin's residences in northern Russia at the ‌end of ​December. Kyiv has denied carrying out such an attack.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 16:29:44 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/dda1178a-efca-11f0-9345-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-09T122853Z-1900863677-RC2OXIAKTPKB-RTRMADP-3-UKRAINE-CRISIS-ORESHNIK-SBU.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia's Shoigu talks with Iran Security Chief, condemns foreign interference, Interfax reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/russias-shoigu-talks-with-iran-security-chief-condemns-foreign-interference-2026-01-12/</link><description>MOSCOW, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Sergei Shoigu, Secretary of Russia's Security Council, held a telephone conversation with the Secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, Interfax reported on Monday.

The judicial overhaul separating the career paths of prosecutors and judges is a flagship reform of Meloni's right-wing coalition and faces fierce opposition from magistrates and the centre-left opposition.

The government, which has accused magistrates of undue interference in areas from public works to immigration, says the move is necessary to prevent conflict of interest between the two groups and prevent political bias.

Recent polls show Italians split on an issue that has roiled domestic politics for decades.

The judiciary has accused the government of seeking control over prosecutors to dictate which crimes they can and cannot investigate -- a charge the centre-left opposition has echoed.

Last week, Meloni dismissed media speculation that the government might seek to capitalise on a successful referendum campaign by calling early general elections, and said she would not resign in the event of a defeat.

The justice reform was approved by parliament in October but must go to a referendum before becoming law because it entails a change to the constitution.

Currently, magistrates enter the legal profession through a single exam and can switch between roles throughout their careers.

Under the reform, candidates must choose at the outset whether to become a judge or prosecutor, with no possibility of changing.

The council which oversees appointments and disciplinary matters would be split into two separate self-governing bodies, with members selected by lottery rather than election, a change aimed at preventing lobby groups from gaining the upper hand.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 16:58:49 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/A6BPJZS4SFOKRG47DH4JPGANUA.jpg?auth=9c7eb750d88ce5faaae0b8f59649c3b4c7ac55cd08d1c5be574f9d05b19513e9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Italy to hold referendum on judicial reform on March 22-23</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/italy-hold-referendum-judicial-reform-march-22-23-2026-01-12/</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 16:59:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>French far-right leader Marine Le Pen faces high-stakes trial ahead of presidential race</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260112-french-far-right-leader-marine-le-pen-faces-high-stakes-trial-ahead-of-presidential-race</link><description>Marine Le Pen is set to learn her political fate. Her appeal trial , opening in Paris on Tuesday and set to run for a month, could dash her hopes of standing in the 2027 presidential election, for which she is currently the frontrunner.

The case centres on the long-running scandal over fictitious National Rally (RN) party assistants at the European Parliament . In March 2025, Le Pen was sentenced to four years in prison – including two years in custody – fined €100,000, and given a five-year ban from public office with immediate effect.

If the Paris appeal court upholds the ruling, it would send shockwaves through the far-right RN party, which has led opinion polls for several months.

In the first ruling, judges found the three-time presidential candidate (2012, 2017 and 2022) guilty, along with 24 former MEPs, parliamentary assistants, an accountant, and the National Rally as a legal entity, of operating a “system” between 2004 and 2016 using European Parliament funds to pay party employees.

The Paris criminal court assessed the financial damage to the European Parliament at €3.2 million, after deducting €1.1 million that had already been reimbursed by some of the defendants.

Only 12 of those convicted in March 2025, along with the party itself, have appealed. They include Perpignan Mayor Louis Aliot, MP Julien Odoul, MEP Nicolas Bay, and senior party figures Wallerand de Saint-Just and Bruno Gollnisch.

Judges ruled that the case did not stem from “administrative errors” or confusion over European rules but amounted to “embezzlement as part of a system designed to reduce the party’s operating costs”.

As in the first trial, Le Pen plans to plead her innocence on appeal and to argue that the case is politically motivated, aimed at preventing her from running for president.

“The trial judge wrote that the goal was not only to stop me from running but also from being elected,” Le Pen told the economic weekly La Tribune Dimanche on December 28. “There was a time when people were shot. Today, you are shot judicially. It means political death.”

Since the verdict was handed down, Presiding Judge Bénédicte de Perthuis has received death threats and been placed under police protection.

In its ruling, the court cited Le Pen’s refusal to acknowledge the facts, the seriousness of the offences and the risk of reoffending to justify the sentence's severity.

The judges also defended the immediate enforcement of her ban from office, saying it was necessary to ensure that elected officials “do not benefit from preferential treatment incompatible with public trust in political life”.

In December, Germany’s Der Spiegel reported that Washington had considered imposing sanctions on the judges who convicted Le Pen. US President Donald Trump had previously criticised the ruling, calling for Le Pen’s “liberation” and dismissing the case as a “witch hunt”.

“If such actions were confirmed or implemented, they would constitute unacceptable and intolerable interference in our country’s internal affairs,” said Peimane Ghaleh-Marzban, president of the Paris criminal court, on January 6.

He pointed to recent US sanctions targeting judges abroad, including a French judge at the International Criminal Court involved in the arrest warrant against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu .

France’s top prosecutor, Rémy Heitz, later played down the claims, saying there was “nothing tangible” at this stage to suggest interference in the appeal proceedings and dismissing the reports as “press rumours”.

The US State Department also denied the allegations, with Under Secretary Sarah B. Rogers calling the reported leak “stale and false”.

The RN dismissed what it described as a “rumour spread by a hostile media outlet”, arguing that the Paris court president’s remarks risked giving credibility to a “fake news story” and amounted to undue pressure on appeal judges.

The appeal court’s decision is expected by the summer of 2026. If Le Pen is acquitted, she would be free to run in the 2027 presidential election. If the conviction and ban are upheld, she will be barred from standing.

She could still take the case to the Court of Cassation, France's highest court. Its president, Christophe Soulard, has said the court would aim, “if possible”, to rule before the presidential election.

A third scenario is possible: Le Pen could be convicted again but without a ban from office, or with a shorter period of ineligibility. She would then be legally able to run but politically weakened by a criminal conviction.

In that case, pressure could grow for her to step aside in favour of National Rally president Jordan Bardella , 30, who is increasingly viewed as a leading contender for 2027. A poll published in late November put Bardella ahead of all potential rivals in a hypothetical presidential race.

Rainfall levels so far this winter are up 95% from a year earlier and 17% above the seasonal average, Baraka told members of parliament.

The average dam-filling rate has risen to 46%, with several key reservoirs now at full capacity, official data showed.

The rainfal has provided relief to the agricultural sector after years of water restrictions.

Seven years of drought had depleted Morocco's dams, cut the wheat harvest, reduced the national cattle herd, caused heavy job losses in farming and pushed the country to accelerate its desalination plans.

Morocco aims to supply 60% of its drinking water from treated seawater by 2030, up from a previous 25%, while leaving dam water for the inner regions of the country, Baraka told Reuters in December.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 17:26:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/TYD7LWL45NMVPH26ISD6USZIUY.jpg?auth=66b12d0ccb1a86e53cf4517fe2702da9a0c4b5204872b8160ca8f1fcb3616817&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Moldova's President Sandu says she would vote to join Romania</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/moldovas-president-sandu-says-she-would-vote-join-romania-2026-01-12/</link><description>CHISINAU, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Moldovan President Maia Sandu has said she would vote in favour of unification with neighbouring European Union and NATO member Romania if a referendum were to take place to help protect its fragile democracy against Russian pressure.

Sandu, whose pro-EU ruling party won a new mandate last September, has repeatedly accused Russia of meddling in Moldova, a former Soviet republic of around 2.4 million with a Romanian-speaking majority and a Russian-speaking minority.

"If we have a referendum, I would vote for the unification with Romania," she said in an interview for the British podcast 'The Rest is Politics', broadcast on Sunday.

"Look at what is happening in the world. It is getting more and more difficult for a small country like Moldova to survive as a democracy, as a sovereign country, and of course to resist Russia."

Around 1.5 million Moldovans hold Romanian citizenship, but recent polls have shown that only around one-third support reunification with Bucharest.

Sandu said she recognised most Moldovans do not support her position, adding that EU integration was a "more realistic objective".

Her government has set its sights on joining the EU by 2030 but will have to implement difficult reforms in the face of opposition from Russia. Moldova's pro-Russian Socialists were in power as recently as 2020.

Moldova, which also borders Ukraine, was part of Romania in the interwar period but was annexed by the Soviet Union during World War Two. It gained its independence in 1991 as the Soviet Union collapsed.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 17:26:21 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CGWEOYAGXFIIPKRVHCMEF2Y6PQ.jpg?auth=2747a4af8b0c1ca8db01e2214be4e4ef8a80c8355c21cf8c48733f61df516934&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russian drones hit two foreign vessels near Ukraine's port, source says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-drones-hit-two-foreign-vessels-near-ukraines-port-source-says-2026-01-12/</link><description>KYIV, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Russian drones on Monday hit two foreign-flagged vessels near Ukraine's southern port of Chornomorsk, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters.

The FRANCE 24 Observers team in Paris has verified videos showing dozens of bodies accumulating at a morgue in Kahrizak, a suburb south of Tehran, as families attempt to find and identify their loved ones.

Medical sources say that hundreds of bodies are currently at the morgue.

Protests that began on December 28, 2025, following the collapse of the Iranian rial have been violently repressed by the regime of the Islamic Republic. The regime has put in place a total ban on internet and cellphone communications.

A nurse at a hospital in northern Iran told the Observers team on Sunday:

“We have received around 50 bodies at our hospital. Most had been killed by shots to the head.

There are many injured people, and the hospital has no capacity to treat them all. We cannot even call in surgeons; there is no connection to do so.

A colleague of mine at another hospital counted 18 bodies in their morgue yesterday.”

According to the Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA), at least 538 people have died since the demonstrations began. But the real toll could be much higher.

A resident of Tehran sent us this account:

“They shot at people and even ran people over with anti-riot vehicles. There was blood everywhere. The streets were covered in people’s blood, and we had to run through it to escape. My shoes are soaked in blood.

We were running away when suddenly a member of the security forces put a gun to my friend’s temple and screamed, ‘What the f*** are you doing here? Get lost.’ For a second, I thought he was going to kill him. Fortunately, he didn’t, and we just ran.”

She said she told Trump that any US troop deployment in Mexico was "not on the table".

"We spoke about various topics, including security with respect for our sovereignties, reducing drug trafficking , trade, and investments," Sheinbaum said on social media.

Trump again said last week that land attacks against drug cartels would follow recent US maritime operations in the Pacific and Caribbean, without specifying where or when.

Mexico extradited dozens of cartel leaders to the United States in 2025 and reinforced border cooperation, but Sheinbaum has repeatedly voiced opposition to any military intervention from outside.

Trump recently told Mexico it had to "get their act together" following months of pressure over drugs and trade on the United States' southern neighbour.

He said Sheinbaum – whom he met in Washington in December – was a "terrific person" but added he was pushing her to let him send US troops to tackle drug cartels in Mexico, an offer he said she has previously rebuffed.

Sheinbaum said at her press conference ‍that fentanyl trafficking from Mexico to the United States had fallen by about 50 percent over the past year.

Since US troops seized Venezuela 's President Nicolas Maduro from Caracas, Trump has also made threats against other leftist governments in the region , including Cuba , Colombia and Mexico.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 17:26:44 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/e165da20-efd1-11f0-afc0-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25332538038143.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Sweden makes record three-ton seizure of cocaine from South America</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/sweden-makes-record-three-ton-seizure-cocaine-south-america-2026-01-12/</link><description>Jan 12 (Reuters) - Sweden on Monday confiscated an estimated three metric tons of cocaine, the country's single-biggest seizure of the drug, in the port of southwestern city Helsingborg, daily Sydsvenskan reported, citing customs.

"The ‍stakes are too high to look the other way: if the Federal ​Reserve loses its independence, the stability of our markets ​and the broader economy will suffer," Murkowski wrote on X.

Murkowski is one of a small handful of Trump's fellow Republicans who have shown themselves willing to vote against his wishes at times in the Senate, where his party holds a 53-47 majority.

The Alaska lawmaker said she had spoken earlier on Monday with ‍Powell, who on Sunday said the US central bank had received subpoenas last week that he called "retaliation" for the Fed's basing interest rates on policy rather than Trump's preferences.

Murkowski called the DOJ threat "nothing more than an attempt at coercion", adding ‍that Congress should investigate the department if it believes probing the Fed ‌was ​warranted over renovation cost overruns, which she called "not unusual".

Since ‍returning to office last year, Trump has been increasingly publicly pressuring the Fed ​to cut interest rates , breaking with long-standing practice meant to insulate the central bank from political pressure and allowing ‌it to focus on economic data.

Trump has repeatedly attacked Powell for not cutting its short-term interest rate, and even threatened to fire him. Powell’s caution has infuriated Trump, who has demanded the Fed cut borrowing costs to spur the economy and reduce the interest rates the federal government pays on its debt. That anger has not subsided even after the Fed cut interest rates in three of the final four months of 2025.

Powell said in his statement that "the threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the president".

Murkowski's statement came as every living former US central bank chief issued a joint criticism of the criminal probe into Powell, saying that the Justice Department's move had "no place" in the country.

"The reported criminal inquiry into Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell is an unprecedented attempt to use prosecutorial attacks to undermine that independence," said the statement, which was also signed by other former US economic leaders.

The extent of the revocations reflects the broad immigration crackdown initiated when Trump returned to the White House last year, deporting an unprecedented number of migrants including some who held valid visas. The administration has also adopted a stricter policy on granting visas, with tightened social media vetting and expanded screening.

"The State Department has now revoked over 100,000 visas, including some 8,000 student visas and 2,500 specialized visas for individuals who had encounters with U.S. law enforcement for criminal activity. We will continue to deport these thugs to keep America safe," the department said in a post on X.

The four leading causes for revocations were overstays, driving under the influence, assault and theft, State Department deputy spokesperson Tommy Pigott said. The revocations marked a 150% increase from 2024, he added.

The State Department has also launched a Continuous Vetting Center aimed at ensuring "all foreign nationals on American soil comply with our laws — and that the visas of those who pose a threat to American citizens are swiftly revoked," Pigott said.

In November, the State Department said it had revoked around 80,000 non-immigrant visas since Trump's inauguration on January 20, 2025, for offenses ranging from driving under the influence to assault and theft.

Directives from the State Department this year have ordered U.S. diplomats abroad to be vigilant against any applicants whom Washington may see as hostile to the U.S. and who have a history of political activism.

Trump administration officials have said that student visa holders and lawful permanent residents with "green cards" are subject to deportation over their support for Palestinians and criticism of Israel's conduct in the war in Gaza, calling their actions a threat to U.S. foreign policy and accusing them of being pro-Hamas.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 18:34:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/Z5AQP7OCTJJ53IFYJQQ3SN4QFU.jpg?auth=3ebaf715cd02c51b1add5aaf0eb5b1d09058f6fee123f09414dd62c5917fd267&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump to meet Venezuela's Machado on Thursday, White House official says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/trump-meet-venezuelas-machado-thursday-white-house-official-says-2026-01-12/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 12 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump will meet with Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado on Thursday, a White House official said on Monday.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 18:35:26 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ZSNHRB54BROSTFF4R4H5DS77RU.jpg?auth=3abbc1246e45e87262c2e5b24dcdd0a7b2ff31822340a1e53a93f254ab34ac5a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Supertankers that would pick up debt-paying Venezuelan oil cargoes for China make u-turn -ship data</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/supertankers-that-would-pick-up-debt-paying-venezuelan-oil-cargoes-china-make-u-2026-01-12/</link><description>HOUSTON, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Two China-flagged supertankers that were sailing to Venezuela to pick up debt-paying crude cargoes amid the U.S. oil embargo on the OPEC country have made u-turn and are now heading back to Asia, LSEG shipping data showed on Monday.

Following the U.S. announcement last week of a $2 billion deal to export up to 50 million barrels of Venezuelan oil stuck in storage, U.S. president Donald Trump said China would not be deprived of Venezuela's crude.

But the Asian country, the first market of the South American nation's oil, has not received any cargoes since last month as Washington says the embargo remains in force.

The very large crude carriers Xingye and Thousand Sunny had remained anchored in the Atlantic Ocean for weeks, waiting for directions amid the blockade and Venezuela's political crisis, triggered by the U.S. capture of President Nicolas Maduro.

The vessels are part of a group of three supertankers that only cover the Venezuela-China route to carry crude that pays Venezuela's debt service to the Asian country.

The loans that are part of Venezuela's overall debt to China, which used to be its first lender. Shortly after Venezuela was put under U.S. energy sanctions in 2019, China granted a grace period to receive capital payments and negotiated a temporary deal with Caracas so debt service would be compensated with crude cargoes.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 18:35:54 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Former Corsican separatist leader Orsoni shot dead at mother's funeral</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/former-corsican-separatist-leader-orsoni-shot-dead-mothers-funeral-2026-01-12/</link><description>PARIS, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Former Corsican separatist leader Alain Orsoni was shot dead during his mother's funeral on Monday in Vero, a village 30 km (18.6 miles) east of Ajaccio, the capital of the Mediterranean French island, the city's public prosecutor said.

"He was hit by a long-range shot," prosecutor Nicolas Septe, told Reuters. Local police confirmed the assassination.

Orsoni, 71, led a separatist movement called the Corsican Movement for Self-Determination, which French police considered to be the legal front for the armed group, the Corsican National Liberation Front-Traditional Wing.

Authorities linked the Corsican National Liberation Front-Traditional Wing to a series of attacks on the island in the 1990s, some of which the group claimed.

Orsoni was also charged, convicted and later pardoned in connection with a machine gun attack on the Iranian embassy in Paris in 1980.

Orsoni was also the president of Corsican soccer club AC Ajaccio in the late 2000s and early 2010s.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 19:21:10 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iranians tap Musk's Starlink to skirt internet blackout, sources say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/iranians-tap-musks-starlink-skirt-internet-blackout-sources-say-2026-01-12/</link><description>Jan 12 (Reuters) - Some Iranians are still using Elon Musk’s Starlink satellite internet service despite a nationwide communications blackout, three people inside the country said, the latest example of Starlink being used to counter internet shutdowns in geopolitical flashpoints.

Iranian authorities have in recent days launched a deadly crackdown on nationwide protests , including the near-complete shutdown of internet service, which is provided through fiber-optic cables and cellphone towers.

But Starlink, which beams its service directly from thousands of low-earth orbit satellites, is still working in some places in Iran , despite being banned by authorities there, three people using Starlink in the country told Reuters. One of them, in Western Iran, said he knew dozens of people using Starlink and that users in border towns and cities were largely unaffected.

Alp Toker, founder of internet monitoring group NetBlocks, said he has heard from people in the region that there is still some Starlink access in Iran, though service appears reduced.

“It is patchy, but still there,” he said.

While it’s not clear how Starlink’s service was being disrupted in Iran, some specialists said it could be the result of jamming of Starlink terminals that would overpower their ability to receive signals from the satellites.

Starlink, which is part of privately held U.S. company SpaceX, didn't respond to requests for comment. Authorities in Iran could not be reached on Monday, amid phone and internet outages. Iranian authorities have blamed the unrest on terrorists and vowed to safeguard the governing system.

The communication lifeline Starlink has provided for some protesters in Iran is the latest sign of the influence Musk and his satellite internet service have in global conflicts and unrest around the world.

Starlink has been a critical tool for Ukrainian forces since Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022. In Myanmar , where the military junta has imposed repeated internet shutdowns, rebel groups, aid organizations and medics have used Starlink for communications. In Sudan , Starlink has also been used by both sides in a years-long civil war due to prolonged blackouts.

U.S. President Donald Trump said on Sunday he plans to speak with Musk about restoring internet in Iran , without mentioning Starlink.

Musk previously shipped free Starlink terminals, which are slightly larger than a laptop, to Ukraine and offered free internet service there. Standard Starlink terminals cost around $599, plus a monthly service fee, making it unaffordable for many Iranians.

Musk's ability to tip the balance in global conflicts was demonstrated when he shut down Starlink as Ukraine retook territory from Russia in 2022, Reuters previously reported .

Starlink isn't licensed to operate in Iran, but Musk has previously said that the service is active there. In December 2022, he posted on his social media platform X that the company was “approaching 100 Starlinks active in Iran," a modest figure given Iran's population of 92 million.

In June last year, in response to a post on X calling for him to provide Starlink access to Iran, Musk posted “beams are on.”

Following the 12-day war between Iran and Israel in June, Iran’s parliament passed a law formally banning the use of Starlink, introducing severe penalties for those who use or distribute the unlicensed technology, according to Iranian state media.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 20:25:54 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/YWUDLBVX5RKQZNGRXZMHBTKFSE.jpg?auth=1258bb9b3eaaa7737fd109082555de36f684aaf7c1db3dfe45e89ce0cdc9c8b7&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Two Canadian members of parliament end Taiwan trip ahead of Carney's China visit</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/two-canadian-members-parliament-end-taiwan-trip-ahead-carneys-china-visit-2026-01-12/</link><description>TORONTO, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Two Canadian Members of Parliament are ending a trip to Taiwan early this week ahead of Prime Minister Mark Carney's visit to China, they said in a statement on Monday.

Helena Jaczek and Marie-France Lalonde, who are both members of Carney's Liberal Party, said they had been pleased to work with members of all political parties on the delegation.

"As this portion of the visit concludes, informed by advice from the government, we are returning home," their statement said. "It's important that we avoid confusion with Canada's foreign policy, given the overlap with the Prime Minister's engagement in Beijing, which was only confirmed last week."

They said Canada’s position on Taiwan has not changed. The Globe and Mail newspaper reported three Conservative members of parliament remained in Taiwan on a trip sponsored by Taiwan's government.

Carney's office said the focus this week is on the prime minister's meetings in China. The Conservative Party did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

China, which claims Taiwan as its own territory, has not ruled out using force to bring the island under its control. Taiwan rejects China's claims.

Carney is trying to diversify Canada's exports away from its main market, the United States, as Canada faces uncertain trade policy from U.S. President Donald Trump .

The China visit aims to increase engagement on trade, energy, agriculture and international security, Carney's office said. China is Canada's second-biggest trading partner.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 20:27:27 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/YSRQTV3SFBN4XPG4OGREZRYXZQ.jpg?auth=81ef2047597374a25843ba47fb54eba57365aa3509c85c5edd7d41b53fa7f7a9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US charges man shot by Border Patrol agent in Portland</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-charges-man-shot-by-border-patrol-agent-portland-2026-01-12/</link><description>Jan 12 (Reuters) - The Venezuelan man shot by a border patrol agent last week in Portland, Oregon, was charged on Monday with assaulting federal officers, the U.S. Justice Department said.

The department said Luis Nino-Moncada will make a court appearance on Monday to face charges of aggravated assault of a federal officer and depredation of federal property. It said he repeatedly rammed his car into agents' vacant vehicle.

The Portland shooting came amid heightened tensions over President Donald Trump's aggressive mass deportation efforts after an ICE immigration agent shot and killed a woman in Minneapolis , Minnesota last week.

Authorities said Nino-Moncada, who was shot in the arm and is in FBI custody, has ties to Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua and is in the U.S. illegally.

The border patrol agent shot him and a woman in the car out of fear that Nino-Moncada "could strike them and other Border Patrol agents with the target vehicle," the Justice Department said.

The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees the border patrol, said last week Nino-Moncada "weaponized" his car.

The woman was identified by DHS as Yorlenys Betzabeth Zambrano-Contreras, who federal officials say was also in the U.S. illegally. She was shot in the chest.

The Justice Department alleges that she also has ties to the Venezuelan gang, was involved in prostitution and was previously involved in a shooting in Portland.

After the shooting, the pair fled in their vehicle, driving about two miles northeast before calling for medical help.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 20:27:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ZJFBL6DHDVI4VOTQRXUQ4EATVM.jpg?auth=9b81860a562504fd85ec18e1a5336fd6f938c2d07fe20bb747a8b8cdf55978bb&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US charges man shot by Border Patrol agent in Portland</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-charges-man-shot-by-border-patrol-agent-portland-2026-01-12/</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 20:27:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Ukraine's Zelenskiy: world must help Iran engineer change</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/ukraines-zelenskiy-world-must-help-iran-engineer-change-2026-01-12/</link><description>Jan 12 (Reuters) - Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Monday that the world had to help Iranians build on protests to engineer change to free them from rule that brought evil to their own and other countries, including Ukraine.

Zelenskiy, speaking in his nightly video address, described the nationwide protests gripping Iran as an "uprising".

He said the unrest showed that Russia had to rethink its close links with Iran, which have included its wide use of Iranian-made "Shahed" drones in the nearly four-year-old war against Kyiv.

"Every normal person on Earth very much wants the people of Iran to finally be fortunate enough to free themselves from the regime that exists there and that has brought so much evil, including to Ukraine and to other countries," Zelenskiy said.

"It is important that the world not miss this moment, when change is possible. Every leader, every country, international organisations must engage now and help people remove those who are responsible for Iran unfortunately being what it has been."

U.S.-based rights group HRANA said it had verified the deaths of 572 people and the arrests of more than 10,000 in protests which began on December 28.

The protests have evolved from complaints about economic hardships to calls for the fall of the clerical establishment.

Russia and Iran have developed closer ties since the Kremlin ordered the invasion of Ukraine in 2022. President Vladimir Putin and Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian signed a 20-year strategic partnership pact last year that deepened military ties and boosted cooperation in a range of areas.</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 20:47:44 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/MQS75TTA7FNHTLPDO5SNVRXWQ4.jpg?auth=9cdf4932da9ab4cabe2cb1fe93f898cfab544dd38ba171b4ff4ef4a8bad7ee18&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Greenland rejects US takeover 'under any circumstance', government says</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/greenland-rejects-us-takeover-under-any-circumstance-government-says</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 20:48:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/006702e4-eff7-11f0-961e-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260112-211242-211429-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'Absence of credible alternatives' has allowed Iranian regime to survive, analyst says</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/absence-of-credible-alternatives-has-allowed-iranian-regime-to-survive-analyst-says</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 20:48:27 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/4c3f9c60-eff4-11f0-9b76-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260112-210550-211207-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Malaysia and Indonesia become the first countries to block Musk’s Grok over sexualized AI images</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/malaysia-and-indonesia-become-the-first-countries-to-block-musk-s-grok-over-sexualized-ai-images</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 20:48:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/eb674c64-eff1-11f0-9330-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/capture-833844252696553d4092667-91773306.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iranians being kept in the dark about crackdown, observer says</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/iranians-being-kept-in-the-dark-about-crackdown-observer-says</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 20:48:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/4dc4cf22-eff1-11f0-be4e-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/capture-478819749696552cb8f7970-61876481.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item></channel></rss>
