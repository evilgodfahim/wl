The bloc's weapon – never-before used and dubbed its trade "bazooka" – allows for curbing imports of goods and services. It has been invoked as a possible way to push back over tech and trade, and now the Danish territory US President Donald Trump wants to acquire.

Trump on ⁠Saturday vowed to implement a wave of rising tariffs ​on European ‍allies until the United ​States is allowed to purchase ​Greenland .

In a post on Truth Social, Trump said 10 percent tariffs would come into effect on February ‍1 on Denmark , Norway , ​Sweden, France , Germany , Great Britain, the Netherlands and Finland . ‌Those tariffs would increase to 25 percent ‍on June 1 and would continue until a deal is reached for the United States ‍to undertake the "complete and total purchase" of Greenland , Trump said.

Trump's tariffs target a number of European countries that have at Denmark's request deployed troops in recent days to the vast, mineral-rich territory at the gateway to the Arctic with a population of 57,000.

Ambassadors from ​the European Union's ⁠27 countries will convene on Sunday for ​an emergency ‍meeting to discuss the tariffs.

Cyprus, ​which holds the six-month rotating EU presidency, said ‌late on Saturday that ‍it had called the meeting for Sunday. EU diplomats said it was set ‍to start at ‌5pm.

European Union leaders on Saturday warned Trump's threat could trigger "a dangerous downward spiral".

"Tariffs would undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral," EU chief Ursula von der Leyen and European Council president Antonio Costa said in a joint statement.

"Europe will remain united, coordinated, and committed to upholding its sovereignty," they added.</description><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 12:41:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/a54c03ce-f45f-11f0-8a1a-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/000-92TD8QR-1.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Portugal votes in tight presidential race with far right expected to reach runoff</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/portugal-votes-in-tight-presidential-race-with-far-right-expected-to-reach-runoff</link><description /><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 12:41:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/db68526e-f45f-11f0-af6d-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260118-120424-120730-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>World markets face fresh jolt as Trump Threatens tariffs on Europe</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/world-markets-face-fresh-jolt-trump-vows-tariffs-europe-over-greenland-2026-01-18/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 18 (Reuters) - Global markets face a fresh bout of volatility this week after President Donald Trump vowed to slap tariffs on eight European nations until the U.S. is allowed to buy Greenland.

Trump said he would impose an additional 10% import tariffs from February 1 on goods from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Finland and Britain, which will rise to 25% on June 1 if no deal is reached.

"Hopes that the tariff situation has calmed down for this year have been dashed for now - and we find ourselves in the same situation as last spring," said Berenberg chief economist Holger Schmieding.

Sweeping "Liberation Day" tariffs in April 2025 sent shockwaves through financial markets. Investors then largely looked past Trump trade threats in the second half of the year, viewing them as noise and responding with relief as Trump made deals with the likes of Britain and the European Union.

While that lull might be over, market moves on Monday could be dampened by the experience that investor sentiment had been more resilient and global economic growth stayed on track.

Nonetheless, Schmieding expected the euro could come under some pressure when Asian trade begins. The euro ended Friday at around $1.16 against the dollar, having hit its lowest levels since late November.

Implications for the dollar were less clear. It remains a safe haven, but could also feel the impact of Washington being at the centre of geopolitical ruptures, as it did last April.

"For European markets it will be a small setback, but not something comparable to the Liberation Day reaction," Schmieding said.

European stocks are trading near record highs, with Germany's DAX (.GDAXI) , opens new tab and London's blue-chip FTSE index (.FTSE) , opens new tab up more than 3% since the start of the year, outperforming the S&amp;P 500 (.SPX) , opens new tab , which is up 1.3%.

European defence shares are likely to remain an outlier - benefiting from increased geopolitical tensions. Defence stocks (.SXPARO) , opens new tab have jumped almost 15% this month, as the U.S. seizure of Venezuela's Nicolas Maduro fuelled concerns about Greenland.

Denmark's closely managed crown will also likely be in focus. It has been weakening, but rate differentials are a major factor and it is still close to the central rate at which it is pegged to the euro . It is trading not far from six-year lows against the euro.

"The U.S.-EU trade war is back on," said Tina Fordham, geopolitical strategist and founder of Fordham Global Foresight.

Trump's latest move came as top officials from the EU and South American bloc Mercosur signed a free trade agreement .

The dispute over Greenland is just one hot spot.

Trump has also weighed intervening in unrest in Iran, while the U.S. administration's threat to indict Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has reignited concerns about its independence .

Against this backdrop, safe-haven gold remains near record highs.

The World Economic Forum's annual risk perception survey, released ahead of its annual meeting in Davos, which will be attended by Trump, identified economic confrontation between nations as the number one concern replacing armed conflict.

While investors have grown increasingly wary of geopolitical risk, they have also become used to it to some extent.

"Investor sentiment has proven quite resilient in the face of the sort of continuing unthinkable sorts of developments, which probably reflects a combination of like faith that Trump just won't be able to do all of the things that he talks about mixed with a sense that none of this kind of moves the needle on asset prices," said Fordham.</description><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 13:28:48 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/XJZ7T2YRKRLRNC5G7MKOMGOV5E.jpg?auth=7cff10b0783ff5956f454aed74d94211ecfaffd1dc357e72db82a86c414ff99d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Libya's security authorities free more than 200 migrants from 'secret prison', two security sources say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/libyas-security-authorities-free-more-than-200-migrants-secret-prison-two-2026-01-18/</link><description>BENGHAZI, Jan 18 (Reuters) - Libya's security authorities have freed more than 200 migrants from what they described as a secret prison in the town of Kufra in the southeast of the country after they were held captive in inhuman conditions, two security sources from the city told Reuters on Sunday.

The security sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that the security authorities had found an underground prison, nearly three meters deep, which the sources said was run by a Libyan human trafficker.

One of the sources said this person had not yet been detained.

"Some of the freed migrants were held captive up to two years in the underground cells," this source said.

The other source said what the operation had found was "one of the most serious crimes against humanity that has been uncovered in the region."

"The operation resulted in a raid on a secret prison within the city, where several inhumane underground detention cells were uncovered," one of the sources added.

The freed migrants are from sub-Saharan Africa, mainly from Somalia and Eritrea, including women and children, the sources said. Kufra lies in eastern Libya, about 1,700 kilometres (1,000 miles) from the capital Tripoli.

Libya has become a transit route for migrants fleeing conflict and poverty to Europe via dangerous routes across the desert and over the Mediterranean since the toppling of Muammar Gaddafi in a NATO-backed uprising in 2011.

The oil-based Libyan economy is also a draw for impoverished migrants seeking work, but security throughout the sprawling country is poor, leaving migrants vulnerable to abuses.

At least 21 bodies of migrants were found in a mass grave in eastern Libya last week, with up to 10 survivors in the group bearing signs of having been tortured before they were freed from captivity, two security sources told Reuters.

Libya's attorney general said in a statement on Friday the authorities in the east of the country had referred a defendant to the court for trial in connection with the mass grave on charges of "committing serious violations against migrants."

In February last year, 39 bodies of migrants were recovered from about 55 mass graves in Kufra. The town houses tens of thousands of Sudanese refugees who fled the conflict that erupted in Sudan in 2023.</description><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 13:29:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Pakistan receives US invitation to join Board of Peace on Gaza</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/pakistan-receives-us-invitation-join-board-peace-gaza-2026-01-18/</link><description>Jan 18 (Reuters) - Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has received U.S. President Donald Trump's invitation to join the Board of Peace for Gaza, a spokesperson for Pakistan's ministry of foreign affairs said in a statement.

"I ‍think we should ​be very careful not to have a trade ‌war that spirals out of ‍control. I don't think anyone benefits from that," Stoere told broadcaster NRK following ‍a press conference.

Eight European ​nations targeted by rising tariffs announced by US President Donald Trump said in ⁠a joint statement that they stood in ​solidarity with ‍the Kingdom of Denmark and ​the people of Greenland ​following the US president's threat to annex the Arctic island.

"Obviously, dialogue has to happen to prevent that from occurring...

Users reported being able to reconnect to the internet around 11 p.m. local time (2000 GMT) on Saturday and some internet service providers sent out a message to customers saying the regulator had ordered them to restore services excluding social media.

"We have restored internet so that businesses that rely on internet can resume work," David Birungi, spokesperson for Airtel Uganda (AIRTEL.UG) , opens new tab , one of the country's biggest telecom companies told Reuters. He added the state communications regulator had ordered that social media remain shut down.

State-run Uganda Communications Commission said it had cut off internet to curb "misinformation, disinformation, electoral fraud and related risks." The opposition, however, criticised the move saying it was to cement control over the electoral process and guarantee a win for the incumbent.

UCC spokesperson Ibrahim Bbosa did not respond to a Reuters' call for comment.

The electoral body in the east African country on Saturday declared Museveni the winner of Thursday's poll with 71.6% of the vote while his rival pop star-turned-politician Bobi Wine was credited with 24% of the vote.

A joint report from an election observer team from the African Union and other regional blocs criticised the involvement of the military in the election and authorities' decision to cut off internet.

"The internet shut down implemented two days before the elections limited access to information, freedom of association, curtailed economic activities...it also created suspicion and mistrust on the electoral process," the team said in their report published on Saturday.

In power since 1986 and currently Africa's third longest-ruling head of state , Museveni's latest win means he will have been in power for nearly half a century when his new term ends in 2031.

He is widely thought to be preparing his son, Muhoozi Kainerugaba, to take over from him. Kainerugaba is currently head of the military and has expressed presidential ambitions.

Wine, who was taking on Museveni for a second time, has rejected the results of the latest vote and alleged mass fraud during the election.

Scattered opposition protests broke out late on Saturday after results were announced, according to a Reuters witness and police.

In Magere, a suburb in Kampala's north where Wine lives, a group of youths burned tyres and erected barricades in the road prompting police to respond with tear gas.

Police spokesperson Racheal Kawala told Reuters the protests had been quashed and that arrests were made but said the number of those detained would be released later.

Wine's whereabouts were unknown early on Sunday after he said in a post on X he had escaped a raid by the military on his home. People close to him told Reuters on Saturday he remained at an undisclosed location in Uganda. Wine was briefly held under house arrest following the previous election in 2021.

Wine has said hundreds of his supporters were detained during the months leading up to the vote and that others have been tortured.

Government officials have denied those allegations and say those who have been detained have violated the law and will be put through due process.</description><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 14:21:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WW6YK44KGNNSREXD65NF7SGXD4.jpg?auth=9b262c9dd792b3f32b9845ae90938bc933bc3267078c944cd0929735e4a7b240&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Explosion at steel plate factory in China's Inner Mongolia region kills 2, state media reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/explosion-steel-plate-factory-chinas-inner-mongolia-region-kills-2-state-media-2026-01-18/</link><description>BEIJING, Jan 18 (Reuters) - An explosion at a steel plate factory in north China's Inner Mongolia region killed two people and left five missing, according to local emergency management and fire rescue departments, China's state broadcaster CCTV reported.

Sixty-six people were hospitalized after the blast, with three in critical condition, the report said.

Only Hungary, whose leader is a close Trump ally, gave an unequivocal acceptance in response to the invitations, which have been addressed to some 60 nations and began arriving in European capitals on Saturday, according to diplomats.

Other governments appeared reluctant to make public statements, leaving officials to express concerns anonymously about the impact on the work of the U.N..

The board would be chaired for life by Trump and would start by addressing the Gaza conflict and then be expanded to deal with other conflicts, according to a copy of the letter and draft charter seen by Reuters.

Member states would be limited to three-year terms unless they pay $1 billion each to fund the board's activities and earn permanent membership, the letter states.

"This simply offers permanent membership to partner countries who demonstrate deep commitment to peace, security, and prosperity," the White House said in a post on X.

Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, visiting South Korea, told reporters her country was "ready to do our part", although it was not clear whether she was specifically referring to Gaza or the broader peace.

Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney said on Sunday he had agreed to Trump's Board of Peace for Gaza in principle although details were still being worked out.

The Board of Peace's mandate was only authorized by the United Nations Security Council through 2027 and was solely focused on the Gaza conflict.

The inclusion of a 'charter' in the invitation letter stoked concerns among some European governments that it could undermine the work of the United Nations, which Trump has accused of not supporting his efforts to end conflicts around the world.

"It's a 'Trump United Nations' that ignores the fundamentals of the U.N. charter," said one diplomat.

Three other Western diplomats said it looked as if it would undermine the United Nations if it went ahead.

A further three diplomats and an Israeli source said that Trump wanted the Board of Peace to eventually have a broader role beyond Gaza that would oversee the other conflicts that Trump has said he has resolved.

The leaders of France, Germany, Italy, Hungary, Australia, Canada, the European Commission and key Middle East powers were among those invited to sit on the Board of Peace, according to officials.

"Declaring that durable peace requires pragmatic judgment, common-sense solutions, and the courage to depart from approaches and institutions that have too often failed," the document showed.

In what appeared to be directed at the United Nations, the document added that there was a "need for a more nimble and effective international peace-building body".

Trump, who covets the Nobel Peace Prize, said in the letter that the board would convene in the near future, adding: "This board will be one of a kind, there has never been anything like it!"

In public comments in response to a reporter's question, a senior U.N. official did not address the plan directly, but said the United Nations was the only institution with the moral and legal ability to bring together every nation, big or small.

"And if we question that ... we fall back and very, very, dark, times," Annalena Baerbock, president of the United Nations General Assembly, told Sky News, adding that it was up to individual states to decide what to do.

The White House on Friday named some individuals who will sit on the board, which would outlive its role supervising the temporary governance of Gaza, under a fragile ceasefire since October.

They included U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, President Donald Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff, former British prime minister Tony Blair and Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner.

Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas signed off on Trump's plan, which says a Palestinian technocratic administration will be overseen by an international board, which will supervise Gaza's governance for a transitional period.

"It's going to, in my opinion, start with Gaza and then do conflicts as they arise," President Donald Trump told Reuters in an interview earlier this week.

Many rights experts and advocates have said that Trump overseeing a board to supervise a foreign territory's governance resembles a colonial structure, while Blair's involvement was criticized last year due to his role in the Iraq war and the history of British imperialism in the Middle East.

The White House did not detail the responsibilities of each member of the board. The names do not include any Palestinians. The White House said more members will be announced over the coming weeks.

It also named a separate, 11-member "Gaza Executive Board" to support the technocratic body.

This would include Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan, U.N. Middle East peace coordinator Sigrid Kaag, United Arab Emirates International Cooperation Minister Reem Al-Hashimy, Israeli-Cypriot billionaire Yakir Gabay and officials from Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said the composition of this board had not been coordinated with Israel and contradicted its policy - possibly a reference to Fidan's presence, as Israel objects to Turkish involvement. Israel's government also has a tense relationship with Qatar. An Israeli government spokesperson declined to comment beyond the statement.</description><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 14:42:19 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/2QDF6SZKNJIADJSPNKSHKKTYUQ.jpg?auth=938d9fa352e1a7e136e8e7db079a618b19f8607e764c5ade141044b41d900757&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Syrian forces advance deeper into the US‑backed, Kurdish‑controlled northeast</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/syrian-forces-advance-deeper-into-usbacked-kurdishcontrolled-northeast-2026-01-18/</link><description /><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 14:43:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Kurdish commander calls on US to 'intervene forcefully' in Syria clashes</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/kurdish-commander-calls-us-intervene-forcefully-syria-clashes-2026-01-18/</link><description /><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 14:44:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Chile declares state of catastrophe as wildfires force thousands to flee</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/chile-declares-state-catastrophe-wildfires-force-thousands-flee-2026-01-18/</link><description>SANTIAGO, Jan 18 (Reuters) - Chilean President Gabriel Boric announced a state of catastrophe in two regions in the south of the country early on Sunday as raging wildfires forced at least 20,000 people to evacuate.

According to Chile's CONAF forestry agency, firefighters are battling 24 active fires across the country as of Sunday morning, with the largest being in the regions of Ñuble and Bío Bío, where the government declared the emergency. The regions are about 500 km south of the capital Santiago.

"In light of the serious ongoing wildfires, I have decided to declare a state of catastrophe in the regions of Ñuble and Biobío. All resources are available," Boric said on a post on X.

Fires have consumed nearly 8,500 hectares (21,000 acres) in the two regions so far, endangering multiple communities in the region, leading authorities to declare evacuation orders.

Chile's Senapred disaster agency said that nearly 20,000 people had been evacuated and at least 250 homes have been destroyed.

Authorities say adverse conditions like strong winds and high temperatures have helped wildfires spread and complicated firefighters' abilities to control the fires. Much of Chile is under extreme heat alerts, with temperatures expected to reach up to 38 C (100 F) from Santiago to Bío Bío on Sunday and Monday.

Both Chile and Argentina have experienced extreme temperatures and heat waves since the beginning of the year, with devastating wildfires breaking out in Argentina's Patagonia earlier this month.</description><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 15:23:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/W554DPJE25MJHCQR2BXQCPPPUI.jpg?auth=47f9e5fc5c0c287c3896f1966e1a3e734ef94c1fcba332d07a897a465723633d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>AFCON 2025 comes to climactic close as hosts Morocco square off against Senegal</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/africa/20260118-afcon-2025-comes-to-climactic-close-hosts-morocco-square-off-against-senegal-final</link><description>The Africa Cup of Nations reaches its climax on Sunday with a showdown between host nation Morocco , looking to win the title for the first time in 50 years, and Sadio Mané 's powerful Senegal side.

The final kicks off at 1900 GMT at the Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium in Rabat, where almost all the 69,000 spectators will be backing Morocco, captained by African player of the year Achraf Hakimi.

The first AFCON ever to start in one year and end in another could be the second in a row to be won by the host nation, with the Atlas Lions aiming to follow in the footsteps of Ivory Coast , crowned champions on home soil in 2024.

Walid Regragui's Morocco have established themselves in recent years as Africa's pre-eminent national team, becoming the first from the continent to reach a World Cup semi-final, in 2022, and climbing to 11th place in the world rankings.

However, they have long been AFCON underachievers, with their only title to date coming in 1976. This will be their first final since 2004, when they lost to Tunisia when Regragui was part of the team.

Senegal, meanwhile, are appearing in their third final in four editions and are targeting a second title to follow their 2022 triumph, when Mané scored the decisive shoot-out penalty against Egypt in Yaoundé.

"We dreamt of being here and now we have done it," Regragui told reporters on Saturday.

He has been under suffocating pressure to deliver the title for the football-mad nation, and would possibly not have kept his job through to the approaching World Cup in North America had he not reached the final.

"I hope this is just the beginning and not our last AFCON final," he added.

"Big football nations want to be up there on a regular basis. Tomorrow we want to try to make history."

He added: "Senegal will need to be really strong to beat us at home, although they are capable."

Morocco's success over the last four weeks has been based around the attacking threat of Real Madrid winger Brahim Diaz, the tournament's top scorer with five goals, and a defence that has conceded only once.

Being at home brings extra pressure, but can also be a huge advantage, and Senegal have complained about the conditions in which they were welcomed to Rabat ahead of the game.

The Lions of Teranga were based in the northern port city of Tangiers until they arrived in Rabat by train on Friday.

The Senegalese Football Federation complained about a "lack of adequate security" for the team's arrival amid a crowd of fans "which put the players and staff at risk".

It also complained about their hotel, the fact that their supporters were given fewer than 3,000 tickets for the final, and about being asked to train at the Moroccan team's base in nearby Salé.

"What happened was not normal," said Senegal coach Pape Thiaw.

"Given the number there, anything could have happened. My players could have been in danger.

"That type of thing should not happen between two brother countries."

Mané, a two-time winner of the African player of the year award, said after netting the winner in the semi-final against Egypt that Sunday's game would be his last ever AFCON appearance.

But Thiaw insisted on the eve of the game that the former Liverpool forward may have to rethink that decision.

"I think he made his decision in the heat of the moment and the country does not agree, and I as coach of the national team do not agree," said Thiaw.

"We would like to keep him for as long as possible," added the coach, who is without centre-back and captain Kalidou Koulibaly due to suspension.

Off the pitch this edition of Africa's premier sports event has demonstrated that Morocco is determined to be a successful co-host of the 2030 World Cup.

The tournament has been free of the problems that have plagued earlier AFCONs; the stadiums and pitches have generally been of a high quality and high-speed rail links show a country significantly upgrading its infrastructure.</description><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 15:25:49 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/b6dd5dce-f3db-11f0-ad87-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/000-92X32G3.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Netherlands ushers in Spring with National Tulip Day celebration</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/netherlands-ushers-in-spring-with-national-tulip-day-celebration</link><description /><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 15:44:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/66da3882-f481-11f0-acdf-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260118-161312-161424-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>European governments condemn Trump's tariff threats over Greenland</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/european-governments-condemn-trump-s-tariff-threats-over-greenland</link><description /><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 15:44:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/492648e4-f481-11f0-85ce-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/capture-1107211990696cfa57e56066-28052140.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Clashes in Colombia between guerrilla groups leave 27 dead, sources say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/clashes-colombia-between-guerrilla-groups-leave-27-dead-sources-say-2026-01-18/</link><description>BOGOTA, Jan 18 (Reuters) - At least 27 members of a leftist guerrilla group in Colombia were killed in clashes with a rival faction in a fight over control of a jungle area in southwestern Colombia, military authorities reported on Sunday.

The clashes, which have been the most violent in recent months, occurred in the rural area of the municipality of El Retorno, in the department of Guaviare, 300 kilometers (186 miles) southwest of Bogotá, a military source said.

The region is strategic for cocaine production and trafficking.

The clashes took place between a faction of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) led by Néstor Gregorio Vera, known by his war name Iván Mordisco, and another led by Alexander Díaz Mendoza, alias Calarcá Córdoba, a second military source specified.</description><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 16:27:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/J2OT46IMSVO2LHG3HHCW3T5WGM.jpg?auth=1bb42dc711388997fd45b2f1aac58ca16ebd233c55b315fd77faa5f6343d7aff&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Syrian government, SDF agree on immediate ceasefire on all fronts, state media say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/syrian-government-sdf-agree-immediate-ceasefire-all-fronts-state-media-say-2026-01-18/</link><description>CAIRO, Jan 18 (Reuters) - The Syrian government and the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) have agreed on an immediate ceasefire on all fronts, Syrian state media reported on Sunday, after days of fighting as the army advanced into Kurdish-held territories in the northeast.</description><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 16:27:26 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/E27F7NHZWBO4BDU7FVKKCSP63I.jpg?auth=eec852656f506fc57e587e68c2ee2b4d4092dad3a6f25248b7e42e486372e555&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Cops attacked in Guatemala after police take back prison, gang leader</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/cops-attacked-guatemala-after-police-take-back-prison-gang-leader-2026-01-18/</link><description>GUATEMALA CITY, Jan 18 (Reuters) - Violence broke out in parts of Guatemala on Sunday morning after Guatemalan security forces regained control of a prison that had been taken over by inmates, and took a top gang leader into custody, the country's civil police agency said.

Authorities regained control over Renovacion 1, near the southern town of Escuintla, one of the three prisons where inmates rioted and took hostages on Saturday, demanding greater privileges for their gang leader.

The release of the hostages held at the prison leaves 37 hostages still being held at two other prisons.

The agency also said authorities had recaptured Aldo Duppie, alias El Lobo, widely reported as the top leader within the Barrio 18 gang.

Shortly afterward, there were six simultaneous attacks against police officers, leaving at least two police officers dead, the civil police's spokesman, Jorge Aguilar, said.</description><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 16:27:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/P6ULUHIR7NJLFCUIRAOTC744WA.jpg?auth=806610ed043978ead18d9b6f334359d391bc3dfb1627b3078db265cc8c67f68f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Syrian government says it has struck ceasefire deal with Kurdish-led forces</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260118-syrian-government-says-it-has-struck-ceasefire-deal-with-kurdish-led-forces</link><description>The ‍Syrian government and the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) agreed on an immediate and comprehensive ceasefire ​on all fronts on Sunday after days of fighting as ​the army advanced into Kurdish-held territories in the northeast.

The ceasefire will be in parallel with the withdrawal of all SDF-affiliated forces to the east of the Euphrates River, according to a document published by the Syrian Presidency on Sunday.

The SDF controls swathes of Syria's oil‑rich north and northeast, areas captured during the civil war and the fight against the Islamic State group over the past decade.

The deal entails merging all SDF forces into the defence ‍and interior ministries after conducting required security checks, the statement said.

The government will also immediately ​and completely take over the Kurdish-held provinces of Deir Ezzor and Raqqa militarily and administratively.

All border crossings, as well as gas and oil fields ‌in the area, will also be handed over to the Syrian government.

The deal will also see Damascus take responsibility for Islamic State group prisoners and their families held in Kurdish-run prisons and camps.

The SDF will be committed to ‍evacuating all non-Syrian leaders and forces affiliated to the Kurdistan Workers' Party ( PKK ) outside of the country.

The document, shared by the Syrian presidency, showed the signatures of both Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa and SDF head Mazloum Abdi.

"All lingering files with the SDF will be resolved," state media quoted ‍Sharaa as saying.

He said he was set to meet Abdi on Monday.</description><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 17:27:16 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/b65afc74-f324-11f0-9b1c-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-16T204820Z-335912092-RC2ECIABFJLB-RTRMADP-3-SYRIA-POLITICS-SHARAA.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump’s tariff policies: Pressuring rivals and alienating allies</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/trump-s-tariff-policies-pressuring-rivals-and-alienating-allies</link><description /><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 17:27:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/92c6ea08-f48b-11f0-8721-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/capture-1571982272696d0b9a7025a5-86064391.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>India gets Trump's invite to join Board of Peace on Gaza, source says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/india/india-gets-trumps-invite-join-board-peace-gaza-source-says-2026-01-18/</link><description /><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 18:29:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>How can Europe respond to Trump's tariff threats over Greenland?</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/how-can-europe-respond-to-trump-s-tariff-threats-over-greenland</link><description /><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 18:29:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/5b3ea2aa-f496-11f0-8ef1-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260118-183740-184404-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Syrian president cancels Germany visit, Merz meeting</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/syrian-president-cancels-germany-visit-merz-meeting-2026-01-18/</link><description>BERLIN, Jan 18 (Reuters) - Syria's President Ahmed al-Sharaa has cancelled his visit to Berlin on Monday and Tuesday, a German government spokesperson told Reuters.

Umerov, writing on Telegram, said two days of talks in Florida with a U.S. team including envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump 's son-in-law, had focused on security guarantees and a post-war recovery plan for Ukraine.

He gave no indication whether any agreements had been achieved at the meeting.

"We agreed to continue work at the team level during the next phase of consultations in Davos," Umerov wrote.

The two sides, in the latest of a series of meetings intended to work out the details of an agreement, had "discussed in depth" the two issues, "focusing on practical mechanisms and carrying out and implementing them," Umerov said.

He said his delegation had reported on Russian strikes last week which badly damaged Ukraine's energy infrastructure and left hundreds of apartment buildings with no heating or electricity.

President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said it was important to outline the dire effects of the Russian strikes as they demonstrated that Russia was not interested in diplomacy.

"If the Russians were seriously interested in ending the war, they would have focused on diplomacy," Zelenskiy said in his nightly video address.

He said Ukrainian intelligence had determined that Russia was conducting reconnaissance on key sites in preparation for strikes, including targets linked to Ukraine's nuclear power stations.

Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said on Saturday that there was evidence Russia was considering attacks on power substations supplying nuclear power stations.

Russia has made no comment on the allegations.</description><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 20:23:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/RKO4IUWIP5LALOOQ7GGPJGOBUQ.jpg?auth=7d6cf0a84935898b0a96fd8b678c6cb8a8147e0754888d5c2f8037ec3940709b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Two high-speed trains derail in Spain, police said</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/two-high-speed-trains-derail-spain-police-said-2026-01-18/</link><description>MADRID, Jan 18 (Reuters) - At least two people have died and an unknown number are trapped after two high-speed trains derailed on Sunday in southern Spain, Spanish police said.

"In all his calls, the prime minister reiterated his position on Greenland.

Speaking on NBC's "Meet the Press" program, Bessent said taking ownership of Greenland is crucial in a geopolitical chess match with Russia and China. He made the remarks a day after U.S. President Donald Trump vowed to implement tariffs on European Union members opposed to a U.S. acquisition, including Denmark, which has long been one of Washington's staunchest allies

"We are the strongest country in the world," Bessent said. "Europeans project weakness. U.S. projects strength."

As tensions with the EU escalated on Sunday, Bessent said he believed European leaders would ultimately "come around" to the idea of U.S. control of Greenland. "I believe that the Europeans will understand that this is best for Greenland, best for Europe, and best for the United States," he said.

The U.S. Treasury chief said he had not recently discussed with Trump whether he is still considering using emergency powers to justify using force to take Greenland. But doing so would be "ridiculous" because there is no emergency in Greenland, said Senator Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican who chairs the U.S. Senate Homeland Security Committee.

"The idea by the secretary that, oh, this is to prevent an emergency - now we're declaring emergencies to prevent emergencies?" Paul, who has long been a vocal opponent of aggressive U.S. efforts overseas, said on "Meet the Press."

The Senate Homeland Security Committee may push a war powers resolution limiting Trump's ability to use force, or a resolution challenging his use of tariffs, Senator Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat, said in the same interview.

Paul was not the only Republican on Sunday to challenge his party's president. U.S. Representative Mike Turner, an Ohio Republican, said the tariff gambit could threaten relationships with NATO allies.

"This is not 'The Art of the Deal,'" Turner said on CBS' "Face the Nation" program, referencing the title of Trump's 1987 book. "This is more like 'The Dating Game.' ... This certainly isn't the type of language someone should be using when asking someone to join you in a partnership."

But Texas Republican Senator John Cornyn characterized Trump's tariff threat as a negotiating tactic.

"Sometimes he believes in strategic ambiguity and talks in terms that get people's attention, but ultimately I think there's a deal to be made," Cornyn said on the "Fox News Sunday" program.

Other lawmakers, including Senators Chris Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat, and Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, pointed to Greenland's natural resources as potential motivation for acquiring it, although they diverged on whether Trump has made a credible argument for the U.S. to absorb the territory.

Cruz, speaking on Fox News' "Sunday Morning Futures" program, cited Greenland's minerals as one of the "enormous economic benefits" of acquiring it, although he also pointed to the country's strategic location. "It is overwhelmingly in the U.S. interest to acquire Greenland," Cruz said.

Speaking on ABC News' "This Week" program, Van Hollen accused Trump of dishonesty about Greenland's national security value and said the president only cares about the territory's natural resources.

"The president is lying to the American people when he says this is about security," Van Hollen said.</description><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 20:27:07 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/IBIHNHQIOBOGDPT6KRL4YKVNPM.jpg?auth=70d61ef0d17024830d13852b96318dc9a68dda8f832a536aa5b233eac0f42ccc&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran's president says any attack on Supreme Leader Khamenei would be declaration of war</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260118-iran-s-president-says-any-attack-on-supreme-leader-khamenei-would-be-declaration-of-war</link><description>Iran's president warned that an attack on the country's supreme leader would be a declaration of war – an apparent response to US counterpart Donald Trump saying it was time to look for new leadership in Iran .

Limited internet access briefly returned in Iran before dropping again, a monitor said Sunday, 10 days into a communications blackout that rights groups said aimed to mask a protest crackdown that killed thousands.

Demonstrations sparked in late December by anger over economic hardship exploded into protests widely seen as the biggest challenge to the Iranian leadership in years.

The rallies subsided after the crackdown that rights groups have called a "massacre" carried out by security forces under the cover of a communications blackout that started on January 8.

Monitor Netblocks said late Sunday that "traffic levels have fallen after a brief, heavily filtered restoration of select Google and messaging services in Iran".

Iranian officials have said the demonstrations were peaceful before turning into "riots" and blamed foreign influence from Iran's arch-foes the United States and Israel.

Trump, who joined Israel's 12-day war against Iran in June, had repeatedly threatened new military action against Tehran if protesters were killed.

While Washington appeared to have stepped back, Trump hit out at supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in an interview with Politico on Saturday, saying it was "time to look for new leadership in Iran".

"The man is a sick man who should run his country properly and stop killing people," Trump said.

Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian on Sunday warned on X: "An attack on the great leader of our country is tantamount to a full-scale war with the Iranian nation."

As leaders in Washington and Tehran have exchanged barbs, Iranian officials have said calm has been restored in the streets.

Security forces with armoured vehicles and motorcycles were seen in central Tehran, according to AFP correspondents.

Schools reopened on Sunday after a week of closure.

Pezeshkian meanwhile told a cabinet meeting that he "recommended to the secretary of the Supreme National Security Council that internet restrictions be lifted as soon as possible".

Some users reported access to WhatsApp, while outgoing international calls had resumed since Tuesday, and text messaging was restored Saturday.

Fars news agency on Sunday reported that the chief executive of Irancell, Iran's second-largest mobile phone operator, was dismissed for failing to comply with the government's decision to shut down the internet.

Solidarity demonstrations have continued in multiple cities in recent days, including in Berlin, London and Paris.

Despite the restrictions, information had still filtered out, with reports of atrocities emerging, according to rights groups.

Amnesty International said it had verified dozens of videos and accounts in recent days showing a "massacre of protesters" by security forces.

Norway-based Iran Human Rights says it has verified the deaths of 3,428 protesters killed by security forces, confirming cases through sources within the Islamic republic's health and medical system, witnesses and independent sources.

However, the NGO warns the true toll is likely far higher. Media cannot independently confirm the figure and Iranian officials have not given an exact death toll for the protests.

Other estimates place the death toll at more than 5,000 – and possibly as high as 20,000 – though the internet blackout has severely hampered independent verification, IHR says.

The overseas-based opposition Iran International channel has said at least 12,000 people were killed during the protests, citing senior government and security sources.

With Reform UK well ahead in the opinion polls before a national election due in 2029, Rosindell is one of more than 20 serving or former Conservative lawmakers to switch to the party led by veteran Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage. His move gives Reform seven seats in the 650-seat parliament.

Rosindell announced his resignation from his position and from the party "with sorrow" on X, saying "the failure of the Conservative Party both when in government and more recently in opposition" to challenge Prime Minister Keir Starmer's decision to cede sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius was "a clear red line for me".

"Both the government and the opposition (Conservatives) have been complicit in the surrender of this sovereign British territory to a foreign power," he said.

The Chagos deal allows Britain to retain control of a strategically important U.S.-UK air base on Diego Garcia, the largest island of the archipelago in the Indian Ocean, under a 99-year lease.

Farage, who welcomed former Conservative leadership candidate Robert Jenrick to his party on Thursday, said in a statement that Rosindell would be "a great addition to our team".</description><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 21:42:10 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4F7ZX46RD5J3LPTCDCOOBPBPZQ.jpg?auth=9d3dd76a597bbc755670633a136db3b6f84786278f9af3c2363c996c93e54fd4&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'Dangerous downward spiral': Europe hits back at Trump tariff threat over Greenland</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260118-europe-hits-back-at-trump-tariff-threat-over-greenland</link><description>European leaders on Sunday slammed US President Donald Trump 's threat of tariffs over their opposition to his designs on Greenland , warning transatlantic ties were at risk.

European countries including Denmark , of which Greenland is an autonomous territory, said they "stand united" against Trump's vow on Saturday to hit them with tariffs of up to 25 percent unless Greenland is ceded to the United States.

"Tariff threats undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral," Britain, Denmark, Finland , France , Germany , the Netherlands , Norway and Sweden warned in a joint statement.

Denmark's Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said Trump's ultimatum threatened the world order "as we know it" and the future of the NATO military alliance.

NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said he had spoken to Trump about "the security situation in Greenland and the Arctic " and hoped to talk again at this week's Davos summit. He did not elaborate on their conversation.

The European Council said it was calling a summit of EU leaders in the coming days, following a meeting of EU ambassadors in Brussels on Sunday.

The Financial Times reported that ⁠European ‍capitals may ​hit the US with ⁠€93 billion ($107.71 billion) worth of tariffs or restrict American ​companies from ‍the bloc's market in ​response to Trump's threats.

The ‍retaliation measures are being ​drawn up to give European leaders leverage in pivotal meetings ‌with Trump at the World Economic ‍Forum in Davos this week, the FT report said, citing officials involved in the preparations for the ‍meetings in Switzerland .

The bloc clinched a deal with Washington in July for most EU exports to face a 15-percent US levy. It was unclear how Trump's threatened tariffs would work against that deal.

"I don't believe that this agreement is possible in the current situation," German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul told ARD television.

Aides to French President Emmanuel Macron said he would ask the EU to activate a never-before-used "anti-coercion instrument" against Washington if Trump makes good on his additional tariffs.

This measure allows for curbing imports of goods and services into the EU, a market of 27 countries with a combined population of 450 million.

Trump has repeatedly expressed his desire to seize Greenland since returning to the White House for a second term.

His rhetoric towards that goal has hardened since he ordered a military operation against Venezuela early this month to capture its leader, Nicolas Maduro .

Trump and his administration have argued that Greenland coming under US rule would serve American "national security".

He and his aides have also argued that Denmark, a fellow NATO member, would be unable to defend Greenland should Russia or China ever seek to invade.

Denmark and several of its European NATO allies responded by recently sending small numbers of military personnel to Greenland for an exercise, to which the US was also invited.

And on Saturday, thousands of people in Greenland and Denmark protested against the US push to control the Arctic island.

"Make America Go Away" read the wording on caps worn by many demonstrators, riffing on Trump's "Make America Great Again" slogan.

Trump responded Saturday with his threat to slap goods coming into the US from Britain, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Finland with 10-percent tariffs starting February 1.

They would rise to 25 percent from June 1 "until such time as a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland", Trump wrote on his social media platform, Truth Social.

Even Italy 's far-right Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni , one of Trump's closest European allies, baulked at the threat.

"I believe that imposing new sanctions today would be a mistake," she told journalists during a trip to Seoul.

"I spoke to Donald Trump a few hours ago and told him what I think," she added.

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer called it "completely wrong", and said he planned to discuss the situation with Trump "at the earliest opportunity".

Dutch Foreign Minister David van Weel denounced Trump's threat as an "inexplicable" form of "blackmail".

France's Agricultural Minister Annie Genevard warned that tariffs would hurt Washington too.

"In this escalation of tariffs, (Trump) has a lot to lose as well, as do his own farmers and industrialists," she told broadcasters Europe 1 and CNews.

Norway, also targeted by Trump's tariffs threat but like Britain not an EU member, said it was not currently looking at retaliation against US goods.</description><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 22:24:54 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/6b5fab42-f497-11f0-ab40-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/71de17683b09ba461a39c3f57f96f7f2cdadb6da.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>High-speed train collision in southern Spain kills at least 10, police say</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260118-rail-accident-spain-trains-collide</link><description>At least 10 people have been killed and several injured after two trains collided in southern Spain, the emergency services said Sunday.

A police spokesman initially told AFP there were five dead after the accident in the province of Cordoba, but soon after updated the toll to 10.

A train travelling from Malaga to Madrid derailed near Adamuz, crossing onto the other track where it hit an oncoming train, which also derailed, Spain's ADIF rail body posted on X.

"We have received calls from people reporting that there were injured and trapped," a spokesperson for the Andalusian emergency services told AFP.

One witness told public broadcaster TVE that one of the carriages of the first train had completely overturned.

Television images showed medical crews and fire services at the scene.

A journalist from public broadcaster RNE who was travelling on one of the trains said the impact had felt like "an earthquake".

Passengers had used emergency hammers to break carriages windows and get out, he said.

Spanish media reports suggested that a total of 400 people have been on the two trains.

Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said in a statement he was "closely monitoring" the situation.

The president of the Madrid region, Isabel Diaz Ayuso said its hospitals were available to the Andalusia region if required.

Rail travel between Madrid and Andalusia has been suspended.</description><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 22:47:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/01195416-f4bc-11f0-8f95-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26018782994454.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukraine's top commander says Russia plans big boost in drone production</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/ukraines-top-commander-says-russia-plans-big-boost-drone-production-2026-01-18/</link><description>Jan 18 (Reuters) - Ukraine's top military commander said Russia is showing no signs of interest in talks leading to a peace deal and, instead, is boosting arms production, including a target of 1,000 drones per day.

"On the contrary, we see an increase in intensity of military actions, an increase in the number of offensive enemy groupings, an increase in production of strike weapons, missiles and drones," Oleksandr Syrskyi told the online media outlet lb.ua in an interview published on Sunday.

"At the moment, the enemy produces daily 404 'Shaheds' (Iranian-designed drones) of different kinds. And the plans are to increase that. The enemy plans to boost production significantly, up to 1,000 drones a day."

Ukraine's military, he said, has to do "everything to disrupt these plans and inflict losses so that the enemy renounces its plans, and also to create conditions in order to hold talks. No one is going to make a deal with a weak side."

Syrskyi also praised the Ukrainian military's "deep-strike" tactics, which he described as "our strong point," resulting in hits on 719 targets and $15 billion in damage, mainly to Russia's oil industry.

Ukraine has rapidly developed its capacity to produce drones since Russia launched its invasion of its smaller neighbour in February 2022 and is counting on further advances.

Russian forces hold about 20% of Ukrainian territory and are engaged in a slow advance through eastern Ukraine, announcing the capture of new villages several times a week.

Military leaders have stressed the importance of developing "interceptor drones" as the most efficient and economical means of combating Russian drone attacks, rather than using missiles.

Syrskyi acknowledged that Russia had the possibility to draw on far higher numbers to deploy in its units, but said mobilisation figures had improved in recent months.

"I can say this: we have much improved numbers in this regard than was the case, say, seven months ago," he told lb.ua.

The improvement, he said, was due to better operation of recruitment centres and training and "in terms of working with people, because we understand that, first of all, problems arise where there is no proper human treatment towards the people being mobilized".

Syrskyi also said Ukrainian losses in 2025 had been reduced by 13% compared to the previous year "while at the same time the level of enemy losses has risen significantly".</description><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 23:43:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7VI5MIER7RLW3EDDRH5PYV7W2E.jpg?auth=78ea9a96ff9eb90dc17b3c306b4a81ac8225df506f2dca03fe062b7970ba8ece&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Guatemala says gangs killed seven police in retaliation over prison transfers</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260118-gang-guatemala-kill-seven-police-prison</link><description>Guatemala' s interior minister accused gangs of killing seven police on Sunday in retaliation for the government's refusal to transfer gang leaders to a lower-security prison.

The killings occurred in the Guatemalan capital and surrounding areas a day after gang-affiliated inmates took 46 people hostage in three prisons across the country. Police regained control of one of the prisons on Sunday.

"I am deeply saddened by the deaths of seven National Civil Police officers who were cowardly attacked by these terrorists in response to the actions the Guatemalan state is taking against them," Interior Minister Marco Antonio Villeda told a press conference.

Ten other police officers were wounded in the retaliatory attacks, and one suspected gang member was killed, he said.

Guatemalan President Bernardo Arevalo announced on X he had convened an emergency cabinet meeting on Sunday to make "decisive decisions to maintain security."

Earlier on Sunday, police supported by the army entered the Renovacion I maximum-security prison at dawn in Escuintla, about 75 kilometers (45 miles) south of Guatemala City, using armored vehicles and tear gas.

After 15 minutes, they managed to regain control of the prison and free guards being held hostage, an AFP photographer witnessed.

"It was an operation that unfolded without casualties on either side, and we managed to rescue the nine hostages that these terrorists had in their power," Villeda said.

The Ministry of the Interior published a video on X showing officers handcuffing and leading away the alleged leader in Guatemala of the Barrio 18 criminal organization, whom authorities identified as Aldo Dupie, alias "El Lobo" (The Wolf). He had bloodstained clothing.

Barrio 18 and the rival gang Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) are blamed for much of the drug trafficking and criminal violence that plague the Central American country. Washington has declared both groups to be terrorist organisations.

Since Saturday morning, the inmates had been holding 45 guards and a psychiatrist hostage to protest the transfer of gang leaders to a maximum-security prison.

The gang members are still holding hostages at the two other prisons: 28 at Fraijanes II located east of the Guatemalan capital, and nine at the Preventivo prison on the outskirts of city.

Villeda acknowledged that the government is "negotiating" with the prison rioters to secure the release of hostages, but insisted that the state "will not bow down to these criminals."

Defense Minister Major General Henry Saenz said the army "will remain on the streets" to continue "dismantling" criminal groups.

Since mid-2025, gang members have staged uprisings at prisons to demand their leaders be held in less-restricted conditions.

In October, Guatemalan authorities reported that 20 leaders of the Barrio 18 gang had escaped from a prison. Only six have been recaptured, while another was shot and killed.

Guatemala ended last year with a homicide rate of 16.1 per 100,000 inhabitants, more than double the global average.</description><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 23:45:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/af1e14fc-f4a3-11f0-ac30-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/d7b9165f2389dcd7eaaf61143e659592877fdd95.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>CBS News to air previously pulled '60 Minutes' report on El Salvador prison</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/cbs-news-air-previously-pulled-60-minutes-report-el-salvador-prison-2026-01-19/</link><description>Jan 18 (Reuters) - CBS News will air on Sunday night the previously shelved "60 Minutes" report on a Salvadoran mega-prison housing migrants deported from the United States, according to new programming details released by the network.

The report was postponed in December, with CBS saying the story required additional reporting. The network also removed a link to the "Inside CECOT" segment page that day and said the piece would be broadcast at a later date.

CECOT is a mega-prison in El Salvador where the U.S. has sent hundreds of mostly Venezuelan migrants without trial, and it has been condemned by human rights groups for its harsh conditions.

For Sunday's broadcast, CBS added a description stating that "last year, the Trump administration deported hundreds of Venezuelans to El Salvador, a country most had no ties to, claiming they were terrorists."

The segment features correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi speaking with Venezuelan men who were later released, and who describe conditions inside the facility as "brutal and torturous".

"CBS News leadership has always been committed to airing the 60 MINUTES CECOT piece as soon as it was ready. Tonight, viewers get to see it, along with other important stories," the network said in a statement on Sunday.

The segment on CECOT, which included allegations that Venezuelan deportees sent to the prison were tortured and raised questions about how the U.S. characterized them, was mistakenly streamed on Canada's Global TV app in December, a CBS spokesperson previously told Reuters.

The decision comes as Bari Weiss implements changes at the network after being chosen to lead CBS News in October, following Paramount Skydance's (PSKY.O) , opens new tab acquisition of The Free Press, the online publication she founded.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 01:52:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/E6MKORVYXFNNJFRJVMZ7I4GO6A.jpg?auth=9e92b48d3b36d39a2312ab84544a878b9ec1bedf38ef83580bb9a78fc8e60495&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Vietnam's Communist Party begins congress to choose its leader</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/vietnams-communist-party-begins-congress-choose-its-leader-2026-01-19/</link><description>HANOI, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Hundreds of delegates from Vietnam's ruling Communist Party will gather Monday under tight security for a congress that will select the single-party country's top leader and set economic goals for the remainder of the decade.

The week-long event , which operates under opaque rules and convenes every five years, could cement and possibly expand power for the party's current general secretary, To Lam, who has launched sweeping bureaucratic reforms at home and become Vietnam's public face overseas.

About 1,600 delegates will elect a 200-person Central Committee, which then will pick up to 17 to 19 members of the Politburo from which the general secretary is chosen.

Lam is seeking to retain his role and possibly take on the state presidency, which has recently been held by a military leader, officials briefed on the matter said.

The congress is likely to confirm him as general secretary, according to multiple officials, although surprises cannot be ruled out, while the decision about the presidency is expected to be made at a later meeting where the outcome is even less clear.

After the congress, the Politburo will nominate the heads of state, government and Parliament. Parliamentary elections will take place only after leaders are chosen by the party.

Lam, 68, has launched several major reforms during his brief tenure as party chief, the country's most powerful job. He ascended to the position following the death of his predecessor, Nguyen Phu Trong , in July 2024.

Widely viewed as a risk-taker, Lam introduced the most significant administrative reform in decades when he cut tens of thousands of jobs in an effort to speed up decisions. The impact has yet to be fully assessed as officials adapt, but approval timelines for some investment projects have shortened.

That acceleration is tied in part to the scaling back of a sweeping anti‑corruption drive launched under Trong, an effort that Lam helped lead as public security minister. The campaign, which was meant to combat systemic bribery, at times paralysed government decision‑making and led to the downfall of senior figures - including two presidents - clearing Lam's path to the top.

Lam has also launched economic reforms and a burst of infrastructure projects, winning favour with foreign investors while stoking concerns about favouritism and waste.

In a country that allows no opposition, Lam has presided over a strengthening of the security forces and a tightening of controls over media and dissidents.

The congress' delegates represent 5.6 million party members in a country of 100 million.

Under tight security - mobile phones will be jammed in the Hanoi building where the congress will take place - they will also refine the text of a resolution to be approved by the end of the congress, which is scheduled to wrap up on January 25.

A party draft released in October on the party's website suggests the final text will prioritise security and ambitious growth, targeting at least 10% annually over the next five years, from the 6.5% to 7.0% target that was missed in the first half of the decade.

The draft mentions security dozens of times and highlights the importance of diplomacy and defence in a "more dangerous" world. The party intends to increase its defence forces, especially in border areas, the draft text says.

Environmental protection, which has been increasingly debated recently in the heavily polluted country, has also gained prominence, according to Politburo member Nguyen Xuan Thang.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 01:53:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BL73QSJ32NNPFESSGJ2I37XUBQ.jpg?auth=8fd3d620bbfb826d8f413a07d3a46ffb482eb7c6bbf59df67de053b61647f04d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Australia parliament returns with moment of silence for Bondi mass shooting victims</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/australia-parliament-returns-with-moment-silence-bondi-mass-shooting-victims-2026-01-19/</link><description>SYDNEY, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Australia's parliament returned early on Monday with speeches and a moment of silence for those killed in the Bondi Beach mass shooting, as victims' families watched from the public gallery.

Two gunmen who police allege were inspired by Islamic State opened fire at a Jewish Hanukkah event on the city's iconic Bondi Beach last month, killing 15 people in the country's worst such incident in decades.

The attack shocked the nation and led to calls for tougher action on antisemitism and gun control, with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese pledging tougher action on both.

"As we offer our love, sympathy and solidarity to everyone bearing the weight of trauma and loss, we make it clear to every Jewish Australian, you are not alone," Albanese told parliament on Monday, following a moment of silence for those killed in the attack, as first responders and victims' families watched on.

Lawmakers had been due to return from their Southern Hemisphere summer break next month, but Albanese recalled parliament two weeks early to commemorate victims and begin debate on gun control and hate speech reforms.

Albanese said on Saturday he would amend proposed hate speech laws and move gun control reforms into a separate piece of legislation, after conservative opposition and Greens parties said they would opposed a combined bill.

"The gun laws will be separate and then the laws on hate crimes and migration will proceed. But we will not be proceeding with the racial vilification provisions because it's clear that that will not have support," he told reporters.

Opposition Liberal Party leader Sussan Ley said last week the proposed clause on racial vilification threatened free speech.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 01:54:10 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/AS5LJRAWAJP4JNFTWUJM3RPZBE.jpg?auth=15ae352b6ea99b1fe9c3d65b9d9f93f0c63faa0d489ae853a74f35a1911acb69&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Billionaires' wealth hits new peak as their clout grows, Oxfam says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/davos/billionaires-wealth-hits-new-peak-their-clout-grows-oxfam-says-2026-01-19/</link><description>Jan 19 (Reuters) - Billionaire wealth surged at three times its recent pace last year to reach its highest level on record, deepening economic and political divides that threaten democratic stability, anti-poverty group ​Oxfam said on Monday.

In a report timed for the opening of the World Economic ‌Forum in Davos, the charity said the fortunes of global billionaires jumped 16% in 2025 to $18.3 trillion, extending an 81% rise since 2020.

The gains happened even as one in four people worldwide struggle to eat regularly and nearly half the global population live in poverty.

Oxfam’s study, which draws on academic ‌research and data sources ranging from the World Inequality Database to Forbes' rich ​list, argues that the wealth boom is being matched by a dramatic concentration of political clout, with billionaires 4,000 times more likely than ordinary citizens to hold political office.

The group links ‍the latest wealth surge to policies under U.S. President Donald Trump, whose second administration has cut taxes , shielded multinational corporations from international pressure and eased scrutiny of monopolies .

Soaring valuations of artificial intelligence companies have added further windfall gains for already ⁠wealthy investors.

"The widening gap between the rich and the rest is at the same time ‍creating a political deficit that is highly dangerous and unsustainable," Oxfam's executive director Amitabh Behar said.

Oxfam urged governments ‌to adopt ‌national inequality reduction plans, impose higher taxes on extreme wealth and strengthen firewalls between money and politics, including curbs on lobbying and campaign financing.

Wealth taxes are levied in just a few countries such as Norway at present but others, from Britain to France and Italy, have debated similar moves.

The ⁠Nairobi-based charity calculates that ⁠the $2.5 trillion added ​to billionaires' fortunes last year is roughly equal to the stock of wealth held by the poorest 4.1 billion people.

The world’s billionaire population surpassed 3,000 for the first time last year, with Tesla and SpaceX chief ‍Elon Musk becoming the first individual to exceed $500 billion in net worth.

Behar warned that governments are "making wrong choices to pander to the elite," pointing to aid cuts and the rollback of civil liberties.

The report highlights what it ​calls the expanding grip of ultra‑wealthy business figures over traditional ‍and digital media.

Billionaires now own more than half of the world’s major media firms, Oxfam said, citing holdings by Jeff ​Bezos, Elon Musk, Patrick Soon‑Shiong and France's Vincent Bolloré.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 01:54:19 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/TGST3XWF3RNN7EGC6OBD2VDC6Q.jpg?auth=9cd23015379c242336fccc74689600cd9720f7bd26ee6dbd6ed34bd1018e53d2&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Billionaires’ wealth hits record in 2025, Oxfam warns of 'dangerous' political risks ahead of Davos</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/economy/20260119-billionaire-wealth-political-oxfam-davos-trump-musk</link><description>The collective wealth of the planet's billionaires soared to a record level in 2025, charity Oxfam reported Monday, warning of "highly dangerous" political consequences as the global elite gathers for the World Economic Forum .

US President Donald Trump 's policies in particular spurred the fortunes of the ultra-rich, which jumped 16.2 percent in the first year of his second term to $18.3 trillion, the NGO said in a report released each year ahead of the Davos forum.

"Actions of the Trump presidency including the championing of deregulation and undermining agreements to increase corporate taxation have benefited the richest around the world," Oxfam said.

The world now has more than 3,000 billionaires for the first time, it added, with the top 12 -- led by Tesla and SpaceX chief Elon Musk -- having "more wealth than the poorest half of humanity, or more than four billion people".

Increasingly this money is buying political power, Oxfam said, pointing in particular to tycoons' buying newspapers and other media , such as Musk's takeover of X or the purchase of The Washington Post by Amazon's Jeff Bezos.

"The widening gap between the rich and the rest is at the same time creating a political deficit that is highly dangerous and unsustainable," Oxfam's executive director Amitabh Behar said.

Trump will arrive with one of the biggest US delegations ever for the Davos conference, where he is expected to dominate an agenda officially billed as "A Spirit of Dialogue".

Trump's participation galvanised around 300 protesters who arrived in Davos on Sunday, many wearing masks of Musk or US Vice President JD Vance and holding fistfuls of euros.

Nathalie Ruoss of the Swiss Young Socialists told AFP the most powerful people in the world make decisions at Davos that impact everyone.

"And they do it with no democratic legitimacy," she said, calling it "unacceptable" that the WEF welcomed "fascists like Donald Trump".

For Oxfam, Washington's decision to exempt US multinationals from an internationally agreed minimum tax rate of 15 percent was a stark example of ignoring growing inequality.

"In country after country, the super-rich have not only accumulated more wealth than could ever be spent, but have also used this wealth to secure the political power to shape the rules that define our economies and govern nations," it said.

"Such power gives billionaires a grasp over all our futures, undermining political freedom and eroding the rights of the many."</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 01:54:39 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/dd2884da-f08f-11f0-93c0-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/240ded13c15db2fc62222f662550c13cb448c079.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Australian boy in critical condition after Sydney Harbour shark attack</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/australian-boy-critical-condition-after-sydney-harbour-shark-attack-2026-01-19/</link><description>SYDNEY, Jan 19 (Reuters) - An Australian boy was in critical condition after being bitten by a shark in Sydney, authorities said on Monday, after heavy rain created ideal conditions for sharks to enter the city's harbour.

The boy, believed to be 12 or 13, had been jumping off rocks with friends late on Sunday afternoon at a beach in Vaucluse, around 9 km (5.5 miles) from the CBD and in the harbour, when he was attacked by the shark.

He was pulled from the water by friends and emergency services with severe injuries to both legs, and remains in a critical condition.

"He's in for the fight of his life now, and the actions of emergency services yesterday gave him that chance," New South Wales Police Superintendent Joseph McNulty told reporters on Monday.

The attack follows days of heavy rain that filled the harbour with fresh water, creating ideal conditions for the bull shark suspected to be behind the attack - a species that thrives in brackish water.

"We believe the combination of the brackish water, the fresh water, the actions of the splashing may have made that perfect storm environment for that shark attack yesterday," McNulty said.

Australia sees around 20 shark attacks per year with just under three of those being fatalities, according to data from conservation groups - numbers that are dwarfed by drownings and other accidents on the country's beaches.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 03:51:22 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>New Zealand and Kiribati relationship warms with partnership agreement</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/new-zealand-kiribati-relationship-warms-with-partnership-agreement-2026-01-19/</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 04:55:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>China's wedding dress sellers pin hopes on rise in marriages</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-wedding-dress-sellers-pin-hopes-rise-marriages-2026-01-19/</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 04:55:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Trump says "it will be done" on getting "Russian threat" away from Greenland</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/trump-says-it-will-be-done-getting-russian-threat-away-greenland-2026-01-19/</link><description>Jan 18 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Sunday that Denmark has not been able to do anything to get the "Russian threat" away from Greenland, and said, "Now it is time, and it will be done!!!"

"NATO has been telling Denmark, for 20 years, that "you have to get Russian threat away from Greenland." Unfortunately, Denmark has been unable to do anything about it," Trump wrote in a post on the social media website he owns called Truth Social.

The White House, the Danish Presidency in the European Union, and Denmark's foreign affairs ministry did not immediately respond to a Reuters' request for comment.

Trump has repeatedly insisted he will settle for nothing less than ownership of Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark.

Leaders of both Denmark and Greenland have insisted the island is not for sale and does not want to be part of the United States.

Trump on Saturday vowed to implement a wave of increasing tariffs on European allies until the United States is allowed to buy Greenland.

The encroaching presence of China and Russia makes Greenland vital to U.S. security interests, Trump has said. Danish and other European officials have pointed out that Greenland is already covered by NATO's collective security pact.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:33:49 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/S7KRIHS46RP45I45DNSIBLGKFY.jpg?auth=49cd0df22e729cca0707ca3720b9b01bd77c288ab9a919d6cf2f3a8cb1988b52&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Portugal socialist wins first round, to face far-right rival in presidential runoff</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260119-portugal-socialist-far-right-presidential-runoff</link><description>Portugal 's socialist candidate won the first round of the presidential election and will face the far-right candidate in the second round, near-complete results showed Sunday.

With votes from 95 percent of constituencies counted, Socialist Antonio Jose Seguro was leading with 30.6 percent of the vote, while far-right contender Andre Ventura came in second with 24.2 percent.

The liberal candidate Joao Cotrim Figueiredo was in third place with 15.5 percent.

Ventura and Seguro will face off on February 8 to decide who succeeds conservative incumbent Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa.

Opinion polls in the run-up to the election had suggested that Ventura was the favourite for the first round.

This will nevertheless be the first time a far-right candidate has made it to the second round of the presidential race.

During the campaign, Seguro had argued that he was the only one capable of defeating Ventura's "extremism" and had called on "all democrats" to unite behind him.

While the role of president is largely ceremonial, in times of crisis the incumbent can dissolve parliament, call elections or dismiss a prime minister.

Portugal's prime minister, right-winger Luis Montenegro, said he would not be giving any advice on who to vote for in the second round.

His minority government already relies on Ventura's Chega party for support to implement some of its policies.

This is the first time in four decades that no candidate has won outright in the first round by securing more than 50 percent of the vote.

Ventura said he felt "very confident" after casting his vote in the sunny capital.

"We cannot spend our time criticising things and then sit on the couch on the day we are called to make a decision," he said.

"I believe in the good sense of the Portuguese," said Ventura after voting in his home city of Caldas da Rainha.

As he finished his first-round campaign, he called on other parties on the right not to stand in his way if he makes it to the second round.

And in his final election rally he toughened his tone, saying he would refuse to try to please everyone and promising to "put some order" into the country.

Voting in Lisbon, Alexandre Leitao, a 50-year-old biologist, said he had voted left wing to stave off the "very negative shift toward the far right".

"We young people are not happy with the country we have," said 33-year-old Irina Ferestreoaru.

She said public approval of Ventura was "a warning sign for the country, because people are desperate to see change".

Analysts say Ventura has his sights set on eventually running the country as prime minister.

"Andre Ventura is running to keep his voter base," said Antonio Costa Pinto, a political scientist at Lisbon University.

Chega's party emerged as the biggest opposition party in parliament after a general election last May, overtaking the Socialists.

"Another solid result for the far right would confirm its domination over the political landscape," consulting firm Teneo said in a note.

Investors have worried that independent monetary policymaking in Southeast Asia's largest economy might be under pressure as Prabowo targets economic growth of 8% by 2029, from about 5% now.

Those fears grew after Bank Indonesia unveiled a new burden-sharing deal last year to fund some government programmes.

Thomas Djiwandono, a deputy finance minister who is a former businessman, will soon face a fit-and-proper test by parliament for the new job, said the two sources, who sought anonymity as they were not authorised to speak to media.

The U.S.-educated Djiwandono will replace current BI board member Juda Agung, one of the sources added.

Djiwandono, Agung, the central bank's spokesperson, and the chairman of a paliamentary panel overseeing assessments for top central bank leadership did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Prabowo's spokesperson declined to comment.

The bank is set to hold its next monthly monetary policy review later this week.

Each member of the bank's board, comprised of a governor and several deputy governors, has a voting right to decide key interest rate levels and determines BI's policy.

Members are usually career central bankers, economists or former executives of commercial banks appointed by the president with parliamentary approval.

Domestic media IDNFinancials also reported the appointment, citing a source who said Djiwandono was expected to take up the new post in February, barring last-minute changes.

Last year, Djiwandono attended at least one central bank monetary policy review as a representative of the finance minister, but did not have a right to vote.

The move comes as parliament discusses a bill with provisions to strengthen the central bank's role in supporting economic growth.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 06:39:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4FFJS5NDIRN4RLTWFW5C5HXPGA.jpg?auth=fdb0f44be280c43c97e23f9554a33e80cda9effb4f83b29297f4c039f51db1f6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Lawyer files impeachment complaint against Philippine President Marcos</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/lawyer-files-impeachment-complaint-against-philippine-president-marcos-2026-01-19/</link><description>MANILA, Jan 19 (Reuters) - A lawyer filed an impeachment complaint against Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr on Monday, accusing him of betraying public trust by allowing his predecessor Rodrigo Duterte to be arrested and taken to The Hague to face trial.

The complaint, filed by Andre De Jesus, described the move against Duterte as an act of "kidnapping," echoing the narrative of the former president's family.

Duterte, president from 2016 to 2022, was arrested and taken to the International Criminal Court in the Hague in March over the thousands of killings that took place during his controversial war on drugs.

The complaint also accuses Marcos of constitutional violations over budget irregularities, failing to act against alleged graft involving flood control projects, and failing to answer allegations of drug use that have raised questions about his fitness to govern.

"We feel that this avenue would enable not just myself as complainant ... but the Filipino people to thrash out all these matters which are being raised and are not answered at all by the president and his cabinet and his officers," De Jesus told reporters in comments posted on X by DZRH radio.

Marcos' office said it respects this democratic process and would "trust that Congress, as a co-equal branch of government, will discharge its duties with honesty, integrity, and fidelity to the rule of law."

"While these processes take their course, the President will continue to govern, ensuring that public services remain uninterrupted and that the work of government stays focused on improving the lives of our people," the presidential communications office said in a statement.

The filing comes nearly a year after the lower house impeached Sara Duterte, Marcos' estranged Vice President and the daughter of his predecessor.

The impeachment was later struck down by the Supreme Court for breaching the Constitution's one‑year bar rule.

Although the lower house of Congress is no longer led by Marcos' cousin, Martin Romualdez, who resigned as House Speaker after being linked to the flood control corruption scandal, it remains dominated by the president's allies, raising doubts about whether the complaint against him can gain traction.

Marcos, elected in 2022, is serving a single six‑year term and is barred by the Constitution from seeking re‑election in 2028, leaving him with about two years remaining in office.

His vice president Sara Duterte is widely viewed as a strong contender for the 2028 presidential race.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 06:39:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/DWHNUHMKVFMZ3IVLN6IPMG4J3Q.jpg?auth=6a83c9fac72aaffbfdfcf9874f13281cde33d6004f45b5c795610759e766bb91&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Death toll in Karachi mall fire jumps to 11</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/death-toll-karachi-mall-fire-jumps-11-2026-01-19/</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 06:40:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Live: EU leaders to meet 'in coming days' to discuss US tariffs over Greenland</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260119-live-eu-leaders-to-meet-in-the-coming-days-to-discuss-us-tariffs-over-greenland</link><description>The eight European countries targeted by US President Donald Trump for a 10% tariff for opposing American control of Greenland blasted the move Sunday, warning that his threats “undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral.”

The joint statement by some of America’s closest allies signaled a possible turning point in the recent tensions over sovereignty and security nearly 24 hours after Trump’s threat.

It was also the most forceful rebuke of Trump from the European allies since he returned to the White House almost a year ago. In recent months, Europeans have mostly opted for diplomacy and flattery around him, even when seeking an end to the war in Ukraine.

Sunday’s statement, as well as some European countries sending troops to Greenland for a Danish military training exercise, appeared to be a step away from that strategy.

Perseus said it is continuing its investigation into the accident and is working closely with the relevant Ivorian authorities.

Reuters reported in December last year that the West African nation introduced new revenue-raising measures, including a flat 8% gold royalty, which miners initially refused to pay as unlawful under contract protections before entering talks to have it scrapped.

Chapo wrote in a post on Facebook late on Sunday that Mozambique "is going through a tough time ... (and) the absolute priority at this moment is to save lives".

Heavy rains since mid-December have caused widespread floods in Mozambique's Gaza, Maputo and Sofala provinces, with several river basins above alert levels, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said in a report on Sunday.

The OCHA report said authorities estimated that more than 400,000 people had been affected, with numbers expected to rise as rains continue.

Neighbouring South Africa has deployed an air force helicopter to Mozambique to help with search-and-rescue efforts.

Heavy rains have also affected parts of South Africa, including the northeast where its renowned Kruger National Park is located. On Monday Kruger reopened to day visitors after being closed for several days.

Flooding has become more frequent and severe in southeastern Africa as climate change makes storms in the adjacent Indian Ocean more powerful.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 07:31:16 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/6LDRPCBZERNMTAJCLLLF23WPCE.jpg?auth=6991d0d0e4ef985327f2be9641ec91f94050e5f8d782a481b99c19289eeead99&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Death toll from high-speed train collision in Spain rises to 39, RTVE reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/death-toll-high-speed-train-collision-spain-rises-39-rtve-reports-2026-01-19/</link><description>MADRID, Jan 19 (Reuters) - The death toll from Sunday's collision between a derailing high-speed train and a second oncoming train in southern Spain has risen to 39, with 152 people injured, state broadcaster RTVE reported on Monday, citing police sources.

The accident happened at 7.45 p.m. local time (1845 GMT) on Sunday near Adamuz in the province of Cordoba, about 360 km (223 miles) south of the capital Madrid.

Over 200 trains between Madrid and the southern Andalucia region - including major cities Cordoba, Seville and Granada - have been cancelled throughout Monday, according to RTVE.

Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has cleared out his agenda for the day, his office said in a statement on Monday.

Video from the scene shared on social media on Sunday showed rescuers pulling passengers from twisted carriages lying on their side under the glare of floodlights. Some passengers climbed out of smashed windows, while others were wheeled away on stretchers.

There were around 400 passengers on the two trains, most of them Spaniards travelling back to and from Madrid after the weekend. It was unclear how many tourists could be onboard as January is not holiday season in Spain.

The cause for the crash is not yet known, Spanish Transport Minister Oscar Puente told reporters at a press conference at Atocha station in Madrid on Sunday.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 07:31:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/M7AZOUYYSZP2XLHKEB7SWT3PLQ.jpg?auth=864b7384f3d8a7da425aaf0badd82ba094d8dc904b5b997b3939c0dab085d862&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Kazakhstan says Trump invited Tokayev to join the Gaza 'Board of Peace', Tengri news outlet reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/kazakhstan-says-trump-invited-tokayev-join-gaza-board-peace-tengri-news-outlet-2026-01-19/</link><description>MOSCOW, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev has been invited to join the Gaza "Board of Peace" proposed by U.S. President Donald Trump and Tokayev has agreed, the Tengri news outlet on Monday quoted the Kazakh president's press secretary as saying.

The board would be chaired for life by Trump and would start by addressing the Gaza conflict and then be expanded to deal with other conflicts, according to a copy of the letter and draft charter seen by Reuters.

Tokayev's spokesman, Ruslan Zheldibay, said that the Kazakhstan had been invited to become one of the founding states of the Board of Peace.

"The head of state sent a letter to the president of the United States expressing sincere gratitude and confirming his agreement to join this new association," Zheldibay was quoted as saying by Tengri.

Trump has invited 60 countries to join the "Board of Peace," of which he is to be the lifetime chairman, but permanent membership will be available to those who pay $1 billion.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 07:31:32 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/JS7PDY4NOBN4FIRFZDRZFZHETA.jpg?auth=a450138d952231a34021c8449a1a4fe83de521eabe813cac8f532bba39432650&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Japan PM Takaichi to dissolve parliament Friday and call national election</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/japan-pm-takaichi-dissolve-parliament-friday-call-national-election-2026-01-19/</link><description>TOKYO, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said she will dissolve parliament Friday and call a national election to seek voter backing for increased spending and a new security strategy expected to accelerate Japan's defence build up.

The snap vote will decide all 465 seats in parliament’s lower house and mark Takaichi's first electoral test since becoming Japan's first female premier in October.

Calling an early election would allow her to capitalise on strong public support to tighten her grip on the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and shore up her coalition’s fragile majority.

The election will test voter appetite for higher spending at a time when the rising cost of living is the public's top concern. A poll released by public broadcaster NHK last week found 45% of respondents cited prices as their main worry, followed by diplomacy and national security at 16%.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 09:36:39 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/G3QSGQK34NPZPLSKQUKHMF6Q2E.jpg?auth=30b3e299ea30fdf59fe9e2d7cdf542a18fae8a01db1e10bf7cebd1a425fc6b87&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>No phones, pre-set tablets for delegates at Vietnam's Communist Party congress</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/no-phones-pre-set-tablets-delegates-vietnams-communist-party-congress-2026-01-19/</link><description>HANOI, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Delegates at Vietnam's Communist Party congress that started on Monday were given Samsung tablet computers without an internet connection, had no access to the mobile phone network and will have to stay in designated accommodation, two people briefed on the matter said.

The moves are part of tighter security for the week-long, once in five years event at which the 1,600 delegates will select the country's top leader for the remainder of the decade, with incumbent party chief To Lam seeking reconfirmation and more powers.

The foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In strict arrangements even by Vietnamese standards, where the one-party state monopolises information, mobile connections were jammed at the Hanoi congress venue and in surrounding areas, according to a Reuters reporter at the conference centre.

Delegates, who will vote on an unspecified day this week to elect the party's 200-strong central committee and will approve the congress resolution, were given tablets with only intranet functions to work on internal documents during the event, the two people said, declining to be named because information about the congress is deemed sensitive.

The delegates met on Monday for a preparatory session in a red-carpeted conference hall at the congress venue, with leaders on the stage under a towering statue of the party's founder Ho Chi Minh and the images of Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin.

Delegates will also be prevented from carrying their mobile phones at the congress from Tuesday, a third person said, although the jamming of the mobile network will anyway make them useless for communication.

Representing roughly 5.6 million party members in the country of 100 million, delegates were also told to stay in designated accommodation during the week of the congress, including those from Hanoi, according to two sources.

Guidelines issued to reporters covering the congress prohibit them from carrying mobiles phones. They can use their own computers but can only connect to the event's network.

Journalists "shall not cause any negative impact on the image or reputation of Viet Nam, its senior leadership, or its delegates in any form," according to guidelines sent to foreign media by Vietnam's foreign ministry.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 09:36:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BNX2STO4ZFO2DPO5VDYWFU7NLM.jpg?auth=1021f955c7209841782e3456fae71b9b0a25beec03b4450e06cfe7c57d6c7468&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Kremlin says Trump would go down in world history if US took Greenland</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/kremlin-says-trump-would-go-down-world-history-if-us-took-greenland-2026-01-19/</link><description>MOSCOW, Jan 19 (Reuters) - The Kremlin said on Monday that it was hard to disagree with experts who said that U.S. President Donald Trump would go down in the history of the United States and the world if he took control of Greenland.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said he was not discussing whether such a step would be good or bad - simply stating a fact.

Trump has repeatedly insisted he will settle for nothing less than ownership of Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark. He has said that if the United States does not take control of Greenland, then Russia or China will.

When asked to comment on Trump's remarks about the alleged Russian threat, Peskov said that there has been a lot of "disturbing information" lately but that the Kremlin would not comment on the alleged Russian designs on Greenland.

"Here, perhaps, it is possible to abstract from whether this is good or bad, whether it will comply with the parameters of international law or not," Peskov said.

"There are international experts who believe that by resolving the issue of Greenland's incorporation, Trump will certainly go down in history. And not only in the history of the United States, but also in world history."

Leaders of both Denmark and Greenland have insisted the island is not for sale and does not want to be part of the United States.

Russia's foreign ministry last week said that it was unacceptable for the West to keep claiming that Russia and China threatened Greenland, and said the crisis over the territory showed the double-standards of Western powers which claimed moral superiority.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 10:29:47 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/3GP4NHJ22NIXBB4OTQENXOV5QI.jpg?auth=d9b56abca82753bfda71b66c775777aca715bb21faafffb1cfad89d6cf5e48a3&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran to consider lifting internet ban; state TV hacked</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/iran-consider-lifting-internet-ban-state-tv-hacked-2026-01-19/</link><description>DUBAI, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Iran may lift its internet blackout in a few days, a senior parliament member said on Monday, after authorities shut communications while they used massive force to crush protests in the worst domestic unrest since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.

In the latest sign of weakness in the authorities' control, state television appeared to be hacked late on Sunday, briefly showing speeches by U.S. President Donald Trump and the exiled son of Iran's last shah calling on the public to revolt.

Iran's streets have largely been quiet for a week since anti-government protests that began in late December were put down in three days of mass violence.

An Iranian official told Reuters on condition of anonymity that the confirmed death toll was more than 5,000 , including 500 members of the security forces, with some of the worst unrest taking place in ethnic Kurdish areas in the northwest. Western-based Iranian rights groups also say thousands were killed.

Opponents accuse the authorities of opening fire on peaceful demonstrators to crush dissent. Iran's clerical rulers say armed crowds egged on by foreign enemies attacked hospitals and mosques.

The death tolls dwarf those of previous bouts of anti-government unrest put down by the authorities in 2022 and 2009. The violence drew repeated threats from Trump to intervene militarily, although he has backed off since the large-scale killing stopped.

Ebrahim Azizi, the head of parliament's National Security and Foreign Policy Committee, said top security bodies would decide on restoring internet in the coming days, with service resuming "as soon as security conditions are appropriate".

Another parliament member, hardliner Hamid Rasaei, said authorities should have listened to earlier complaints by Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei about "lax cyberspace".

Iranian communications including internet and international phone lines were largely stopped in the days leading up to the worst unrest. The blackout has since partially eased, allowing accounts of widespread attacks on protesters to emerge.

During Sunday's apparent hack into state television, screens broadcast a segment lasting several minutes with the on-screen headline "the real news of the Iranian national revolution".

It included messages from Reza Pahlavi, the U.S.-based son of Iran's last shah, calling for a revolt to overthrow rule by the Shi'ite Muslim clerics who have run the country since the 1979 revolution that toppled his father.

Pahlavi has emerged as a prominent opposition voice and has said he plans to return to Iran, although it is difficult to assess independently how strong support for him is inside Iran.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 10:30:21 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7BAA77MZEFLCBE3ALQZUTUACCI.jpg?auth=5ae69833ffd7195a71729814a58e837f2d6e8f01fa2a2bf09c02843618af0a31&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Passion and debts: the mixed legacy of the 2006 Turin Games</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/passion-debts-mixed-legacy-2006-turin-games-2026-01-19/</link><description>TURIN, Italy, Jan 19 (Reuters) - When Turin hosted the Winter Olympics 20 years ago, it transformed the city's image from grey industrial home of the troubled Fiat car-making empire to smart Mecca for food, culture and sport.

But the event - remembered in the north-western Italian metropolis for its "Passion lives here" slogan - left a legacy of large debts and unused infrastructure that offers a cautionary tale for Milano Cortina 2026.

"The 2006 Games were very positive in terms of Turin's morale and international visibility, but less so in terms of long-term infrastructure legacy," said renowned Turinese architect Carlo Ratti.

Marco Boglione, founder and chairman of Turin-based Basicnet (BCNT.MI) , opens new tab , which controls apparel and sportswear brands including Kappa and Superga, recalls the 2006 Olympics as a collective civic effort that reawakened his city.

"There was an incredible participation from everyone, public and private bodies, Olympic committee, everyone. That was our secret ... Turin was the first Olympic city to do something I'd call popular, collective, and it went very well," he said.

Milan, Italy's financial capital, and the Alpine resort of Cortina d'Ampezzo will co-host the 2026 Winter Games from February 6-22.

Turin's Olympic candidacy was dreamed up in the 1990s as part of efforts to reinvent the city and reduce its dependency on Fiat , the once-mighty Italian auto giant that is now a part of the global Stellantis (STLAM.MI) , opens new tab group.

The late Fiat boss Giovanni Agnelli, a towering business leader of postwar Italy and the grandfather of Stellantis Chairman John Elkann, was one of the main backers of the Olympics idea.

The Games gave Turin new or upgraded sporting venues, its first metro line, pedestrianised squares, better motorway connections to Alpine resorts that hosted part of the Olympics - and a new sense of local self-confidence.

"It put us on the map," said Marco Gay, head of local business lobby Unione Industriali. "It gave us the impetus to change, not to be a one-company city but a city that knows how to excel and does well in many sectors."

Boglione, who enlivened the 2006 Olympics with night-time side events, said Turin was the first Winter Games host that embraced the Summer Olympics format, with "a big city, a big event, lots of fun and entertainment for people in town".

Tourism has flourished, thanks to top-notch museums - including the world's oldest Egyptian museum - and a spruced-up city centre that bears witness to Turin's past as home to the royal Savoy family and as unified Italy's first capital.

In recent years Turin, home city of soccer clubs Juventus and Torino, hosted the Eurovision Song Contest and the ATP tennis finals, with both events staged at the Inalpi Arena, a venue originally built for the Olympics.

Another Olympic site, the Oval, is a candidate to host speed skating races for the French Alps 2030 Winter Olympics.

But other facilities have been abandoned, with the most egregious examples in mountain valleys near Turin: the bobsleigh track in Cesana, closed since 2011, and ski jumps in Pragelato, also closed and abandoned.

In Turin itself, one of the Olympic Villages has had a troubled history, with parts vandalised and occupied by migrants and drug addicts, until the area was cleared and turned into student and social housing.

"It took a month just to clear out all the garbage and debris. They did a great job, after the previous administration had literally forgotten about us. Now the neighbourhood is liveable," said Gilberto, a pensioner who lives in the area.

Another part of the village, the so-called "arcate" (arches) - near Fiat's historic Lingotto factory, now a shopping mall and museum venue - is abandoned, with draft plans to turn them into a biotech park and a sports centre.

"The area ... as it is now is a real waste, a real shame, it would be perfect for cultural initiatives," said Aurora, a 21-year-old nursery student. "I was born and raised here, it's my neighbourhood, but there is nothing here".

Francesco Ramella, a transport policy expert at the University of Turin and a fellow at the free-market Istituto Bruno Leoni think tank, has estimated that the Turin Olympics cost 3.3 billion euros ($3.8 billion).

They brought long-term benefits worth 2.5 billion euros, factoring in additional tourism and upgraded infrastructure, meaning a net economic loss of 1.3 billion euros, the professor said.

Milano Cortina is currently budgeted at 5.2 billion euros, including 3.5 billion euros of public money for infrastructure, and 1.7 billion euros in private funds to organise and hold the Games.

According to a study by Italian lender Banca Ifis, they should generate a 5.3-billion-euro "Olympic windfall", including 1.2 billion euros in extra tourism revenue and 3 billion euros from upgraded infrastructure.

Turin had offered to host the Games again in 2026, saying it would have been a low-cost alternative, re-using the 2006 infrastructure. Once that was rejected, the city turned down the chance to co-host along with Milan and Cortina.

"We did Turin a favour by not participating in the three-way Olympics," Antonino Iaria, urban planning councillor in 2019-2021 for the anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S), told Reuters.

He said the city would have seen little benefit from hosting "just two or three competitions".

Turin is today one of Italy's most indebted cities, largely due to the cost of investments made from the 1990s to prepare the city for the Games, even if the financial situation is easing.

Debt fell to 3.3 billion euros at the end of 2025 from 3.5 billion euros in 2024. Nevertheless, debt-servicing costs, standing at nearly 240 million euros, took up nearly a fifth of current cash expenditure.

Architecture Professor Guido Montanari, deputy mayor for the M5S in 2016-2019, said the post-Olympics financial hangover forced the city into harsh budget austerity, with social and welfare spending particularly affected.

Having seen what happened in Turin, he said he was "against any kind of Olympics, I think they are really something that should be avoided".

Needless to say, Milano Cortina backers are confident theirs will be a different story.

"Every euro (for the Olympics) is a euro well spent," Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini, who hails from Milan, said in November.

The letter, seen by Reuters, came in response to a brief message to Trump from Norway's Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere and Finnish President Alexander Stubb opposing his decision to impose tariffs on European allies over their refusal to let the U.S. take control of Greenland, Stoere said in a statement.

"Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace, although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America," Trump wrote in the letter.

Stoere said he had repeatedly told Trump that the Norwegian Nobel Committee, which awards the peace prize, is independent and that Norway's government has no control over it.

Trump has openly campaigned for the Nobel Peace Prize, which last year was awarded to Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado.

Machado gave Trump her gold medal during a White House meeting last week, though the Norwegian Nobel Committee has said the prize cannot be transferred, shared or revoked.

In his letter, Trump also again questioned Danish sovereignty over Greenland , saying: "Denmark cannot protect that land from Russia or China, and why do they have a 'right of ownership' anyway?

"There are no written documents, it's only that a boat landed there hundreds of years ago, but we had boats landing there, also."

"The World is not secure unless we have Complete and Total Control of Greenland," Trump added.

Greenland, a vast, mineral-rich Arctic island, is an autonomous part of the Kingdom of Denmark.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 10:31:31 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KCDOH4LXLFOHNPFKV7ZFIP3GZE.jpg?auth=0958fed0e0e78c83c0372640dee4565c4a803ed719b177391166bcf04ed7506f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Putin’s special envoy Dmitriev to travel to Davos, meet members of U.S. delegation, sources say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/davos/putins-special-envoy-dmitriev-travel-davos-meet-members-us-delegation-sources-2026-01-19/</link><description>MOSCOW, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin's special envoy Kirill Dmitriev will travel to the Swiss resort of Davos this week and hold meetings with members of the U.S. delegation on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum, two sources with knowledge of the visit told Reuters on condition of anonymity.

Ukraine's top negotiator Rustem Umerov said on Sunday that talks with U.S. officials on a resolution of the nearly four-year-old war with Russia would continue at the World Economic Forum (WEF) this week.

Trump will attend this year's annual meeting in person, after addressing the gathering by video link last year. He will be accompanied by a large U.S. delegation.

The Kremlin has said that it is preparing to welcome U.S. Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner to Moscow for peace talks on Ukraine, but that no dates have been set yet.

Dmitriev travelled to the U.S. in December and held two days of talks with Witkoff and Kushner. He briefed Putin after returning from the trip.

Witkoff and Kushner later met with officials from Ukraine and Europe, and then separately with the Ukrainian delegation, led Umerov. Witkoff called the talks "productive and constructive."

Trump and Putin discussed the Ukraine war during a telephone call on December 29 that was described by the White House as "positive."

In an interview with Reuters on January 14, Trump said that Ukraine, not Russia, is holding up a potential peace deal, in a statement that stands in marked contrast to that of the European leaders.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 10:31:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/PHIJGKFNIVPBFLAQKMECGARI6Q.jpg?auth=bf541580f7c05e624b64e6ce8c73b2efced5bbac8908dba3515a75746cf59ba1&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>National security advisers to discuss Greenland in Davos</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/davos/national-security-advisers-discuss-greenland-davos-2026-01-19/</link><description>Jan 19 (Reuters) - National security advisers from a number of countries are due to meet on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos on Monday, with Greenland among the subjects on the agenda, diplomatic sources said.

A Swiss foreign ministry spokesperson would only confirm that a meeting was due to take place but declined to comment on its content, timing or the participants.

One European diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity said Greenland had been added to the agenda of the previously scheduled meeting since U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to impose extra tariffs on eight European countries until ownership of the Arctic island had been transferred to the United States.

Two other diplomatic sources said some of the security advisers would be represented by lower-level officials.

European leaders have called the Trump move wrong and are studying a number of possible trade retaliation measures.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 10:32:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HTYLGDRIFRKK7FHJMO3NCQVT2A.jpg?auth=6c236538e12a4902e8f1afa89c58a653217ce10cdda223cd6bb7dacb5403b318&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Turkey sees Syria-Kurdish forces deal as "historic turning point", security sources say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/turkey-sees-syriakurdish-forces-deal-historic-turning-point-security-sources-say-2026-01-19/</link><description>ANKARA, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Turkey sees an integration deal between Syria's government and Kurdish forces there as an "historic turning point", ahead of which the Turkish intelligence agency played an intensive role to ensure restraint by parties involved, Turkish security sources said on Monday.

Turkey, a strong supporter of Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa, sees the deal as critical to restoring state authority across Syria and to its own goal of eliminating terrorism at home, including advancing its long-running efforts toward securing peace with the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), the sources said.

Ankara is the strongest foreign backer of the administration in neighbouring Damascus and had threatened its own military operation against the Syrian Kurdish Democratic Forces (SDF) in the north if the group did not agree to come under central government control.

On Sunday, Syria and the SDF struck a wide-ranging deal to integrate the Kurdish civilian and military authorities, ending days of fighting in which Syrian troops captured territory including key oil fields.

The Turkish security sources said the fight against Islamic State in Syria would continue uninterrupted despite the agreement.

Turkey's intelligence agency MIT had been in dialogue with the United States - which mediated the Sunday agreement - and the Syrian government ahead of the deal, the sources said. MIT also maintained intensive contacts to ensure restraint among parties, including protecting civilians and critical infrastructure, in Syria in the run-up to the deal, they added.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 10:32:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/IRMM6JBPVJP3RBCULWZUJX4ID4.jpg?auth=95fa15e49fd1f7ef7768627152f67695521a295053fcf5b1c74bb5476509eec5&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>At least 11 schoolchildren killed in South Africa minibus crash, reports say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/least-11-schoolchildren-killed-south-africa-minibus-crash-reports-say-2026-01-19/</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 10:32:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>UK PM Starmer hopes calm discussion can avert trade war with Trump over Greenland</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/uk-pm-starmer-calls-calm-discussion-greenland-after-trump-tariff-threat-2026-01-19/</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 10:32:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Turkey sees Syria-Kurdish forces deal as "historic turning point", security sources say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/turkey-sees-syriakurdish-forces-deal-historic-turning-point-security-sources-say-2026-01-19/</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 10:32:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>At least 11 schoolchildren killed in South Africa minibus crash, reports say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/least-11-schoolchildren-killed-south-africa-minibus-crash-reports-say-2026-01-19/</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 10:32:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>UK PM Starmer hopes calm discussion can avert trade war with Trump over Greenland</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/uk-pm-starmer-calls-calm-discussion-greenland-after-trump-tariff-threat-2026-01-19/</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 10:32:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>National security advisers to discuss Greenland in Davos</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/davos/national-security-advisers-discuss-greenland-davos-2026-01-19/</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 10:33:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Turkey sees Syria-Kurdish forces deal as "historic turning point", security sources say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/turkey-sees-syriakurdish-forces-deal-historic-turning-point-security-sources-say-2026-01-19/</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 10:33:04 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>At least 11 schoolchildren killed in South Africa minibus crash, reports say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/least-11-schoolchildren-killed-south-africa-minibus-crash-reports-say-2026-01-19/</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 10:33:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>UK PM Starmer hopes calm discussion can avert trade war with Trump over Greenland</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/uk-pm-starmer-calls-calm-discussion-greenland-after-trump-tariff-threat-2026-01-19/</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 10:33:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Residents left without power as Russia targets Ukraine's energy grid</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/residents-left-without-power-as-russia-targets-ukraine-s-energy-grid</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 10:33:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/2a3b5d60-f51d-11f0-92ff-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260119-101549-101715-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'Ultimate litmus test': Can the EU stand up to Trump over Greenland?</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/ultimate-litmus-test-can-the-eu-stand-up-to-trump-over-greenland</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 10:33:32 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/10ebe494-f51b-11f0-b61d-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260119-100209-100830-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Deadly wildfires in southern Chile force thousands to flee</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260119-wildfires-southern-chile-leave-dead-force-thousands-to-flee</link><description>Wildfires raging across central and southern Chile on Sunday left at least 19 people dead, scorched thousands of acres of forest and destroyed hundreds of homes, authorities said, as the South American country swelters under a heatwave .

Chilean President Gabriel Boric declared a state of catastrophe in the country’s central Biobio region and the neighbouring Ñuble region, around 500 kilometers (300 miles) south of Santiago, the capital.

The emergency designation allows greater coordination with the military to rein in over two dozen active wildfires that have so far blazed through 8,500 hectares (21,000 acres), according to the national forestry agency.

In a press conference from the hard-hit city of Concepción in the Biobio region, Boric expressed his support and condolences to the victims and warned that the government's initial reports of 19 people killed and 300 houses destroyed were expected to rise as the extent of the losses came into focus.

He estimated the total number of affected homes in the Biobio region alone to be “certainly more than a thousand, just so far”. Already the fires ravaging the hillsides forced 50,000 people to evacuate.

“The first priority, as you know, in these emergencies is always to fight and extinguish the fire. But we cannot forget, at any time, that there are human tragedies here, families who are suffering,” he said. “These are difficult times.”

His address followed complaints from local authorities that for hours, destruction was everywhere and help was nowhere.

“Dear President Boric, from the bottom of my heart, I have been here for four hours, a community is burning and there is no (government) presence,” Rodrigo Vera, the mayor of the small coastal town of Penco in the Biobio region, said on a local radio station earlier Sunday. “How can a minister do nothing but call me to tell me that the military is going to arrive at some point?”

Firefighters struggled to extinguish the flames, with the heat and strong winds hampering their efforts. Temperatures topped 38C (100F) on Sunday, and the scorching weather was expected to persist through Monday.

“Weather conditions for coming hours are not good and indicate extreme temperatures,” said Interior Minister Álvaro Elizalde.

Residents said the fires took them by surprise after midnight, trapping them in their homes.

“Many people didn’t evacuate. They stayed in their houses because they thought the fire would stop at the edge of the forest,” said John Guzmán, 55, surveying the scene in Penco, where smoke blanketed the sky in an orange haze. “It was completely out of control. No one expected it."

The fire engulfed most of Penco, burning cars, a school and a church. Thousands of people scrambled to take refuge in makeshift emergency shelters.

"We fled running, with the kids, in the dark,” said Juan Lagos, 52.

The government imposed a nighttime curfew in the area. Charred bodies were found across fields, homes, along roads and in cars.

“From what we can see, there are people who died ... and we knew them well," said Víctor Burboa, 54. "Everyone here knew them.”

Wildfires afflict central and southern Chile every summer, typically reaching a peak in February as temperatures surge and the country continues to reel from a yearslong drought. In 2024, massive fires ripping across Chile's central coastline killed at least 130 people, becoming the nation's deadliest natural disaster since a devastating 2010 earthquake.

President Donald Trump vowed on ‌Saturday to implement a wave of increasing tariffs on imports from European allies until the United States is allowed to buy Greenland, intensifying a dispute over the future of Denmark's vast Arctic island.

"Germany and France agree: we will not allow ourselves to be blackmailed," German Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil said at his ministry ‌where he received his French counterpart.

"Blackmail between allies of 250 years, blackmail between ​friends, is obviously unacceptable," French Finance Minister Roland Lescure said at the same event.

EU leaders are set to discuss options at an emergency summit in Brussels on Thursday. One ‍option is a package of tariffs on 93 billion euros ($107.7 billion) of U.S. imports that could automatically kick in on February 6 after a six-month suspension.

"We Europeans must make it clear: the limit has been reached," Klingbeil ⁠said. "Our hand is extended but we are not prepared to be blackmailed."

The other option is the so ‍far never used "Anti-Coercion Instrument", which could limit access to public tenders, investments or banking activity or restrict trade in ‌services, ‌in which the U.S. has a surplus with the bloc, including in digital services.

Lescure said that although the EU's anti-coercion instrument was above all a deterrent, it should be considered in the current circumstances.

"France wants us to examine this possibility, hoping, of course, that deterrence will prevail," Lescure said. ⁠He added that he hoped ⁠the transatlantic relationship ​will return to being "friendly and based on negotiation, rather than a relationship based on threats and blackmail".

Klingbeil said he was not interested in escalation, as it would come at the expense of economies on both sides of the ‍Atlantic.

Klingbeil and Lescure's U.S. counterpart Scott Bessent said on Sunday that European "weakness" necessitated U.S. control of Greenland for global stability.

Lescure said that Europe needed to adopt reforms to boost its technological edge and productivity in order to ​prove that Europe was strong and not weak.

"Our objective in the ‍coming days, weeks, quarters and years is to politely but firmly convince Scott Bessent that he is wrong," Lescure said.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 10:56:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/TXB63CZR3NOMHNARH75SEEOJ64.jpg?auth=3fcb4b50a0e4f92b99215740c03a0b1528477be098f0082765bb7d97dbbec46d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Harry's lawyer tells UK court Daily Mail complicit in unlawful acts</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/prince-harry-elton-johns-lawsuit-against-daily-mail-publisher-begin-2026-01-19/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Prince Harry, Elton John and five other public figures were victims of widespread phone hacking and other unlawful acts by Britain's powerful Daily Mail with the complicity of executives and senior journalists, their lawyer told a court on Monday.

The British royal and other claimants accuse Associated Newspapers of unlawful behaviour from 1993 until 2011 and beyond in one of the most high-profile civil cases in the UK for years.
Associated calls the allegations part of a coordinated smear conspiracy against the press.
HARRY'S MISSION AGAINST PRESS

Over nine weeks, the legal team for Harry, singer John and the other claimants - John's husband David Furnish, actors Liz Hurley and Sadie Frost, anti-racism campaigner Doreen Lawrence and former lawmaker Simon Hughes - will argue private investigators instructed by the Mail unlawfully obtained material about them.

Their lawyer David Sherborne said practices included hacking voicemail messages, bugging landlines and obtaining private information by deception, known as "blagging".

"There can be little doubt that journalists and executives across the Mail titles engaged in or were complicit in the culture of unlawful information gathering that wrecked the lives of so many," Sherborne said in documents released at the start of the trial at London's High Court.

Harry, 41, who has long blamed the press for the death of his mother in a Paris car crash in 1997 as her vehicle sped away from paparazzi, listened on in court, sitting behind his lawyers with Frost and Hughes

Among those accused of involvement in wrongdoing were managing editors and senior journalists including the current editors of the Mail on Sunday and Sun newspapers.

Examples included finding out precise travel plans of Harry's former girlfriend Chelsy Davy, and a report about "private and intimate conversations" between Harry and his elder brother Prince William about a statement regarding images of their dead mother, the claimants' written submissions said.

In his witness statement, quoted in the submissions, Harry, whose case is based on 14 published newspaper stories, says the intrusion had been "terrifying" for loved ones, and created a "massive strain" on personal relationships, the submissions said.

Associated, whose titles had not previously been embroiled in the phone hacking scandal hanging over the British press for two decades until the case was filed in 2022, has denied wrongdoing and says the lawsuits should have been brought sooner.

It says evidence from former private detectives - some of whom have been convicted of crimes and whom Associated say have been paid by the claimants' legal team for their testimonies - was untrustworthy.

The publisher says the claimants, backed by rich supporters, were trying to reopen a public inquiry into press standards which was held almost 15 years ago after revelations of phone hacking caused public outrage.

Judge Matthew Nicklin's conclusions will not just put reputations on the line, but also determine legal costs running to tens of millions of dollars.

"This case asks whether Britain's most influential publisher truly sailed through the phone‑hacking era without touching the water — or whether it simply avoided the spotlight," media lawyer Mark Stephens said.

For Harry, it is the final instalment of his legal war on the British tabloids, having said it was his mission to clear up the press and hold those in senior positions to account.

He has already successfully sued Mirror Groups Newspapers (MGN) for damages while he won an apology and admission of some wrongdoing by Rupert Murdoch's British newspaper arm which settled ahead of a trial a year ago.

The prince is due to give evidence on Thursday, having become the first British royal to appear in a witness box in 130 years in 2023 during the MGN trial.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 10:58:22 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/JL3A7VKR6ZNRTKST5BT6LLP7EA.jpg?auth=8ceccde57911f0c914e0dde3920c62fbb44482effe6f624b4ee173d271bab1d2&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Shooting at Czech town hall kills one, shooter also dead, police say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/shooting-czech-town-hall-kills-one-shooter-also-dead-police-say-2026-01-19/</link><description>PRAGUE, Jan 19 (Reuters) - A woman was killed and at least four other people including a police officer were wounded in a shooting at a Czech village's town hall on Monday, police said, adding the attacker had also been killed.

Trump stunned Europe on Saturday when he vowed to slap EU members Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Sweden – and non-members Britain and Norway – with levies of up to 25 percent unless the Danish territory is ceded to the US.

French President Emmanuel Macron has raised the prospect of hitting back with the EU's trade weapon that was established in 2023 but has never been activated.

The leader of the liberal Renew group in the European Parliament , Valerie Hayer, also called for the weapon to be used.

Referred to as a "bazooka" or "nuclear" option, the instrument is intended to deter economic coercion against any of the EU's 27 member states.

The EU defines coercion as a third country "applying – or threatening to apply – measures affecting trade or investment", thereby interfering "with the legitimate sovereign choices" of the EU and member states.

The armoury allows the EU to take measures such as import and export restrictions on goods and services in its single market of 450 million people.

It also gives Brussels the power to limit American companies' access to public procurement contracts in Europe .

The EU last year threatened to use the weapon during difficult trade negotiations with Trump to avoid steep levies but the two sides struck a deal.

A major target could be American tech giants since the US has a services surplus with the EU.

Brussels previously drew up a list of US services to potentially target.

The instrument's creation came after Lithuania accused China of banning its exports because Vilnius allowed a Taiwanese diplomatic representation to be opened on its soil in 2021.

Both the commission and member states have the right to seek its activation, but it would then need the green light of at least 55 percent of the member countries voting in favour, representing 65 percent of the bloc's population.

Even if Brussels were to activate the weapon, it could take months before any measures were taken, according to the rules.

First, the European Commission has four months to investigate the third country accused of detrimental trade policies – then member states would have eight to 10 weeks to back any proposal for action.

Only then would the commission have a green light to prepare measures, to take effect within six months. The EU says the timeframe is indicative.

But even just triggering an investigation under the instrument would send a powerful message that Brussels is willing to fight back against its important ally.

"The United States is making a miscalculation that is not only dangerous but could be painful," Renew group's Hayer said in a statement.

"The anti-coercion instrument is our economic nuclear weapon," she said.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 11:00:02 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/dfd7a142-de57-11f0-9e40-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25353107331920.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Influential Israeli minister Smotrich calls for US-led centre for Gaza to be shuttered</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/influential-israeli-minister-smotrich-calls-us-led-centre-gaza-be-shuttered-2026-01-19/</link><description>JERUSALEM, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich urged Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday to shut a U.S.-led multinational coordinating centre that supports President Donald Trump’s plan to end the Gaza war .

Washington established the Civil Military Coordination Centre (CMCC) last October as a centre for civilian and military personnel from other countries to work alongside U.S. and Israeli officials on post-war Gaza planning.

"The time has come to dismantle the headquarters in Kiryat Gat," said Smotrich, the influential, far-right cabinet minister, in remarks shared by his office to media, referring to the Israeli city northeast of Gaza where the centre is based.

The Israeli prime minister's office, the U.S. State Department and the U.S. military's Central Command did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the remarks.

Smotrich also said that Britain, Egypt and other countries that are "hostile to Israel and undermine its security" should be removed from the CMCC. The British and Egyptian foreign ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Central Command in December said that 60 countries and organisations were represented at the centre. The CMCC has also been tasked with facilitating humanitarian aid entering Gaza.

The U.S.-led CMCC was established after Trump announced his 20-point plan to end the war. Germany, France, and Canada are also among countries that have sent personnel there.

Smotrich, speaking at an event marking the establishment of a new Jewish settlement in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, said that Hamas should be given a "very short" ultimatum to disarm and go into exile, and once that ultimatum expires, the military should storm Gaza with "full force" to destroy the militant group.

"Mr. Prime Minister, it's either us or them. Either full Israeli control, the destruction of Hamas, and the continued long-term suppression of terrorism, encouragement of the enemy's emigration outward and permanent Israeli settlement," he said.

The plan, announced by Trump in September, states that members of Hamas who commit to peaceful coexistence and to decommission their weapons will be given amnesty. Those who want to leave Gaza will be given safe passage to other countries.

The White House last week announced that the president's plan to end the war was moving to the second phase, which would include the demilitarization and reconstruction of Gaza.

Under the initial phase of the plan, Israel and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire in Gaza that went into effect in October.

Hamas also released the remaining living hostages abducted from Israel during the October 2023 attack, who had been held in Gaza since then. The remains of all but one deceased hostage have been handed over as well.

Since the ceasefire started, Israel has repeatedly carried out air strikes in Gaza which it has said were responding to or fending off attacks carried out by Palestinian militants.

Over 460 Palestinians and three Israeli soldiers have been killed in Gaza since the ceasefire came into effect.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 11:24:19 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/RP7BVFFXUVNNPIJRGZRDWZHUSA.jpg?auth=01b3cd15347b5d2cadfaafb8124eeb751d768d4d8287f07446a78dbfcd862a8c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>A year into his return, Trump wields executive power with few restraints</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/year-into-his-return-trump-wields-executive-power-with-few-restraints-2026-01-19/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 19 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Tuesday will mark his first year back in the White House after a shock-and-awe policy blitz that has expanded presidential power and reshaped America's relations with the world. As he enters his second year, he appears increasingly unconstrained, pursuing policies that have deepened divisions in the country.

In recent weeks, Trump ordered a more aggressive federal crackdown on illegal immigration in Minnesota that led to the shooting death of an unarmed woman motorist by a federal agent, oversaw an audacious military raid on Venezuela to capture President Nicolas Maduro , revived his controversial plan to take over Greenland , threatened to bomb Iran , and shrugged off concerns over a criminal investigation into Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell.

"I don't care," Trump told Reuters in an Oval Office interview last week when asked about the potential economic fallout from the probe into Powell. Speaking to The New York Times on January 7, Trump said the only check on him as commander-in-chief to launch military strikes abroad was "my own morality."

Taken together, Trump’s comments underscore a view of the presidency in which he is constrained chiefly by his own judgment rather than institutional restraint.

Anna Kelly, a White House spokeswoman, said Trump's first instinct is diplomacy and he makes all decisions thoughtfully. But she added he keeps all options on the table and decided to send the U.S. military into Venezuela to capture Maduro, and to bomb three Iranian nuclear facilities last year, "after both failed to negotiate in a serious way."

When Trump triumphantly returned to the White House on January 20, 2025, for a second term, he vowed to remake the economy, the federal bureaucracy, immigration policy and much of U.S. cultural life. He has delivered on much of that agenda, becoming one of the most powerful presidents in modern U.S. history.

Like all U.S. presidents who cannot seek another term, Trump faces the almost inevitable waning of power in his second year. He remains a deeply unpopular figure: a growing number of Americans are unhappy with his handling of the economy and have concerns about his priorities. But opinions are deeply polarized and he still enjoys substantial support among his core supporters.

Trump's approval rating stands at 41% according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted last week, with 58% of U.S. adults disapproving of his job performance. The number is low for U.S. presidents in general but not the lowest of Trump's second term.

"Trump's total disregard for the rule of law or basic checks and balances has made Americans less safe across the board," said Democratic strategist Alex Floyd, adding that voters could punish Republicans for what he described as "lawless behavior."

In his interview with Reuters, Trump acknowledged that Republicans were in danger of losing control of Congress in the November elections, saying history does not favor the party of the president in midterms. Earlier, he told a gathering of Republican lawmakers to fight to retain control of Congress, or a newly empowered Democratic majority in the House of Representatives would impeach him for the third time.

When asked by Reuters about Americans' worries about high prices - the top issue for voters ahead of the elections - Trump repeated his claim the economy was the "strongest" in history, despite data showing stubbornly high inflation.

In recent weeks, Trump has tried to address concerns over the cost of living in speeches and with other actions, but has complicated that effort by simultaneously calling the issue of affordability a Democratic "hoax."

MOST POWERFUL PRESIDENT SINCE 1930s

In his first year back in the White House, Trump has cut the size of the federal civilian workforce , dismantled and closed government agencies, slashed humanitarian aid to foreign countries, ordered sweeping immigration raids and deportations, and sent National Guard troops into Democratic-run cities.

He has also triggered trade wars by imposing tariffs on goods from most countries, passed a massive tax-and-spending-cut bill, prosecuted political enemies , canceled or restricted access to some vaccines , and attacked universities , law firms and media outlets .

Despite promising to end Russia's war in Ukraine on the first day he was in office, Trump has made little progress toward a peace deal, while asserting he has ended eight wars, a claim widely disputed given ongoing conflicts in several of those hotspots.

All modern presidents have sought to expand their presidential power, but this year Trump has increased executive might at a rate rarely seen before, historians and analysts say. He has done this through executive orders and emergency declarations that have shifted decision-making away from Congress and to the White House.

The conservative majority on the U.S. Supreme Court have mostly sided with Trump, and the Republican-controlled Congress has done little to stand in his way. And unlike his first term, Trump has total control over his cabinet, which is packed with loyalists.

Timothy Naftali, a presidential historian, said Trump has wielded power with fewer constraints in his second term than any president since Franklin Roosevelt.

In the first few years of his 1933-1945 White House tenure, Roosevelt, a Democratic president, enjoyed large majorities in Congress, which passed most of his domestic agenda to expand government with little resistance. He also enjoyed significant public support for his efforts to tackle the Great Depression and faced a fractured Republican opposition.

Analysts and party strategists say Trump's difficulty in convincing voters that he understands their struggles with high living costs could prompt some Republican lawmakers to distance themselves in an effort to protect their seats in November.

Aides say Trump will frequently hit the road this year to promote his economic agenda to try to convince voters he has a plan to reduce high prices, even though he is not on the ballot in November.

But his economic speeches in recent weeks have frequently been meandering and unfocused, and he has continued to focus much of his attention on foreign affairs, a lack of message discipline that alarms some Republican strategists and candidates.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 11:25:17 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BVPSGM2LUBNH5NHPI6TAB2AVTY.jpg?auth=ac02cea2cde55c35903149b41d2a27f03d80d569cc3b30b663c81f8e3c53b491&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Syrian troops consolidate hold after abrupt Kurdish withdrawal</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/syrian-troops-consolidate-hold-after-abrupt-kurdish-withdrawal-2026-01-19/</link><description>RAQQA/ Syria, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Syrian government troops tightened their grip on Monday across a swathe of northern and eastern territory abruptly abandoned the previous day by Kurdish forces, in a dramatic shift that consolidated President Ahmed al-Sharaa's rule.

After days of fighting with government forces, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), once the main U.S. allies in Syria, agreed on Sunday to withdraw from two Arab-majority provinces they had controlled for years, including oil fields.

It marks the biggest shift in Syria's control map since Islamist fighters led by Sharaa toppled President Bashar al-Assad in 2024. The balance of power had been tilting Sharaa's way after months of deadlock in talks with the SDF over government demands its forces merge fully with Damascus.

Neighbour Turkey, which has repeatedly sent forces into northern Syria to curb Kurdish power since 2016, welcomed the agreement signed by its ally Sharaa and SDF commander Mazloum Abdi, voicing hope it would help bring stability and security.

Reuters journalists saw government forces deployed in the city of Raqqa that the SDF had captured from Islamic State in 2017, and at oil and gas facilities in the eastern province of Deir al-Zor - both areas the Kurdish forces had held for years.

The SDF, spearheaded by the Kurdish YPG militia, had established control of wide areas of Syria during the 2011-2024 civil war, whilst fighting with the support of U.S. troops against Islamic State. The United States, which has since established close ties with Sharaa under President Donald Trump, has been closely involved in mediation between the sides.

In Raqqa, government internal security forces and military police were setting up checkpoints and checking IDs.

Security sources in Raqqa told Reuters that the city had been cleared of SDF fighters overnight, though some snipers had held out until Sunday evening.

In Deir al-Zor, a Reuters reporter saw state security forces at both the al-Omar oilfield – Syria’s largest – and the Conoco gas field. Al-Omar had long served as the SDF's main base in the area.

Two guards stood outside the Conoco field’s gate. A large Syrian military convoy was deploying to al-Omar. There was no visible SDF presence.

Abdi, the SDF commander, confirmed on Sunday that the SDF had agreed to withdraw from Deir al-Zor and Raqqa provinces, both of which have Arab majorities. The 14-point deal published by Syria's presidency showed his signature alongside Sharaa's.

Abdi said he is set to meet Sharaa in Damascus on Monday and would share the details of the agreement with the public after his return to SDF-held territory, Kurdish media reported.

Abdi said his group remained committed to protecting the "achievements" of the Kurdish region in the northeast.

“This war was imposed on us. We wanted to prevent it, but unfortunately, because it was planned by many forces, it was imposed on us," Kurdish media quoted him as saying.

The SDF retains control of the northeastern province of Hasaka, which includes the Kurdish-majority city of Qamishli and the main camps and prisons holding Islamic State fighters and civilians captured after the group's defeat in Syria in 2017.

The deal stipulates that those sites, along with all border crossings and oil and gas fields, would be handed to Syrian government control, steps the SDF had long resisted. The timing of the handover of the prisons and camps was not announced.

The deal also says that all SDF forces will be merged into the central defence and interior ministries as "individuals" and not as whole units, as the SDF had sought.

The agreement commits the SDF to expel all non-Syrian figures affiliated to the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a Kurdish militant group which fought a decades-long insurgency in Turkey.

Senior figures from Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan’s ruling AK Party said this removed a major obstacle to Turkey’s peace process with PKK militants.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 11:25:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/JAYWB52EWJIULOZNE4QV5YIAME.jpg?auth=773608aadc42cb306279c67e019e092ee3a70833bb351b5f33a66a18634d895a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia hits energy system in several regions of Ukraine, Kyiv says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-hits-energy-system-several-regions-ukraine-kyiv-says-2026-01-19/</link><description>Jan 19 (Reuters) - Russia launched a barrage of drone strikes on Ukraine's energy infrastructure overnight on Monday, cutting off power in five regions across the country amid freezing temperatures and high demand, Ukrainian officials said.

The Ukrainian air force said that Russian troops had launched 145 drones. Air defence units shot down 126 of them, it said.

"As of this morning, consumers in Sumy, Odesa, Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, and Chernihiv regions are without power," the energy ministry said in a statement. "Emergency repair work is underway if the security situation allows."

In the southern Odesa region, energy and gas infrastructure was damaged, the regional governor said, adding that one person was hurt in the attack.

DTEK, Ukraine's largest private energy company, said its energy facility in Odesa was "substantially" damaged, knocking out power for 30,800 households.

A local power grid company in northern Chernihiv region said that five important energy facilities were damaged, leaving tens of thousands of consumers without power.

Russia also hit Ukraine's second-largest city of Kharkiv with missiles on Monday morning, significantly damaging a critical infrastructure facility, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said.

Moscow has stepped up a winter campaign of strikes on the Ukrainian energy system, including generation, electricity transmission and gas production facilities, amid freezing temperatures that complicate repair works.

The attacks have caused long blackouts.

"Being without electricity for more than 16 hours is awful," Serhii Kovalenko, CEO of energy distribution company Yasno, said on Facebook late on Sunday. "And it's not because of the energy companies, but because of cynical attacks by the enemy, who is trying to create a humanitarian disaster."

Ukraine declared an energy emergency last week as its grid crumbled due to accumulated wartime damage and a new targeted wave of Russian bombardments.

Energy Minister Denys Shmyhal said on Monday the government would implement projects to improve electricity transmission from the western part of the country to its power-hungry east.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 11:25:52 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/XRJTTJSBZNJEPFF4M4E5AJAQAY.jpg?auth=7bdcd5a41f6472377126b4a7801197e0c0fc1ebd18f05c15e8d768c2f47f188f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Nigerian airstrikes kill scores of militants in Borno, military says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/nigerian-airstrikes-kill-scores-militants-borno-military-says-2026-01-19/</link><description>ABUJA, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Nigerian air force strikes destroyed about 10 canoes and killed more than 40 militants preparing attacks in Borno state, the military said late on Sunday, in the latest in a series of operations targeting groups around Lake Chad.

Borno, where fighters from militant groups Boko Haram and ISWAP have recently intensified attacks on military convoys and civilians, remains the epicentre of the 17-year Islamist insurgency in the northeast of the country.

Air force spokesperson Ehimen Ejodame said airstrikes on January 15 and 16 in the Musarram and Azir communities signalled renewed military pressure on insurgents who still use the region's rugged terrain to launch raids on troops and nearby communities.

The air force said it hit militants in Musarram on Thursday after intelligence showed they were massing in canoes to attack Baga town and the fish dam area of Lake Chad.

Three bombing runs broke up the group, with fleeing gunmen tracked into nearby trees and neutralised, Ejodame said in a statement.

Troops and local officials reported the airstrikes foiled the planned attack.

On Friday in Azir, close-air-support aircraft struck terrorists retreating from an earlier clash and regrouping under trees, killing several and restoring order, Ejodame said.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 11:26:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Astronomers spot mysterious 'iron bar' in well-known Ring Nebula</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/science/astronomers-spot-mysterious-iron-bar-well-known-ring-nebula-2026-01-19/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 19 (Reuters) - The Ring Nebula, a stunning celestial structure residing in our neighborhood of the Milky Way galaxy, was discovered by French astronomer Charles Messier in 1779 and has been studied extensively ever since. But that does not mean we have it all figured out.

Researchers have spotted a large cloud of iron atoms in the shape of a bar stretching about 3.7 trillion miles (6 trillion km) long across the face of the nebula, which is a glowing shell of gas and dust expelled by a dying star, and are searching for an explanation.

They said it is possible the iron atoms, collectively comparable to the mass of Earth's molten iron core , are the remnants of a rocky planet that was vaporized when the star threw off its outer layers, though they cautioned that such an explanation is mere conjecture at the moment. The inner rocky planets of our solar system, potentially even Earth, could face the same fate when the sun goes through these same death throes billions of years from now.

The researchers made the observation using a new instrument called WEAVE, short for WHT Enhanced Area Velocity Explorer, on the William Herschel Telescope, located on the Atlantic Ocean island of La Palma in Spain's Canary Islands.

"It is exciting to see that even a very familiar object - much studied over many decades - can throw up a new surprise when observed in a new way," said astronomer Roger Wesson of Cardiff University in Wales and University College London, lead author of the research published in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society , opens new tab .

"It's a classic object for professional and amateur astronomers alike to observe," Wesson said. "Although it's too faint to see with the naked eye, it's quite easy to spot with binoculars. In a small telescope, you can see the ring-like appearance."

The Ring Nebula, also called Messier 57, is located about 2,600 light years from Earth in the constellation Lyra. A light-year is the distance light travels in a year, 5.9 trillion miles (9.5 trillion km). It is believed to have formed roughly 4,000 years ago, very recently in cosmic time.

It is familiar even to beginning students of astronomy.

"You'll find it in many astronomy textbooks," University College London astronomer and study co-author Janet Drew said.

That is why the iron bar is so intriguing.

"No other chemical element that we have detected seems to sit in this same bar. This is weird, frankly. Its importance lies in the simple fact that we have no ready explanation for it, yet," Drew said. "The origin of the iron might trace back to the vaporization of a planet. But there could be another way to make the feature that doesn't involve a planet."

"A planet like the Earth would contain enough iron to form the bar, but how it would end up in a bar shape has no good explanation," Wesson said.

The nebula formed when a star about twice the sun's mass ran out of nuclear fuel in its core, swelled up into what is called a red giant and expelled its outer layers before becoming a compact stellar remnant known as a white dwarf, approximately the size of our planet.

"From the perspective of Earth, it has the appearance of a ring, although it's believed that it's actually more like a cylinder of material that we are seeing end-on. It's made up mostly of hydrogen and helium, with small quantities of heavier elements," Wesson said.

About 3,000 such nebulas are known in our galaxy. Studying them lets astronomers examine the life stage of stars when chemical elements forged by nuclear processes inside them are released into interstellar space to be recycled and contribute to the next generation of stars and planets.

"We look forward to getting more data to follow up on this discovery, to try to unravel this new problem and work out where the iron bar has come from," Wesson said.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 11:26:39 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/2WQK7C75WFOWHDJYWBCNIAT27A.jpg?auth=aa47e8848ac07afbb4dbb090486fa2f4490368637fb13c1fc5fcea6b39298d07&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>BHP refused permission to appeal UK judgment over 2015 Brazil dam collapse</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/bhp-refused-permission-appeal-uk-judgment-over-2015-brazil-dam-collapse-2026-01-19/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 19 (Reuters) - BHP (BHP.AX) , opens new tab was on Monday refused permission to appeal against a ruling that it is liable for the 2015 collapse of a dam in southeastern Brazil, in a London lawsuit potentially worth tens of billions of pounds.

In November, London's High Court ruled BHP was legally responsible for the collapse of the Fundao dam in Mariana, southeastern Brazil, which was owned and operated by BHP and Vale's (VALE3.SA) , opens new tab Samarco joint venture.

BHP's application for permission to appeal that ruling was denied by the High Court, though BHP can still apply directly to the Court of Appeal.

The claimants' lawyers have previously valued the lawsuit, one of the largest in English legal history, at up to 36 billion pounds ($48.26 billion) and were seeking nearly 200 million pounds in legal fees after their initial victory.

The initial stage of the case was to determine whether BHP was liable to the claimants, with a further trial to decide on damages to be paid due to begin in October, with a ruling likely at some point in mid-2027.

Hundreds of thousands of Brazilians, dozens of local governments and around 2,000 businesses sued BHP over the collapse of the Fundao dam, which was Brazil's worst environmental disaster.

The collapse unleashed a wave of toxic sludge that killed 19 people, left thousands homeless, flooded forests and polluted the length of the Doce River.

Judge Finola O'Farrell ruled last year that BHP should not have continued to raise the height of the dam, which ultimately caused its collapse.

Bringing Ukraine's voter registry up to date and making the proper preparations for a vote will take significant time, Oleh Didenko, the head of Ukraine's Central Election Commission, told Reuters in a rare interview with international media.

Amid diplomatic efforts to end the war, U.S. President Donald Trump has demanded Ukraine hold elections, even though they are banned under martial law - in force since the invasion - and a majority of Ukrainians oppose a wartime ballot.

Organising elections as soon as possible is part of a 20-point peace framework that Ukrainian and U.S. negotiators have been working to finalise in recent months.

Under pressure from Trump, Zelenskiy said last month he was ready to hold elections if the United States and other allies could ensure the security of the vote. At his request, lawmakers and experts started a working group to draft proposals for the significant legal changes needed to hold an election.

A ceasefire and safe conditions for voters are prerequisites for any vote, Didenko said. Beyond that, Ukraine faces numerous challenges: millions of its citizens are abroad or at the front line, its infrastructure has been destroyed and its voter register does not reflect migration changes.

"Issues of electoral law are very complicated in peacetime in Ukraine: they were not resolved quickly or easily. So now these issues are even more complicated because there are significantly more challenges," Didenko said.

Ukraine last held presidential and parliamentary elections in 2019, when Zelenskiy won by a landslide to become president.

His five-year mandate expired last year and Russia has questioned his legitimacy, but Kyiv's allies have rejected Moscow's assertions and Zelenskiy's ratings are high.

In the 2019 presidential election, almost 19 million people cast their ballot from 30 million registered voters. At least 20% of those lived in parts of Ukraine now occupied by Russia, pre-war data shows.

President Vladimir Putin has said Ukrainians living in Russia must be able to participate - an idea rejected by Zelenskiy.

Voting in occupied territories is out of the question but Ukraine will ensure voting rights for people who manage to reach Kyiv-controlled territory, Didenko said.

The commission allowed voters to update their data online this month - a function suspended since 2022 for security reasons - as part of a broader effort to bring its registry up to date.

There are about 5.8 million Ukrainian refugees overseas, the majority in Europe, according to United Nations refugee agency data from January.

As of now, there is no final assessment of voter numbers abroad as many have not updated their registration.

"We need to locate the voters and create voting infrastructure," Didenko said.

Ukraine had 102 polling stations in its embassies and consulates before the war. That is insufficient to ensure refugees can vote, Didenko said.

The commission believes opening polling stations outside diplomatic premises is the most realistic solution, Didenko said, as online and postal voting are at risk of external interference and attempts to discredit the process.

Ensuring voting rights for servicemen is another challenge although Didenko said Ukraine could build on its experience in organising military voting.

In the 2019 elections, thousands of troops had already been deployed to eastern Ukraine to battle Russia-backed separatists who had seized territory five years earlier. The scale of the problem now is much greater, with about 800,000 Ukrainians serving in the army.

According to Ukraine's election commission, almost 2,000 of over 30,000 polling stations have been destroyed or damaged, mostly in the east.

While Zelenskiy has said security is a core issue for any elections, Russia has systemically rejected the idea of a ceasefire. Putin said in December that Moscow was ready "to think about" ensuring security in Ukraine during a vote.

Only 9% of Ukrainians back the idea of an election before a ceasefire, a poll by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology showed in December. About 57% see elections as possible only after a final peace deal and the end of the war.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 12:51:31 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/DALV2S2BPBJL7EKSEJGNCV2OTI.jpg?auth=4f828b71943e65aa3b1555a0f3a6b02de86bc18ae1b652e1df8f76d2b98d9b57&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Several killed in blast in Afghan capital Kabul, Taliban interior ministry says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/several-killed-blast-afghan-capital-kabul-taliban-interior-ministry-says-2026-01-19/</link><description>KABUL, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Several people were killed in a blast in Afghan capital Kabul's Shahr-e-Naw area, the Taliban interior ministry said on Monday.

While weather conditions overnight helped control some fires, the largest were still active, with adverse conditions expected throughout the day, security minister, Luis Cordero, said at a news briefing on Monday.

"The projection we have today is of high temperatures," Cordero said, and the main worry was that new fires would be triggered throughout the region.

Parts of central and southern Chile were under extreme heat warnings with temperatures expected to reach up to 37 Celsius (99 Fahrenheit).

As of late Sunday, Chile's CONAF forestry agency said firefighters were combating 23 fires across the country, the largest of which were in regions of Ñuble and Bío Bío, where President Gabriel Boric declared a state of catastrophe.

Over 20,000 hectares (77 square miles) have been razed so far, an area about the size of Seattle, with the largest fire surpassing 14,000 hectares on the outskirts of the coastal city Concepcion.

The fast-moving blaze tore through the towns of Penco and Lirquen over the weekend, destroying hundreds of homes and killing several people, with authorities still assessing the damage.

Authorities are currently battling the fire as it threatened Manzano prison on the edge of Concepcion and the town of Tome to the north.

Both Chile and Argentina rang in the new year with heat waves which have continued into January. Earlier this month, wildfires broke out in Argentina's Patagonia, burning around 15,000 hectares.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 12:51:42 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/OR4AXPO4GNP6PACPKJUYLGDFHY.jpg?auth=2c1adfe82bf642db8c7231505afc90905127d0d04ce9b8e5e5664856ac15b396&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Yemen humanitarian crisis to worsen in 2026 amid funding cuts, says UN</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/yemen-humanitarian-crisis-worsen-2026-amid-funding-cuts-says-un-2026-01-19/</link><description>GENEVA, Jan 19 (Reuters) - The U.N. warned on Monday that the humanitarian situation in Yemen is worsening and that gains made to tackle malnutrition and health would go into reverse due to funding cuts.

"The context is very concerning... We are expecting things to be much worse in 2026," Julien Harneis, U.N. Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Yemen, told reporters in Geneva.

Some 21 million people will need humanitarian assistance this year, an increase from 19.5 million the previous year, according to the U.N. The situation has been aggravated by economic collapse and disruption of essential services including health and education, and political uncertainty, Harneis said.

Funding Yemen traditionally received from Western countries was now being cut back, Herneis said, pointing to hopes for more help from Gulf countries , opens new tab .

The U.S. slashed its aid spending this year, and leading Western donors also pared back help as they pivoted to raise defence spending, triggering a funding crunch for the U.N.

Yemen has been the focus of one of the world's largest humanitarian operations in a decade of civil war that disrupted food supplies. The country has also been a source of heightened tensions in recent months between Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

"Children are dying and it's going to get worse," Harneis said. Food insecurity is projected to worsen across the country, with higher rates of malnutrition anticipated, he stated.

"For 10 years, the U.N. and humanitarian organisations were able to improve mortality and improve morbidity...this year, that's not going to be the case."

He said Yemen’s humanitarian crisis threatened the region with diseases like measles and polio that could cross borders.

In 2025 680 million dollars was afforded to the U.N. in Yemen, about 28% of the intended target, Harneis said.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 12:51:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/73ZMBNYUPRM3PN5FIVLLCF6DF4.jpg?auth=c1ecd21a60b3b24e6ad39e9f94cba4c8edeb2a9cac9501271d89762f408eede5&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Hungarian opposition taps former Shell executive for economics role ahead of April election</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/hungarian-opposition-taps-former-shell-executive-economics-role-ahead-april-2026-01-19/</link><description>BUDAPEST, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Hungarian opposition leader Peter Magyar has tapped former Shell (SHEL.L) , opens new tab executive Istvan Kapitany for a senior economics role in his team, as he seeks to defeat nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban in an election in April.

How to revive the economy from its three-year slumber is a focus of campaigning ahead of the April 12 vote and Magyar's centre-right Tisza party leads over Fidesz in most polls, though many voters are still undecided.

Kapitany, a former global executive vice president at Shell who also led a Hungarian association of executives between 2020 and 2025, said the release of European Union funding and predictable policies would help revive the economy.

Instead of supporting manufacturing megafactories, which has been a key plank of Orban's policy since 2010, small local businesses should be made more competitive, he said in a Facebook video announcing his appointment.

A key task would be to restore confidence by creating a predictable investment environment, which Kapitany said had been marred by Orban's ad hoc policy changes and by windfall taxes on certain sectors to plug budget holes.

"I would like this country to perform better and I am willing to work for it," Kapitany said in the video.

"However, I would like to stress that there are no miracles. We need work, a decent approach, and corruption is obviously the death of business," he said, stressing the importance of "a level playing field."

Kapitany will work with Tisza fiscal and tax policy advisor Andras Karman, a former Erste Bank (ERST.VI) , opens new tab executive.

The EU has suspended billions of euros of funding over Orban's rule-of-law reforms, forcing the government to cut back on public investments in a blow to the economy. Orban, in power since 2010, has said Hungary was no more corrupt than other EU members.

"We need to bring the EU funds home ... We need to use them fairly and well," Kapitany said.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 12:51:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HEIZLLXTZNMC5LTRGXR7NUKNTY.jpg?auth=fd7dec66e706622476e4713238b33813cc2b39129003f30c9c7582aa7c805aef&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Spanish PM Pedro Sanchez travels to site of deadly train crash</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/spanish-pm-pedro-sanchez-travels-to-site-of-deadly-train-crash</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 12:52:07 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/20d35ef2-f532-11f0-bb02-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260119-130155-130508-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trains collide in southern Spain, killing dozens</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/trains-collide-in-southern-spain-killing-dozens</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 12:52:10 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/404a9e0a-f52b-11f0-a4e0-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260119-120121-120252-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Benin opposition fails to secure seats in parliamentary election</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/benin-opposition-fails-secure-seats-parliamentary-election-2026-01-19/</link><description>COTONOU, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Benin's political opposition has failed to win any seats in parliament, according to provisional election results released over the weekend, as two parties aligned with President Patrice Talon secured control over the entire body.

The January 11 election came just over one month after soldiers attempted to topple Talon in a failed coup bid and three months before the West African nation holds a presidential election that will end his 10-year tenure.

The Progressive Union for Renewal will hold 60 of 109 seats in the National Assembly, having won 41.15% of the vote, according to provisional results that still need to be validated by the Constitutional Court. The Republican Bloc will hold 49 seats, having won 36.64% of the vote.

The Democrats, the main opposition party linked to President Patrice Talon's predecessor and rival Thomas Boni Yayi, received 16.14% of the vote, failing to meet the 20% threshold required for parliamentary representation. That threshold was increased from 10% as part of electoral code reforms passed in 2024.

The Democrats previously held more than 20 seats.

The election outcome "deepens political exclusion and reduces institutional checks on the executive," Consultancy Signal Risk said in a note.

Nadin Kokode, a member of the Democrats, said last week that pro-Talon parties had done everything in their power to exclude the opposition from the political scene for the next seven-year term.

He complained of electoral irregularities including the late opening of polling stations, a lack of voting equipment and party supervisors' exclusion from the vote counting process.

The electoral commission reported a few minor logistical challenges during the poll but said incidents were promptly brought under control.

It said voter turnout was 36.73%.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 13:46:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/NJV3OZAUJZKBLNOW7TDNUBYWX4.jpg?auth=975e53f34eeda24d0c58d13f5f5ed85d14a3206029aa6a5d47db44d9e8b37c7f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Army returns to strategic east Congo town after rebel withdrawal</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/army-returns-strategic-east-congo-town-after-rebel-withdrawal-2026-01-19/</link><description>Jan 19 (Reuters) - Congolese soldiers and combatants from a pro-government militia have re-entered the eastern town of Uvira, residents said on Monday, just over a month after it fell to Rwanda-backed M23 rebels in a blow to peace efforts mediated by the Trump administration.

M23 entered Uvira , an important base for the Congolese army near the border with Burundi, on December 10, days after Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi and Rwandan leader Paul Kagame met President Donald Trump in Washington and reaffirmed a U.S.-brokered peace deal .

The capture marked the rebels' biggest gains in months, fueling fears of regional spillover from fighting that has killed thousands and displaced hundreds of thousands in the last year.

M23 staged a lightning advance in January 2025 and still holds more territory than ever before, including Goma and Bukavu, the capitals of North and South Kivu provinces respectively.

After U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in December that Rwanda's actions in mineral-rich eastern Congo were violating the peace deal, M23 pledged to withdraw from Uvira to give peace talks a chance.

Heavy fighting has continued on the outskirts of Uvira, and M23 and the Congolese government on Sunday traded accusations of looting inside the town.

Two residents and a civil society activist based in Uvira said on Monday that Congolese soldiers and members of the Wazalendo militia returned over the weekend and were visible throughout the town, having retaken positions they occupied before M23's arrival.

Jean-Jacques Purusi, the Kinshasa-appointed governor of South Kivu province where Uvira is located, said the Gatumba crossing at the Congo-Burundi border, which closed when M23 took Uvira, would soon reopen.

Rwanda denies backing M23 and has blamed Congolese and Burundian forces for the renewed fighting. A report by a United Nations group of experts in July assessed that Rwanda exercised command and control over the rebels.

The United States has hosted talks between Congo and Rwanda, while Qatar has hosted separate talks between Congo and M23.

During a meeting in Togo focused on eastern Congo, African leaders on Saturday reaffirmed their support for the Doha talks and called for them to resume without delay.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 13:46:27 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/DTS6XWSHQNPCPH4EC3XNGYUPFI.jpg?auth=0fd0a3d3afce698b1d4ebfbc4b36d6a4d1801f47fd321e0d335fdf9aed3d77ee&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Kurdish-led force says armed group attacks Syria prison holding thousands of Islamic State members</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/kurdish-led-force-says-armed-group-attacks-syria-prison-holding-thousands-2026-01-19/</link><description>Jan 19 (Reuters) - The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces said on Monday that an "armed group" was attacking Shaddadi prison in Hasaka in Syria's northeast where it said thousands of Islamic State militants were being held.

The SDF had said earlier in the day it was clashing with Syrian government forces near Al-Aqtan prison on the outskirts of the city of Raqqa that also held IS detainees. Raqqa was once the seat of a short-lived IS-declared "caliphate" in the region.

The SDF described the clashes as a "highly dangerous development" and said government forces seizing the prison "could have serious security repercussions that threaten stability and pave the way for a return to chaos and terrorism".

Under a sweeping integration deal between the SDF and Damascus agreed on Sunday, responsibility for prisons housing IS detainees was meant to be transferred to the Syrian government.

After days of fighting with government forces, the autonomy-minded SDF, once the main U.S. allies in Syria, agreed on Sunday to withdraw from two Arab-majority provinces they had controlled for years, including oil fields.

Syrian government troops tightened their grip on Monday across a swathe of northern and eastern territory abruptly abandoned on Sunday by the SDF in a dramatic shift that consolidated President Ahmed al-Sharaa's rule.

In the wake of the deal, government internal security forces and military police were setting up checkpoints and checking IDs in Raqqa. Security sources there said Raqqa had been cleared of SDF fighters overnight.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 13:46:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/Z2O43ZOY2ZOILNL524VA5MDH4A.jpg?auth=af5eef2a17b5a04d9578c3215158d78ab0974be3348093a4e05d997b34065ff6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Spain's high-speed train crash: what happened?</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/spains-high-speed-train-crash-what-happened-2026-01-19/</link><description>MADRID, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Sunday's train collision and derailment in southern Spain killed at least 39 people and left 122 injured, with officials highlighting the "tremendously strange" nature of the accident on a straight stretch of railway.

Here is what we know so far:

The accident happened at 7:45 p.m. (1845 GMT) near the town of Adamuz in the province of Cordoba, about 360 km (223 miles) south of the capital Madrid.

It involved two high-speed trains, one operated by the private consortium Iryo and the other by Alvia, run by Spain's public railway company Renfe.

The last two out of eight carriages of the trademark-red Iryo train going from Malaga to Madrid derailed on a straight stretch of railway and hit the oncoming Alvia, causing the latter's first two carriages to derail and fall down an up to five-metre (16.4 feet) embankment.

There was a 20-second interval between the first derailment and the impact, too short to activate the automatic braking system, according to Renfe chief Alvaro Fernández Heredia, who also said human error was practically ruled out.

"It must have been some kind of failure in the rolling stock or the infrastructure, and that will take time" to investigate, he said.

Officials said the Alvia had apparently hit the derailed carriages or undercarriage debris of the Iryo. The 27-year-old driver of the Alvia train died in the crash, the Renfe chief said.

The Iryo train was carrying around 300 people and had just left the historic city of Cordoba. Its speed at the moment of the accident was 110 kph, well below the maximum limit of 250 kph on that stretch.

The oncoming train, carrying 187 people, was travelling at a speed of 205 kph, Renfe said.

The derailed Alvia carriages had 37 people in the first and 16 in the second. Most of the dead and injured came from the first two Alvia carriages.

Transport Minister Oscar Puente said that the Iryo was less than four years old and that the railway track had been completely renovated last May with an investment of 700 million euros ($813.5 million). Iryo said the train was last inspected on January 15.

Puente called the accident "tremendously strange" and said that had it not been for the oncoming train, the derailment would have likely caused no deaths.

Jose Trigueros, president of the Association of Road Engineers, said his preliminary analysis of images and information released by the authorities suggested "failure of the undercarriage of the back units" of the Iryo train.

Train drivers union SEMAF had warned state-owned rail infrastructure administrator ADIF in a letter last August of severe wear and tear to the railway track where the two trains collided, according to a copy of the letter seen by Reuters, saying potholes, bumps, and imbalances in overhead power lines were causing frequent breakdowns and damaging the trains.

ADIF did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

According to a Reuters review of alerts on ADIF's X account, it has previously reported problems with infrastructure at Adamuz, from signalling failures to issues with overhead power lines, that caused delays to high-speed trains between Madrid and Andalusia 10 times since 2022.

The government was criticised last year for a series of delays on the network, caused by power outages and the theft of from the lines. The network is vulnerable to cable thefts as it crosses large swathes of empty countryside.

Spain's high-speed railway network, with 3,622 km of tracks, is the largest in Europe and the second-biggest in the world after China, according to ADIF.

Spain opened up its high-speed rail network to private competition in 2020 in a bid to offer low-cost alternatives to Renfe's AVE trains.

Iryo is a joint venture between Italian state railway operator Ferrovie dello Stato, airline Air Nostrum and Spanish infrastructure investment fund Globalvia. It began operating in November 2022, starting with the Madrid-Barcelona route and expanding to other major cities.

The Iryo ETR1000 train is manufactured by the partnership of Hitachi Rail-Bombardier in Europe for Ferrovie's unit Trenitalia.

It was not clear whether the Sudan People's Liberation Army-in-Opposition (SPLA-IO), which battled forces loyal to President Salva Kiir during a 2013-18 civil war, could credibly threaten Juba.

But the call signalled an escalation in the SPLA-IO's rhetoric and ambitions following months of intense clashes around the country that the United Nations has said are occurring at a scale not seen since 2017.

The SPLA-IO seized the town of Pajut, which is more than 300 km (180 miles) north of the capital, in heavy fighting last week in the north of Jonglei State. Pajut's capture puts the state capital of Bor within striking distance of the SPLA-IO.

Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations Wisley Welebe Samson ordered SPLA-IO forces "to move to Juba from all directions of South Sudan and remove the anti-peace regime in Juba", SPLA-IO spokesperson Col. Lam Paul Gabriel said in a statement.

A spokesperson for South Sudan's military declined to comment. A government spokesperson was not immediately available for comment.

Kiir's forces battled those loyal to his vice president, Riek Machar, in the 2013-18 war, which was fought along largely ethnic lines and cost about 400,000 lives. A peace deal in 2018 quieted the conflict, although localised clashes persisted.

Heavy fighting surged again last year after an ethnic militia with historic ties to the SPLA-IO overran an army base in the northeastern town of Nasir.

The government then arrested Machar, who had returned to the vice presidency under the peace deal, and charged him with treason and crimes against humanity for his alleged role in the incident.

Machar has denied the charges during an ongoing trial .

Bol Deng Bol, a civil society activist in Jonglei, said the fighting since last week had caused many people to flee their homes, many into uninhabitable swamps.

The U.N. Commission for Human Rights in South Sudan condemned the "deliberate sabotage" of the 2018 peace agreement, including what it said were indiscriminate aerial bombardments.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 13:47:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Billionaires' wealth hits new peak amid rising poverty, Oxfam says</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/billionaires-wealth-hits-new-peak-amid-rising-poverty-oxfam-says</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 13:47:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/5115d392-f537-11f0-babc-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260119-133425-133605-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Sadio Mane leads Senegal to AFCON glory</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/sadio-mane-leads-senegal-to-afcon-glory</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 13:47:16 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/eeeafdf0-f536-11f0-bb9d-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260119-131705-131841-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>French PM Lecornu inches closer to passing budget bill without vote</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/french-pm-lecornu-inches-closer-to-passing-budget-bill-without-vote</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 13:47:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/78d8a536-f536-11f0-ba84-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260119-131111-131526-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'Most challenging situation’ for transatlantic relations as Trump threatens EU with tariffs</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/most-challenging-situation-for-transatlantic-relations-as-trump-threatens-eu-with-tariffs</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 13:47:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/b1adb2b2-f535-11f0-8be0-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260119-130546-131109-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Spain's deadliest train disasters</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/spains-deadliest-train-disasters-2026-01-19/</link><description>Jan 19 (Reuters) - At least 39 people died in southern Spain after a high-speed train derailed and collided with an oncoming one on Sunday night near Adamuz, in the province of Cordoba, in the worst railway accident in the country since 2013.

The collision left 122 people injured, with 48 still in hospital and 12 in intensive care, according to emergency services.

Here are some of Spain's deadliest train disasters, starting from most recent:

A railway accident in the summer of 2013 left 80 people dead and 145 injured when an eight-carriage high-speed train veered off the track on a sharp bend near the northwestern city of Santiago de Compostela, slamming into a concrete wall and bursting into flames.

A Transport Ministry commission concluded that the accident was caused by speeding and the driver being distracted by a call from a superior, but a victims association blamed the accident not only on human error but also on the railway's security systems.

On March 11, 2004, ten backpack bombs detonated on four Cercanias commuter trains, killing 193 and injuring thousands during Madrid's rush hour. The attacks were carried out by Islamist extremists opposing Spain's participation in the Iraq war.

An accident caused by a head-on collision between two trains in the Cadiz-Seville route left 86 people dead and more than 150 injured near the southern town of El Cuervo in 1972. The accident was caused by a driver's failure to stop at a red light at El Cuervo station, according to an investigation by state-owned rail operator Renfe.

A head-on collision of two trains killed 33 in the town of Urduliz, near the northern city of Bilbao, in the summer of 1970. A stationmaster was initially blamed for the accident, but it later emerged that he had been working 16-hour shifts for the previous four days.

A train on the Madrid-Barcelona route caught fire in 1965 in the town of Grisen, near northeastern Zaragoza, killing dozens of passengers. Though the train operator said at the time that 30 people died, later reports have claimed the real death toll was up to 80 and the Francoist regime tried to downplay it.

The 1944 crash of three trains in the El Bierzo region of Spain's León province is considered one of the deadliest railway disasters in Spain, with the estimated death toll of 78 still being debated due to censorship under the regime of late dictator Francisco Franco.

A train travelling from Madrid to A Coruña suffered a brake failure and collided with a locomotive inside a tunnel, just before a third train entered the same gallery and crashed into the wreckage.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 14:30:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7AU364VJSBIYFPZGD7XEJQT77A.jpg?auth=34f012990f126ba5b9b02cb726468d5cb449a7165aeb32f4fd38dcda97bffa3c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>On Saudi-backed tour, Yemeni officials accuse UAE of running secret prisons</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/saudi-backed-tour-yemeni-officials-accuse-uae-running-secret-prisons-2026-01-19/</link><description>Mukalla, YEMEN, Jan 19 (Reuters) - The Saudi-backed Yemeni government accused the United Arab Emirates on Monday of running a secret prison at an airbase near the south Yemeni port city of Mukalla, fueling tensions in a deepening row between the two Gulf oil states.

The allegations were made by Salem Al-Khanbashi, the governor of the eastern Yemeni province of Hadramout, during a rare media trip arranged by the Saudi government which flew international journalists including a Reuters team from Riyadh to the Riyan airbase near the Yemeni city of Mukalla.

Al-Khanbashi told a televised press conference that necessary measures would be taken against the UAE and the head of Yemen's main separatist group , the STC, who the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen alleged had been spirited out of Yemen by the UAE.

"All the measures will be taken to hold perpetrators of violations accountable, either Aidarous al-Zubaidi or the UAE - its elements, officials, or people working for them... to achieve justice for the victims and their families."

There was no immediate comment by the UAE foreign ministry.

The STC is fully committed to human rights and justice, an official of the group told Reuters in response to the accusation that the UAE-backed group had run a secret prison.

"We have continuously engaged constructively with U.N. and other human rights bodies to ensure the rights and protection of the Southern (Yemeni) people," he added.

Khanbashi's remarks are among the most severe accusations levied against the UAE in a war of words with Saudi Arabia . The dispute broke into the open last year when UAE-backed STC fighters pushed Saudi-backed forces aligned with the internationally-recognized Yemeni government out of key provinces.

Then, in late December, Saudi Arabia struck what it said was an Emirati shipment of weapons and equipment destined for the STC in the port of Mukalla, before backing an offensive that saw the STC collapse and the UAE withdraw after nearly a decade as the main force on the ground in Yemen.

Disagreements between Riyadh and Abu Dhabi span the region, where they back opposing sides in conflicts from Sudan to Somalia and Syria. They are also engaged in fierce economic competition, including over who can attract more foreign capital and visitors and take the biggest share of the global AI boom.

Over the past weeks, Saudi and Emirati pundits have traded attacks on social media in an unusually open display of discord. The Gulf monarchies have in the past kept their disagreements out of the public eye, partially in an effort to show a united front against their main common foe, Iran.

A post on X on Saudi state-run Ekhbariya TV on Sunday read: "With Abu Dhabi inciting against Saudi Arabia ... the kingdom will not hesitate to take the necessary steps and measures against it."

The Yemeni government has previously alleged that the UAE was running secret prisons in several areas under its control in Yemen, allegations the UAE has denied.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 14:30:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Heat inequality: The toll of climate change in Rio de Janeiro's favelas</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/cop/heat-inequality-study-measures-toll-climate-change-rio-de-janeiro-favelas-2026-01-19/</link><description>RIO DE JANEIRO, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Michele Campos feels like crying every summer when temperatures in Rio de Janeiro climb above 40°C (100°F), heating up the cement that covers every corner of the favela of Chapeu Mangueira where she lives and making life unbearable in her windowless bedroom.

“Sleeping is the worst part," said the 39-year-old. "In the favela we experience the heat in a very different way from people who can afford air conditioning."

Researchers from Utrecht University in the Netherlands, together with local partners, are now trying to understand exactly how extreme heat strains the livelihoods of the 1.3 million people who, like Campos, live in Rio’s favelas, working-class neighbourhoods built by residents without any urban planning.

“We don’t have architects or engineers. We build out of necessity,” said Valdinei Medina, who heads the Percilia and Lucio Renewable Energy Cooperative, Brazil’s first solar energy cooperative based in favelas.

“When the heat comes, we suffer a lot,” he said.

The researchers have installed thermometers in people's homes in the favelas of Chapeu Mangueira and Morro da Babilonia to measure indoor temperatures and asked residents to keep “heat diaries,” documenting how high temperatures affect their bodies and daily routines.

The goal is to show how climate change affects people unevenly in a city known for its stark inequality, with working‑class homes sprawling across rolling hills above wealthy neighbourhoods.

The data the researchers collect could help inform public policy that takes into account not only heat levels on the streets but also conditions inside homes, said Francesca Pilo, the project’s coordinator and a professor of urban planning at Utrecht University.

The study, she added, is the "starting point for understanding how climate change, often seen as an environmental issue but one that becomes political, has been amplifying urban inequalities that already existed."</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 14:30:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/IMOVHHARFVOSHPBQDDRHCT6LLI.jpg?auth=b808478d779d97dc7dd856adeafc734db135c8431ae8abebce578832ffd72bcc&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>A look at the EU's 'Anti-Coercion Instrument' amid Greenland dispute with US</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/a-look-at-the-eu-s-anti-coercion-instrument-amid-greenland-dispute-with-us</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 14:31:26 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/17dc97ac-f53f-11f0-b854-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260119-143216-143347-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Louvre closes for third time in a month due to staff strike</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260119-louvre-closes-for-the-day-due-to-staff-strike</link><description>The Louvre Museum said Monday it was shutting for the day, for the third time in a month, due to a strike by staff.

"The museum is not opening today," said a spokesperson for the most-visited museum in the world.

Trade unions are pressing for more recruitment, pay and better maintenance of the vast former royal palace, and have launched several days of strikes in recent months.

Nearly 140 new hires have been announced since the start of the strike movement in mid-December, and another meeting was scheduled at the culture ministry on Thursday to discuss salary increases.

Some union leaders were also contesting museum director Laurence des Cars' management style which they view as remote and inflexible.

"If we get the pay but continue with this governance model, we won’t be out of the woods," Valerie Baud of the CFDT union said.

"There may be announcements, but we are still dealing with a management that digs its heels in and doesn’t recognise that it can sometimes be wrong,” added her colleague Elise Muller from the SUD union.

The two days of museum closures in December and earlier in January have resulted in a loss of "at least one million euros" in revenue, management said.

The security failures highlighted by a spectacular break-in at the museum on October 19 have cast a harsh spotlight on management of the institution and des Cars, who has apologised.

Footage of the heist was broadcast for the first time on French television on Sunday evening, showing the brazen jewel thieves breaking into display cases.

The images, filmed by surveillance cameras, were shown by the TF1 and public France Televisions channels on Sunday evening, three months after the hugely embarrassing break-in in October.

They show the two burglars, one wearing a black balaclava and a yellow high-visibility jacket, the other dressed in black with a motorcycle helmet, as they force their way into the Apollo Gallery.

After breaking in through a reinforced window with high-powered disk cutters, they begin slicing into display cases under the eyes of several staff members who do not intervene.

Managers at the Louvre have stressed that staff are not trained to confront thieves and are asked to prioritise the evacuation of visitors.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 14:31:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/ba2d3828-f539-11f0-9d67-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/a47b642011cda7fa111cba5497922c52df012da9.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Passengers tell of terror, screams and darkness after Spain train crash</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/passengers-tell-terror-screams-darkness-after-spain-train-crash-2026-01-19/</link><description>MADRID, Jan 19 (Reuters) - A violent jolt, followed by screams, flying objects, blood and then darkness is how survivors of the train crash in southern Spain on Sunday night described the moment of impact in the high-speed collision that killed at least 39 people.

The trains were carrying about 400 people when the accident happened near Adamuz in the province of Cordoba, about 360 km (223 miles) south of the capital Madrid. It left 122 people injured, with 48 still in hospital and 12 in intensive care, according to emergency services.

Most survivors said on Monday they were unaware of the scale of the disaster until they made it outside and witnessed injured or dead passengers, and rescuers working under floodlights beside the tracks.

"I started to get up and thought, this isn't normal. Then I looked for my sister. That's the last thing I remember before everything went dark," said Ana Garcia Aranda, 26, who was travelling to Madrid from Malaga with her sister and their dog after visiting family.

Other passengers had broken windows and pulled her from the wrecked carriage.

"There were people who were fine and others who were very, very badly injured. You had them right in front of you and you knew they were going to die, and you couldn't do anything," she said, wearing sticking plasters on her face.

Firefighters later rescued her sister from the train and took her to hospital, where she is in intensive care.

Outside the crash site, sirens echoed through the night as emergency vehicles flooded the narrow roads. Residents of Adamuz said the whole town mobilised, bringing water, blankets and food to help the stranded passengers.

"That won't be forgotten," Salvador Jimenez, a journalist with Spanish public broadcaster RTVE, who was pulled from one of the trains, said. "In the end, it's a lottery. Many of us were lucky."

Paqui, who owns a farm in the area and rushed to the site with her husband, recalls horrific scenes in and around the trains.

"Pieces of people, it wasn’t people anymore, you found arms. My husband saw a child who died inside... another child calling for his mother, looking for his mother," she said. "I can’t sleep, those are images that stay with you."

Another passenger, Raquel, told radio station Cadena Ser: "I was thrown from the back cabin and opened the door with my head," she said, adding that she briefly lost consciousness before managing to walk towards where firefighters were working.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 14:57:04 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/P75GOFVOGJMW3PMYVAR55STM7A.jpg?auth=1986badd69d9184544dc5adb2957d11d114c2b7aef3c3b5b30752ad0be311527&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Central African Republic court validates Touadera's re-election</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/central-african-republic-court-validates-touaderas-re-election-2026-01-19/</link><description>BANGUI, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Central African Republic's Constitutional Court on Monday validated President Faustin-Archange Touadera's victory in a disputed December 28 presidential election that handed him a third term.

Even before provisional results were announced on January 5, Touadera's opponents had alleged fraud but the government denied that.

"On behalf of the Central African people, the Constitutional Court declares Faustin Archange Touadera president-elect in the first round with 77.9% of the vote," President of the Constitutional Council Jean-Pierre Waboe said.

Touadera's main rival, former Prime Minister Anicet-Georges Dologuele, received 13.5% of the vote, final results from the electoral commission showed.

The Constitutional Court said it rejected an appeal that Dologuele had lodged after the announcement of provisional results.

Another competitor, former Prime Minister Henri-Marie Dondra who got 2.97% of the vote, last week acknowledged Touadera's victory and said he decided not to appeal.

"I made this decision to preserve peace and avoid reigniting tensions. I call on the president-elect to take the necessary measures to reconcile the Central African people and organize a genuine dialogue to ease political tensions in the country," Dondra told Reuters.

Touadera, a 68-year-old mathematician who took power a decade ago, campaigned on his security record in the chronically unstable nation.

His victory will likely further the interests of Russia, which has traded security assistance for access to resources including gold and diamonds.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 14:57:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KBCNPGHFSZJK7J23RURLZN54JQ.jpg?auth=496f3c420086c9e73d25c2117b568e35a7161a5af398f2b918f1f75bf5530dc3&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Exclusive: Investigators find broken joint on track at Spanish rail crash site, source says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/investigators-find-broken-joint-track-spanish-rail-crash-site-source-says-2026-01-19/</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 15:28:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Rising smoke, locked exits: How Karachi mall inferno trapped victims</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/rising-smoke-locked-exits-how-karachi-mall-inferno-trapped-victims-2026-01-19/</link><description>KARACHI, Jan 19 (Reuters) - When smoke began seeping from ducts at the sprawling Gul Plaza shopping complex in Karachi late on Saturday, those inside thought a small fire had broken out in a corner of the mall.

But the flames spread rapidly, leaping through a structure that housed 1,200 stores in Karachi's historic centre.

"It engulfed the whole mall in front of our eyes," shopowner Shahbaz Iqbal, 27, told Reuters on Monday, after the blaze was largely extinguished following a 24-hour firefight. Authorities said more than 60 people were still missing and 21 have been killed.

"We thought it was a small fire. No one ever thought it would be this bad."

Iqbal and his co-workers ran upstairs and out of the mall from one of the basement exits, but those coming from the upper floors weren't as lucky. With the facility due to close soon, most of the mall's gates were locked.

Senior police official Syed Asad Raza told Reuters that all but three of the mall's 16 exits were locked.

"When I went in (to the building), I saw the locks," said rescue worker Aqeel, who declined to share his whole name as he was not authorised to speak to the media.

Gul Plaza's management did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters.

As rescue workers dug through mounds of debris, human remains were pulled out of the building in white cotton sheets turned into makeshift sacks.

Shafi Ahmed, who owned a store in the basement, stood holding his hands together in prayer.

When asked if anyone he knew was inside, he said five of his friends were left in the mall.

"These are all our people. These are all my people. These are our people," he said, breaking down in tears.

Police struggled to hold back grieving families and shopowners who said they had lost everything.

At one point, officials discovered a drawer full of money, causing a fight to break out among shopowners claiming it was theirs.

Hundreds of protesters gathered around the smouldering remains of the building on Monday calling for accountability from the authorities.

Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah has promised an investigation into the fire and response time, while Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab, who arrived on the scene nearly 24 hours after the fire broke out, was met with jeers from the angry crowd.

Roads still under construction outside Gul Plaza were inundated with water after the firefight. Rescue officials sat in a tent outside the building, noting down the names of the missing.

Razia, 40, who goes by one name, said six of her relatives worked in the building.

"One of them jumped out with two of his friends. One of the friends broke his legs and the other died on the spot," she said, describing the account from the relative, her nephew.

Another of her family members, a flower shop worker named Ibrar, did not make it out. He broke down a door to help others escape, "but he is still stuck ... no one has heard from him since Saturday," Razia said.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 15:29:27 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BKG3DVSQQRJD7HB4M5CVMPJUFY.jpg?auth=077e6ca16776672c6a261872db8512337995c7b77040be3f1aa61e331438b4be&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>The exchange of messages between Norway's prime minister and President Trump</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/exchange-messages-between-norways-prime-minister-president-trump-2026-01-19/</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 15:29:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Syria deal could remove main obstacle to Turkey-PKK peace, Turkish officials say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/syria-deal-could-remove-main-obstacle-turkey-pkk-peace-turkish-officials-say-2026-01-19/</link><description>ISTANBUL, Jan 19 (Reuters) - A deal under which Kurdish forces abandoned long-held territory in Syria to the Syrian government could pave the way for Turkey to advance its stalled effort to end its decades-long conflict with the PKK, Turkish politicians and officials said on Monday.

After days of fighting, the Syrian government and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) agreed on Sunday to bring Kurdish authorities under the control of Damascus. By Monday, SDF fighters had pulled out of swathes of territory which were now under control of the Syrian military.

Neighbour Turkey has long considered the SDF in Syria to be an offshoot of the banned PKK, or Kurdistan Workers Party, which decided in May last year to and end its decades-long war against the Turkish state.

Turkish officials have long said that as long as the SDF controlled a swathe of territory across the border, it was difficult to end the war with the PKK. But now, with the SDF pulling out of two Syrian provinces, Turkish leaders see progress resuming.

Omer Celik, spokesman for President Tayyip Erdogan's ruling AK Party, said Syrian government forces' recent advances had "thwarted" efforts by Kurdish groups to derail Turkey's peace process.

Feti Yildiz, a deputy leader of the government-allied Turkish nationalist MHP party, said Sunday's agreement in Syria would have "a favourable impact".

"Things will become easier," Yildiz told reporters in the Turkish parliament when asked how the Syrian deal affects the PKK process. "It had been standing like an obstacle, and for now it looks as though that obstacle has been removed."

The PKK itself had yet to comment on the SDF's withdrawal as of Monday afternoon. Turkey's pro-Kurdish DEM Party, which has previously criticised the Syrian offensive against Kurdish forces, has also not yet reacted.

Turkish security sources, speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity, called the deal a historic turning point and said stability in Syria was vital to Ankara's goal of eradicating terrorism in Turkey, where the PKK has fought an insurgency since 1984 in which more than 40,000 people have been killed.

Though the PKK in July, the peace process has since shown little sign of progress: a months-long parliamentary commission has so far revealed no details on legal or reform measures.

Joshua Landis, director of the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Oklahoma, said the deal ended the Kurdish hope of retaining a large measure of autonomy and would benefit Turkey.

"Erdogan is undoubtedly rejoicing at the news, which will greatly weaken the PKK and any lingering Kurdish aspiration for an independent Kurdistan. Syria will become stronger economically and militarily, and Turkey will profit from this," Landis said on X.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 15:30:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BLG5UHMGJZPUBMXXDLBZ4SWVEA.jpg?auth=c3e5d488282298469f07a79fb3d9a17bf59b726fa6e4947521ffdec3c7d186fa&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump charges $1bn for permanent seat on Gaza ‘Board of Peace’, invites Russia’s Putin</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260119-trump-charges-1bn-for-permanent-seat-on-gaza-board-of-peace-invites-russia-s-putin</link><description>US President Donald Trump 's government has asked countries to pay $1 billion for a permanent spot on his "Board of Peace" aimed at resolving conflicts, according to its charter, seen Monday by AFP.

The White House has asked various world leaders to sit on the board, chaired by Trump himself, including Russian President Vladimir Putin , Hungarian premier Viktor Orban and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney .

Member countries -- represented on the board by their head of state -- would be allowed to join for three years -- or longer if they paid more than $1.0 billion within the first year, the charter says.

"Each Member State shall serve a term of no more than three years from this Charter's entry into force, subject to renewal by the Chairman," the board's draft charter says.

"The three-year membership term shall not apply to Member States that contribute more than USD $1,000,000,000 in cash funds to the Board of Peace within the first year of the Charter's entry into force."

The board was originally conceived to oversee the rebuilding of Gaza, but its charter does not appear to limit its role to the occupied Palestinian territory.

The White House said there would be a main board, a Palestinian committee of technocrats meant to govern devastated Gaza, and a second "executive board" that appears designed to have a more advisory role.

"The Board of Peace is an international organization that seeks to promote stability, restore dependable and lawful governance, and secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict," the charter says.

It appears to take a swipe at international institutions such as the United Nations, saying that the board should have "the courage to depart from approaches and institutions that have too often failed."

Trump has regularly criticized the United Nations and announced this month that his country will withdraw from 66 global organizations and treaties -- roughly half affiliated with the UN .

Membership of the board would be "limited to States invited to participate by the Chairman," according to the draft charter.

Trump would have the power to remove member states from the board, subject to a veto by two-third of members, and choose his replacement should he leave his role as chairman.

The "Board of Peace" began to take shape on Saturday when the leaders of Egypt , Turkey , Argentina and Canada were asked to join.

Trump also named as members Secretary of State Marco Rubio , former British prime minister Tony Blair , senior negotiator Steve Witkoff and his son-in-law Jared Kushner .

Israel has objected to the line-up of a "Gaza executive board" to operate under the body, which includes Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan and Qatari diplomat Ali Al-Thawadi.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 15:30:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/fa636c6a-f547-11f0-b622-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26016765794544.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump's Greenland ambitions lack domestic support, polls show</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/trump-s-greenland-ambitions-lack-domestic-support-polls-show</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 15:30:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/608b5a9a-f546-11f0-814b-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260119-152718-152853-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>French investigators expose failings in Dominique Pelicot mass rape case</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260119-french-investigators-expose-failings-in-dominique-pelicot-mass-rape-case</link><description>France 's General Inspectorate of Justice (IGJ) has exposed failings in an investigation into Dominique Pelicot, convicted in a high-profile rape case, for not acting on DNA evidence against him for a dozen years, in a report seen by AFP.

Pelicot was sentenced to 20 years in prison in December 2024 in a case that shocked the country, after admitting to repeatedly drugging his then-wife Gisele Pelicot and inviting dozens of men to rape her while she was unconscious between 2011 and 2020.

During the trial, it emerged that he had been first apprehended in 2010 in a suburban Paris shopping centre while filming up women 's skirts, and had his DNA taken by police .

A few months later, he was connected with an attempted rape in the Seine-et-Marne area east of the capital on May 11, 1999.

Yet the DNA match was not acted upon by the justice system for more than 12 years.

In October 2022, he was finally placed under formal investigation by a cold case unit in Nanterre, west of Paris, for the 1999 incident as well as a 1991 rape and murder of a woman in Paris.

Last year, Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin called on the IGJ to look into why the investigation did not happen sooner.

The IGJ report seen by AFP this week found that the court investigating the 1999 rape had no receipt of receiving the evidence, which was sent by regular mail.

Furthermore, the court at the time was undergoing a structural re-organisation and "loss of documents was sometimes observed", the report said.

The IGJ report highlighted "vulnerabilities" and general malfunction in the handling of genetic profiles, prompting a list of recommendations to secure the receipt of reports issued by France's National Automated DNA Database (FNAEG).

Contacted by AFP, Dominique Pelicot's lawyer, Beatrice Zavarro, said "the work of justice had been undermined".

She also acknowledged that the rape case involving his ex-wife "could have been avoided" had police intervened earlier.

"If we take it at face value, yes, this case could obviously have been avoided," she said.

Pelicot has admitted to his involvement in the 1999 case after he was identified by his DNA, but has denied involvement in the 1991 rape and murder case.

Last week, the Nanterre cold case unit launched a broader investigation into Pelicot's "criminal trajectories" to identify other possible crimes and victims.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 15:30:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/cec7aa2c-f541-11f0-a335-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25030386341588.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia gleeful at Trump-Europe split over Greenland, but also has concerns</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/russia-gleeful-trump-europe-split-over-greenland-also-has-concerns-2026-01-19/</link><description>MOSCOW, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Russia is watching with glee as U.S. President Donald Trump's drive to acquire Greenland widens splits with Europe even though his moves could have serious security ramifications for Moscow, which covets its own presence in the Arctic.

The Kremlin said Trump would go down in history if he took control of Greenland, an autonomous Danish territory. President Vladimir Putin's special envoy Kirill Dmitriev hailed the "collapse of the transatlantic union." Former President Dmitry Medvedev joked about Europe getting poorer.

Criticism of Trump over Greenland has been notably absent at a time when Russia wants to keep him onside to ensure any end to the war in Ukraine is on Moscow's terms, even though traditional Russian allies Venezuela and Iran are also in his crosshairs.

"There are international experts who believe that by resolving the issue of Greenland's incorporation, Trump will certainly go down in history. And not only in the history of the United States, but also in world history," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Monday.

"It's hard not to agree with these experts."

The daily Moskovsky Komsomolets said it was a pleasure to watch Europe being "at a total loss" after Trump said he would put rising tariffs on goods imported from some European countries until the United States is allowed to buy Greenland.

"Make America Great Again (MAGA) = Make Danmark Small Again (MDSA) = Make Europe Poor Again (MEPA). Has this idea finally sunk in, dimwits?" said Medvedev, who is now deputy chairman of Russia's Security Council.

Dmitriev, who is involved in talks with the U.S. on the war in Ukraine, mocked European leaders in posts on social media.

"Collapse of the transatlantic union. Finally — something actually worth discussing in Davos," said Dmitriev, who is due to meet U.S. envoys on Ukraine during the World Economic Forum in the Swiss resort this week.

Dmitriev said on X that "Putin understands the U.S. rationale on Greenland," linking to a speech in which Putin said U.S. designs on Greenland had deep historical roots.

Russian commentators said Trump's behaviour was putting unprecedented strain on the NATO military alliance, Moscow's longtime foe, and could cause economic and diplomatic pain for the European Union and Britain, seen by Moscow as obstacles to Russia having its way on Ukraine.

An article in Rossiiskaya Gazeta, the Russian government's official newspaper, asked whether differences over Greenland would spell the end of NATO.

Sergei Markov, a former Kremlin adviser, said Moscow should help Trump advance his ambitions "because almost all of Trump's enemies are also Russia's enemies."

For all its satisfaction, Moscow is treading a delicate line as Trump's moves could have an impact on Moscow's own ambitions in the Arctic, which is rich in natural resources and also seen by Russia as strategically important.

Russia has bridled at Trump's suggestion that Moscow poses a threat to Greenland - part of his rationale for wanting U.S. control of the island - while avoiding mentioning his name in its criticism.

The foreign ministry said last week it was unacceptable for the West to continue accusing Russia and China of being a threat to Greenland.

But Ukraine is a higher priority for Russia than Greenland, where the U.S. already has a military presence.

A transatlantic rift over Greenland that involves countries that have financed and armed Kyiv could work in Russia's favour, possibly seeping into other policy areas and overshadowing events in Ukraine.

Some Russian commentators have suggested Trump's behaviour is ushering in a new world order without rules, something that might benefit Moscow.

Others though have sounded the alarm over the unpredictability of his behaviour, citing the recent seizure of Venezuela's Nicolas Maduro.

They have also cautioned that Trump, who says the U.S. will reassert its dominance in the Western Hemisphere, has not shown a readiness for other nations to have their own spheres of influence.

"Russia can only have its own sphere of influence through strength," said Markov.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 16:31:49 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/3GP4NHJ22NIXBB4OTQENXOV5QI.jpg?auth=d9b56abca82753bfda71b66c775777aca715bb21faafffb1cfad89d6cf5e48a3&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israel invited to join Trump's 'Board of Peace', sources say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-invited-join-trumps-board-peace-sources-say-2026-01-19/</link><description>JERUSALEM, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Israel has received an invitation from the United States to join President Donald Trump 's "Board of Peace" initiative aimed at resolving global conflicts, two sources briefed on the matter told Reuters.

It was not immediately clear if Israel had accepted the invitation. The prime minister's office did not respond to a request for comment.

Trump originally proposed establishing the Board of Peace when he announced last September his plan to end the war in Gaza . But an invitation sent to world leaders last week, seen by Reuters, outlines a broad role ending conflicts globally.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office has criticised the composition of a Gaza Executive Board announced by the U.S. last week, saying that it ran counter to Israel's policy.

The Gaza Executive Board would fall under the authority of the Board of Peace, and the White House has said that it will focus on advancing stability and prosperity in Gaza. There are no Palestinians on the board.

Netanyahu's office did not specify the issue with the Gaza board, whose members include Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan and a Qatari official, among others.

Israeli officials have repeatedly objected to any Turkish involvement in Gaza, and Israel has a tense relationship with Qatar, which mediates between Israel and Hamas.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 16:32:39 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KA2TV422RFNIDANBYESUAKRSQI.jpg?auth=c281a5d2c107923e987dda09f4936afeede07419358af1cb5d5012b60e4d8969&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Dozens abducted in Nigeria church attacks; church leader says more than 160 seized</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/dozens-abducted-nigeria-church-attacks-church-leader-says-more-than-160-seized-2026-01-19/</link><description>KADUNA, Nigeria, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Armed bandits abducted dozens of worshippers from two churches in Nigeria's Kaduna state, police said on Monday, while a senior church leader put the number of those missing at more than 160.

Kaduna state police said gunmen armed with "sophisticated weapons" attacked the two churches in Kurmin Wali, a forest community in Afogo ward, at about 11:25 a.m. on Sunday. They said officers were still trying to confirm how many people were taken.

A police spokesperson said the area was remote and difficult to reach due to bad roads, making it challenging to obtain reliable information in the immediate aftermath of such attacks.

The Chairman of the Christian Association of Nigeria in the northern part of the country, Reverend John Hayab, told Reuters by phone that 172 worshippers were kidnapped, and that nine later escaped, leaving 163 still held.

"Information came to me from the elders of the churches that one hundred and seventy‑two worshippers were abducted while nine escaped," Hayab said.

Initial figures in Nigeria often vary widely after mass kidnappings. Security agencies typically give conservative early numbers, while local community and religious groups sometimes cite higher tallies. A similar pattern occurred during the abduction at a Catholic school in Kaduna State in a previous incident.

Police said troops and other security agencies had been deployed to the area and that efforts were under way to track the abductors and rescue the captives.

Northwest Nigeria has seen a surge in mass kidnappings by armed gangs operating from forest enclaves, attacking villages, schools and places of worship.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 16:33:12 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Dozens injured by train crash in southern Spain still in hospital</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/dozens-injured-by-train-crash-in-southern-spain-still-in-hospital</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 16:34:04 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/c75b5ac4-f549-11f0-b0f3-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260119-160242-160642-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump invites Polish president to join Gaza Board of Peace, aide says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/trump-invites-polish-president-join-gaza-board-peace-aide-says-2026-01-19/</link><description>WARSAW, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Polish President Karol Nawrocki has been invited to join the Gaza Board of Peace by U.S. President Donald Trump, the Polish president's foreign policy adviser said on Monday

Usually known only by his first name, Valentino was 93, and had retired in 2008 .

Founder of the eponymous brand, Valentino scaled the heights of haute couture, created a business empire and introduced a new colour to the fashion world, the so-called 'Valentino Red'.

"Valentino Garavani passed away today at his Roman residence, surrounded by his loved ones," the foundation said on Instagram.

The lying in state will be on Wednesday and Thursday, while the funeral will take place in Rome on Friday at 11 am (1000 GMT), it added.

Valentino was ranked alongside Giorgio Armani and Karl Lagerfeld as the last of the great designers from an era before fashion became a global, highly commercial industry run as much by accountants and marketing executives as the couturiers.

Poulsen made his remarks after a meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and Greenlandic Foreign Minister Vivian Motzfeldt in Brussels.

"We have proposed this. The NATO Secretary General has also taken note of this, and I believe we can now hopefully establish a framework for how this can be achieved," Poulsen said.

The news was first reported by the CBC News and the Globe and Mail newspaper.

Military officials have presented plans for the operation to the government and are awaiting a decision from Prime Minister Mark Carney, said the source, who requested anonymity given the sensitivity of the matter.

Carney's office declined to comment.

U.S. President Donald Trump's threats to take Greenland pose a challenge for Carney, who is keen to show solidarity with European allies while trying to stay on the right side of Trump, who has in the past threatened to annex Canada.

"We're concerned about this escalation, to be absolutely clear... we always will support sovereignty and territorial integrity of countries, wherever their geographic location is," Carney told reporters in Doha on Sunday.

European countries sent small numbers of military personnel to Greenland last week.

Germany, France, Sweden, Norway, Finland and the Netherlands have said they are sending military staff to begin preparations for larger drills later this year.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 17:32:17 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/R4JZS637XVIJ5LDMVBPPLKTULE.jpg?auth=6316cad1a8ca6d3dcf9c1df8a24c69bd614c3d4d9cf9ea5ad91eaf51831d7f18&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>French PM Lecornu will use special power to force through budget with ‘regret’</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260119-french-pm-lecornu-will-use-special-constitutional-power-to-pass-budget-without-parliamentary-vote</link><description>France 's ​Prime ⁠Minister Sébastien Lecornu on ​Monday said he will invoke the ​constitutional power defined in Article 49.3 to force a budget ‍for 2026 ​through parliament without a vote. Lecornu ‌had originally pledged ‍in October he would not invoke the Article 49.3.

The decision, he said, was made with "regret".

"It's a partial success, partial failure," said Lecornu, citing "a certain amount of regret and a little bit of bitterness" after budget negotiations came to an impasse.

As a result, the premier risks exposing himself to a non-confidence vote, but he is counting on the support of a key swing group in the lower chamber to survive.

Lecornu last year had pledged to seek parliament approval for a 2026 austerity budget and not force it into law, in a bid to avoid the fate of his two predecessors who were ousted over budget negotiations.

He managed to get a bill on social security spending approved by year end, but lawmakers failed to reach a compromise on state expenses.

Lecornu's centre-right government said last week it would be "impossible" to adopt a 2026 austerity budget by vote.

Any use of "Article 49.3", a constitutional power to push legislation through parliament without a vote, can trigger a no-confidence vote, which can topple the government.

"In 2026, the United States has entered into the most profound and searing debate about the moral foundation for America's actions in the world since the end of the Cold War," the three highest-ranking U.S. Catholic archbishops said in a rare joint statement.

The statement by Cardinals Blase Cupich of Chicago, Robert McElroy of Washington and Joseph Tobin of Newark, echoes Pope Leo's fiery Vatican speech earlier this month denouncing the world's "zeal for war".

Leo, the first U.S. pope, has previously criticized some of U.S. President Donald Trump's policies, in particular on immigration.

Citing recent developments in Venezuela , Russia's war in Ukraine and the threats against Greenland by the Trump administration, the archbishops said rights of nations to self-determination appeared "fragile".

"The events in Venezuela, Ukraine and Greenland have raised basic questions about the use of military force and the meaning of peace," the clerics said.

The joint statement did not directly name Trump. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Saying that the U.S. needs a "genuinely moral foreign policy," the archbishops renounced "war as an instrument for narrow national interests" and said that "military action must be seen only as a last resort in extreme situations, not a normal instrument of national policy."</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 17:51:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ESYHHVWKBJMEZJJ2L2DC2E5KFI.jpg?auth=5a4c1df8c77d1c8ca91265093991128c8a006ed6fb7ea4c33a49144c75234ad2&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Celebrated Italian fashion designer Valentino dies aged 93</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260119-celebrated-italian-fashion-designer-valentino-dies-aged-93</link><description>Valentino Garavani, the jet-set Italian designer whose high-glamour gowns — often in his trademark shade of “Valentino red” — were fashion show staples for nearly half a century, has died at home in Rome, his foundation announced Monday. He was 93.

“Valentino Garavani was not only a constant guide and inspiration for all of us, but a true source of light, creativity and vision,″ the foundation said in a statement posted on social media.

His body will repose at the foundation’s headquarters in Rome on Wednesday and Thursday. The funeral will be held Friday at the Basilica Santa Maria degli Angeli e dei Martiri in Rome’s Piazza della Repubblica.

Universally known by his first name, Valentino was adored by generations of royals, first ladies and movie stars, from Jackie Kennedy Onassis to Julia Roberts and Queen Rania of Jordan , who swore the designer always made them look and feel their best.

“I know what women want,” he once remarked. “They want to be beautiful.”

Never one for edginess or statement dressing, Valentino made precious few fashion faux-pas throughout his nearly half-century-long career, which stretched from his early days in Rome in the 1960s through to his retirement in 2008.

His fail-safe designs made Valentino the king of the red carpet, the go-to man for A-listers’ awards ceremony needs. His sumptuous gowns have graced countless Academy Awards, notably in 2001, when Roberts wore a vintage black and white column to accept her best actress statue. Cate Blanchett also wore Valentino — a one-shouldered number in butter-yellow silk — when she won the Oscar for best supporting actress in 2004.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 17:54:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/beff9388-f55b-11f0-87a0-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP20218540071518.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Death toll from Guatemala gang attacks rises to nine police officers</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/death-toll-guatemala-gang-attacks-rises-nine-police-officers-2026-01-19/</link><description>GUATEMALA CITY, Jan 19 (Reuters) - The death toll from coordinated gang attacks in Guatemala has risen to nine police officers, an official confirmed on Monday, following a weekend of violence that began with prison riots.

The conflict started on Saturday when inmates from the Barrio 18 gang took 46 guards hostage at three prisons, demanding greater privileges.

The violence escalated on Sunday after security forces regained control of a prison holding the gang's leader, Aldo "El Lobo" Duppie. In apparent retaliation, gang members launched a series of attacks on police in and around Guatemala City.

Initially, seven officers and one gang member were killed in the Sunday attacks, with more than a dozen officers wounded. National police spokesman Jorge Aguilar told Reuters that an eighth officer died Sunday night and a ninth, Frallan Medrano, died early Monday from injuries sustained in an ambush.

In response, President Bernardo Arevalo declared a 30-day "state of siege," which expands the power of security forces and may temporarily limit some civil liberties.

"The attack suffered by the officers was not only against them... but against the entire country," Arevalo said during a wake for the fallen officers.

The president argued the violence was orchestrated by "political-criminal mafias" attempting to spread terror ahead of key judicial appointments.

El Lobo, the gang leader, is serving sentences totaling approximately 2,000 years and is married to the niece of Sandra Torres, Arevalo's main rival in the 2023 presidential election.

While streets in Guatemala City were mostly calm on Monday, police and military forces were patrolling heavily. Classes across the country were canceled as a precaution.

Last October, Guatemala's Congress officially classified the Barrio 18 and Mara Salvatrucha gangs as terrorist organizations.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 18:34:32 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/R2VE35BJUZN2HKRMHNVEUXHJDE.jpg?auth=68396034c53845d966ac0bc22ee282b18ee4d7b0aa6a526fbb64fe6858f630ea&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Turkey's Kurdish party says Syria deal leaves Ankara 'no excuses' on peace process</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/turkeys-kurdish-party-says-syria-deal-leaves-ankara-no-excuses-peace-process-2026-01-19/</link><description>ANKARA, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Turkey's pro-Kurdish DEM Party said on Monday that the Turkish government had no more "excuses" to delay a peace process with the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) now that a landmark integration deal was achieved in neighbouring Syria.

On Sunday in Syria, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) agreed to come under the control of authorities in Damascus - a move that Ankara had long sought as integral to its own peace effort with the PKK.

"For more than a year, the government has presented the SDF’s integration with Damascus as the biggest obstacle to the process," Tuncer Bakirhan, co-leader of the DEM Party, told Reuters, in some of the party's first public comments on the deal in Syria.

"The government will no longer have any excuses left. Now it is the government's turn to take concrete steps."

Bakirhan cautioned President Tayyip Erdogan's government against concluding that the rolling back Kurdish territorial gains in Syria negated the need for a peace process in Turkey.

"If the government calculates that ‘we have weakened the Kurds in Syria, so there is no longer a need for a process in Turkey,’ it would be making a historic mistake," he said in the interview.

Turkish officials said earlier on Monday that the Syrian integration deal, if implemented, could advance the more than year-long process with the PKK, which is based in northern Iraq. Erdogan urged swift integration of Kurdish fighters into Syria’s armed forces.

Turkey, the strongest foreign backer of Damascus, has since 2016 repeatedly sent forces into northern Syria to curb the gains of the SDF - which after the 2011–2024 civil war had controlled more than a quarter of Syria while fighting Islamic State with strong U.S. backing.

The United States has built close ties with Damascus over the last year and was closely involved in mediation between it and the SDF toward the deal.

Bakirhan said progress required recognition of Kurdish rights on both sides of the border.

"What needs to be done is clear: Kurdish rights must be recognized in both Turkey and Syria, democratic regimes must be established, and freedoms must be guaranteed," he said.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 18:34:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/SRQWQTLIFJITDPLF7FIHZ725HY.jpg?auth=c0b40b5d4628d6bf774944f4f87c380d5b959b79fb69bb4175b3946bd7647beb&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>, Valentino, Italian haute couture 'emperor' who painted fashion red, dies at 93</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/valentino-italian-haute-couture-emperor-who-painted-fashion-red-dies-93-2026-01-19/</link><description>ROME, Jan 19 (Reuters) - ROME, Jan 19 (Reuters) - A mix of carmine and scarlet, with a hint of orange - a new hue, inspired by an elderly woman at Barcelona's opera house, whose elegance struck a young Valentino Garavani.

The colour, introduced to the fashion world several years later, in 1959, with a strapless cocktail dress of draped tulle, has carried his name - "Valentino red" - ever since, doubling as the eponymous Italian fashion group's signature.

"I think a woman dressed in red is always wonderful, she is the perfect image of a heroine," Valentino wrote in the book "Rosso" (Red), released in 2022. He would include at least one red dress in every one of his collections.

Valentino, the Italian fashion designer who built one of the country's most celebrated luxury houses and was known in the industry as "the emperor", died on Monday at his home in Rome, his foundation said. He was 93.

The cause of death was not immediately known.

Valentino ranked alongside Giorgio Armani and Karl Lagerfeld as the last of a leading generation of designers, from an era before fashion became a highly commercial industry run as much by financiers and marketing executives as by couturiers.

Scaling the heights of high fashion, he was the first Italian to feature on the exclusive Paris haute couture catwalks.

Passionate about film, he dreamed as a young man of dressing the "beautiful ladies of the silverscreen", as he called them, among them 1950s Hollywood stars Lana Turner and Judy Garland.

Valentino would eventually design Elizabeth Taylor's wedding gown, and was the first choice for numerous Oscar winners, including Sharon Stone and Penelope Cruz.

His romantic designs, simple at first glance, were full of intricate detail. "I love beauty," Valentino said. "It is not my fault. And I know what women want: they want to be beautiful."

The designer, who also dressed Jackie Kennedy, created a business empire under his own name before selling it off ahead of his retirement, in 2008.

Valentino was an only child, born into a well-to-do family in Voghera, south of Milan, where his father ran an electrical supplies company.

Having started drawing and appreciating high-end clothes from a young age, he studied couture in Milan and Paris, where he then worked as an apprentice for designer Jean Dessès. He returned home in 1960, opening his own fashion house in the heart of Rome.

That year, Elizabeth Taylor chose a white Valentino gown for the premiere of blockbuster "Spartacus".

Also in 1960, he met Giancarlo Giammetti in a Roman cafe. Giammetti would go on to be his partner in business and in life.

"To share life with a person for your whole existence - every moment, joy, pain, enthusiasm, disappointment - is something that cannot be defined," Valentino said of him.

Giammetti took on the managerial part of the business, leaving creative matters to the designer.

"To be with Valentino as a friend, as a lover and as an employee is a bit the same: you need a lot of patience," Giammetti said in "Valentino: The Last Emperor", a documentary that followed the designer in the last two years of his career.

Valentino's georgette fabrics, chiffon ruffles and ornate embellishments, including the exclusive budellini technique - where long strips of sheep's wool are hand rolled into tubes, wrapped in silk and stitched together - won him a multitude of awards, including France's highest civilian distinction in 2006.

"Fame and fortune didn't change him," Giammetti said at the time. "He is still the little guy I met 45 years ago."

Superstitious and introverted, Valentino loved chocolate, skiing and his pugs. He told Corriere in 2017 that he was afraid of death.

In 2007 he wowed Rome with lavish celebrations to celebrate his decades in fashion - a three-day event that included dinners, parties and exhibitions with thousands of guests flying in from around the world.

Months later he announced that he would stop designing for his company, which he no longer controlled after selling the firm almost a decade earlier for some $300 million.

"I have decided that this is the perfect moment to say adieu to the world of fashion," he said. "As the English say, I would like to leave the party when it is still full."

His last catwalk show was held in January 2008 in Paris, a city he called his second home and which he said had taught him to love fashion and life.

The business that bears his name was bought by Qatari fund Mayhoola for 700 million euros in 2012. French luxury group Kering bought a 30% stake in 2023, with a commitment to fully acquire the business from 2026, but then deferred the move to 2028 at the earliest.

Valentino and Giammetti remained active in supporting the arts. Their foundation opened the PM23 gallery in the centre of Rome in 2025, next to the Valentino headquarters.

Fittingly, the opening exhibition - "Horizons/Red" - focused on the colour most closely associated with Valentino.

"Red isn't just a colour," Giammetti said at the time. "It's a symbolic and aesthetic force of extraordinary power."</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 19:20:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/PRXJ5WPKQ5IIFEKXQUW7QS32JQ.jpg?auth=5de06f1b2f68fb37b5c97412e2149da20bb089b3c3a4226ad1fe08bfa1cb0483&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Kurdish forces say Turkish drones hit Syria's Hasaka city; Turkey denies it</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/kurdish-forces-say-turkish-drones-hit-syrias-hasaka-city-turkey-denies-it-2026-01-19/</link><description>Jan 19 (Reuters) - The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces said on Monday that Turkish drones struck Syria's far northeastern city of Hasaka, but Turkish security sources said the report was not true.

Ukraine is still reeling from a wave of Russian strikes earlier this month that knocked out power and heating to thousands of apartment blocks, particularly in the capital Kyiv.

Zelenskiy has repeatedly called for air defences to be strengthened, including increased assistance from Ukraine's Western allies.

"There will be a new approach to the use of air defences by the Air Force, concerning mobile fire groups, interceptor drones and other 'short-range' air defence assets," Zelenskiy said in his nightly video address.

"The system will be transformed."

The president announced the appointment of a new deputy Air Force Commander, Pavlo Yelizarov, to oversee and develop the innovation.

Ukraine has rapidly developed its drone manufacturing system since Russia launched its invasion of its smaller neighbour in February 2022, and has emphasised interceptor drones as an effective and economical way to parry Russian strikes.

In his remarks, Zelenskiy warned Ukrainians to be "extremely vigilant" ahead of anticipated new Russian attacks.

"Russia has prepared for a strike, a massive strike, and is waiting for the moment to carry it out," he said, urging every region in the country to "be prepared to respond as quickly as possible and help people".

Both Zelenskiy and Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha warned at the weekend that Ukrainian intelligence had noted Russia was conducting reconnaissance of specific targets, particularly substations that supply nuclear power plants.

The president also said he had instructed Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko to make decisions this week regarding difficulties from the recent attacks, including bonuses for tens of thousands of emergency crew members restoring heating and electricity.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 20:46:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/MQS75TTA7FNHTLPDO5SNVRXWQ4.jpg?auth=9cdf4932da9ab4cabe2cb1fe93f898cfab544dd38ba171b4ff4ef4a8bad7ee18&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Islamic State claims responsibility for attack on Chinese-run restaurant in Afghanistan</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/islamic-state-claims-responsibility-attack-chinese-run-restaurant-afghanistan-2026-01-19/</link><description>CAIRO, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Islamic State claimed responsibility on Monday for an attack on a Chinese-run restaurant in a hotel in Kabul.

But the government also pledged to tackle economic hardships that sparked the demonstrations, which were met with a crackdown that rights groups say has left thousands dead.

The protests constituted the biggest challenge to the Iranian leadership in years, with the full scale of the violence yet to emerge amid an internet blackout.

National police chief Ahmad-Reza Radan on Monday urged young people "deceived" into joining the "riots" to turn themselves in and receive lighter punishment.

Those "who became unwittingly involved in the riots are considered to be deceived individuals, not enemy soldiers" and "will be treated with leniency", he told state television .

Officials have said the demonstrations were peaceful before descending into chaos fuelled by Iran's arch-foes the United States and Israel in an effort to destabilise the nation.

The heads of the country's executive, legislative and judicial branches on Monday all pledged to work "around the clock" in "resolving livelihood and economic problems", according to a joint statement published by state television.

But they would also "decisively punish" the instigators of "terrorist incidents", said the statement from President Masoud Pezeshkian , parliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf and judiciary chief Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei.

The scale of the crackdown has emerged piecemeal as Iran remains under an unprecedented internet shutdown that is now in its 11th day.

Despite difficulty accessing information, the Iran Human Rights NGO says it has verified that 3,428 protesters were killed by security forces.

The NGO's director Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam on Monday warned the death toll could be higher by many thousands.

"Information received from eyewitnesses, families and other citizens, together with other available evidence, indicates that the number of protesters killed may exceed even the highest media estimates," he said in a statement.

"There is no doubt that the Islamic republic has committed one of the largest mass killings of protesters in our time."

Alarm has grown over the possibility that authorities will use capital punishment against protesters.

The United Nations on Monday warned the country was using executions as "a tool of state intimidation".

Iran -- the world's most prolific executioner after China , according to rights groups -- reportedly executed 1,500 people last year, UN rights chief Volker Turk said in a statement.

Security officials cited by Iran's Tasnim news agency said late last week that around 3,000 people have been arrested in connection with the demonstrations, but rights groups say the number could be as high as 20,000.

Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Saturday that authorities "must break the back of the seditionists".

Internet access would "gradually" return to normal this week, Hossein Afshin, Iran's vice president for science, technology and the knowledge economy, said Monday on state television, after limited access briefly returned the day before.

Pezeshkian criticised the internet restrictions, urging "better governance" of cyberspace.

Images from the capital Tehran showed buildings and billboards destroyed during the rallies.

In Iran's second-largest city of Mashhad, damage to public infrastructure exceeded $15 million, Mayor Mohammadreza Qalandar Sharif told state television.

Outside Iran, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of neighbouring Turkey, in his first comments on the protests, described the unrest as a "new test" for Tehran, pledging Turkey would "stand against any initiative" that would drag the region into chaos.

"We believe that, with a... policy prioritising dialogue and diplomacy , our Iranian brothers will, God willing, get through this trap-filled period," he said in a televised speech.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 21:43:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/3f593b2a-f55b-11f0-93d1-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/cf1321f0d45aae92fa1e4dc2978bbe674174663c.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Sydney beaches close after three shark attacks in two days</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/sydney-beaches-close-after-three-shark-attacks-two-days-2026-01-19/</link><description>SYDNEY, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Beaches in the north of Sydney remained closed on Tuesday after a shark bit a man in his 20s, the city's third shark attack in two days.

Emergency services were called to a beach in Manly in the north of the city on Monday evening following reports a surfer had been bitten by a shark, New South Wales police said in a statement.

He was treated for serious leg injuries and taken to hospital in a critical condition.

All beaches in the Northern Beaches, a council area straddling the city's northern coastline, will remain closed until further notice, police said.

Earlier on Monday a 10-year-old boy escaped unharmed after a shark knocked him into the water, biting a chunk out of his surfboard.

On Sunday a boy was left in a critical condition after being bitten by a shark at a city beach.

The attacks follow days of heavy rain that ran off into the harbour and beaches around the city, creating ideal conditions for the bull sharks suspected to be behind some of the attacks. The species thrives in brackish water.

Australia sees around 20 shark attacks per year with just under three of those being fatalities, according to data from conservation groups. Those numbers are dwarfed by drownings on the country's beaches.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 22:23:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/S2V2TDOOWRKSRG7RM23DN7TQ2Q.jpg?auth=db2ac4a3f6c0ab2b4b706a2766b4699beb3d154abca58f7f84b09de2e3c5e0a7&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Moldova proceeds with withdrawal from Russia-led CIS group</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/moldova-proceeds-with-withdrawal-russia-led-cis-group-2026-01-19/</link><description>CHISINAU, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Moldova is proceeding with the necessary formalities to complete its withdrawal from the Russia-led Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) that emerged from the collapse of the Soviet Union, Foreign Minister Mihai Popsoi said on Monday.

Pro-European President Maia Sandu, who is spearheading a drive for Moldova to join the European Union by the end of the decade, has denounced Russia's invasion of Ukraine and accused the Kremlin of trying to subvert her government.

Moldova, one of Europe's poorest states, located between Ukraine and EU member Romania, has ceased taking part in all CIS activities since 2023.

"Let me just say that we are in the process of confirming the denunciation of three agreements with the CIS," Popsoi told Radio Moldova, citing accords which underpinned the founding of the organisation in 1991.

"The denunciation of these three agreements will mean we can say that from a legal standpoint we are no longer a member. De facto, we suspended our participation for a time, but de jure we are still there."

Sandu was re-elected in 2024 and last year, her Party of Action and Solidarity retained its majority in parliamentary polls.

Over the past 150 years, Moldova has been part of the Russian empire, Greater Romania and the Soviet Union. In more than 30 years of independence its governments have been sometimes favourable to and other times opposed to close ties with Russia.

Sandu, in a radio interview last week, said that if a referendum on reunification with Romania were now held, she would vote 'yes', the first time a Moldovan leader has taken such a position.

The head of Moldova's pro-Russian opposition Socialist Party, former president Igor Dodon, denounced the decision to withdraw from the CIS as "unacceptable".

Political analyst Vitalii Andrievschii said the move to withdraw from the CIS in no way meant Moldova would end its relationship with other ex-Soviet states.

"We have to bring this process to a conclusion," he told Reuters. "We will develop ties on a bilateral basis. But there is no point in remaining in the CIS, run by Russia."</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 22:24:27 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/F55WLNCUVZKCHCYY5PF7RZT76A.jpg?auth=e3147cf73d894969956fa297812f31ea34b51ddc8ed73bda3e4aff5181084ec7&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Senegal awaits return of AFCON champions</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/senegal-awaits-return-of-afcon-champions</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 22:25:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/c92a983e-f57a-11f0-bb2b-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/ANGL260119-2141-Live-01.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Kurdish Rudaw website reports around 1500 Islamic State members escaped from Syria's Shaddadi prison</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/kurdish-rudaw-website-reports-around-1500-islamic-state-members-escaped-syrias-2026-01-19/</link><description>CAIRO, Jan 20 (Reuters) - The Kurdish website Rudaw reported that a spokesperson for the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, Farhad Shami, said around 1500 Islamic State members escaped from Syria's Shaddadi prison.

Job vacancies requiring "AI agent" skills have surged by 1,587%, Randstad said in its yearly "Workmonitor" report, with survey data suggesting that AI and automation are increasingly replacing low-complexity, transactional roles.

Randstad (RAND.AS) , opens new tab , one of the world's largest recruitment agencies, surveyed 27,000 workers and 1,225 employers and covered more than 3 million job postings across 35 markets for the report.

Labour markets are under immense pressure as corporations around the globe ramp up job cuts as consumer sentiment dims, shaken by U.S. President Donald Trump's trade war and aggressive foreign policy moves that have taken a wrecking ball to the rule-based world order .

AI-focused tech firms have started to replace jobs with automation, even as most companies still await tangible returns from an exceptional investment boom into AI that will shape the business world for years to come.

"What we generally see amongst employees is that they are enthusiastic about AI ... but they may also be sceptical in the sense that companies want what companies always want: they want to save costs and increase efficiency," Randstad CEO Sander van 't Noordende told Reuters.

"Gen Z is the most concerned generation, while Baby Boomers show greater self-assurance and are the least worried about AI’s impact and their ability to adapt," the report said.

Nearly half of the workers interviewed fear the nascent technology stands to benefit corporations more than the workforce, the data showed.

There is also a discrepancy with how employers and workers view business performance. Around 95% of surveyed employers forecast growth for this year, while only 51% of employees shared this optimism, according to the report.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 23:21:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/6VU5636N2BPJFNGSPEI7FFSW64.jpg?auth=ebc451a8127caa4a687bdb1f79323908311b91a864b72cf451232d85d959791e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Australia's lower house passes tougher gun control laws in response to Bondi mass shooting</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/australias-lower-house-passes-tougher-gun-control-laws-response-bondi-mass-2026-01-20/</link><description>SYDNEY, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Australia’s lower house of Parliament on Tuesday passed laws to enable a national gun buyback and tighten background checks for gun licences in response to the country’s worst mass shooting in decades at a Jewish festival last month.

The bill, which was opposed by conservative lawmakers, passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 96 to 45 and will now go to the Senate.

The December 14 attack at Bondi Beach that killed 15 people was carried out by individuals who had "hate in their hearts and guns in their hands," Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said as he introduced the new laws.

"The tragic events at Bondi demand a comprehensive response from government," Burke said. "As a government, we must do everything we can to counter both the motivation and the method."

The new measures would establish a national gun buyback scheme to purchase surplus and newly restricted firearms.

They would also introduce tougher background checks for firearm licences issued by Australia’s states by drawing on information held by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation.

The government said on Sunday there were a record 4.1 million firearms in Australia last year, including more than 1.1 million in New South Wales, the country’s most populous state and the site of the Bondi attack.

New South Wales also passed new laws last month that limit the number of guns per individual to four and 10 for farmers, and mandate firearm owners to renew their licences every two years instead of five years.

"The sheer number of firearms currently circulating within the Australian community is unsustainable," Burke said.

The bill passed without the support of the conservative Liberal-National opposition coalition, who accuse Prime Minister Anthony Albanese’s Labor government of failing to adequately address rising antisemitism.

Parliament, which is sitting after Albanese recalled it early from its summer break to address issues following the Bondi attack, is also debating separate legislation that would lower the threshold for prosecuting hate speech offenses.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 01:47:08 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7YD7VD4RUFM5FKNEWZBV4DK5DM.jpg?auth=1259b2f24fcb23da86762ad9548daae8cf60ed46991df0f63c36a4259ce95ac5&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'Content to die': Afghanistan's hunger crisis worsened by winter, aid cuts</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/content-die-afghanistans-hunger-crisis-worsened-by-winter-aid-cuts-2026-01-20/</link><description>KABUL, Jan 20 (Reuters) - In the dull glow of a single bulb lighting their tent on the outskirts of Kabul, Samiullah and his wife Bibi Rehana sit down to dry bread and tea, their only meal of the day, accompanied by their five children and three-month-old grandchild.

"We have reached a point where we are content with death," said 55-year-old Samiullah, whose family, including two older sons aged 18 and 20 and their wives, is among the millions deported by neighbouring Iran and Pakistan in the past year.

"Day by day, things are getting worse," he added, after their return to a war-torn nation where the United Nations' World Food Programme estimates 17 million battle acute hunger after massive cuts in international aid.

"Whatever happens to us has happened, but at least our children's lives should be better."

He was one of the returned Afghans speaking before protests in Iran sparked a massive crackdown by the clerical establishment, killing more than 2,000 in ensuing violence.

Samiullah said his family went virtually overnight from its modest home in Iran to their makeshift tent, partially propped up by rocks and rubble, after a raid by Iranian authorities led to their arrests and then deportation.

They salvaged a few belongings but were not able to carry out all their savings, which would have carried them through the winter, Samiullah added.

Reuters was unable to reach authorities in Iran for comment.

"Migrants who are newly returning to the country receive assistance as much as possible," said Afghan administration spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid, in areas from transport to housing, healthcare and food.

It was impossible to eradicate poverty quickly in a country that suffered 40 years of conflict and the loss of all its revenue and resources, he added in a statement, despite an extensive rebuilding effort.

"Economic programmes take time and do not have an immediate impact on people's lives."

The WFP says Iran and Pakistan have expelled more than 2.5 million Afghans in massive repatriation programs.

Tehran ramped up deportations last year amid a flurry of accusations that they were spying for Israel. Authorities blamed the expulsions on concerns about security and resources.

Islamabad accelerated deportations amid accusations that the Taliban was harbouring militants responsible for cross-border attacks on Pakistani soil, allegations Afghanistan has denied.

As winter spreads across Afghanistan's arid landscape, work opportunities have dried up, while the wave of returning Afghans has swelled the population by a tenth, said John Aylieff, the WFP's country director.

"Many of these Afghans were working in Iran and Pakistan and they were sending back remittances," he told Reuters, adding that 3 million more people now face acute hunger. "Those remittances were a lifeline for Afghanistan."

Cuts to global programmes since U.S. President Donald Trump returned to the White House have sapped the resources of organisations such as the WFP, while other donor countries have also scaled back, putting millions at risk worldwide .

"Last year was the biggest malnutrition surge ever recorded in Afghanistan and sadly the prediction is that it's going to get worse," added Aylieff, estimating that 200,000 more children would suffer acute malnourishment in 2026.

At the WFP's aid distribution site in Bamiyan, about 180 km (111 miles) from Kabul, the capital, are stacks of rice bags and jugs of palm oil, while wheelbarrows trundle in more food, but it is still too little for the long queues of people.

"I am forced to manage the winter with these supplies; sometimes we eat, sometimes we don't," said Zahra Ahmadi, 50, a widowed mother of eight daughters, as she received aid for the first time.

At the Qasaba Clinic in the capital, mothers soothed their children during the wait for medicine and supplements.

"Compared to the time when there were no migrants, the number of our patients has now doubled," said Dr. Rabia Rahimi Yadgari.

The clinic treats about 30 cases of malnutrition each day but the supplements are not sufficient to sustain the families, who previously relied on WFP aid and hospital support, she said.

Laila, 30, said her son, Abdul Rahman, showed signs of recovery after taking the supplements.

"But after some time, he loses the weight again," she said.

After the Taliban takeover, she said, "My husband lost his (government) job, and gradually our economic situation collapsed. Life never remains the same."

The United States led a hasty withdrawal of international forces from Afghanistan in July 2021, after 20 years of war against the Taliban, opening the doors for the Islamists to take control of Kabul.

As dusk gathers and the temperature falls, Samiullah brings in firewood and Bibi Rehama lights a stove for warmth.

"At night, when it gets very cold, my children say, 'Father, I'm cold, I'm freezing.' I hold them in my arms and say, 'It's OK.' What choice do we have?" Samiullah said.

"(When) I worked in Iran, at least I could provide a full meal. Here, there is neither work nor livelihood."</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 01:47:10 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7P55PJCU4ROBPL6VIZSEUAPJCI.jpg?auth=8106aef172ed6b50d9cd17f39fb07aff5fd3375273c5417af6b7be494c93b9b8&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia hits Kyiv with drones and missiles, cutting power, water supplies</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/russia-hits-kyiv-with-drones-missiles-cutting-power-water-supplies-2026-01-20/</link><description>Jan 20 (Reuters) - Russian forces launched a combined drone and missile attack on the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv early on Tuesday, triggering cuts in power and water supplies, the city's mayor said.

M23, an anti‑government group, launched an offensive in early December in South Kivu province in eastern DRC and seized Uvira, a city of several hundred thousand people on the border with Burundi, just after the DRC and Rwanda signed a peace agreement overseen by US President Donald Trump.

On December 17, the armed group said it was pulling its troops out of Uvira, claiming to be responding to a US request, but M23 police and military personnel remained in the lakeside city.

On Thursday, the M23 said it planned to withdraw its remaining forces from Uvira and declared its intention to place the city "under the full and entire responsibility of the international community".

Local sources then reported troop movements on Saturday as M23 units left the city.

On Sunday morning, "wazalendo" forces -- the local pro‑Kinshasa militias -- entered southern districts of Uvira, followed later in the day by elements of the Congolese special forces, according to local and government sources.

Congolese army (FARDC) spokesman Mak Hazukay announced the city's full recapture in a statement on Monday.

Residents cheered the arriving fighters as sporadic gunfire echoed through the city. Their arrival was also marred by looting of shops and homes, according to several local sources.

"About 20 looting civilians were arrested," Hazukay said.

The FARDC "continue their deployment in the city of Uvira and its surroundings in order to consolidate their positions", the statement added.

On Sunday, the governor of the surrounding South Kivu province, Jean Jacques Purusi, said M23 troops had "positioned themselves on the heights" above Uvira "to point their weapons at the city", as well as in nearby localities, according to a message circulated to the media.

North Korea said earlier this month that a drone from South Korea was flown into its airspace recently, showing photographs of debris and aerial pictures of buildings that it alleged the drone had taken.

A South Korean task force investigating the incident has called in a civilian suspect for questioning, police said.

"It should not happen for a civilian to send a drone to North Korea for an illegal purpose," Lee told a televised cabinet meeting. "How did we fail to check that a drone had been flown to the North?"

Lee said such action was "akin to starting a war" and created unnecessary tension with North Korea that could have a negative impact on the South Korean economy. He called for a thorough investigation and to ensure it never happened again.

Lee said that while a probe was ongoing if a South Korean citizen was found to have flown the drone they could be criminally charged for provoking Pyongyang.

Kim Yo Jong, the powerful sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, last week urged Seoul to investigate the incident, warning that any provocations could result in terrible situations.

Lee's administration has been seeking to improve ties with Pyongyang since he took office last year, but so far its overtures have been rebuffed by the North.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 03:46:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/NR4VOIEQI5PHHNNV27DMYEWQLQ.jpg?auth=ef2f5d95b88de6e1bf1e4a5f99a6b42993770d29142de811084df5fed5975261&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Vietnam's Lam pledges growth above 10% despite global challenges</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/vietnams-lam-pledges-growth-above-10-despite-global-disruptions-2026-01-20/</link><description>HANOI, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Vietnam's top leader To Lam pledged annual economic growth of more than 10% for the remainder of the decade despite global disruptions, as he addressed delegates at the Communist Party congress on Tuesday.

The week-long event, which started on Monday in Hanoi, will select the party chief, the country's most powerful position, and set economic goals up to 2030.

The congress is taking place amid "many overlapping difficulties and challenges, from natural disasters, storms and floods to epidemics, security risks, fierce strategic competition, and major disruptions in energy and food supply chains," Lam told delegates at the start of his speech.

The former head of state security, who is seeking to retain his role as party chief and possibly take on the state presidency, promised to further reform the public administration after he launched the bureacracy's most significant overhaul in decades during his brief tenure as party chief.

A party document submitted to the congress and reviewed by Reuters set the annual growth goal at no less than 10% until 2030, above a missed target of 6.5%-7.0% for the first half of the decade.

Lam, 68, said Vietnam was also determined to cut red tape and expand global trade to ensure the country's independence and national interests were protected.

The 20% tariffs imposed on Vietnam in August by the Trump administration have not prevented Vietnamese exports to the United States from growing, leading to a record trade surplus with Washington.

However, the country is seeking to boost trade ties with other partners, with the impact of U.S. duties likely to be felt over the coming months.

Lam promised to continue the fight against corruption, although during his tenure the anti-bribe drive launched by his late predecessor Nguyen Phu Trong has abated, as Lam sought to speed up project approvals to boost growth.

"Infrastructure must be developed to adapt to climate change and ensure strong regional, inter‑regional, and global connectivity," Lam also said.

He has presided over a splurge in infrastructure projects, which has supported economic growth, but has also raised concerns about favouritism and waste.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 03:47:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/NDU6WCGXUFNAVMN5NG3Q6UHT3U.jpg?auth=733518ec1e0c1ded91cdb08520d5878fe2a5e7fea7e4d2a89709fbf93e605c0d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>North Korea's Kim purges vice premier, slams ‘incompetent’ officials</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260120-north-korea-s-kim-purges-vice-premier-slams-incompetent-officials</link><description>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has fired his vice premier and railed against "incompetent" officials in a rare and very public broadside against apparatchiks at the opening of a critical factory, state media said Tuesday.

Vice Premier Yang Sung Ho was sacked "on the spot", the state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said, in a speech in which Kim attacked "irresponsible, rude and incompetent leading officials".

"Please, Comrade Vice Premier, resign by yourself when you can do it on your own before it is too late," Kim reportedly said.

Nuclear-armed North Korea, which is under multiple sets of sanctions over its weapons programmes, has long struggled with its moribund state-managed economy and chronic food shortages.

Kim has been quick to scold lazy officials for alleged mismanagement of economic policy but such a public dismissal is very rare.

Touring the opening of an industrial machinery complex on Monday, Kim blasted cadres who for "too long been accustomed to defeatism, irresponsibility and passiveness".

Yang was "unfit to be entrusted with heavy duties", Kim said, according to KCNA.

"Put simply, it was like hitching a cart to a goat -- an accidental mistake in our cadre appointment process," the North Korean leader explained.

"After all, it is an ox that pulls a cart, not a goat."

And he urged a quick turnaround in the "centuries-old backwardness of the economy and build a modernised and advanced one capable of firmly guaranteeing the future of our state".

Images released by Pyongyang showed a stern-looking Kim delivering a speech at the venue in Hamgyong Province in the country's frigid northeast, with workers in attendance wearing green uniforms and matching grey hats.

The impoverished North has long prioritised its military and banned nuclear weapons programmes over providing for its people.

It is highly vulnerable to natural disasters including flood and drought due to a chronic lack of infrastructure, deforestation and decades of state mismanagement.

The new machine complex makes up part of a large machinery-manufacturing belt linking the northeast to Wonsan further south, "accounting for about 16 percent of North Korea's total machinery output", according to Yang Moo-jin of the University of North Korean Studies.

Kim's public dismissal of Yang mirrors past cases such as Jang Song Thaek, Kim's uncle, who was executed in 2013 after being accused of plotting to overthrow his nephew, Yang said.

The North Korean leader is "using public accountability as a shock tactic to warn party officials", he told AFP.

Pyongyang is gearing up for its first congress of its ruling party in five years, with analysts expecting it in the coming weeks.

Economic policy, as well as defence and military planning, are likely to be high on the agenda.

Last month, Kim vowed to root out "evil" at a major meeting of Pyongyang's top brass.

State media did not offer specifics, though it did say the ruling party had revealed numerous recent "deviations" in discipline -- a euphemism for corruption.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 03:47:54 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/54c06540-f5a3-11f0-90c8-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/3d05bc0e43c3bcb5463fa919406e06d92b88b61f.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Islamic State group claims deadly blast at Chinese restaurant in Kabul</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260120-islamic-state-group-claims-deadly-blast-at-chinese-restaurant-in-kabul-afghanistan-china</link><description>A blast at a Chinese restaurant in central Kabul on Monday killed at least seven people and wounded more than a dozen others, emergency services said.

An AFP journalist saw police vehicles and an ambulance at the scene following the explosion on a street known for its flower sellers in the Shahr-e-Naw area.

Kabul police spokesman Khalid Zadran said the explosion occurred at the Chinese Noodle restaurant, which he said mainly served Chinese Muslims.

"A Chinese Muslim, Ayub, and six Afghans were killed, and several others were wounded. The blast occurred near the kitchen," Zadran said in a statement.

The police spokesman, who said the cause was under investigation, had earlier said the blast hit a hotel.

The Islamic State armed group claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement, the SITE Intelligence Group reported, saying it was a suicide attack targeting Chinese nationals.

"The Islamic State in Afghanistan has placed Chinese nationals on its list of targets, especially in light of the escalating crimes committed by the Chinese government against the oppressed Uyghur Muslims," the IS statement said.

Italian NGO EMERGENCY said its hospital near the targeted restaurant had received "seven people dead on arrival", with 13 others admitted to the surgical department.

"Among the wounded are four women and a child," Dejan Panic, the NGO's country director, said in a statement.

The owner of a flower shop, requesting anonymity for security reasons, said the blast happened at around 3:30 pm (1100 GMT) at the other end of the street from his business.

He told AFP he heard the "strong sound" of a blast in the crowded area.

"It was an emergency situation. Everybody feared for his own life," he said.

"I could see at least five wounded."

Within hours of the blast the street was reopened to traffic, with cars streaming past the restaurant's covered entrance.

Windows in the building opposite were smashed, according to an AFP photographer.

Taliban officials have vowed to restore security to the country and are courting foreign investors to secure crucial revenue streams as foreign aid funding dries up.

Chinese business visitors have flocked to Afghanistan since the Taliban government took power in 2021 for the second time.

The following year, the Islamic State group claimed a deadly attack on a Kabul hotel popular with Chinese guests.

China, which shares a rugged 76-kilometre (47-mile) border with Afghanistan, has close ties with the Taliban government.

Trump is set to dominate the week at the Swiss ski resort, with a US delegation already on the ground to promote an American agenda that has unsettled the global order cherished by the World Economic Forum (WEF).

European Union chief Ursula von der Leyen and French President Emmanuel Macron will address the forum on Tuesday, along with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, whose countries have their own disputes with Trump.

Trump will deliver a speech on Wednesday and participate in other events on Thursday.

Europe is weighing countermeasures after Trump threatened to impose tariffs on eight European countries over the Greenland standoff.

US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who is leading the US contingent in Davos, warned that EU retaliation "would be very unwise".

Von der Leyen met with a bipartisan US congressional delegation in Davos on Monday and said on social media that she had "addressed the need to unequivocally respect the sovereignty of Greenland and of the Kingdom of Denmark".

While Macron will leave on Tuesday without seeing Trump in Davos, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said he would seek to meet the US president at the forum on Wednesday.

Merz said Germany and other European countries agreed "that we want to avoid any escalation in this dispute if at all possible".

Leaders from the 27-nation bloc will hold an emergency summit in Brussels on Thursday to discuss their response to one of the gravest crises in years to hit transatlantic ties.

At a news conference in Davos, Finland's President Alexander Stubb said "tariff threats at the allied level are unacceptable. They weaken our transatlantic relationship and, in the worst case, can lead to a vicious cycle".

When asked if the United States might use force, Stubb said: "I don't believe that the United States will take control of Greenland militarily."

Denmark has proposed that NATO start surveillance operations in Greenland to confront security concerns.

Other prominent foreign leaders addressing the WEF on Tuesday include Carney, who has sought to reduce his country's reliance on the United States as Trump has raised tariffs on Canadian products.

As US ties fray, Carney turned the page on years of diplomatic tensions with China during a visit to Beijing last week, securing a preliminary trade agreement to reduce tariffs.

Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng, whose country has had long-running trade spats with Trump, will also address the WEF.

Other flashpoints on the WEF agenda include the crises in Venezuela, Gaza, Ukraine and Iran.

The United States has sent an unusually large delegation to Davos, in a sign that it wants to make its presence felt at the gathering for global economic and political leaders.

Bessent and other US officials will attend panels at the forum's congress centre but also at the "USA House", a venue inside an old church on the glitzy promenade of the mountain retreat.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 03:47:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/958a9c9e-f59e-11f0-9811-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/d4e168388e1a20126e943459d9ed31017af3faea.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Hong Kong to call 10 witnesses in case over Baltic Sea undersea cable damage</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/hong-kong-call-10-witnesses-case-over-baltic-sea-undersea-cable-damage-2026-01-20/</link><description>HONG KONG, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Ten witnesses will be called to testify in a "criminal damage" case against a Chinese captain of a Hong Kong-registered ship alleged to have damaged undersea cables in the Baltic Sea, his lawyer told reporters in Hong Kong after a hearing on Tuesday.

Wan Wenguo , the captain of the container ship NewNew Polar Bear, is alleged to have caused "criminal damage" to an underwater natural gas pipeline and submarine telecom cables between Finland and Estonia on October 8, 2023, according to a Hong Kong charge sheet reviewed by Reuters.

Wan appeared in court on Tuesday but his lawyer said more time was needed to go through documents before entering a plea.

The case has been adjourned to February 11.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 04:47:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/DDXQBMOAMFLS3N4WR7JTGAKMT4.jpg?auth=6b148bb69e8ffb632cd5dea8f4291b0b10d2586122802660e292ba05f956e997&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Canadian tourist found dead on Australian beach surrounded by dingoes</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/canadian-tourist-found-dead-australian-beach-surrounded-by-dingoes-2026-01-20/</link><description>SYDNEY, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Australian police are investigating whether a Canadian tourist discovered dead on a beach in the northern state of Queensland drowned or was attacked by a pack of dingoes, the wild dogs native to the country.

The 19-year-old woman was found on Monday after telling friends she was going for a swim on K'Gari, an island off the Queensland coast, police said.

"At this stage it's too early to confirm how the young lady lost her life. We are investigating all possibilities," Queensland police inspector Paul Algie told a press conference, but gave no details of the woman's identity.

"People travelling down the beach noticed the group of dingoes, stopped very quickly and obviously scared those dingoes away and uncovered the young lady's body," he added.

The wild dogs roam the island freely, emboldened by growing human contact, the state's environment ministry has said. They are capable of injuring and occasionally killing people, especially children.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 04:47:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>ASEAN will not certify Myanmar election or send observers, Malaysia says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/asean-will-not-certify-myanmar-election-or-send-observers-malaysia-says-2026-01-20/</link><description>KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 20 (Reuters) - The 11-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations will not send observers to army-ruled Myanmar's ongoing three-stage election and will therefore not endorse the poll, Malaysia's foreign minister said on Tuesday.

Myanmar has been ravaged by conflict since the military staged a coup against a civilian government in 2021.

The election, which began in December last year, has been criticised by the United Nations, many Western countries and rights groups as a ploy to legitimise military rule through political proxies - a charge the junta has denied.

In a low turnout , voters cast their ballots in the second stage of the poll earlier this month, with the military-allied Union Solidarity and Development Party leading after securing 88% of the lower house seats contested over the first phase.

Speaking in parliament, Minister Mohamad Hasan said ASEAN had rejected a request from Myanmar to send election observers during the annual leaders' summit in Kuala Lumpur last year, though some individual member states had decided to do so on their own.

"We have said that ASEAN will not send observers, and by virtue of that, we will not certify the poll," Mohamad said in response to a question from another lawmaker about Malaysia and ASEAN's position on the election.

Separately, Mohamad also said ASEAN was in the final stages of concluding a long-proposed code of conduct with Beijing this year concerning activities in the South China Sea.

"We hope we are able to do it by this year," he said.

ASEAN and China pledged in 2002 to create a code of conduct but took 15 years to start discussions, and progress has been slow.

Beijing claims sovereignty over most of the South China Sea, including parts of the 200-nautical mile exclusive economic zones of the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, Taiwan and Vietnam, complicating fishing and energy exploration activities by those countries.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 04:48:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/3NJD7XBAZRJRJGD7ZSDS23GZOU.jpg?auth=0e933fdca3b9bc056ebc2209a9a58cb9ed70f07f2b85be6a3dca05c11aafff80&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Wave of low temperature brings rare snowfall to Shanghai</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/wave-low-temperature-brings-rare-snowfall-shanghai-2026-01-20/</link><description>SHANGHAI, Jan 20 (Reuters) - A wave of low temperature sweeping southern China brought rare snowfall to Shanghai on Tuesday, delighting residents of the financial hub as authorities warned that the frigid weather could last for at least three days.

The city, on China's east coast, last experienced a heavy snowfall in January 2018. And just last week, Shanghai basked in unusually high temperatures of 20 degrees Celsius (68 degrees Fahrenheit), which local media said had caused some osmanthus trees to bloom.

"The weather seems rather strange this year," said 30-year-old resident Yu Xin.

"In general, the temperature fluctuations have been quite significant, so some people might feel a bit uncomfortable," she said.

Chinese state media said other areas experienced sharp temperature drops, including Jiangxi and Guizhou provinces, which sit south of China's Yangtze and Huai rivers. Guizhou province is expected to experience temperature drops of 10 to 14 degrees Celsius, the Zhejiang News reported.

Across China, authorities have also shut 241 sections of major roads in 12 provinces including Shanxi, Inner Mongolia and Heilongjiang due to snowfall and icy roads, state broadcaster CCTV said.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 05:30:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/S4OIA6MB2BKNJO7VVP5MCEJFCQ.jpg?auth=64e9639fd70649735aa48dfea3ed5287f2f13b634274478b7d7c8edb1baabfd3&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Canada's Carney aims to lead new global trading order less reliant on US</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/canadas-carney-aims-lead-new-global-trading-order-less-reliant-us-2026-01-20/</link><description>OTTAWA/DOHA/DUBAI, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney is trying to foster a new global trading order by working more closely with China and inking smaller trade deals, but faces constraints from Canada's still overwhelming economic dependency on the United States.

Last week, Carney took his trade diversification push further than his allies in Europe by signing a deal with China , and aims to project Canada as a potential leader in a new global trading order after U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs upended long-standing relationships.

Forging new alliances and trading partnerships has taken on new urgency for countries like Canada as Trump's foreign policy grows more aggressive and unpredictable. Trump has intensified his push to wrest sovereignty over Greenland from fellow NATO member Denmark, prompting the European Union to weigh hitting back with its own measures.

Carney, the former head of both the Bank of England and the Bank of Canada, won an election last year promising to create new economic alliances to help Canada survive Trump's tariffs and threats to annex Canada.

Before arriving at an annual gathering of the global elite in Davos on Monday, he circled the world and visited countries previously overlooked by Canada.

"A number of the multilateral relationships, institutions, rules-based systems, are being eroded by various decisions of various countries, the United States included," Carney said in Doha on Sunday, where he pledged more cooperation on defense and security and said progress had been made on an investment promotion agreement.

"Where there is progress, and where Canada and like-minded countries are looking to make progress, is through plurilateral deals," Carney said, advocating for agreements between a smaller number of countries.

Carney said Canada was already advocating to be a bridge between the European Union and Pacific Rim nations.

"In this moment of volatility, Canada will step up and lead. We will make sure that we are bringing countries to the table who will assist in this role," Foreign Minister Anita Anand told Reuters in an interview in Doha.

The European Union is also intensifying its trade diversification efforts - signing a deal with South American trade bloc Mercosur after 25 years of talks, concluding a deal with Indonesia in September and updating agreements with Mexico . The EU has resumed trade agreement negotiations with Malaysia, the Philippines, the United Arab Emirates and India.

But while the EU relies on the U.S. for just over 20% of goods exports, Canada still sends close to 70% of its exports south of the border.

For Canada to reduce merchandise exports to the U.S. by 10%, it would have to double its exports to China, Germany, France, Mexico, Italy and India or find similar countries of that size, said Prince Owusu, senior economist with Export Development Canada.

Carney has pledged to double Canada's non-U.S. exports over the next decade. Trade experts and economists say to achieve this, Canada has to heavily rely on China, currently its No. 2 trade partner.

"We have to be very cautious... Moving too quickly and integrating too quickly with China also creates some issues around long-term stability for the economy," said William Pellerin, partner and co-head for international trade at law firm McMillan.

Chinese manufacturers have the ability to flood the Canadian market overnight in just about every category of goods, he said.

China's shipments to the U.S. fell last year but rose sharply to the rest of the world.

Canada's share of exports to the U.S. fell to their lowest ever level outside the COVID-19 pandemic years in October, according to official data. But the U.S. still accounted for 67.3% of all exports. While the government hopes to sell more oil to Asia, 90% of Canadian crude goes to the U.S.

Economists say the U.S. share of Canadian exports is unlikely to decline much more anytime soon, with many companies awaiting the outcome of negotiations over the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement this year.

Carney last week became the first Canadian prime minister to visit Qatar and the first to visit China since 2017.

In Beijing, Carney said China had become a more predictable partner than the U.S. He is expected to visit India soon, after the two countries restored diplomatic ties and agreed to restart trade talks that had stalled under his predecessor Justin Trudeau.

Canada has also wrapped up trade deals with Ecuador and Indonesia and signed investment agreements with the United Arab Emirates.

Carney's Trade Minister Maninder Sidhu said Canada will next focus on the Philippines, Thailand, Mercosur and Saudi Arabia, as well as India.

"Normally, the government of Canada signs one trade agreement a year," Sidhu said in an interview in Dubai. "We want to make sure we get those done as soon as possible."</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 06:37:58 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/SF7GIQBNW5POFPDSVTK5STODVM.jpg?auth=da65a6c83570831532146900d86650911dfec89df2d769af97a2412d316c5cf3&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump says had a telephone call with NATO's Rutte concerning Greenland</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/trump-says-had-telephone-call-with-natos-rutte-concerning-greenland-2026-01-20/</link><description>Jan 20 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday he had a "very good" telephone call with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte concerning Greenland.

US President Donald Trump said Monday he thought European leaders would not "push back too much" on his attempt to buy Greenland.

"I don't think they're gonna push back too much. We have to have it. They have to have this done," he told a reporter in Florida who asked what Trump planned to say to European leaders who opposed his plans.

Red baseball caps spoofing Donald Trump’s iconic MAGA hats have become a symbol of Danish and Greenlandic defiance against the U.S. president's threat to seize the frozen territory.

The caps reading “Make America Go Away” — parodying Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan — have gained popularity along with several variants on social media and at public protests, including a weekend demonstration held in freezing weather in the Danish capital.

European governments are rallying behind Denmark, citing the need to defend Arctic regions and warning that threats against Greenland undermine Western security.

Protesters, however, are less diplomatic.

“I want to show my support to Greenland and also show that I don’t like the president of the United States,” said 76-year-old Copenhagen resident Lars Hermansen, who wore one of the red caps at a protest Saturday.

Donald Trump warned he no longer feels obliged to think "purely of peace" after being snubbed for a Nobel prize, in a text message published Monday as the US president ramps up his campaign to take over Greenland.

In an extraordinary exchange with Norway's prime minister, Trump questioned Denmark's right to the vast Arctic island, over which he said he wanted "complete and total control".

"Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace," Trump wrote to Norway's Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store.

"Denmark cannot protect that land from Russia or China, and why do they have a ‘right of ownership’ anyway? There are no written documents.

"The World is not secure unless we have Complete and Total Control of Greenland."

NATO will keep working with Denmark and Greenland on security, the military alliance's Secretary General Mark ​Rutte said.

Norway’s Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store on Monday said he received a message from Trump about rising tensions over Greenland in which the US president reportedly said he no longer felt obligated to think purely of peace since he did not receive the Nobel Peace Prize .</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 06:40:31 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/a19e01d0-f2f4-11f0-9a9b-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/063-2256603455.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia jails U.S. citizen for five years after he carried rifle on yacht</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/russia-jails-us-citizen-five-years-after-he-carried-rifle-yacht-2026-01-20/</link><description>MOSCOW, Jan 20 (Reuters) - A Russian court sentenced a U.S. citizen to five years in jail for crossing the border with a weapon when he sailed from the United States to meet a Russian woman he met over the Internet, Russia's court service said.

The man, identified as Charles Wayne Zimmerman, pleaded guilty but told the court that the weapon was stored on his yacht for self-defence and he had not been aware of the Russian law, the service said in Monday's statement.

Russian prison ends a long voyage for Zimmerman, who sailed off in July 2024 from North Carolina to Portugal, and then through the Mediterranean and Black seas to arrive in June 2025 at the southern port of Sochi.

"Zimmerman told the court he had met a woman from Kazan over the internet and had decided to sail to meet her on his yacht," the court service added, referring to the southern city.

"When setting off, he did not bother to study the laws of the Russian Federation and believed that the weapons stored on his yacht for self-defence should simply always remain on board."

Found guilty, he was sentenced to five years in jail by a court in Sochi in the Krasnodar region, the service said.

It released video showing a rifle and Remington cartridges seized from the yacht, on which Zimmerman was seated with a bottle of water.

Reuters was unable to reach Zimmerman for comment.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 07:28:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump shares messages from France's Macron offering G7 meeting after Davos</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/trump-shares-messages-frances-macron-offering-g7-meeting-after-davos-2026-01-20/</link><description>Jan 20 (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron told U.S. President Donald Trump that he could set up a G7 meeting in Paris on Thursday afternoon and that he did not understand what Trump was "doing on Greenland," in a screenshot of the messages that Trump posted on Truth Social and said was a note from Macron.

The east African country's veteran leader Yoweri Museveni, 81, was declared the landslide winner of the January 15 poll with 71.6% of the vote against his opponent Bobi Wine with 24%.

Wine, the pop star-turned-politician, and his party, the National Unity Platform have rejected the results, alleging widespread irregularities including ballot stuffing, enforced disappearance of polling agents and intimidation by security forces. Wine's whereabouts remain unknown after he said he had escaped a raid by the military on his home.

In a video on NTV Uganda on Monday night Wine accused police of vandalising his home and said leaving his residence would free him "to speak to the world." He did not disclose his location.

At least 118 members of the NUP were taken to various courts in the capital Kampala on Monday and charged with offences including unlawful assembly, conspiracy and unlawful possession of election materials, NUP lawyer Kato Tumusiime told Reuters and court documents showed.

David Rubongoya, NUP's secretary general, denied their supporters were involved in violent activity.

"Majority of them were polling agents, they even had their letters confirming that they are polling agents of NUP, they were targeted, arrested violently," Rubongoya told local broadcaster NTV Uganda late on Monday.

Scattered protests broke out around the capital on Saturday shortly after the electoral body declared Museveni the winner, although they were quickly quashed by police using teargas and detentions.

Ahead of voting, the U.N. Human Rights Office accused Uganda's military and police of using live ammunition to disperse peaceful rallies, carrying arbitrary detentions and abduction of opposition supporters.

In power since 1986 and currently Africa's third longest-ruling head of state, Museveni's latest win means he will have been in power for nearly half a century when his new term ends in 2031.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 07:28:56 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KN2RQA4TARIPLFIYJN3GZZCLP4.jpg?auth=1ed9a7391a433f937fee25e74094a895e8a52abdc5e15174727b4407c512c697&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump threatens 200% tariff on French wine over Macron's refusal to join 'Board of Peace'</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/trump-threatens-200-tariff-french-wine-macron-refusal-join-board-of-peace</link><description>US President Donald Trump said ⁠he will impose a 200 percent tariff on French wines and Champagnes , a move he claimed would push French President Emmanuel Macron to ​join Trump's Board of Peace initiative aimed at resolving ‍global conflicts.

When asked by a reporter about Macron saying he will not join the ​board, Trump said, "Did he say that? Well, nobody wants him ​because he will be out of office very soon."

"I'll put a 200 percent tariff on his wines and Champagnes, and he'll join, but he doesn't have to join," Trump said.

France intends to decline the invitation to join the initiative, at this stage, a source close to Macron ‍said on Monday.

Trump originally proposed establishing the Board of Peace when he announced last ​September his plan to end the war in Gaza . But an invitation sent to world leaders last week outlines a broad role ‌ending conflicts globally.

A draft charter sent to about 60 countries by the US administration calls for ‍members to contribute $1 billion in cash if they want their membership to last more than three years, according to the document seen by Reuters.

The island of Diego Garcia houses a strategically important U.S.-UK air base in the Indian Ocean.

Britain and Mauritius last year struck a deal to pass on the sovereignty of the Chagos islands to Mauritius while allowing Britain to retain control of the air base under a long-term lease.

Trump wrote on his Truth Social account: "Shockingly, our 'brilliant' NATO Ally, the United Kingdom, is currently planning to give away the Island of Diego Garcia, the site of a vital U.S. Military Base, to Mauritius, and to do so FOR NO REASON WHATSOEVER."

Trump said there was no doubt that "China and Russia have noticed this act" by Britain.

The UK government did not immediately respond to a Reuters' request for comment on Tuesday.

Trump has previously said that the encroaching presence of China and Russia makes Greenland vital to U.S. security interests, and repeatedly insisted he will settle for nothing less than ownership of Greenland.

Britain's deal with Mauritius was delayed after the Trump's inauguration in January 2025, with London wanting to give the new administration time to examine the details of the plan.

In February of that year, Trump indicated he was "inclined to go along" with Britain on the agreement.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 07:50:54 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CIMWSN4XWNGXVPTO5N74QYT2XA.JPG?auth=c8143363cc516af47b32604023f92d6aac27dd7563947467cc110155d1447cc0&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Rescue workers clearing Karachi inferno ruins, 63 missing feared dead</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/rescue-workers-clearing-karachi-inferno-ruins-63-missing-feared-dead-2026-01-20/</link><description>KARACHI, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Firefighters were clearing the charred ruins of a Karachi mall on Tuesday as they tried to locate 63 people still missing after a fire that burned for nearly two days and killed 21 people.

Police have said most of the missing are feared dead and rescue workers were trying to locate bodies in the debris.

The city's largest fire in over a decade started late on Saturday and quickly spread through the sprawling Gul Plaza shopping complex, famous for its 1,200 family-owned stores that sold wedding clothes, toys, crockery and much else.

Firefighters battled the flames that created an inferno inside the mall throughout the night and late into Sunday before bringing the blaze under control, although small fires continued to break out across the ruins.

Kosar Bano, a woman standing near the site, said six of her family had gone to the mall to shop for a wedding. The last time she heard from them, they said they would be home in 15 minutes.

"The only hope we have is how many hands we will find, how many fingers we will find, and how many legs we will find. That's it," she said.

Much of the once-imposing structure, larger than a football field, was reduced to a pile of ash and debris scattered across the street as rescue workers searched for a growing list of missing people.

Rizwan Ahmed from the Rescue 1122 group said on Tuesday that 21 people were killed in the blaze while another 63 were still missing, nearly three days after the fire began.

Relief workers dug through the rubble and brought out human remains in sacks before sending them for DNA testing.

Senior police official Syed Asad Raza told Reuters that 15 DNA samples had been collected by Monday night to help identify the bodies.

There was also rising anger at the scene with people blaming a delayed rescue effort and jeering the city's mayor when he showed up at the site nearly 24 hours after the fire began.

The government has said it will investigate the cause of the fire and the response.

Police also said that all but three of the mall's 16 exits were locked when the fire began around the mall's closing time.

Gul Plaza's management did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters.

Islamabad has held talks with 13 countries, six to eight of which are in an advanced stage, for deals involving JF-17 jets made jointly with China as well as training aircraft, drones, and weapons systems, said three Pakistani sources who have knowledge of defence sales.

Pakistan's military and defence ministry did not provide details on any deals but the country's defence production minister confirmed that several countries were interested in jets and other military equipment.

China's defence ministry did not respond to Reuters' request for comment.

Analysts believe countries are searching for new supply chains following disruptions caused by the war in Ukraine and conflict in the Middle East. Pakistan's weapons have become a viable alternative after they were tested in a massive air battle with India in May, in which Pakistan's air force squadrons flew JF-17s alongside the advanced Chinese-made J-10s.

Reuters spoke to six sources privy to defence deals, three retired air force officials, and a dozen analysts who provided insight into Pakistan's rising weapons industry, including unreported details of negotiations.

While some expressed scepticism about whether Pakistan could navigate geopolitical pressures and increase production capacity, there was consensus that interest in Pakistani military hardware had surged. However, most analysts cautioned talks would not necessarily lead to signed deals.

"These talks are taking place (but) they can fall through due to international pressures," Defence Production Minister Raza Hayat Harraj told Reuters, terming any negotiations "guarded secrets".

"There are a lot of queries but we are negotiating," he said, adding interest had been expressed in air force equipment, ammunition and training.

Harraj also stressed the price difference between Pakistani jets and weapons and alternatives made in the U.S. and Europe. While some Western options may be more technologically advanced, they cost more than three times as much as an approximately $30 million to $40 million JF-17.

The sources said countries engaged in talks include Sudan, Saudi Arabia , Indonesia , Morocco, Ethiopia, and Nigeria as well as the government in eastern Libya led by Khalifa Haftar. Discussions on JF-17s and other weapons with Bangladesh and Iraq have been publicly acknowledged by Pakistan's military, although more details have not been made public.

Almost all the potential buyers are Muslim-majority nations, like Pakistan. Many are from the predominantly Muslim Middle East, where Pakistan has historically been a security provider.

Asim Suleiman, a retired Air Marshal who remains briefed on defence sales, said "there are also three African countries lined up" as buyers, which do not include deals with the Libyan National Army and Sudan previously reported by Reuters.

Three defence sources said among the most advanced talks is a wide-ranging arms, defence cooperation and intelligence-sharing deal with Bangladesh, which gained independence from Pakistan after the 1971 civil war.

The talks include JF-17 Block III multi-role fighter jets, MFI-17 Mushshak aircraft, Pakistani-made drones including the Shahpar reconnaissance and attack UAVs, air defence systems, and Mohafiz mine-resistant armoured vehicles, two of the sources said.

A key hurdle will be whether Pakistan can scale production of the JF-17, which has become the cornerstone of its weapons production programme, with training aircraft and drones also in demand.

Suleiman said that by the end of 2027 Pakistan's jet production rate will increase significantly, even possibly double from the current 20 or so aircraft manufactured annually
 , due to upgrades and expansions at the main factory.

Analysts said there were few visible constraints on increasing defence manufacturing and with backing from Beijing, Pakistan should be able to overcome most hurdles.

Pakistan "is becoming more relevant as a flexible, mid-tier provider of defence capacity," said Andreas Krieg, a lecturer at King's College London's security studies department.

"It can train forces, provide advisers, run joint exercises, support maritime operations, and offer a menu of cost-effective platforms. For fragile African partners, that combination can be attractive: it is faster than Western capacity-building, less politically encumbered, and often cheaper."

Partnerships with a rising private sector specialising in defence, particularly drones, will also speed up growth.

At Sysverve Aerospace in the city of Rawalpindi, where Pakistan's army also has its headquarters, workers build hundreds of kamikaze and reconnaissance drones a year that are primarily supplied to the military.

"The trend in the army is naturally moving toward engaging the private sector," company director Saad Mir told Reuters.

Siemon Wezeman, a senior arms transfer researcher at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, said it was unclear how many reported talks over JF-17 sales would firm into hard deals, adding that Beijing could object to sales to certain clients.

While Pakistan was a natural partner for China to market the aircraft across the Middle East and Africa, "it's the ones to Sudan and Libya that are really problematic".

Both Libya and Sudan's Darfur region are subject to U.N. arms embargoes.

Alongside juggling ties with China, Pakistan is navigating Middle East tensions between allies Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

Islamabad has signed a mutual defence pact with Riyadh and is discussing another defence agreement involving Saudi Arabia and Turkey, although details have not been made public.

"On the ideological side, Islamabad is more aligned with Saudis on overall narrative," said Emadeddin Badi from the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime.

"But where things get murkier is on the business, ports, mineral sides, all those supply chains are very much dominated by UAE, that's where the battle is playing out and Saudis have to play catch-up."</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 08:35:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ROUKOLMVPRKY5MZJPS6FK5ZIVI.jpg?auth=c67ba8a9c535927877429504b606f374e37389d359b04318725dc7c4c7e0710a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China invited to join Trump's 'Board of Peace'</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-invited-join-trumps-board-peace-2026-01-20/</link><description>BEIJING, Jan 20 (Reuters) - China on Tuesday confirmed that it had been asked to join U.S. President Donald Trump 's "Board of Peace," an invitation that Washington had extended to dozens of countries in his bid to launch a global initiative aimed at resolving conflicts.

But Beijing, which recently struck a delicate trade truce with Washington, stopped short of saying whether it would accept or decline the invitation.

Governments from around the world have so far reacted cautiously to Trump's invitation to join the initiative, which diplomats say could undermine the United Nations.

The initiative would kick off by addressing the Gaza conflict and then be expanded to deal with other situations. The initiative's board would be chaired for life by Trump. Member states would be limited to three-year terms unless they paid $1 billion each .

"The Chinese side has received the invitation from the U.S.," said Guo Jiakun, a spokesperson at the Chinese foreign ministry, at a regular news conference.

He declined to comment when asked if China would accept the invitation.

Asked how China would evaluate Trump's presidency in the past year, especially in light of his stance on Venezuela and threat to annex Greenland, the spokesperson refrained from giving an assessment.

"Over the past year, China-U.S. relations have experienced ups and downs, but have achieved overall dynamic stability," said Guo, explaining that occasional variability in their relationship could be expected.

China is willing to work with the U.S. on further stabilising ties while safeguarding its own interests, Guo said.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 08:36:12 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/XWONIJSWTNKUHD2K4L52UC7IKA.jpg?auth=f77f9030ee297e634794b70af2b057dae2ab348234880de3b98a6799360dbb3c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China invited to join Trump's 'Board of Peace'</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-invited-join-trumps-board-peace-2026-01-20/</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 08:37:09 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>More than 5,600 Kyiv residential buildings left without heat after Russian attack</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260120-more-than-5-600-kyiv-residential-buildings-left-without-heat-after-russian-attack</link><description>A Russian aerial attack overnight on the Ukrainian capital has left thousands of residential buildings without heating in minus 14C temperatures , mayor Vitaly Klitschko said Tuesday.

"After this attack, 5,635 residential buildings are without heating," he said on Telegram, adding that a large part of the city was also without running water.

A woman was wounded and hospitalised, Klitschko said, adding that several buildings, including a primary school, were damaged.

These new strikes come some 10 days after Moscow 's worst attack on Kyiv 's energy grid since the start of its invasion of Ukraine four years ago.

The attack carried out at dawn on January 9 targeted energy facilities, depriving half the city of heating and leaving many residents without electricity for days in freezing temperatures.

In the night of Monday to Tuesday, Russia fired long-range combat drones before launching cruise missiles towards the city and its region.

Multiple explosions were heard in the city centre, AFP journalists reported.

"Municipal and energy services are working to restore heating, water , and electricity in city homes," Klitschko added.

Palestinian refugee agency's East Jerusalem compound on Tuesday after seizing the site last year, in an act condemned by the agency as a violation of international law.

Surrounded by Israeli forces, bulldozers razed several large buildings and other smaller structures inside the United Nations Relief and Works Agency's compound, where dozens of agency staff once worked.

UNRWA, which has been accused of bias by Israel, has not used the building since the start of last year after Israel ordered it to vacate all its premises and cease its operations.

A spokesperson for UNRWA, Jonathan Fowler, told Reuters that Israeli forces entered the compound around 7 a.m. local time (0500 GMT), forced out the compound's security guards and then brought in bulldozers to begin demolishing buildings inside.

"This is an unprecedented attack against UNRWA and its premises and it also constitutes a serious violation of international law and the privileges and immunities of the United Nations," Fowler said.

Some former UNRWA staff said the structures that were demolished on Tuesday had been used to store aid for the West Bank and Gaza.

Israel's parliament passed a law in October 2024 banning the agency from operating in the country and prohibiting officials from having contact with the agency.

Israel has alleged that some UNRWA staff were members of the Palestinian militant group Hamas and took part in the attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, that killed about 1,200 Israelis and led to Israel's war against Hamas , in which Gaza authorities say more than 71,000 Palestinians have been killed.

UNRWA has fired several staff members but said Israel had not provided evidence for all the allegations against its staff.

In a statement, the Israeli foreign ministry said the "compound does not enjoy any immunity and the seizure of this compound by Israeli authorities was carried out in accordance with both Israeli and international law."

Israel's Jerusalem municipality raided the compound last year, saying UNRWA had failed to pay property taxes of 11 million shekels ($3.4 million) after multiple warnings were issued and all necessary procedures were followed.

UNRWA says the East Jerusalem compound remained U.N. premises despite the Israeli ban on its operations and that the agency had no debts to the municipality.

The agency operates in East Jerusalem, which the U.N. and most countries consider territory occupied by Israel. Israel considers all Jerusalem to be part of the country.

UNRWA also operates in Gaza, the West Bank and elsewhere in the Middle East, providing schooling, healthcare, social services and shelter to millions of Palestinians.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 09:34:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ECOS4VVJAVJF3AIUQPA6EFRAHE.jpg?auth=9ba74bcc802e614a7078c32405963991f358400d15614843647add158f835057&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>FACTBOX Key facts about Chagos Islands deal signed by UK and Mauritius</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/factbox-key-facts-about-chagos-islands-deal-signed-by-uk-mauritius-2026-01-20/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 20 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump has called Britain's deal to cede sovereignty of the island of Diego Garcia in the Chagos Islands to Mauritius an "act of total weakness", putting the agreement back into the spotlight eight months after it was signed.

Britain signed the multi-billion dollar deal after a last-gasp injunction was overturned, which secured it a lease for the strategically important UK-U.S. air base on Diego Garcia over the next century.

Here are some key points about the islands and the contentious deal:

The Chagos Archipelago is a group of six atolls with more than 600 islands in the Indian Ocean, 500 km (300 miles) south of the Maldives and halfway between Africa and Indonesia.

Around 4,000 people are currently stationed on the islands.

No indigenous inhabitants, often referred to as Chagossians or Ilois, have lived there since Britain forcibly displaced up to 2,000 people, mostly former agricultural workers, from the islands in the late 1960s and early 1970s to establish the Diego Garcia base.

Under increasing international pressure, Britain agreed in October 2024 to transfer sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius, a former colony that gained independence in 1968. The deal, however, drew criticism from lawmakers as well as Britons born on Diego Garcia.

In May 2025, Britain said it would pay Mauritius 101 million pounds ($136 million) per year - calculated to be worth 3.4 billion pounds over the lifetime of the deal - to secure the future of the Diego Garcia military base under a 99-year lease.

At the time, the U.S. said it "welcomed the historic agreement", commending both countries' leaders for their vision. In February 2025, ahead of the signing, Trump also expressed preliminary support for the deal.

Canada, Australia, New Zealand and India have also backed the agreement.

Diego Garcia serves as a key military base in the Indian Ocean for the U.S. and Britain.

Recent operations launched from Diego Garcia include bombing strikes against Houthi targets in Yemen in 2024 and 2025, humanitarian aid deployments to Gaza and attacks against Taliban and al Qaeda targets in Afghanistan in 2001.

China also has a growing reach in the region, including close trade ties with Mauritius.

Britain split the archipelago off from its colonial island territory of Mauritius in 1965, three years before granting independence to Mauritius - minus the islands.

In 2019 after a request by the United Nations General Assembly, the International Court of Justice issued a non-binding ruling calling on Britain to give up control, saying it wrongfully forced the population to leave to make way for the base.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio raised concerns in February 2025 about potential threats to U.S. security, particularly in light of China's influence in the region.

Mauritian Prime Minister Navin Ramgoolam, who was elected after the initial agreement was reached, also questioned the deal when he took office. Ramgoolam had wanted Trump to look at the plan and say whether it was a good arrangement.

Some Chagossians, many of whom ended up living in Britain after being removed from the archipelago, have protested against the agreement on the grounds that they were not consulted.

Kemi Badenoch, leader of the opposition in Britain, said on Tuesday on X that the deal was "complete self sabotage" that made "us and our NATO allies weaker".

Before the deal was signed, a UK High Court judge issued a last-minute injunction sought by Bernadette Dugasse and Bertrice Pompe, British nationals who were born in Diego Garcia and criticised the deal for excluding Chagossians.

The injunction was overturned hours later by Britain's High Court, clearing the way for the deal to be signed.

Spaniards are reeling following the first-ever deadly accident on Spain's extensive high-speed rail network, which occurred on Sunday evening near Adamuz in Cordoba province, about 360 km (223 miles) south of Madrid. Experts say a faulty rail joint might be key to determining the cause of the derailment that led to the collision between two trains.

Another body was found overnight within the wreck of the first derailed train that belonged to private consortium Iryo, elevating the death toll to 41, authorities said on Tuesday.

At least three bodies have been seen still trapped inside the wreckage, Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska told state broadcaster TVE late on Monday.

He said that police had received 43 missing-person reports, which broadly matched the provisional death toll, but cautioned that the final number would not be confirmed until rescue teams had lifted the derailed carriages.

The collision occurred in rolling, olive-growing countryside in the foothills of a mountain range. The site is only reachable by a single-track road, making it difficult for rescuers to access with heavy machinery.

King Felipe and Queen Letizia were set to visit the site along with Deputy Prime Minister Maria Jesus Montero later on Tuesday, the government's public agenda showed.

Tales by survivors of tragedy and fortune were beginning to emerge on Tuesday.

Lola Beltran told TVE she had changed carriages minutes before the crash, moving from her assigned seat in one of the hardest-hit cars to another carriage to sit with a colleague.

"We had to break the windows with emergency hammers and pry open the doors to get out," Beltran said, describing scenes of chaos, screams, and torn-out seats.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 09:35:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5TFK6JVGPFOCVC63RA226IEBYQ.jpg?auth=7df4742df7cdeebbbeebdd41d7c25325fb6e1ed1f88c0caafdfcb48ef3f53882&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Moscow says it expects U.S. to release Russian crew from seized Venezuela-linked tanker</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/moscow-says-it-expects-us-release-russian-crew-seized-venezuela-linked-tanker-2026-01-20/</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 09:36:04 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Egypt's Sisi to meet Trump on the sidelines of Davos, presidency says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/davos/egypts-sisi-meet-trump-sidelines-davos-presidency-says-2026-01-20/</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 09:36:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>India PM Modi's party elects youngest-ever president with eye to youth vote</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/india/india-pm-modis-party-elects-youngest-ever-president-with-eye-youth-vote-2026-01-20/</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 09:36:07 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>US Treasury Secretary Bessent brushes off 'hysteria' over Greenland</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/davos/us-treasury-secretary-bessent-brushes-off-hysteria-over-greenland-2026-01-20/</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 09:36:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Moscow says it expects U.S. to release Russian crew from seized Venezuela-linked tanker</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/moscow-says-it-expects-us-release-russian-crew-seized-venezuela-linked-tanker-2026-01-20/</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 09:36:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Egypt's Sisi to meet Trump on the sidelines of Davos, presidency says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/davos/egypts-sisi-meet-trump-sidelines-davos-presidency-says-2026-01-20/</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 09:36:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>India PM Modi's party elects youngest-ever president with eye to youth vote</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/india/india-pm-modis-party-elects-youngest-ever-president-with-eye-youth-vote-2026-01-20/</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 09:36:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>US Treasury Secretary Bessent brushes off 'hysteria' over Greenland</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/davos/us-treasury-secretary-bessent-brushes-off-hysteria-over-greenland-2026-01-20/</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 09:36:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Iran crackdown: 'Can a government willing to kill its own people be trusted to reform?'</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/iran-crackdown-can-a-government-willing-to-kill-its-own-people-be-trusted-to-reform</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 09:36:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/4859ddec-f5dd-11f0-a793-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260116-133344-133942-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump shares private message from Macron offering G7 meeting in Paris</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/trump-shares-messages-france-macron-g7-meeting-paris-after-davos</link><description>Macron sent a "private message" to Donald Trump offering to organise a G7 summit in Paris on Thursday in which Russia could be invited on the sidelines, the French president's entourage confirmed.

Trump posted this message on his Truth Social network in which Macron also proposes inviting Ukraine to the meeting as well as Denmark to discuss disagreements over Greenland .

The offer comes as Europe is weighing countermeasures after Trump threatened to impose tariffs on eight European countries in a bid to pressure the EU over Greenland.

"My friend, we are completely aligned on Syria . We can do great things in Iran . I don't understand what you are doing in Greenland," Macron said in his message.

"I can organise a G7 meeting in Paris on Thursday afternoon after Davos," Macron wrote, referring to the gathering of global elites in Switzerland where the US president is set to be in attendance.

"I can invite the Ukrainians, the Danes, the Syrians and the Russians on the sidelines" of the meeting, he added.

It was not immediately clear when the messages from Macron to Trump were sent.

Trump's relations with Macron hit a new low Monday when the US president threatened 200 percent tariffs on French wine over France's intention to decline an invitation to join his " Board of Peace ".

"Tariff threats to influence our foreign policy are unacceptable and ineffective," a source close to Macron said on Tuesday.

Macron is scheduled to arrive at the World Economic Forum annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland on Tuesday morning, and return to Paris on Tuesday evening, Elysée aides said on Monday, adding there were no plans to extend his stay to  Wednesday, when Trump arrives in the Swiss town.

In December the French president ‍said Europe will have to re-engage in direct talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin if the latest US-led efforts to broker ‌a Ukraine peace deal ​founder.

Last week, Macron said that France was now providing two-thirds of intelligence information to Ukraine , largely replacing the US.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 09:36:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/e869a306-f2d9-11ef-958e-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/000_36YL4PQ.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UN rights council to hold emergency session on Iran, document shows</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/un-human-rights-council-hold-emergency-session-iran-document-shows-2026-01-20/</link><description>GENEVA, Jan 20 (Reuters) - The U.N. Human Rights Council will hold an emergency session on Iran on Friday, with proponents aiming to discuss "alarming violence" used against protesters, a document showed on Tuesday.

An Iranian official said authorities have verified at least 5,000 deaths in the protests which are the biggest demonstrations since 2022, prompting U.N. rights chief Volker Turk to condemn the violence.

"A special session is needed because of the importance and urgency of the situation, in particular due to credible reports of alarming violence, crackdowns on protesters and violations of international human rights law across the country," according to a letter written by Iceland's ambassador Einar Gunnarsson on behalf of a group of countries including Germany and Britain, and seen by Reuters.

The special session will happen on Friday, the U.N. confirmed, adding that 21 countries so far have supported the proposal.

Human Rights Watch has denounced mass unlawful killings and is asking for an existing U.N. probe, set up by the council in 2022 after the last wave of protests, to investigate the deaths and be given extra financing to do so.

Iran's diplomatic mission did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Diplomats said Iran had sent to missions pages of rebuttal against allegations of a crackdown, saying the clashes followed armed attacks on security forces.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 10:29:33 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/NKQ3SU34TVNYZPIWFWCKUZS7NQ.jpg?auth=678ff3d14b62b2332bd46b1bd09b95b9053901d8219593f99ab1568e0515946e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump threatens 200% tariffs on French wines to get Macron on Board of Peace</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/trump-threatens-tariffs-french-wines-get-macron-join-board-peace-2026-01-20/</link><description>WASHINGTON/PARIS, Jan 20 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to hit French wines and champagnes with 200% tariffs in an apparent effort to cajole French President Emmanuel Macron into joining his Board of Peace initiative aimed at resolving global conflicts.

Trump's initiative, which would start by addressing Gaza and then expand to deal with other conflicts, raises questions about the role of the United Nations and a source close to Macron said the French president intended to decline the invitation to join.

When asked about Macron's stance, Trump said, "Did he say that? Well, nobody wants him because he will be out of office very soon."

"I'll put a 200% tariff on his wines and champagnes, and he'll join, but he doesn't have to join," Trump said.

Macron is due in Davos for the day on Tuesday before a scheduled return to Paris in the evening. Elysee aides have said there are no plans to extend his stay to Wednesday, when Trump arrives in the Swiss mountain resort town.

In another shot at the French leader, Trump published a private message from Macron in which he said he did not understand Trump's actions over Greenland . France holds an election to replace Macron in 2027.

Wines and spirits exported to the United States from the European Union currently face a 15% tariff - a rate the French have been lobbying hard to reduce to zero since Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen agreed a U.S.-EU trade deal in Scotland last summer.

The United States is the largest market for French wine and spirits, with shipments to the U.S. at 3.8 billion euros in 2024.

"The fact that we're getting more threats is going to make the industry harder to invest in, it's going to make it harder for companies to make decisions for their own investments," said Laurence Whyatt, head of European beverages research at Barclays.

"They will have to be more reserved, keep a bit of cash back, not invest, because they need to be able to weather the storms as and when they come."

Shares in luxury conglomerate LVMH (LVMH.PA) , opens new tab , which owns major champagne producers including Moet &amp; Chandon, were down 2% in early trading.

Gabriel Picard, chairman of the French wine and spirits export lobby FEVS, told Reuters on Monday, before the new threat, that the industry had seen a 20% to 25% hit to U.S. activity in the second half of last year from previous trade measures.

A Macron aide said the Elysee took note of Trump's remarks and stressed that tariff threats to influence a third party's foreign policy were unacceptable.

Europeans are weighing their own 93 billion euro tariff riposte and even the use of the bloc's " Anti-Coercion Instrument " to retaliate against a separate threat of tariff hikes against a group of European states over Greenland.

"It's brutal, it's designed to break us, it's a tool for blackmail. All of this is outrageous," French Farm Minister Annie Genevard told news channel TF1.

"We have the tools; Europeans must take responsibility. We cannot allow such an escalation."

Trump has threatened a 200% tariff on wine and other alcoholic beverages imported from the EU before, including last year in March as transatlantic trade tensions escalated.

Governments have reacted cautiously to Trump's Board of Peace invitation, a plan that diplomats said could harm the work of the United Nations.

A draft charter sent to about 60 countries by the U.S. administration calls for members to contribute $1 billion in cash if they want their membership to last more than three years, according to the document seen by Reuters.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 10:30:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CKA7Z7NWTJMTVL4HWFCKRMLSJI.jpg?auth=e09611807cca28b2a1eac25a0b527815f58c639662406cf3163a7c4e3e5df758&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Greece will cooperate with Israel on anti-drone systems, cybersecurity, Greek minister says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/greece-will-cooperate-with-israel-on-anti-drone-systems-cybersecurity-greek-2026-01-20/</link><description>ATHENS, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Greece will cooperate with Israel on anti-drone systems and cybersecurity, Greek Defence Minister Nikos Dendias said on Tuesday after meeting his Israeli counterpart in Athens.

The images quickly went viral. “So this guy like 100% had a stroke, right?” podcaster Jeremy Kaplowitz wrote on X that same day, a post later liked more than 272,000 times. The White House did not immediately comment. On January 15, however, the Daily Beast reported a theory from Professor Bruce Davidson of Washington State University’s Elson S. Floyd College of Medicine, suggesting a medical episode “ six months ago or more, earlier in 2025 ”. Davidson also noted that Trump began shuffling his feet while walking and was “garbling” his words.

Washington quickly pushed back, dismissing the report as a “BS fake news story.”

Since returning to the Oval Office, close scrutiny of Trump’s public appearances have sparked numerous rumours about his declining health. The White House has sometimes offered rather unexpected explanations. Bruises seen on his hands during a February meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron were attributed to the fact that he is “constantly working and shaking hands all day, every day”, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said.

When images showed Trump with swollen ankles and struggling to walk steadily, Leavitt said the president suffers from a “chronic venous deficiency”, adding that there was “no evidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or arterial disease”. But unlike previous presidents, no full medical records have been released – only summarised memoranda from White House physician Dr Sean Barbabella have been made public.

“Let’s be clear: we have no idea what his health condition is. All we can really assess is what we see,” presidential historian Barbara Perry says. “And what we witness is an almost octogenarian man who keeps nodding off at public events, and whose speeches can be … quite strange.”

Trump’s lifestyle has also drawn significant attention. He has long dismissed the value of exercise and openly embraces fast food. After returning to the Oval Office following his inauguration, he quickly had the famous Diet Coke button – a red button on his desk that summons staff to deliver his preferred soda – reinstalled, echoing the setup of his first term.

When Trump’s controversial health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., was asked about Trump’s diet, he reportedly replied : “I don’t know how he is alive.”

Trump’s family history – his father Fred died after suffering from Alzheimer’s disease – is frequently cited by critics including his niece , psychologist Mary Trump. But doctors warn against drawing simplistic conclusions based loosely on genetics. The Alzheimer’s Association notes that, although family history can affect the level of risk, lifestyle factors play a significant role.

To fend off questions about his mental fitness, Trump has repeatedly boasted that he “ aced ” several cognitive exams, claiming “ perfect ” scores not just as proof of his fitness for office but as evidence of exceptional sharpness. “I got the highest score possible,” he has said at rallies, in interviews, and on Truth Social, claiming that no other president had been willing to take such tests.

The US president even declared in December that he is “ sharper than I was 25 years ago ” – in response to a New York Times article about how he seemed to be slowing down – before apparently dozing off at a cabinet meeting.

The Montreal Cognitive Assessment , which Trump took in 2018 and then twice in 2025, is a screening tool rather than a diagnostic test, with limited scope. “Any adolescent could easily pass it,” argues emeritus political scientist Denis Lacorne, who has followed US presidents since the 1960s.

“Constantly invoking it is anything but reassuring.”

“We’ve just lived through this with President Biden,” says Perry. “We saw it with our own eyes, yet it was covered up until it became impossible to deny,” she says. “Presidents can decline very quickly. Some draw energy from crowds and public appearances, which can mask fatigue or deterioration.”

Trump thus fits into a long American tradition. “Woodrow Wilson governed after a debilitating stroke in 1919 and the last year of his presidency was managed by his wife. Franklin D. Roosevelt had suffered polio and was in a wheelchair, though not impaired cognitively. John F. Kennedy suffered from Addison's disease and a bad back; he was heavily medicated and this was concealed,” University of Texas at Austin professor James Galbraith said in an email.

The high-pressure nature of the job also plays a role.

“Presidents operate in a cocoon. The public never has full certainty about their condition,” Galbraith said. “Erratic decisions can reflect impairment – or simply bad information and extreme pressure.”

“The presidency makes you age faster,” adds Olivier Richomme, a political scientist at Lyon 2 University. “It’s not a job designed for someone close to 80.”

“With Trump,” he adds, “there is also a culture of loyalty and courtisanship that prevents honest discussion”.

The constitutional safeguard of the 25th Amendment theoretically allows for a transfer of power in case of incapacity. In practice, few believe it could be invoked today.

“It’s a nuclear option,” Richomme says. “Politically, it is almost unimaginable in a polarised system, because it requires two-thirds of Congress to agree.”

Trump’s frequent dozing and tendency to veer off topic into sometimes bizarre tangents have long fuelled his critics.

His supporters cite his packed schedule, frequent rallies and constant media exposure as evidence of his stamina.

“They refuse to see it, while those who oppose him can only see the opposite,” Richomme says. Trump’s impulsive rhetoric and erratic policy signals make questions about his health unavoidable.

Within the Republican Party, and ahead of midterms that could hand the Democrats a landslide victory , the subject remains taboo.

“No one around him has an interest in raising the issue,” Richomme says. “Silence is safer.”

“The danger isn’t only decline,” Perry warns. “It’s decline combined with secrecy, loyalists and the absence of independent advisers.”

As with several presidents before him, the full truth about Trump’s health may only emerge after his tenure in office.

Surrounded by Israeli forces, ​ bulldozers razed several large buildings and other smaller structures inside the United Nations Relief and Works Agency's compound, where dozens of ‍agency staff once worked.

UNRWA, which has been accused of bias by Israel , has not used the building since the start of last year after Israel ordered it to vacate all its premises ​and cease its operations.

A spokesperson for UNRWA, Jonathan Fowler, told Reuters that Israeli forces entered the ​compound around 7am local time (0500 GMT), forced out the compound's security guards and then brought in bulldozers to begin demolishing buildings inside.

"This is an unprecedented attack against UNRWA and its premises and it also constitutes a serious violation of international law and the privileges and immunities of the United Nations," Fowler said.

Some former UNRWA staff said the structures demolished on Tuesday had been used to store aid for the West Bank and Gaza .

"The destruction today by the Israeli occupation is another message to the world that Israel is the only country that can demolish international law and get away with it," said Hakam Shahwan, ‍former chief of staff at UNRWA's East Jerusalem headquarters.

Israel's parliament passed a law in October 2024 banning the agency from operating in the country and prohibiting officials from having contact with the ​agency.

Israel's far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir posted a video on social media standing in front of the UNRWA compound as a bulldozer began to tear it down.

"This is a historic day, it's a holiday," said Ben-Gvir.

Israel has alleged that some UNRWA ‌staff were members of the Palestinian militant group Hamas and took part in the attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, that killed about 1,200 Israelis and led to Israel's war against Hamas, in which Gaza authorities ‍say more than 71,000 Palestinians have been killed.

UNRWA has fired several staff members but said Israel had not provided evidence for all the allegations against its staff . Fowler previously told Reuters that Israel had been conducting a "sustained disinformation campaign" against UNRWA.

In a statement, the Israeli foreign ministry said the "compound does not enjoy any immunity and the seizure of this compound by Israeli authorities was carried out in accordance with both Israeli and international law."

Israel's Jerusalem municipality raided the compound last year, saying UNRWA had failed to pay property taxes after multiple warnings.

UNRWA says the East Jerusalem compound remained UN premises ‍despite the Israeli ban on its operations and that the agency had no debts to the municipality.

Residents of Bani Suhaila, east of Khan Younis, said the leaflets were dropped on Monday on families living in tent encampments in the Al-Reqeb neighbourhood.

“Urgent message. The area is under IDF control. You must evacuate immediately,” said the leaflets, written in Arabic, Hebrew, and English, which the army dropped over the Al‑Reqeb neighbourhood in the town of Bani Suhaila.

In the two-year war before the U.S. brokered ceasefire was signed in October, Israel dropped leaflets over areas that were subsequently raided or bombarded, forcing some families to move several times.

Residents and a source from the Hamas militant group said this was the first time they had been dropped since then. The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The ceasefire has not progressed beyond its first phase, under which major fighting has stopped, Israel withdrew from less than half of Gaza, and Hamas released hostages in return for Palestinian detainees and prisoners.

Virtually the entire population of more than 2 million people are confined to around a third of Gaza's territory, mostly in makeshift tents and damaged buildings, where life has resumed under control of an administration led by Hamas.

Israel and Hamas have accused each other of major breaches of the ceasefire and remain far apart on the more difficult steps planned for the next phase.

Mahmoud, a resident from the Bani Suhaila area, who asked not to give his family name, said the evacuation orders impacted at least 70 families, living in tents and homes, some of which were partially damaged, in the area.

"We have fled the area and relocated westward. It is maybe the fourth or fifth time the occupation expanded the yellow line since last month," he told Reuters by phone from Khan Younis, referring to the line behind which Israel has withdrawn.

"Each time they move it around 120 to 150 metres (yards) inside the Palestinian-controlled territory, swallowing more land," the father-of-three said.

Ismail Al-Thawabta, director of the Hamas-run Gaza government media office, said the Israeli military had expanded the area under its control in eastern Khan Younis five times since the ceasefire, forcing the displacement of at least 9,000 people.

“On Monday, 19 January 2026, the Israeli occupation forces dropped warning leaflets demanding the forced evacuation of the Bani Suhaila area in eastern Khan Younis Governorate, in a measure that falls within a policy of intimidation and pressure on civilians,” Thawabta told Reuters.

He said the new evacuation orders affected approximately 3,000 people.

“The move created a state of humanitarian disruption, increased pressure on the already limited shelter areas, and further deepened the internal displacement crisis in the governorate,” Thawabta added.

Israel's military has previously said it has opened fire after identifying what it called "terrorists" crossing the yellow line and approaching its troops, posing an immediate threat to them.

It has continued to conduct air strikes and targeted operations across Gaza. The Israeli military has said it views "with utmost severity" any attempts by militant groups in Gaza to attack Israel.

Under future phases of the ceasefire that have yet to be hammered out, U.S. President Donald Trump's plan envisages Hamas disarming, Israel pulling out further, and an internationally backed administration rebuilding Gaza.

More than 460 Palestinians and three Israeli soldiers have been reported killed since the ceasefire took effect.

Israel launched its operations in Gaza in the wake of an attack by Hamas-led fighters in October 2023 which killed 1,200 people, according to Israeli tallies. Israel's assault has killed 71,000 people, according to health authorities in the enclave.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 10:57:27 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/6QDTMVCHKNLQZBK5GOEOWUA53Q.jpg?auth=d34028749ca383d97b104ffaa255e411ded40d288aca9601c3ee53409b7f8aa8&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia says it has no specific contacts with US on expiring nuclear treaty</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/russia-says-it-has-no-specific-contacts-with-us-expiring-nuclear-treaty-2026-01-20/</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 10:57:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>UN chief Guterres cancels Davos trip due to bad cold, spokesperson says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/davos/un-chief-guterres-cancels-davos-trip-due-bad-cold-spokesperson-says-2026-01-20/</link><description>GENEVA, Jan 20 (Reuters) - The U.N.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) warned the severe geomagnetic storm could potentially cause problems with technology, including issues with voltage control and impacts on satellite operations.

NOAA officials said those in northern and central states of the continental US "can look for the aurora ... at night, and should weather conditions permit".

"Auroras may become visible over much of the northern half of the country and maybe as far south as Alabama to northern California."

The storm is a result of "an eruption of solar material and magnetic fields" that left the sun on Sunday.

The severity of this geomagnetic storm is "very rare", NOAA said.

Shawn Dahl of NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center said the last time a solar radiation storm of this intensity showered the earth was in 2003.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 11:00:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/073e981a-f5e3-11f0-96c6-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-20T071733Z-1768893448-DPAF260120X99X223849-RTRFIPP-4-ENVIRONMENT-NATURE-AURORABOREALIS-ALPS-TREES-PINK-GREEN-PURPLE-PROJECT.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UK approves China plan for its largest embassy in Europe despite espionage fears</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-approves-china-plan-its-largest-embassy-europe-despite-espionage-fears-2026-01-20/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Britain's government gave approval on Tuesday for China to build its largest embassy in Europe in London, hoping to improve ties with Beijing despite British and U.S. politicians' warnings that it could be used as a base for spying.

China's plans to build a new embassy on the site of the two-century-old Royal Mint Court near the Tower of London have stalled for three years over opposition from local residents, lawmakers and Hong Kong pro-democracy campaigners in Britain.

The decision was announced before an expected visit to China by Prime Minister Keir Starmer this month, the first by a British leader since 2018. Some British and Chinese officials said the trip was dependent on the embassy being approved.

"All material considerations were taken into account when making this decision," the government said in a statement. "The decision is now final unless it is successfully challenged in court."

The Chinese government purchased Royal Mint Court in 2018 but its requests for planning permission to build a new embassy on the site were rejected by the local council in 2022. Chinese President Xi Jinping asked Starmer last year to intervene.

The government took control of the planning decision last year and an inquiry was held last February to hear arguments about whether the embassy should be approved.

Some politicians in Britain and the United States have said China should be barred from building on the site near London's historic financial district because it might enable Beijing to eavesdrop on fibre-optic cables that are used by finance firms and travel underneath the area.

British security officials have also warned that allowing China to build a much larger embassy would mean more Chinese spies in Britain as well as more diplomats, an assertion dismissed by the Chinese embassy in London.

The head of Britain's MI5 domestic spy agency said in October his spy agency had more than a century of experience dealing with foreign embassies, suggesting any security risks could be managed.

But MI5 has also warned of a threat posed by attempts by China to recruit and cultivate people with access to the British government.

The agency issued a warning to lawmakers in November about Beijing trying to interfere in British politics, and the collapse of a trial of two British men charged with spying on members of parliament for China led to criticism the government was prioritising better relations over national security.

The government has approved the new embassy - after years of diplomatic pressure from China - as Starmer tries to reset relations with Beijing, which is one of his foreign policy priorities.

Britain has in the past decade moved from saying it wanted to be China's biggest supporter in Europe to being one of its fiercest critics, and is now trying to improve relations again. Starmer said last month closer business ties were in the national interest.

Some local residents who oppose China building a large embassy in the area are considering whether to ask for a judicial review against the decision.

The new embassy would be one of the largest diplomatic outposts in the world with a footprint of about 55,000 square metres (600,000 square feet), according to the planning application.

That is almost 10 times the size of China's current embassy in central London and considerably bigger than its embassy in the United States.

Before Tuesday's decision, China had blocked plans by Britain to expand its embassy in Beijing, officials involved in the talks said.

Chinese officials say that when Beijing purchased the site for 255 million pounds ($343.54 million), it received assurances from the then Conservative government that it could build its embassy.

Royal Mint Court was from the early 19th century until 1967 the site of the Royal Mint, where coins are produced.

Starmer said the government was prepared to take robust action, a day after it said it would examine whether features such as infinite scrolling and the age at which children can access platforms should be restricted.

The Labour government said it would examine evidence from around the world on suggested proposals including looking at whether a social media ban for children would be effective and how best to make such a ban work if it were imposed.

"This is a hugely complex issue – so it's important it's properly considered," Starmer said on Substack.

Ministers will visit Australia, which last month became the first country to ban social media for children under 16, to learn from their approach, it said on Monday.

The government did not specify an age threshold, saying it was exploring a ban "for children under a certain age" and other measures such as better age checks and looking into whether the current digital age of consent was too low.

The proposals come as governments and regulators worldwide contend with the risks of exposing children to social media, as well as the impact of screen time on their development and mental health.

The recent rapid explosion of AI-generated content online has exacerbated those concerns, highlighted this month by a public outcry over reports of Elon Musk's Grok AI chatbot generating non-consensual sexual images, including of minors.

The British government has already set out plans for an outright ban on artificial intelligence nudification tools, while working to stop children being able to take, share or view nude images on their devices, it said in Monday's statement.

The government said it was also considering removing or limiting functionalities that could drive addictive or compulsive use of social media.

Britain's recently enforced Online Safety Act, one of the strictest safety regimes, has increased the share of children encountering age checks online to 47% from 30%, while cutting visits to pornography sites by a third, according to the government.

"These laws were never meant to be the end point, and we know parents still have serious concerns," Technology Secretary Liz Kendall said.

Starmer said childhood should not mean judgement from strangers or pressure to perform for likes, adding that "for too many today, it means being pulled into a world of endless scrolling, anxiety and comparison".

"We will work with experts to identify the most effective measures we can take to do more," he said, reiterating that "no option is off the table".

The government said it would produce evidence-based screen time guidance for parents of children aged 5 to 16, with separate guidance for under-fives to be published in April.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 11:26:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5GYABB2TVNMOTICN3PIY2DJF4I.jpg?auth=58fe1335c31f4bbc54a56bdcc30d4385bf1b370074d0680a17831fd4d9841223&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>IAEA says Ukraine's Chornobyl nuclear plant lost all off-site power on Tuesday</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/iaea-says-ukraines-chornobyl-nuclear-plant-lost-all-off-site-power-tuesday-2026-01-20/</link><description>Jan 20 (Reuters) - Ukraine's Chornobyl nuclear power plant, site of the world's worst civil nuclear catastrophe, lost all off-site power following widespread military activity on Tuesday morning, the UN atomic watchdog said in a post on X.

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said that several Ukrainian electrical substations vital for nuclear safety were affected by the military activity, while power lines to some other nuclear power plants were also impacted.

Russia launched a combined drone and missile attack on Ukraine early on Tuesday, knocking out power and heating supplies to thousands of apartment buildings in Kyiv amid freezing temperatures, Ukrainian officials said.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 11:27:16 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/J2OT46IMSVO2LHG3HHCW3T5WGM.jpg?auth=1bb42dc711388997fd45b2f1aac58ca16ebd233c55b315fd77faa5f6343d7aff&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Syrian govt says 120 Islamic State detainees escaped prison</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/syrian-govt-says-120-islamic-state-detainees-escaped-prison</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 11:29:07 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/21ea2afe-f5f1-11f0-8ae8-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260120-110830-111017-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Why did the ceasefire fail in Syria and what about IS group detainees?</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/why-did-the-ceasefire-fail-in-syria-and-what-about-isis-detainees</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 11:29:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/d1ab971c-f5f0-11f0-b010-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260120-103751-104212-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>EU Commission working on package to support Arctic security, von der Leyen says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/eu-commission-working-package-support-arctic-security-von-der-leyen-says-2026-01-20/</link><description>DAVOS, Jan 20 (Reuters) - European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Tuesday that the bloc's executive arm is working on a package to support Arctic security and warned that tariffs proposed by U.S. President Donald Trump over Greenland are a mistake.

"Arctic security can only be achieved together, and this is why the proposed additional tariffs are a mistake, especially between long-standing allies," von der Leyen said in a speech at the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos.

"The European Union and the United States have agreed to a trade deal last July, and in politics as in business – a deal is a deal," she said.

"Plunging us into a downward spiral would only aid the very adversaries we are both so committed to keeping out of the strategic landscape, so our response will be unflinching, united and proportional."

Trump has intensified his push to wrest sovereignty over Greenland from fellow NATO member Denmark, prompting the European Union to weigh hitting back with its own measures .

Von der Leyen said the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Denmark and Greenland is non-negotiable and that work is underway to boost security in the high north.

"We are working on a package to support Arctic security," she said.

The EU is also working on a "massive European investment surge in Greenland", she said, to support the local economy and infrastructure.

The Commission president also said the EU will work with the US and other partners on wider Arctic security, adding that the planned surge in defense spending could be used on a "European icebreaker capability and other equipment vital to the Arctic security."</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 11:46:39 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/O4QISWEUMFJPRBEE6M3SNCUTTI.jpg?auth=b99441ee361f0533c248e7f6715e9d2136f55386c5a242479f803a2da09dcf70&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia's Lavrov says Britain should no longer be called 'Great' Britain</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/russias-lavrov-says-britain-should-no-longer-be-called-great-britain-2026-01-20/</link><description>MOSCOW, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Tuesday that Britain should no longer be called Great Britain as it was the only country in the world to officially name itself "Great".

"I think that Britain should be called simply Britain because 'Great Britain' is the only example of a country which calls itself 'Great'," Lavrov told reporters as he spoke about colonialism following comments on Greenland .

His spokeswoman then gave Ivor Bennett, a correspondent from Britain's Sky News, a question. "No offence," Lavrov said.

Lavrov said another example of a country which called itself "great" was the "Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya" led by Muammar Gaddafi.

"But it no longer exists."

The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is usually called "Velikobritaniya", or Great Britain, in Russian.

As the U.S. under Donald Trump seeks to reset ties with Moscow and broker peace between Russia and Ukraine, Britain has been granted the status of Russia's public enemy number one .

On Russian state television, "Perfidious Albion", a term used frequently by news anchors, is cast as a scheming global intelligence power that is meddling behind the scenes from Washington to Iran in a duplicitous bid to undermine Russian interests across the world.

Britain says Russia is a threat to Europe. Amid the war in Ukraine, Russia and the West have repeatedly accused each other of unfurling espionage campaigns of an intensity not seen since the depths of the Cold War.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 11:46:49 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/AYJT74MECNLA7GZTHEMQV6YXBA.jpg?auth=40bf6062421ce167b86551fbb3271ada46bfdbe9ac6c3ec84564926de868a954&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US-led coalition negotiating Al-Hol camp handover, Syrian sources say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-led-coalition-negotiating-al-hol-camp-handover-syrian-sources-say-2026-01-20/</link><description>Jan 20 (Reuters) - The U.S.-led coalition against the Islamic State was negotiating a handover of the Al-Hol camp, which houses IS-linked civilians, to Syrian authorities, three Syrian sources familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.

The Marina de Cudeyo Town Council confirmed the incident on Sunday through their social media accounts, describing the disappearance as "an unfortunate event" and suggesting foul play. "Everything indicates that it was a theft," the council stated.

The statue, which has been a focal point in tiny Pedrena as a tribute to Ballesteros' enduring legacy, vanished sometime over the weekend, local police told Reuters, indicating that they are now working to identify those responsible and recover the tribute.

“If anyone has observed any suspicious activity, especially in the last 24 hours, please report it to the police,” the town council urged in a post on Facebook.

The life-size statue of the late golfer was located in La Barquería Park and was created in 2009 by sculptor Salvador García Ceballos. It was permanently installed in 2017.

The statue is made of bronze and depicts him in one of his most characteristic poses, with his fist raised in a triumphant gesture after winning the 1984 British Open at St Andrews.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 11:47:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/UE6HKTFIHJNSHIKRJWNNJO5HJE.jpg?auth=58e8781535d753f7a93e0dd2fc1ae935e3e20f7a12eb62d7f993af6696f13ff7&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Turkey's Erdogan will soon decide whether to join Trump's Board of Peace</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/turkeys-erdogan-will-soon-decide-whether-join-trumps-board-peace-2026-01-20/</link><description>ANKARA, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan will soon decide whether to join U.S. President Donald Trump's Board of Peace initiative after having received an invitation, Turkey's foreign minister said on Tuesday.

The Civil-Military Coordination Centre was established in southern Israel in October under President Donald Trump 's plan to end the war in Gaza . It was tasked with monitoring the Israel-Hamas ceasefire, facilitating the entry of aid and developing post-war policies for the Palestinian territory.

Dozens of countries, including Germany, France, Britain, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, sent personnel including military planners and intelligence officials to the centre as they sought to influence discussions on Gaza's future.

But eight foreign diplomats told Reuters that officials from some European countries had not returned to the CMCC, located near the Gaza border, since the Christmas and New Year holidays. Several nations were questioning the purpose of the centre, with one Western diplomat describing it as "directionless".

"Everybody thinks it's a disaster, but there is no alternative," said another Western diplomat.

The European rethink, which has not been previously reported, is the latest sign of unease among Washington's allies as Trump pursues unorthodox foreign policies towards Gaza, Greenland and Venezuela.

Some European governments were now considering whether to reduce their CMCC presence or even to stop sending personnel altogether, the diplomats said. The diplomats declined to say which governments were reassessing their position.

The White House and U.S. State Department did not respond to requests for comment on this story.

The CMCC is run by a U.S. general and also hosts both American and Israeli military personnel. Its establishment was a key element of the first phase of Trump's ceasefire plan, which has been shaken by repeated Israeli airstrikes in Gaza against what Israel says have been Hamas attempts to carry out attacks.

As Trump pursues the next phase of his plan, including by setting up a "Board of Peace" to supervise Gaza policy, it is unclear whether the CMCC will retain any influence over policy formation or aid distribution.

The diplomats said it was also not known how the CMCC would work with the Board of Peace's Gaza-focused bodies, including its committee of Palestinian technocrats .

Washington last week announced Trump's plan had moved to the second phase, which would include demilitarisation and reconstruction. But there was no mention of further Israeli military withdrawals, beyond a partial pullback that has left 53% of Gaza still in Israeli hands.

In November, Reuters reported U.S. partners were concerned that Gaza could be effectively partitioned as efforts to advance Trump's plan beyond the ceasefire stalled.

There was also no mention in Trump's second phase announcement of the expected deployment of a multinational stabilisation force into the enclave.

Gaza's border with Egypt has yet to reopen, although this was supposed to have happened during the plan's first phase that took effect in October, amid repeated Israeli objections.

The diplomats said there had been no significant increase in humanitarian aid entering Gaza since the truce took hold, contradicting White House assertions, despite widespread homelessness and malnutrition.

Many trucks entering Gaza were in fact carrying commercial goods, they said, and Israel remained effectively in control of Gaza's aid policy, despite the U.S.-led CMCC being tasked with helping boost relief supplies into the enclave.

Israel bans or restricts supplies from entering Gaza on the grounds they are "dual-use", or could be repurposed for military as well as humanitarian purposes. The diplomats said Israel has so far made no concessions on dual-use items, which include metal poles for tents to house the largely displaced population.

An official at COGAT, the Israeli government agency that coordinates civilian policy in Gaza, said that 45% of all trucks that have entered Gaza since the October ceasefire were commercial vehicles transporting food and other everyday goods.

The official said humanitarian trucks were prioritised, and that commercial shipments supplemented the aid effort. If additional humanitarian trucks were available, they would be allowed to enter Gaza, the official said.

The COGAT official acknowledged that Israel continues to restrict dual-use items, but said alternatives are being sourced, such as tent poles made of wood.

Beyond humanitarian aid, the eight diplomats said, CMCC personnel had drafted a number of "white papers" on Gaza on a range of topics including on reconstruction and governance but that it was unclear if they would be implemented.

It is unlikely that countries would formally leave the CMCC, in part out of fear of drawing Trump's ire but also out of a desire to be able to ramp up their involvement in the centre if it gains relevance, the diplomats said.

There is also a concern that quitting the CMCC could give Israel greater influence over policies for post-war Gaza, they said. There are no Palestinians at the CMCC, and a European presence could help put more emphasis on Palestinian interests.

Trump's 20-point peace plan provides no timeline or mechanism for implementation, and since the ceasefire started in October more than 460 Palestinians and three Israeli soldiers have been killed in fighting.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 12:51:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/FCUBDDODZRJUXFSBJIS6RSTFTM.jpg?auth=fde7630740976155c9aad8f823c2e6b5609c5a6d7e6d306c362b3b1a8e43021f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US Treasury Secretary Bessent brushes off 'hysteria' over Greenland</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/us-treasury-secretary-bessent-brushes-off-hysteria-over-greenland-2026-01-20/</link><description>DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 20 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent expressed confidence on Tuesday that the United States and European countries would find a solution over the U.S. administration's aim to take over Greenland, brushing off "hysteria" about a possible trade war.

U.S. President Donald Trump announced tariffs on Saturday on imports from European allies that oppose the United States taking over Greenland, an autonomous part of the Kingdom of Denmark.

European countries say new tariffs would violate a trade deal reached with Trump last year, and EU leaders are set to discuss possible retaliation at an emergency summit in Brussels on Thursday. One option is a package of tariffs on 93 billion euros ($108 billion) of U.S. imports that could automatically kick in on February 6 after a six-month suspension.

Bessent said the issue had only recently emerged and a solution would be found that ensures national security for the United States and Europe.

"It's been 48 hours. As I said, sit back, relax," Bessent told reporters on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland. "I am confident that the leaders will not escalate and that this will work out in a manner that ends up in a very good place for all."

Asked about the prospect of a prolonged trade war between the United States and Europe, Bessent replied: "Why are we jumping there? Why are you taking it to the worst case?... Calm down the hysteria. Take a deep breath."

Trump has repeatedly insisted he will settle for nothing less than ownership of Greenland. Leaders of both Denmark and Greenland have said the island is not for sale and does not want to be part of the United States.

Bessent dismissed the possibility the EU would for the first time tap its Anti-Coercion Instrument, a powerful trade measure which could limit U.S. access to public tenders, investments or banking activity, or restrict trade in services.

"Well, having worked with the Europeans, my guess is their next move will be to form a working group, the dreaded 'European working group'," Bessent said in an interview with CNBC. "We've seen a lot of working groups."

In his earlier briefing, Bessent also dismissed market speculation that European governments might sell U.S. Treasury bonds they own as reserves, making it more expensive for the U.S. government to finance itself.

"(U.S. government debt) is the most liquid market, it is the basis for all financial transactions and I am sure that the European governments will continue holding it," Bessent said.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 12:51:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LNKO5ICTVJMW3HXR7JG5XWGN7Y.jpg?auth=19f223b1216ef74aff5258d15e39ecf056354145fb924e19e8950b5e01fcda08&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia's Far East buried in snow, transport disrupted in China and Japan</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/russias-far-east-buried-snow-transport-disrupted-china-japan-2026-01-20/</link><description>Jan 20 (Reuters) - Russia's Far East was buried under metres of snow by its heaviest snowfall in 60 years on Tuesday as a winter blast swept across Asia, dusting Shanghai white and grounding flights in Japan's northwest .

The cold snap disrupted transport across the region, closing roads in China, stranding air travellers in Japan and leaving parts of Russia’s Far East paralysed.

Scientists said the weather was related to waves of cool air coming in from the Arctic, which was simultaneously affecting Eastern Russia and Asia, and a second, affecting Eastern Europe.

"You've got these two simultaneous bursts of cool air coming down from the Arctic due to a waviness in the jet stream," said climate scientist Theodore Keeping, referring to air currents in the upper atmosphere which define weather patterns.

"The Arctic polar vortex, which is this massive cold air which circulates the Arctic is relatively weak right now, and what that means it drives the jet stream less intensely, and that leads to waves of cool air coming down from the Arctic," said Keeping, an extreme weather researcher for World Weather Attribution at London's Imperial College Centre for Environmental Policy.

In Russia’s Far Eastern Kamchatka Peninsula , vast snowdrifts several metres high blocked building entrances and buried cars, after more than 2 metres (6.5 feet) of snow fell in some areas in the first half of January, following 3.7 metres in December, according to weather monitoring stations.

Some vehicles were almost completely submerged, four-wheel drives struggling for traction or immobilised entirely, as residents dug narrow paths through the snow to reach apartment entrances. In the port city of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, locals were filmed walking atop snowbanks beside traffic lights, with some jumping from the drifts for fun.

"It's like a sand dune," resident and blogger Polina Tuichieva said of the mammoth snow in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, 6,800 km (4,200 miles) east of Moscow.

The same system swept south into China, where a wave of low temperatures brought rare snowfall to the financial hub of Shanghai as authorities warned the frigid weather could last for at least three days. The east coast city last experienced heavy snowfall in January 2018.

"It was the first time I have seen such heavy snowfall in Shanghai," 23-year-old student Li Meng said.

The wintry scenes marked a sharp reversal from just a week earlier, when Shanghai basked in unusually high temperatures of 20 degrees Celsius (68 degrees Fahrenheit), prompting some osmanthus trees to bloom, local media reported.

"The weather seems rather strange this year," 30-year-old Shanghai resident Yu Xin said. "Last week, it was still over 20 degrees Celsius, but this week it dropped below zero and started snowing. In general, the temperature fluctuations have been quite significant, so some people might feel a bit uncomfortable."

Chinese state media said sharp temperature drops also hit provinces south of the Yangtze and Huai rivers, including Jiangxi and Guizhou. In Guizhou, temperatures are expected to fall by 10 to 14 degrees Celsius, Zhejiang News reported.

As icy conditions spread, authorities shut sections of major roads across 12 provinces — including Shanxi, Inner Mongolia and Heilongjiang — due to snowfall and icy roads, state broadcaster CCTV said.

In Japan, strong winds and heavy snowfall disrupted travel along its northwestern coast, grounding dozens of flights and hitting popular ski regions at the height of winter.

The Japan Meteorological Agency warned that heavy snow would hit northern and western regions between January 21 and 25, urging people to avoid non-essential travel.

ANA Holdings (9202.T) , opens new tab cancelled 56 flights affecting around 3,900 passengers, while Japan Airlines scrapped 37 flights affecting 2,213 travellers. Nearly all of ANA’s cancellations were concentrated at New Chitose Airport near Sapporo in Hokkaido.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 12:51:56 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7O5KXNTUY5OSHNNEY6SXCCHUGY.jpg?auth=717f324de6c9fe29748e9ed59c2a6994e02309886ad042e5438442960852af49&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China, Russia conclude BRICS+ naval drills in South Africa amid controversy</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/china-russia-conclude-brics-naval-drills-in-south-africa-amid-controversy</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 12:52:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/fae9cde8-f5f4-11f0-8027-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260116-214617-214803-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump hits Macron with tariff threats, underscores tense US-France relations</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/trump-hits-macron-with-tariff-threats-underscores-tense-us-france-relations</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 12:52:48 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/8797d65c-f5f2-11f0-ba6a-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260120-120519-120959-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Swiss bar owner faces prosecutors for second hearing after deadly New Year's fire</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/swiss-bar-owner-faces-prosecutors-second-hearing-after-deadly-new-years-fire-2026-01-20/</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 13:49:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Prince Harry targeted for standing up to UK newspaper, his lawyer says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/prince-harry-targeted-standing-up-uk-newspaper-his-lawyer-says-2026-01-20/</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 13:50:02 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Iranian parliament warns of jihad if Supreme Leader is attacked, ISNA</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iranian-parliament-warns-jihad-if-supreme-leader-is-attacked-isna-2026-01-20/</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 13:51:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>At least four dead as floods sweep across Tunisia</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/least-four-dead-floods-sweep-across-tunisia-2026-01-20/</link><description>TUNIS, Jan 20 (Reuters) - At least four people were killed on Tuesday as floods swept across Tunisia amid the worst torrential rain for over 70 years in some regions, and there were fears the death toll could rise, authorities said.

The cloudbursts inundated streets, submerged vehicles and disrupted daily life in multiple governorates (provinces) of the North African country, with emergency services struggling to respond to the scale of the flooding.

Civil protection teams said several areas were cut off by rising waters, particularly in low-lying neighbourhoods.

Schools were closed in the capital Tunis and in the towns of Nabeul, Sousse and Beja, and court sessions were suspended and public and private transport crippled in some districts.

Videos shared on social media showed fast-moving floods sweeping debris through residential streets, with seawater inundating neighbourhoods in the coastal town of Menzel Temime.

Meteorological officials said the rainfall levels in some regions were the heaviest recorded since 1950.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 13:51:52 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/F5VKCUW4IVMNLGJE6FTBEIG2RU.jpg?auth=e44aa8b87a6335bb3d80a6812ea4091bdf02479574c747a04fa9f2ef79e56587&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Lawmakers quit Dutch far right leader Wilders' faction in threat to leadership</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/lawmakers-quit-dutch-far-right-leader-wilders-faction-threat-leadership-anp-says-2026-01-20/</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 13:52:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Macron tells Davos of a 'shift towards a world without rules'</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/macron-tells-davos-shift-towards-world-without-rules-2026-01-20/</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 13:52:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Saudi state TV says King Salman chairs cabinet days after leaving hospital</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/saudi-state-tv-says-king-salman-chairs-cabinet-days-after-leaving-hospital-2026-01-20/</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 13:53:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Togo expels ex-Burkina Faso leader after coup plot claim, sources say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/togo-expels-ex-burkina-faso-leader-after-coup-plot-claim-sources-say-2026-01-20/</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 13:53:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Myanmar junta 'can't last forever': military in 'worse position now' than ever before</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/myanmar-junta-can-t-last-forever-military-in-worse-position-now-than-ever-before</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 13:53:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/22cf963e-f605-11f0-b304-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260111-130847-131606-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>French far-right leader Marine Le Pen takes the stand in high-stakes appeals trial</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/french-far-right-leader-marine-le-pen-takes-the-stand-in-high-stakes-appeals-trial</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 13:53:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/e9c55160-f601-11f0-8312-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260120-133541-133736-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump publishes Macron's message, threatens French wine tariffs</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/trump-publishes-macron-message-threatens-french-wine-tariffs</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 13:53:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/0d065f3a-f601-11f0-b1b0-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260120-133150-133349-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump’s first year back in office: Mass layoffs, deportations and global moves</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/trump-s-first-year-back-in-office-mass-layoffs-deportations-and-global-moves</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 13:53:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/7cd26fd0-f600-11f0-979e-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260120-130140-130412-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Greenland crisis shows time for flattering Trump is over, former NATO boss Rasmussen says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/greenland-crisis-shows-time-flattering-trump-is-over-former-nato-boss-rasmussen-2026-01-20/</link><description>BRUSSELS, Jan 20 (Reuters) - The time for flattering Donald Trump is over and Europe should hit back hard economically if the U.S. imposes tariffs on NATO allies that sent troops to Greenland , ex-NATO boss and former Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen said on Tuesday.

Rasmussen said Trump's insistence that Greenland - a semi-autonomous Danish territory - should become part of the United States represented the biggest challenge to NATO since its establishment in 1949.

"It's really the future of NATO that is at stake," said Rasmussen, who offers a unique perspective on the crisis as a former leader of both Denmark - from 2001 to 2009 - and NATO, where he served as secretary general from 2009 to 2014.

"The time for flattering is over. It doesn't work. The fact is Trump only respects force and strength. And unity. That's exactly what Europe should demonstrate right now," he told Reuters from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.

Rasmussen said he was not criticising leaders such as current NATO boss Mark Rutte, who has lavished praise on Trump. But he said it was time for a new approach from Europe.

He said the EU's Anti-Coercion Instrument - the so-called "bazooka" that confers broad powers to retaliate against economic pressure - should be on the table after Trump threatened tariffs on eight European nations until the U.S. is allowed to buy Greenland.

Trump says U.S. ownership of Greenland is vital for national security .

He told Norway's prime minister on Sunday, in an exchange of text messages , he had "done more for NATO than any other person since its founding, and now, NATO should do something for the United States".

Rasmussen proposed a three-point plan to defuse the crisis. It includes an update of a 1951 agreement between the United States and Denmark that allows U.S. forces and military bases on Greenland to include a strengthened NATO presence there.

It also includes an investment pact to help U.S. and European firms extract minerals in Greenland and "a stabilisation and resilience compact" to prevent Chinese and Russian investments in critical sectors there, he said.

Rasmussen said he had not presented the plan to Danish or other government officials but would discuss it with delegates in Davos.

"I hope that an infusion of something concrete could bring this whole discussion into a more constructive phase," he said.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 14:32:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/L2QKUTAUFZJYZNTX4R6E4X6VVQ.jpg?auth=51be4347a993c7ec60376486b118952fcec2482dbad925dba39bc1fe9caac489&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Supreme Court weighs Trump's firing of the Fed's Lisa Cook by social media</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/supreme-court-weighs-trumps-firing-feds-lisa-cook-by-social-media-2026-01-20/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 20 (Reuters) - In the battle over President Donald Trump 's effort to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook that is set to go before the U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday, the justices may focus on the president's use of social media to carry out this unprecedented action.

The justices are due to hear arguments over Trump's request to lift a lower court judge's decision barring ​him from firing Cook while her legal challenge to the removal continues. The justices in October agreed to hear the dispute, a decision , opens new tab that left Cook in her role for the time being.

Trump's prolific use ‌of social media is well-established. The Republican president long has used social media not only to voice opinions but also to announce major decisions and official government policies.

Here too, just after 8 p.m. last August 25, Trump posted to his Truth Social account a letter addressed to Cook informing her that "you are hereby removed" from the role of Fed governor. No president since the central bank's founding in 1913 has ousted a Fed governor.

That action, Cook and her lawyers argue, violated her rights under the U.S. Constitution's Fifth Amendment, which provides that no person may be "deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law."

The case, which could imperil the independence of the world's most important central bank, prominently tests whether Trump had adequate "cause" under federal law to remove Cook. But it also is a ‌fight over whether the way Trump sought to oust Cook was fair. Lower courts agreed with Cook that Trump's action likely was not.

The president has based his bid to ​fire Cook on allegations by Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte, a Trump appointee, that she committed mortgage fraud. Cook, who was appointed in 2022 by Democratic former President Joe Biden as the first Black woman to serve in the post, has denied the allegations.

Cook's lawyers contend that the allegations are a pretext to fire her based on her monetary policy stance. Trump has repeatedly demanded lower interest rates, also frequently lashing out at Fed Chair Jerome Powell for not doing so more quickly.

The Trump administration ‍this month opened a criminal investigation into Powell over remarks he made to Congress last year about a Fed building project, a move the central bank chair similarly called a pretext aimed at gaining more influence over interest rates.

In creating the Fed, Congress passed a law called the Federal Reserve Act that included provisions to shield the central bank from political interference, setting out that governors could be removed by a president only "for cause" - though the law does not define the term or establish procedures for removal.

Cook's case raises thorny questions concerning the scope of presidential power, the ⁠validity of Trump's decisions that impact the central bank, and the authority of the judiciary to second-guess the president.

But the case also offers the court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority and has backed Trump in numerous decisions since he returned to ‍the presidency last year, a way of deciding the case on procedural grounds that could leave some of those contentious, substantive questions to another day.

Cook's lawyers have said that Trump's letter on social media purporting to fire her without either notice in advance or an ‌opportunity to respond ‌to the allegations did not satisfy the constitutional requirements of due process.

"One way for the court to side with Cook would be to say that the process she received - generally characterized in such cases as notice and an opportunity to be heard - was insufficient," said Jane Manners, a professor at Fordham Law School in New York who has studied the history of laws governing officer removal.

Although it is not entirely clear what kind of hearing would be required, Manners said legal precedents in this area show that removals need to follow a "judicial-type hearing involving the presentation of evidence and testimony, including from the officeholder."

Trump's Justice Department urged the Supreme Court to reject Cook's argument, contending that a government officer's position is not a form of property protected ⁠by the Constitution's due process provision.

"Officers exercise significant government power, ⁠and no individual has a property right to such ​power," the administration said in its written filing.

Even if the due process provision does protect someone in Cook's position, the administration said Trump gave her the required notice when on August 20 he referenced on social media Pulte's referral of the mortgage allegations to the Justice Department for criminal investigation, writing, "Cook must resign, now!!!"

Trump also gave her an opportunity to respond given that he did not post his letter firing her until five days later, the administration added.

"Cook had an opportunity to explain why no misconduct occurred, and she spurned it," the filing ‍stated.

Cook sued Trump in August after the president announced he would remove her.

U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb in September temporarily blocked Trump from carrying out his directive, ruling that he likely violated Cook's due process rights and that the mortgage allegations likely were not a legally sufficient cause to remove her under the Federal Reserve Act as they relate to conduct that occurred before she was confirmed to the post by the Senate.

The Washington-based judge called it "doubtful that Cook should have been required to piece together the evidentiary basis for a 'for cause' removal from a scattered assortment of social media ​posts and news articles."

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit refused Trump's bid to put Cobb's order on hold, prompting ‍the administration to seek the Supreme Court's intervention.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 14:33:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CHCF2OEAL5OTHKNAHBXKWATQFQ.jpg?auth=758c4cb558a63307c437636db9150be3cb3093ec46ab755f2867731757e261e5&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UAE becomes early supporter of Trump’s ‘Board of Peace’ with formal acceptance</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/uae-becomes-early-supporter-trumps-board-peace-with-formal-acceptance-2026-01-20/</link><description>DUBAI, Jan 20 (Reuters) - The United Arab Emirates (UAE) accepted an invitation to join U.S. President Donald Trump's newly proposed “Board of Peace,” the UAE foreign ministry said on Tuesday, placing Abu Dhabi among the first governments to publicly endorse the initiative.

The ministry said the UAE stood ready to “contribute actively to the mission of the Board of Peace, supporting greater cooperation, stability, and prosperity for all,” marking Abu Dhabi's formal alignment with Washington’s new conflict‑resolution effort.

Abu Dhabi's acceptance comes as governments worldwide react cautiously to Trump’s plan, which aims to begin with the Gaza conflict before widening to tackle other conflicts, according to a copy of the letter and draft charter seen by Reuters.

Some leaders offered ambiguous responses. Italy’s Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said her country was “ready to do our part,” while Canada’s Prime Minister Mark Carney said Ottawa had agreed “in principle” pending further details.

The inclusion of a 'charter' in the invitation letter triggered concerns among some European governments that it could undermine the work of the United Nations, which Trump has accused of not supporting his efforts to end conflicts around the world.

The board would be chaired for life by Trump. Member states would be limited to three-year terms unless they pay $1 billion each to fund the board's activities and earn permanent membership, the letter states.

Beijing's desire to build China's biggest embassy in Europe in the heart of historic London had become a flashpoint in relations, testing ‌Britain's ability to navigate the security risks and trade potential of a relationship with China.

The government ignored warnings from British and U.S. politicians, local residents and British-based Hong Kong pro-democracy campaigners who said the new building could be used as a base for espionage and to intimidate Chinese dissidents.

Since taking office in 2024, Starmer has made reviving Britain's economy his priority and wants closer relations with China to boost foreign investment and deliver on an election pledge to improve living standards.

Some U.S. politicians objected to the new embassy location, near sensitive underground communication cables, questioning whether there would be security implications for one of Washington's partners in the Five ‌Eyes alliance with Canada, Australia and New Zealand.

"This will be seen for what it is, which is a base for hostile activity inside the United ​Kingdom," Tom Tugendhat, security minister in Britain's last Conservative government, told Reuters. "This is, I am afraid, further indication that this British government has no idea of the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) it is dealing with."

China has 146 registered diplomats in Britain, second to the United States, British government records show.

Opponents of China's plans to build a much bigger embassy say it will mean more ‍diplomatic staff and therefore more spies, with the new site serving as a symbol of China's power and as a warning.

Local residents said they would seek a legal challenge, saying Tuesday's decision would be unlawful if British officials privately gave China assurances the project would be approved before the planning process had been completed.

Six current and former British officials told Reuters most of the espionage fears were exaggerated or could be managed. They said the consolidation of ⁠China's existing diplomatic premises, spread across London, could make it easier to track suspected spies.

Two of the former officials said security services could typically look for the unexpected loss of signals within the ‍cables to see whether they were being tapped, other cables could be re-rerouted and sensitive information encrypted.

They said much of Beijing's spying activity was conducted from China, such as cyberattacks, and many of its spies work in business, ‌think tanks or ‌academia rather than at the embassy, where officials are easier to track.

China's embassy in London has accused British officials of exaggerating fears about Chinese spies and cyberattacks.

The embassy decision shows the trade-offs Britain faces navigating relations with China, a powerful adversary but possible source of economic help at a time when the U.S. - Britain's biggest single trading partner - has threatened to impose new tariffs as it tries to acquire Greenland.

Starmer is expected to travel to China this month, alongside a business delegation, after Beijing made clear the trip was conditional on approval for the new embassy, British and ⁠Chinese officials said.

Approval of the new embassy could ⁠leave Starmer vulnerable to criticism in Britain and ​alienate London's most powerful ally when opinion polls suggest he is Britain's least popular prime minister.

In a parliamentary debate last week, 30 members of the chamber spoke out against the embassy expansion plans. None spoke in favour.

Julian Lewis, a former chair of parliament's intelligence committee, said that in almost three decades in parliament he had never seen such an occasion "where every question asked on both sides of the House was deeply hostile".

Mike Johnson, Speaker ‍of the U.S. House of Representatives, is among U.S. politicians who have raised concerns about the embassy expansion.

Nicholas Eftimiades, a former U.S. intelligence officer and specialist on Chinese intelligence, said British security services might be underestimating the risks.

"The U.S. has intelligence capabilities several orders of magnitude larger than the UK and yet is unable to effectively counter China's intelligence collection," he said.

Hong Kong pro-democracy campaigners who fled the former British colony are among vocal opponents of expanding the embassy.

Chloe ​Cheung, who received a special British visa to move from Hong Kong and has a bounty on her head from ‍China on charges of incitement to secession, subversion and collusion with foreign forces that she denies, said she felt betrayed.

She said the new embassy with its Regency-style columned facade and huge flags would look like a little Chinese "castle" and send the message ​that "the Chinese government is very powerful", intimidating Chinese dissidents.

"I thought the UK would be a safe haven," she said.

The red caps resemble the "Make America Great Again" caps of Trump's supporters but feature slogans like "Make America Go Away" and "Already Great".

Store co-owner Michael said the caps had languished unsold for months before swiftly gaining popularity. "We only made one hundred to begin with," said Michael, who declined to give his surname. "When it went viral it was very, very popular."

Principal owner Jesper Rabe Tonnesen devised one of the caps' slogans, "Nu det NUUK" - a Danish pun that sounds like "Nu det nok," meaning "Now is enough," but substitutes the "nok" with "Nuuk," the capital of Greenland.

"I thought, 'How can you communicate in an easy way while putting your foot down?'," Tonnesen told Reuters, adding that he had distributed 300 caps by cargo bike at a protest held in Copenhagen on Saturday.

Tens of thousands of people rallied in Copenhagen and Nuuk at the weekend chanting "Greenland is not for sale" and marching to U.S. diplomatic posts, many of them wearing the protest caps.

Trump says Greenland is vital to U.S. security because of its strategic location and mineral deposits, and he has not ruled out using force to take control of the island. His threats have triggered a diplomatic crisis between the NATO allies.

"People have an urge to get out there with a message. We've just had enough and we're fed up, sad and tired," Tonnesen said.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 14:35:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ENYOGUYAQJK45LUTPW535PHLIQ.jpg?auth=fbd863de9fa374e6bb5da3924b24217c14c4381064605e6639b757459f683cc6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukraine to share wartime combat data with allies to help train AI</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/ukraine-share-wartime-combat-data-with-allies-help-train-ai-2026-01-20/</link><description>KYIV, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Ukraine will establish a system allowing its allies to train their artificial intelligence models on Kyiv's valuable combat data collected throughout the nearly four-year war with Russia, newly appointed Defence Minister Mykhailo Fedorov has said.

Fedorov - a former digitalisation minister who last week took up the post to drive reforms across Ukraine's vast defence ministry and armed forces - has described Kyiv's wartime data trove as one of its "cards" in negotiations with other nations.

Since Russia's invasion in February 2022, Ukraine has gathered extensive battlefield information, including systematically logged combat statistics and millions of hours of drone footage captured from above.

Such data is important for training AI models, which require large volumes of real-world information to identify patterns and predict how people or objects might act in various situations.

"Today, frontline data has extraordinary value," Fedorov told reporters in comments cleared for release on Tuesday, adding that there was demand for this data from allies. "We will build a system on which they can train their software products using our data."

Fedorov has previously said Ukraine was using AI technology from U.S. data analytics firm Palantir for both military and civilian applications.

Outlining his plans for the wartime defence ministry after his appointment, he said he wanted to "more actively" integrate allies into projects.

He said his team was receiving advice from the Center for Strategic and International Studies and RAND in the U.S., as well as Britain's Royal United Services Institute.

Fedorov also said Ukraine would test its homegrown replacement for China's DJI Mavic drone this month, which is widely used for aerial reconnaissance on the front lines by both sides. He did not disclose the manufacturer.

Ukraine has previously raised concerns about reliance on Beijing for drones and components, given China's deepening diplomatic ties with Russia.

"We will have our own Mavic analogue: the same camera, but with a longer flight range," Fedorov said.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 15:32:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/JS2HTGYCR5L33JOT6QF36LQCKE.jpg?auth=4895884458f75e5b711dbec60a76231180a2163944864053d6459368813ab62c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US Supreme Court does not issue ruling on Trump's tariffs</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us-supreme-court-does-not-issue-ruling-trumps-tariffs-2026-01-20/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 20 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court issued three decisions on Tuesday but did not decide the closely watched dispute over the legality of President Donald Trump 's global tariffs.

Letby, 36, is serving a whole life sentence after being convicted of killing the newborns and attempting to murder seven more between June 2015 and June 2016 while working in the neonatal unit at a hospital in northern England, making her Britain's worst serial child killer of modern times.

Britain's Crown Prosecution Service said it had considered further allegations of murder and attempted murder relating to two infants who died and the attempted murder of seven others but had concluded the evidential test was not met.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 15:33:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/E2GGJVZBUZJVPDUIUS4NTYEZ3Q.jpg?auth=adad8204038d981271f5c46422d5a63d3bc274e1c2b860b5d2192091086c3225&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US estimates 200 Islamic State fighters escaped Syrian prison, US official says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-estimates-200-islamic-state-fighters-escaped-syrian-prison-us-official-says-2026-01-20/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 20 (Reuters) - About 200 low-level Islamic State fighters escaped Syria's Shaddadi prison on Monday after guards from the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces left the facility, but Syrian government forces recaptured many of them, a U.S. official said on Tuesday.

Fernando Grande-Marlaska told Reuters external processing centres, such as Italy’s plan to detain migrants in Albania , were "no magic solution" as they posed significant legal challenges and could strain relationships with third countries.

Meanwhile, Spain's strategy of working with transit nations before arrivals occur was proving effective, he said.

In contrast to many EU states tightening their immigration policies amid the rise of the far right, Spain's leftist government has been an outlier by treating migration as an economic asset, promoting legal immigration pathways , while simultaneously reducing irregular migration.

Irregular arrivals to Spain fell 42% last year - to around 36,000 compared to Italy’s little-changed 66,000.

"I believe that our figures and migration policy overall doubtlessly ... greatly strengthen Spain's role in defining migratory policy within the European Union," Grande-Marlaska said.

Denmark said last month that a majority of EU countries supported the processing of asylum requests "in safe third countries" to deter arrivals. The European Parliament is expected to restrict migration rules this year.

To bolster its strategy, Spain has increased its presence in West African nations Mauritania, Senegal and the Gambia— deploying nearly 100 police officers and various surveillance assets.

Rights groups, however, have said Spain's and the EU's support to West African countries to prevent migrants from boarding precarious boats to Spain's Canary Islands has led to abuses, notably in Mauritania where Spanish police were allegedly present during abusive detention of migrants, according to Human Rights Watch.

Grande-Marlaska said Spain had "not seen any illegal action or action against refugees' fundamental rights" and said Spain was working on beefing up its teams in Mauritania and Senegal and delivering more drones and vehicles to local forces.

Migrant arrivals to the Canaries fell 62% last year from record-breaking 2024 levels, Spanish data shows.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 15:34:10 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/SRM4P4J5ZFMRLDXYNWUVA6L34M.jpg?auth=925c134ab7b9adc9f19787f14abb8fdb0d1d2d83bccc45618f86195bca6a3765&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Norway won't take part in Trump's "Board of Peace", deputy foreign minister tells Aftenposten</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/norway-wont-take-part-trumps-board-peace-deputy-foreign-minister-tells-2026-01-20/</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 15:34:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>China says it drove away Philippine aircraft over disputed shoal</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-says-it-drove-away-philippine-aircraft-over-disputed-shoal-2026-01-20/</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 15:34:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Syrian government forces advance in northeast as Kurds vow to resist</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260120-syrian-government-forces-advance-in-northeast-as-kurds-vow-to-resist</link><description>Syrian government troops thrust deeper into areas held by Kurdish forces in northeastern Syria on Tuesday, Syrian military sources said, pressing rapid gains against Kurdish fighters who vowed to defend their remaining enclaves.

Government forces have this week taken swathes of northern and eastern Syria long held by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), once the main US ally in Syria, advancing President Ahmed al-Sharaa 's effort to bring all the country under centralised authority.

The swift reversal for the SDF along one of Syria's main faultlines marks the biggest shift in territorial control in Syria since Islamist fighters led by Sharaa toppled President Bashar al-Assad in 2024.

Amid reported clashes, three Syrian sources said the US-led coalition against the Islamic State (IS) group was negotiating for the government to take over an SDF-guarded camp housing thousands of civilians linked to the jihadist group near the town of al-Hol, close to the Iraqi border. The Syrian military said it was advancing on al-Hol.

The US military's Central Command did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.

One of the sources, a Syrian official, said talks were focused on a smooth transition to avoid any security risks or detainees fleeing.

The SDF had established control of a quarter or more of Syria during the 2011-2024 civil war , while fighting with the support of US troops against Islamic State.

The Syrian military sources said government troops had advanced on Tuesday in eastern areas of Hasakah province - where al-Hol is located - and south of the town of Kobani, also known as Ain al-Arab, which lies on the border with Turkey .

A spokesperson for the Syrian Kurdish YPG, the dominant component of the SDF, said "enemy forces were trying to advance" near al-Hol camp but Kurdish forces were maintaining a defensive line in the area. The spokesperson did not respond to a question about the advances reported near Kobani.

The SDF said it had inflicted heavy losses on government forces trying to advance on the village of Tel Baroud in Hasakah. Neither side announced overall casualty figures.

Earlier on Tuesday, the SDF reported four attacks at dawn by " Damascus factions" in areas near Kobani, saying the attacks had been repelled. "Our forces ... confirm their complete readiness to confront any aggression," the SDF said in a statement.

Tensions between the SDF and Damascus spilled into open conflict this month, including in Aleppo , after months of deadlock over the fate of the SDF's fighters and territory, with the Kurdish force resisting government demands that it fully dissolve into the defence ministry.

After days of fighting, the SDF said on Sunday it would withdraw its forces from the Arab-majority provinces of Raqqa and Deir al-Zor. On Monday, government forces pushed into the SDF-controlled Hasakah province, saying they had seized control of one of several jails holding Islamic State prisoners.

Reports indicated that SDF commander Mazloum Abdi and Sharaa held a rocky meeting on Monday, after Abdi's signature appeared on a 14-point agreement with the government.

YPG spokesperson Farhad Shami said claims of an agreement being reached were "lies".

"I believe that when Mazloum Abdi went to Damascus, he knew that this government would try again to force our people to surrender," Shami said in an interview with Kurdish broadcaster Rudaw on Monday evening.

"We have decided that we will defend ourselves even if we are alone," he said.

The United States, which has since established close ties with Sharaa under President Donald Trump , has been closely involved in mediation between the sides.

The government and the SDF have traded blame over the escape of IS group prisoners from a prison in the town of Shaddadi on Monday, with each accusing the other of releasing them.

The Syrian Interior Ministry said on Tuesday that about 120 IS group detainees escaped, 81 of whom had been recaptured. The Syrian government has said that it is now in control of the prison in Shaddadi.

The SDF has previously said it was guarding some 10,000 IS group fighters.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 15:34:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/27be6718-f611-11f0-a781-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26020518687801.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'Greenland tipped the balance': Macron and Trump's shifting relationship</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/greenland-tipped-the-balance-macron-and-trump-s-shifting-relationship</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 15:34:22 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/ee939a62-f610-11f0-ac0e-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260120-152347-153126-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>French opposition parties expected to file votes of no-confidence</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/french-opposition-parties-expected-to-file-votes-of-no-confidence</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 15:34:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/a6b167c0-f60f-11f0-9ec0-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260120-153214-153553-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>French PM forces part of budget bill through lower house without vote</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/french-pm-forces-part-budget-bill-through-lower-house-without-vote-2026-01-20/</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 16:38:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Turkey probing flag burning at protests along Syrian border</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/turkey-probing-flag-burning-protests-along-syrian-border-2026-01-20/</link><description>NUSAYBIN, Turkey, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Turkey said on Tuesday it was investigating the burning of its flag during protests along its border with Syria by pro-Kurdish groups, coinciding with clashes there between the Damascus government army and Kurdish-led forces.

Syrian government forces pushed deeper into northeast Syria's Kurdish-held areas on Tuesday after taking swathes of territory long held by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) this week, advancing President Ahmed al-Sharaa's effort to bring all the entire country back under centralised authority.

Ankara, the main foreign supporter of Sharaa's government, deems the SDF a terrorist organisation linked with outlawed Kurdish PKK militants in Turkey, and has repeatedly said the SDF must integrate into Syria's state apparatus under a 2025 accord.

Turkish authorities have been engaged in a peace process with the PKK for months under which it says the group - and its extensions - must lay down weapons and disband to end a four-decade PKK insurgency in Turkey.

Footage from the protests showed participants, whom Ankara said supported Kurdish militants, trying to climb fenced walls along the Turkish-Syrian border in the Nusaybin-Qamishli region, while some burned or tore down Turkish flags in the area and chanted slogans.

Police used water cannon and pepper spray in attempts to disperse the crowds, amid scuffles with some protesters.

Justice Minister Yilmaz Tunc said on X that prosecutors had launched inquiries into the events, while the defence ministry said investigations were underway against PKK supporters trying to cross the border illegally at Nusaybin.

"With this attack in question, it is evident that dark forces aiming to sabotage the goal of a terror-free Turkey have once again come into play. These attempts will neither weaken the determination of our state nor harm the unity and solidarity of our nation," Burhanettin Duran, the Turkish presidency's communications director, said on X.

Omer Celik, spokesman for President Tayyip Erdogan's AK Party, vowed the "clearest and strongest response".

Turkey has since 2016 repeatedly sent forces into northern Syria to curb the gains of the SDF - which during Syria's 2011–24 civil war took control of more than a quarter of the country while fighting Islamic State with strong U.S. backing.

The SDF has said the peace process between the Turkish state and PKK does not apply to it.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 16:38:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/YKFIXWEQ6FMYRGZM4GEPARZXJ4.jpg?auth=fb1b7535e63559750f6863619795d0b4daecd02062c6820e011835d5e838c49c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Syrian defence ministry announces four-day ceasefire after new accord with Kurdish force</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/syrian-defence-ministry-announces-four-day-ceasefire-after-new-accord-with-2026-01-20/</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 16:39:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Italian ski resort Courmayeur bans indoor sparklers after deadly Swiss fire</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/italian-ski-resort-courmayeur-bans-indoor-sparklers-after-deadly-swiss-fire-2026-01-20/</link><description>MILAN, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Courmayeur, an exclusive Italian ski resort at the foot of Mont Blanc, has banned the use of sparklers and other naked flame items in closed spaces following the deadly blaze in a bar in Switzerland's Crans-Montana.

The Crans-Montana fire on New Year's Eve killed 40 people, most of them teenagers, including six Italians, and injured 116. Authorities believe it was caused by "fountain candle" sparklers carried too close to the ceiling.

Courmayeur's town hall said in a statement on Tuesday that the ban would apply to "open flames and pyrotechnic items in all enclosed spaces, in particular in public venues".

Italian local authorities have intensified inspections of nightclubs and other public venues since the Crans-Montana catastrophe, checking capacity limits, emergency exits and fire safety measures.

Several clubs and discotheques have been closed in Rome this month following safety inspections, including Piper, one of the capital's most popular and historic venues which rose to fame during the 1960s.

Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has said her government is considering introducing a nationwide ban on the use of sparklers indoors. Several Swiss cantons have banned the sparklers since the Crans-Montana disaster.

Courmayeur Mayor Roberto Rota said the resort's ban was "necessary and urgent" due to the widespread use of open flames in public venues during celebrations.

Francesco Lenzi, a 20-year-old ski enthusiast from Milan, said more cities should follow Courmayeur's example.

Jeri, who assumed power in October after the expulsion of former President Dina Boluarte, said on Monday night he would make himself available to the prosecutor's office and the congressional oversight committee to "provide statements and clarifications" on the matter, according to the president's press office.

Jeri's meetings with businessman Zhihua Yang, who owns commercial stores and a concession for an energy project, and his failure to publicly disclose them as part of his agenda, prompted criticism over a lack of transparency and potential corruption. In Peru, the president's meetings are traditionally included in the official agenda.

Jeri met with Zhihua Yang on December 26 and January 6, according to local media.

Opposition lawmakers have said they will present a motion to impeach or censure Jeri, 39, whose popularity remains high despite dipping to 44% in January, according to the local polling firm CPI.

Jeri issued a public apology for the initial meeting, a dinner at a Chinese restaurant in Lima, via a recorded message on Sunday. He said he went to coordinate the celebration of another anniversary of Peruvian-Chinese friendship and denied having received an "irregular request" to meet.

"I admit my mistake," he said. "And I publicly apologize for entering the meeting with the businessman the way I did, hidden, and for that, giving rise to suspicions and doubts about my behavior," Jeri said.

Hours after Jeri's apology, a second meeting with Zhihua Yang, whose business has been suspended by Lima's authorities for selling unauthorized products, was made public.

An attorney representing Zhihua Yang told radio station RPP on Monday night that the encounters were a "friendly meeting in which President Jeri broke some protocols."

Although a censure of Jeri requires fewer votes than impeachment (87 out of 130), his removal is unlikely, political experts have said. Two-thirds of Peru's lawmakers are seeking reelection and will likely opt for stability before the April general elections, analysts said.

Peru has been reeling from an ongoing political crisis, with a revolving door of seven presidents since 2018 due to resignations or dismissals.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 16:41:02 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ZKFKQZ66DVKYJEYT7JT34R35RE.jpg?auth=67df6820c9a04d87cb3bf7371068367a57ae371657ef1be2324d8a7c73a0f9b8&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Carney tells Davos Canada 'strongly opposes' tariffs over Greenland</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/carney-tells-davos-canada-strongly-opposes-tariffs-over-greenland-2026-01-20/</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 16:41:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Peru's president embroiled in scandal over failure to disclose meetings with Chinese businessman</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/perus-president-embroiled-scandal-over-failure-disclose-meetings-with-chinese-2026-01-20/</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 16:41:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Carney tells Davos Canada 'strongly opposes' tariffs over Greenland</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/carney-tells-davos-canada-strongly-opposes-tariffs-over-greenland-2026-01-20/</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 16:41:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>French PM Lecornu forces 2026 budget through parliament without a vote</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260120-french-pm-lecornu-forces-2026-budget-through-parliament-without-a-vote</link><description>France 's Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu made use of a special constitutional power on Tuesday to force part of his 2026 budget ​bill through the deeply divided lower house of parliament ‍without a vote.

Lecornu invoked Article 49.3 of the Constitution on the income side of the ​legislation to get it through the lower house, where it had ​become deadlocked after three months of discussions.

In response, opposition parties the hard-left France Unbowed (LFI) and far-right National Rally (RN) were expected to file no-confidence motions against the government.

Lecornu and his government, however, appear to have won enough political backing, notably from the Socialists, to survive the no-confidence votes, which are likely to take ‍place on Friday.

The legislation is due to head to the Senate next before returning to the ​lower house. Lecornu will also need to force the spending side of the budget bill through the lower house before a final push ‌on the overall package.

Lecornu's minority government expects the budget to be definitively passed in the first half of ‍February, one official has said. He had previously promised to abstain from forcing the budget bill through parliament without a vote but was forced to do so after failing to win over enough lawmakers to pass the legislation with a vote, despite offering a series of concessions.

Lecornu's move nevertheless brings France closer to ‍a conclusion to getting a 2026 budget through parliament that keeps the fiscal deficit ‌to a maximum ​of 5% of its projected economic output for the year.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 16:41:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/07d05bae-f61c-11f0-9f32-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-20T160933Z-924940248-RC245JA1ZX0W-RTRMADP-3-FRANCE-POLITICS-BUDGET.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Crypto investments and conflicts of interest: Trump's very profitable year in office</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260120-crypto-investments-and-conflicts-of-interest-trump-s-very-profitable-year-in-office</link><description>In his second inaugural address , US President Donald Trump promised a “golden age of America” was about to begin.

One year later, many Americans still find themselves in the grip of price hikes , but Trump’s personal fortune has flourished, according to estimates from US media and monitors.

The US president has increased his wealth by $3 billion in the past 12 months – up to a total of $7.3 billion, according to Forbes. The New Yorker meanwhile estimates his fortune shot up $3.4 billion in the first six months of his second term alone, largely from “pocketing off the presidency”.

Almost $2 billion-worth of cash and gifts have boosted the Trump family fortune according to the Trump's Take tracker , run by the Center for American Progress (CAP) policy institute.

No one knows exactly how much Donald Trump is worth. Since he first took office in 2017, he has refused to comply with the decades-old tradition of US presidents releasing their tax returns. He has also been accused by a US court of lying about his net worth to make himself look richer.

Historically Trump’s fortune came from the Trump Organisation family conglomerate focused on real estate and tourism, but much of his new wealth is thought to come from crypto ventures that have boosted his fortunes by billions of dollars in just a few months.

The sums are unprecedented for a president in office. “There is no historical parallel for this. Nothing comes close,” said Will Ragland, vice president of research at CAP.

While former presidents have gone to great lengths to avoid conflicts of interest, such as Jimmy Carter putting his peanut farm into a blind trust, Trump seems to embrace the grey area.

Trump is “a president who appears to actively use his businesses as a vehicle for blatant conflict of interest for personal gain,” said Ragland.

During Trump’s first term, the infamous dealmaker lost money. According to Forbes, Trump was worth $3.5 billion when he was first inaugurated. By 2021, the figure had slumped to $2.4 billion .

The loss was largely due to the impact of the Covid pandemic on his commercial real-estate interests, including hotels, resorts and office blocks , as well as devaluations in his fleet of planes and golf courses.

By the time Trump was poised to run for a second presidential term in 2024, his portfolio of investments had diversified.

The vast majority of his new wealth has come from crypto investment projects run by the Trump family including World Liberty Financial, stablecoin USD1, meme coin tokens and NFTs (non-fungible tokens).

Although many of these are run by Trump’s sons, Forbes estimates that Trump himself has made $2.4 billion from cryptocurrencies since 2024 while Trump’s Take estimates the total value of the Trump family’s crypto assets has grown by $7.4 billion since his returned to the White House .

This, despite Trump's claim back in 2019 that he was “not a fan” of cryptocurrencies as their value was “highly volatile and based on thin air” and that they could also facilitate “illegal activity”.

Six years later, the mercurial nature of crypto has played to his advantage.

Meme coins, for example, are cryptocurrencies that generally emerge from internet jokes and are often bought as a novel way to engage with online trends, rather than as a serious investment.

When Trump launched his $TRUMP meme coin days before his second inauguration, buying in was a way for his supporters to ride a wave of excitement – but it was also a money spinner. By March, Trump had made $350 million off the coin, according to the Financial Times.

Next to launch was the $MELANIA meme coin, named after the first lady, which quickly earned $65 million in sales and trading fees – with particular benefits for a few early investors.

In the minutes before it’s official launch, 24 unidentified wallets bought up $2.6 million of the $MELANIA coin and within days flipped them for $100 million , the Financial Times reported.

Trump’s other crypto ventures have benefitted from similar boosts since he became president.

Since 2025, World Liberty Financial – a platform for borrowing, lending and trading cryptocurrencies – has sold more than $1 billion of its own tokens, Trump NFT’s have netted him around $13 million and the USD1 stablecoin is now worth an estimated $235 million .

The advantage of an association with the White House is especially clear for Trump's stablecoin.

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that aim to maintain a stable value through links to specific assets – in USD1’s case it comes with a presidential guarantee that it is backed by short-term US government treasuries and dollar deposits.

The safeguard has encouraged foreign investment. In May 2025, the UAE’s ruling family bought up $2 billion of USD1.

Weeks later the White House gave the UAE access to thousands of the world’s most advanced and scarce computer chips .

Although the two incidents are not explicitly linked, there are indications – some more blatant than others – that those who invest in Trump’s crypto ventures are being given preferential treatment.

In April 2025, it was announced that the top 25 $TRUMP coin holders would be invited to a reception and VIP tour of the White House, a clear opportunity to pay for access to the President.

Among those on the guest list was China-born crypto billionaire Justin Sun, who is thought to own hundreds of millions of Trump’s meme coins, and is also the second-largest known investor in World Liberty Financial.

He was also the subject of a 2023 investigation by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which charged him with finding illicit ways of trading in the US including enlisting celebrities to endorse his cryptocurrency.

The Trump administration has since ended nearly all regulation against crypto traders and, in 2026, the SEC put its charges against Sun on hold.

Such deals are not necessarily illegal, but they “certainly transgress the ways in which things have been done in the past,” said Emma Long, associate professor in American history and politics, at the University of East Anglia.

It is not unusual for US presidents to use their profile for lucrative ends: most do this after they leave office, via book deals and speaking fees worth tens of millions of dollars.

But while in office, “presidents usually divest themselves of any financial arrangements that might be a conflict of interest or that might be seen as trading on their official position”, Long added.

While crypto ventures are the main source of Trump’s rapidly increasing fortune, there are other ventures that operate in this grey area.

On the 2024 campaign trail, Trump became the only presidential candidate to run an online merchandise store redirecting funds – that supporters may have believed were going to his campaign – into his own pocket.

Since his re-election, there have been claims that Trump’s hotels and resorts have benefitted from their association with the White House and from Trump holding official events there. Membership fees for Trump’s most famous resort, Mar-a-Lago in Florida, have now risen to $1million .

Then there are a host of other eyebrow-raising deals, such as a $40 million agreement signed with Amazon giving the corporation access to film a documentary with Melania Trump .

There's also the $400 million luxury jet that Trump accepted from Qatari government, which he has been allowed to keep even though it “appears to violate the spirit if not the letter of the Constitution, which essentially prohibits accepting profits or gifts from foreign countries without congressional approval”, said Ragland.

US Congress has so far failed to take action against the exceptionally expensive gift, making it part of a wider cash grab that indicates the country's “ethical guardrails are no longer functional,” said Ragland.

“We aren't just looking at one man’s fortune; we’re looking at a systemic failure that leaves the American public completely vulnerable to industrial-scale corruption,” he added.

French President Emmanuel Macron said the European Union should not bend to "the law of the strongest", adding that it was "crazy" that the bloc was having to contemplate using its "anti-coercion instrument" against the United States.

"We do believe that we need more growth, we need more stability in this world, but we do prefer respect to bullies," Macron told the World Economic Forum's annual meeting, the day before Trump's arrival in Switzerland.

Without referring directly to Trump, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen highlighted a need to respond to seismic shifts in the world and said the speed and scale of change had driven a consensus in Europe on independence.

"It is time to seize this opportunity and build a new independent Europe," she said in a speech.

Belgium's Prime Minister Bart De Wever said the 27-member bloc was "at a crossroads" where it must decide on how to get out of a "very bad position" after trying to appease Trump to get his support for the Ukraine war .

"So we should unite and we should say to Donald Trump ... 'You're crossing red lines here.' We either stand together or we will stand divided," De Wever said on a panel discussion.

Trump announced tariffs on Saturday on imports from European allies that oppose the U.S. acquiring Greenland, an autonomous part of Denmark.

European governments, which are facing growing challenges from populist, nationalist parties, have been at odds over how to respond to the tariff threat while maintaining U.S. support for Ukraine.

Macron said Europe should not accept a world where might was right and called for bold moves to defend European industries.

"Let's not be shy. Let's not be divided. Let's not accept a global order, which will be divided by those who claim to have the bigger voice," Macron said.

Macron also appeared to see an opportunity for Europe in Trump's chaotic policies.

"We have a place where the rule of law and predictability is still the rule of the game, and my guess is that it is under-priced by the market," he said in his speech.

However, some senior bankers and executives in Davos, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they saw the response from European leaders to Trump's moves as emotional rather than pragmatic. Two suggested the continent needed to look beyond the way the U.S. president delivers his message and have a negotiation.

"But they won't even want to have that conversation, because they're so offended by the style. And so what you have in Europe is a very, very, delicate balance of a continent that cannot move together," one senior banker told Reuters.

European countries say Trump's threat of new tariffs would violate a trade deal reached with the U.S. last year, and EU leaders are set to discuss possible retaliation at an emergency summit in Brussels on Thursday.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, however, voiced confidence that the United States and European countries would find a solution and avoid what some have warned could become a prolonged trade war.

"Why are we jumping there? Why are you taking it to the worst case? ... Calm down the hysteria. Take a deep breath," he said.

Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Tuesday that he was ready to join other global leaders in Davos, but only if the U.S. was ready to sign documents on security guarantees for Ukraine and a post-war prosperity plan.

"Ukraine is ready for meetings ... if those meetings are actually effective," he wrote on X.

His comments came as CEOs, including finance industry executives, are expected to meet on Wednesday to discuss post-war reconstruction, a source familiar with the matter said.

But any decisions were unlikely, the source told Reuters, adding: "You need peace in order to reconstruct the place."

Zelenskiy urged the U.S. to pile more pressure on Russia after its latest massive air attack on Ukraine cut heating to half of the capital and affected substations the United Nations' atomic watchdog said are vital for nuclear safety.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 17:30:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4EPO2RX5PRONTC3RDIJCXBQ6CM.jpg?auth=8e9543263e090b354d7cb131edfbf0b54f18bd0a6627113bd8fd899c6a6f94dc&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>ICE crackdown creates double-edged campaign issue for Republicans and Democrats</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/ice-crackdown-creates-double-edged-campaign-issue-republicans-democrats-2026-01-20/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 20 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown is fast becoming a double-edged campaign issue in November's hotly contested midterm congressional elections because of mounting public unease over aggressive tactics by federal immigration officers.

After an ICE officer shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Good in Minneapolis on January 7, sparking protests , opinion polls showed most Americans disapprove of the conduct of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, including a Reuters/Ipsos survey that pointed to a Republican split over whether federal immigration agents should try harder to avoid hurting people.

Criticism about ICE's use of force appears to have diminished the ability of Republican candidates to pivot away from economic pessimism among voters by stressing the party's traditionally strong standing on crime and security. Democrats could benefit, despite the party's historic weakness on border security issues, if voters decide Trump has moved beyond what they elected him to do, said Nathan Gonzales, editor of analysis firm Inside Elections.

The polling data has raised Republican concerns that souring public views of ICE operations could cloud Trump's success at securing the U.S.-Mexico border. Record numbers of migrants flowed into the U.S. under former President Joe Biden, a topic Republicans view as a key campaign asset.

But with some Democratic candidates calling for ICE's abolition, Democratic groups are concerned that voters worried about immigration and security could turn against them come November.

Republicans control both the Senate and the House of Representatives but face voter frustration over high prices and the economy in an election cycle that often punishes the ruling party as voters cast ballots for all 435 House seats and 35 of the 100 Senate seats.

"This is kind of a fluid situation that we're in right now that reminds me a bit of where we were after George Floyd, where public opinion moved pretty dramatically," said Amy Walter, editor-in-chief of the Cook Political Report.

The 2020 police killing of Floyd in Minneapolis spurred nationwide anger that brought about reforms in many U.S. states but also proved to be a political liability for both Republicans and Democrats.

Members of the public have expressed outrage over immigration enforcement tactics such as ICE agents wearing masks, zip-tying children and arresting and injuring or killing U.S. citizens. Over the weekend in Minneapolis, a naturalized U.S. citizen said immigration agents with guns drawn broke down his door and dragged him into the snow wearing shorts and . ChongLy Thao, 56, who goes by the name Scott, said he was returned home later without explanation or apology.

The Department of Homeland Security has said ICE officers, whom it oversees, have also faced violence .

DEMOCRATS COULD RETAKE HOUSE: ANALYSTS

Analysts say Democrats are in a strong position to gain control of the House and could cut into the 53-47-seat Republican Senate majority, if not seize the chamber outright. Losing either chamber would hinder Trump's ability to enact his agenda and also would enable congressional investigations into administration policies and actions.

"Is (ICE) an issue that people care enough to vote on? I don't know," Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters last week.

The Trump administration is poised to ramp up immigration enforcement this year with funds Congress gave ICE to hire thousands of agents, detain more than 100,000 migrants at any given time and expand surveillance to track down possible immigration offenders. The push is expected to include more enforcement against employers, a move that could pressure businesses in sectors known to hire workers who are in the U.S. illegally.

In the coming months, ICE's aggressive tactics could undermine Republican support among Latino voters and influence toss-up Senate races in Democratic-leaning states such as Maine and Michigan, Walter said.

Senator Susan Collins of Maine, the most vulnerable of this year's Republican incumbents, criticized what she considered "excessive" ICE tactics, including wearing masks and targeting immigrants without criminal records, which she said have been ordered by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.

"It's not the ICE officers' fault," Collins told Reuters. "Some of the tactics that the secretary has had ICE use in cities are not where the focus should be."

Some Senate Democrats hope to use government funding legislation to impose new curbs on ICE's actions. But Collins, who oversees funding issues as chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said she instead favored oversight hearings with Noem.

In response, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said, "President Trump and Secretary Noem are delivering on the American people's mandate to deport illegal aliens."

McLaughlin's statement to Reuters cited opinion polls released months before Good's shooting that showed most Americans favoring deportation of people in the country illegally, though one New York Times survey also said most voters thought Trump had gone too far on immigration enforcement.

The statement asserted that 70% of those arrested by ICE have been charged with or convicted of crimes, a claim that has been disputed by independent researchers, advocacy groups and journalists.

Democrats could find themselves debating whether to reform ICE or abolish the agency altogether, a question some fear could backfire on the party.

"The task ahead is not to eliminate enforcement, but to reclaim it from those who are abusing it for political gain," the Democratic centrist think tank Third Way warned in a public memo.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 17:30:47 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BM5MVL4CQRKSVC4QCUD5QPSAZY.jpg?auth=6bb5a87ae36812fb5427ff2cf3668f8460b856017688a5f101ff9c3826d48680&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Six-year-old girl who went to see Lion King is family's sole survivor of Spanish train crash</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/six-year-old-girl-who-went-see-lion-king-is-familys-sole-survivor-spanish-train-2026-01-20/</link><description>MADRID, Jan 20 (Reuters) - A six-year-old girl was found walking alone along the tracks on Sunday night after her parents, brother and cousin all died in the high-speed crash between two trains in southern Spain. She had been on a family outing to see the Lion King musical in Madrid.

The girl, who has not been officially named, suffered only a minor head wound. The family had been returning to their home in Aljaraque, on the Atlantic coast near Huelva, according to Spanish media.

The trip to the musical had been a present for the feast of Epiphany, which Spain celebrates along with Christmas. The family also visited Real Madrid's Bernabeu Stadium, according to regional broadcaster Canal Sur.

The girl's survival was described by the mayor of Aljaraque as "a miracle".

"The town is broken by grief and with hardly any words of comfort," Adrian Cano said.

The girl was cared for overnight by a police officer before being reunited with her grandmother in Cordoba, authorities said.

Hers is among a series of stories told by grieving family members or worried relatives on social media or to local broadcasters about those missing or killed in one of Europe's deadliest train crashes .

Alberto Garcia told Antena 3 his daughter, who is five months pregnant, is in intensive care because of serious injuries sustained in the crash. Doctors have placed her under sedation and on a ventilator, he said, keeping watch over the unborn child, which still has a heartbeat.

Firefighters pulled her unconscious from the twisted wreck of the carriage, relatives told El Pais, after passengers smashed windows to escape from the train. Her sister , Ana, who was travelling with her and their dog, suffered lighter injuries. Relatives say the dog, named Boro, is still missing.

Ana said she believes her sister may have been injured while trying to protect the animal. "If I can’t do anything for her, at least I hope I can find Boro," she told local newspaper El Mundo.

Spain's government has declared three days of national mourning and high-speed rail services between Madrid and cities in Andalusia are suspended while tracks are cleared and combed over by investigators and rail safety experts.

Julio Rodriguez, 16, was among the first residents of Adamuz, where the trains crashed, to help with rescue efforts after passing the site on his return from a fishing trip.

"I arrived here and my body became someone else’s. All I could think about was helping. I walked the 800 metres back and forth six or eight times. I didn’t stop to think about tiredness," he told reporters after King Felipe thanked him and others during a visit to the crash site on Tuesday.

Many are still searching for their relatives. Families have filed a total of 47 missing reports but so far only 10 of the victims have been identified, official data says.

Relatives and colleagues were appealing online for news of Jesus Saldana, a cardiologist who has not been found among the injured or dead in any hospital or official lists, his sister told Cadena Ser radio. While they have recovered his mobile phone, they still have no news of him, she added.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 17:31:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LPSTZL76VFKBHC2BI6UBQWSAUQ.jpg?auth=3cd24f5eff914f9aff629856e5ac35bcf4263d2544912cdf9f83f6ef68c39d9e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Lukashenko joins Trump's 'Board of Peace' as US eases his isolation</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/lukashenko-joins-trumps-board-peace-us-eases-his-isolation-2026-01-20/</link><description>MOSCOW, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko signed an agreement on Tuesday to join U.S. President Donald Trump's Board of Peace, the latest step in a rapprochement with Washington after years of international isolation.

A presidential Telegram channel published video of Lukashenko signing the document, and quoted him as saying he hoped to contribute towards peace in Ukraine.

Lukashenko, in power since 1994, was long shunned by the West because of his poor human rights record and backing for Russian President Vladimir Putin in the war in Ukraine .

But Trump last year began easing sanctions on Belarus in return for the release of political prisoners. He has called Lukashenko a "highly respected" leader - a description that jars with the exiled Belarus opposition, which sees him as a dictator.

The invitation to join the Board of Peace marked a further stage in the U.S. rehabilitation of Lukashenko as it continues to negotiate with him on further prisoner releases and a normalisation of ties.

Trump originally proposed establishing the Board when he announced his plan last September to end the war in Gaza. But an invitation sent to world leaders last week outlines a broad role for the body in ending conflicts globally.

A draft charter sent to about 60 countries by the U.S. administration calls for members to contribute $1 billion in cash if they want their membership to last more than three years, according to the document seen by Reuters.

On Monday Trump said he had invited Russian President Vladimir Putin to be a member of the Board.

On Tuesday, Armenia said it would also join. Trump has claimed credit for ending a long-running conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan, which have fought two wars since the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 17:32:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/RIVW7ZNXNNJ6FMEB5JV77OKBB4.jpg?auth=09173f074c3aa17e76e3b2d7eb90a3fa9d61afca36009b84b6fd26653b9a4e8d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Portuguese police arrest 37 suspected ultra-right militants</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/portuguese-police-arrest-37-suspected-ultra-right-militants-2026-01-20/</link><description>LISBON, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Portuguese police on Tuesday arrested 37 people suspected of belonging to an ultra-right group responsible for hate crimes, with links to similar international groups, in a large operation that involved around 300 officers.

"Those detained ... promoted Nazi ideology, inherent to the national-socialist culture and the radical and violent extreme right, acting out of racist and xenophobic motives with the aim of intimidating, persecuting and assaulting ethnic minorities, namely immigrants," the Judicial Police said in a statement.

Searches found weapons of different kinds and neo-Nazi propaganda materials.

Police sources said the group in question was "1143", named after the year Portugal became a kingdom. The group's leader, Mario Machado, is serving a prison sentence after being convicted of racial discrimination, hate speech and related violence.

In June, police arrested several suspected neo-Nazis believed to be seeking to create an illegal armed militia , and seized firearms and explosives.

Human rights groups have long raised concerns about increasing hate speech and attacks against immigrants in Portugal, where the far-right, anti-immigration party Chega last year became the second-largest parliamentary group - 50 years after the country overthrew its fascist dictatorship.

On Sunday, Chega leader Andre Ventura came in second in the first round of a presidential election, proceeding to a runoff against Socialist candidate Antonio Jose Seguro.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 17:33:27 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UK approves new Chinese ‘mega embassy’ in London despite security concerns</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260120-uk-approves-new-chinese-mega-embassy-in-london-despite-security-concerns</link><description>Britain’s government on Tuesday approved a huge new Chinese embassy in central London, despite strong criticism from lawmakers across the political spectrum that it could become a base for espionage and intimidation of opponents.

Local Government Secretary Steve Reed formally signed off on plans for the building near the Tower of London , after years of delays and legal challenges.

Critics have long expressed concerns that the supersized embassy, set to be the biggest Chinese embassy in Europe, will heighten risks of Chinese intelligence-gathering as well as amplify the threat of surveillance and intimidation of Chinese dissidents in exile.

The heads of two UK spy agencies said that while it's not realistic to eliminate all risk, appropriate “security mitigations” were in place.

Plans for the embassy have been plagued by objections and protests since 2018, when China’s government bought the site at Royal Mint Court, where Britain's money was once made, for 225 million pounds (around $300 million.)

Opponents say the huge site sits too close to underground fiber optic cables carrying sensitive financial information between London’s two main financial districts. British media have reported that the 20,000 square-meter (around 215,000 square-foot) complex would include 208 secret basement rooms close to the data cables.

Dissidents have been among those who have protested the plans, saying a mega embassy housing large numbers of officials would further China’s repression of activists abroad.

Kemi Badenoch, the leader of the opposition Conservative Party, joined hundreds of protesters  who chanted “no China mega embassy” at the site Sunday.

Critics argue that approving the embassy was a mistake that went beyond security at the building — they say it sends a signal that Britain bows to pressure from Beijing to avoid economic repercussions.

“The government has capitulated to Chinese demands," Conservative security spokesman Chris Philp said.

Security Minister Dan Jarvis insisted: "We don’t trade off security for economic access.”

Helena Kennedy, a human rights lawyer and Labour Party member of the House of Lords, the upper house of the British Parliament, said that the decision was a dangerous step.

“We cannot reinforce the dangerous notion that Britain will continue to make concessions — such as granting a mega embassy — without reciprocity or regard for the rule of law,” she said.

Local residents said they were “determined to keep fighting today’s decision” and planned to challenge the approval in the courts.

Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s government has repeatedly postponed its decision in recent months after multiple cases of alleged Chinese spying and political interference underlined concerns about the proposed embassy.

In November, the domestic intelligence agency MI5 issued an alert to lawmakers warning that Chinese agents were making “targeted and widespread” efforts to recruit and cultivate them using LinkedIn or cover companies.

Beijing has strongly denied those claims, calling them “pure fabrication and malicious slander.”

The UK government also has faced questions about whether it interfered in the trial of two men accused of spying on Parliament for Beijing, and whose prosecution collapsed last year.

The heads of the domestic security service MI5 and the electronic intelligence agency GCHQ said in a letter to ministers that “as with any foreign embassy on UK soil, it is not realistic to expect to be able wholly to eliminate each and every potential risk.”

“However, the collective work across UK intelligence agencies and (government) departments to formulate a package of national security mitigations for the site has been, in our view, expert, professional and proportionate,” MI5 chief Ken McCallum and GCHQ director Anne Keast-Butler said.

They said there were “clear security advantages” to consolidating China’s current seven diplomatic premises in London onto one site.

The government said that “no bodies with responsibility for national security ... have raised concerns or objected to the proposal on the basis of the proximity of the cables or other underground infrastructure.”

Starmer has stressed that while protecting national security is nonnegotiable, Britain needs to keep up diplomatic dialogue and cooperation with the Asian superpower.

The approval is widely expected to pave the way for a long-anticipated trip by Starmer to China, and an expansion of the UK Embassy in Beijing. The closely watched visit would be the first made by a British prime minister since 2018.

China has complained about the seven-year delay in approving the project, saying the UK was “constantly complicating and politicising the matter.”</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 17:34:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/5485ef58-f2ee-11f0-aa22-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26014481909047.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>France's PM invokes Article 49.3 to force through budget bill</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france-s-pm-invokes-article-49-3-to-force-through-budget-bill</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 17:34:39 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/71cbda3c-f61d-11f0-bf3d-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260120-171443-171641-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Mass kidnapping at Kaduna churches adds to pressure on Nigeria</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/mass-kidnapping-kaduna-churches-adds-pressure-nigeria-2026-01-20/</link><description>KADUNA, Nigeria, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Afiniki Moses thought her ordeal was over when armed abductors released her on January 15 after her family paid a ransom in a village in northern Kaduna state. She was wrong.

The armed gang returned to Kurmin Wali village on Sunday and seized more than 170 people during a church service from two churches, including her husband and two children.

The children later escaped, she said, but her husband is among 163 people that the Christian Association of Nigeria says are still missing.

"They kidnapped a large number of people in the community and my husband happened to be among them. As you can see me now, I am not feeling fine," she said.

The attack on the churches is the latest in a series of abductions in the West African country, adding to pressure on the government.

It is under scrutiny from U.S. President Donald Trump who over what he says is persecution of Christians before launching an airstrike on Christmas Day. The Nigerian government has denied there is any systematic persecution of Christians.

It says it is working hard to tackle Islamists and other violent groups that have attacked both Muslim and Christian civilians often for ransom.

It has also hired a Washington-based consulting firm to help communicate its effort to protect Christians.

Kidnappings have spread over the years mostly in remote parts of northern Nigeria and are carried out by armed gangs who ride into villages on motorcycles and seize villagers.

Inside one of the churches targeted in Kurmin Wali, named the Evangelical Church Winning All, a Reuters reporter saw signs of disturbance, with some plastic chairs on the floor. A Bible lay on one chair, and musical instruments that appeared to have been used in a lively church service.

Idris Madami said he was outside Albarika Cherubin and Seraphin Movement Church nearby when the gunmen arrived with guns.

He managed to escape but said about 20 of his family members who were attending service were taken away and he has not heard from them.

"I have two wives (and) three children among those kidnapped," he told Reuters.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 17:58:26 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5OGNMYLOQFLSTPEOUFTAD6KMEQ.jpg?auth=5229cdc9829389c40978a479ab6bcb17b605bbd3718dac991901abee08468457&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Lithuania president says joint security deal could end Greenland row</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/lithuania-president-says-joint-security-deal-could-end-greenland-row-2026-01-20/</link><description>DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 20 (Reuters) - An agreement on sharing responsibility for the security of the Arctic and the North Atlantic could provide a way out of the stand-off between the United States and Europe over Greenland, Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda said on Tuesday.

Nauseda told Reuters an interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum's annual meeting that the Greenland row was overshadowing the war in Ukraine and playing into Russia's hands, and urged Washington to de-escalate tensions.

"The best outcome would be just to agree on common responsibility on the security of the Arctic region and North Atlantic region. Is it possible to achieve? We should do our best to go this way, because this is the best way," he said.

U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday there was "no going back" on his aim of acquiring Greenland, refusing to rule out taking the Arctic island by force and rounding on allies.

Trump's ambition to wrest sovereignty over Greenland from fellow NATO member Denmark has threatened to blow apart the alliance that has underpinned Western security for decades.

EU leaders are due to discuss their options at an emergency summit on Thursday which Nauseda said would show whether Europe can present a united front over Greenland. He said the next two weeks would probably show how the dispute is resolved.

Nauseda said he hoped countries that can be sceptical about supporting Ukraine would understand that Europe has reached a critical juncture, arguing NATO's future is at stake.

Trump is due to speak in Davos on Wednesday, and Nauseda said his hope was that the U.S. President would send out some signals towards de-escalating tensions over Greenland.

Describing upholding territorial integrity as an "untouchable principle," Nauseda said there was always room to de-escalate.

"But of course the precondition is that both sides want this de-escalation, and now I'm not sure. Europe is obviously willing to de-escalate. I hope that the United States will be too."

The Lithuanian president said the Greenland dispute had diverted attention away from Russia's invasion of Ukraine, posing additional challenges for Europe's eastern flank.

Ongoing support from Washington was vital while Europe set about taking on responsibility for its own security, he said.

"Europe needs time in order to implement this strategic autonomy, not only on paper, but in reality," Nauseda said.

"We need 10 to 15 years' time," he added.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 18:41:19 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/NQMHK3BRP5MEJGEFBQNZRU4DN4.jpg?auth=ff643bb005ad4794fc7230bd6cb7a3226ba9c4151c0abb17ee0a9103f3a3f9ad&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuela calls for 'symbolic' social media action after Trump post</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/venezuela-calls-symbolic-social-media-action-after-trump-post-2026-01-20/</link><description>Jan 20 (Reuters) - Venezuela's government on Tuesday called on citizens to post its official map on social media as a "symbolic action" after U.S. President Donald Trump posted an altered image showing U.S. flags over Venezuela, as well as Canada and Greenland.

The image, posted on Trump's Truth Social just before 1 a.m. Eastern Time (0600 GMT), shows an altered version of an August 2025 photo of European leaders in the Oval Office with Trump, with the original map replaced with one showing U.S. flags over Venezuela and much of North America.

The photo includes images of Britain's Keir Starmer, Italy's Giorgia Meloni, France's Emmanuel Macron and EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen - even as Trump himself and other world leaders traveled to Davos for the World Economic Forum.

"In light of this situation, the Venezuelan State calls on all citizens to take symbolic action in unity, with the aim of defending territorial integrity and countering misinformation," Venezuela's government said in a statement.

It urged its population to post on social media its official map of Venezuela, which includes Esequibo - some two-thirds of neighboring Guyana that is claimed by Venezuela, though this is not recognized by any major country or by the U.N.

Since the U.S. attack on Caracas on January 3, when it captured President Nicolas Maduro, the Trump administration has said it plans to "run" Venezuela and that it is cooperating with Maduro's vice-president and interim successor, Delcy Rodriguez.

While decrying the attack at home, which Venezuelan authorities say killed 100 people, Rodriguez has said she plans to pursue diplomatic channels with the U.S. She also agreed to a deal under which Venezuelan oil revenues are channeled to U.S.-controlled bank accounts .

Canada's prime minister's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Speaking in Copenhagen on Tuesday, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said she would not abandon Greenland and as Trump has not ruled out use of the military, she would not rule it out either .</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 18:43:16 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LEIWZDL2Z5M2POSKYLQKGRC7LE.jpg?auth=b433f221b75941af91b10b6fe761fd074a8717a2288ffee623c562ec8fbbf56f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Looming water supply 'bankruptcy' puts billions at risk, UN report warns</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/looming-water-supply-bankruptcy-puts-billions-risk-un-report-warns-2026-01-20/</link><description>Jan 20 (Reuters) - The world is facing irreversible water "bankruptcy", with billions of people struggling to cope with the consequences of decades of overuse as well as shrinking supplies from lakes, rivers, glaciers and wetlands, U.N. researchers said on Tuesday.

Nearly three-quarters of the global population live in countries classified as "water insecure" or "critically water insecure", and 4 billion people face severe water scarcity at least one month per year, the United Nations University Institute for Water, Environment and Health warned in a report , opens new tab .

"Many regions are living beyond their hydrological means, and many critical water systems are already bankrupt," said Kaveh Madani, lead author and director of the institute.

"By acknowledging the reality of water bankruptcy, we can finally make the hard choices that will protect people, economies and ecosystems," he said.

The report said water supplies are "already in a post-crisis state of failure" after decades of unsustainable extraction rates that have drawn down water "savings" contained in aquifers, glaciers, soils, wetlands and river ecosystems, with supplies also degraded by pollution.

More than 170 million hectares of irrigated cropland - an area larger than Iran - are under "high" or "very high" water stress, and economic damage from land degradation, groundwater depletion and climate change amounts to more than $300 billion a year worldwide, the report said.

Three billion people and more than half of global food production are concentrated in areas already facing unstable or declining water storage levels, while salinisation has also degraded more than 100 million hectares of cropland, it said.

The researchers wrote that the current approach to solving water problems was no longer fit for purpose, and the priority was not "returning to normal" but a new " global water agenda " designed to minimise damage.

However, Jonathan Paul, geoscience professor at Royal Holloway, University of London, said the report did not address one major factor behind the crisis.

"The elephant in the room, which is mentioned explicitly only once, is the role of massive and uneven population growth in driving so many of the manifestations of water bankruptcy," he said.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 18:43:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/EIBL34MG7VPQPFZZFGJX5K3HVU.jpg?auth=3d66a5330100edbf1e3ab153c28bd2b2754593f94a5130d47c8cc45ec7805b31&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>French far-right leader Le Pen takes the stand, denies party had ‘system’ to embezzle EU funds</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260120-french-far-right-leader-le-pen-takes-the-stand-denies-party-had-system-to-embezzle-eu-funds</link><description>French far-right leader Marine Le Pen at an appeals trial on Tuesday rejected her party having had any "system" to embezzle European Parliament funds, as she seeks to save her 2027 run for president.

A French court last year barred Le Pen, a three-time presidential candidate from the far-right National Rally (RN), from running for office for five years over a fake jobs scam at the European institution.

It found her, along with 24 former European Parliament lawmakers, assistants and accountants as well as the party itself, guilty of operating a "system" from 2004 to 2016 using European Parliament funds to employ RN staff in France.

Le Pen, 11 others and the party are appealing.

"The term 'system' bothers me because it gives the impression of manipulation," Le Pen said in the dock on Tuesday.

"The parliamentary assistant cases must be examined one by one, because it seems to me they reflect very different realities," she added.

The appeal hearings are to last until mid-February, with a decision expected this summer.

If the court upholds the first ruling, Le Pen will be prevented from running in the 2027 election, widely seen as her best chance to win the country's top job.

She made it to the second round in the 2017 and 2022 presidential polls, before losing to Emmanuel Macron . But he cannot run this time after two consecutive terms in office.

Le Pen was also handed a four-year prison sentence, with two years suspended, and fined 100,000 euros ($116,000) in the initial trial.

She now again risks the maximum sentence of 10 years in prison and a one-million-euro ($1.16 million) fine if the appeal fails.

Le Pen is hoping to be acquitted -- or at least a shorter election ban and no time under house arrest.

As the appeals trial opened last week, Le Pen said her party had "no sense" they were committing any offence, and sought to shift the blame on the European Parliament.

"If indeed any wrongdoing was committed, the European Parliament did not play the warning role it should have," she said on Tuesday last week.

On Thursday, EU Parliament official Didier Klethi said the legislature's rules were clear.

EU lawmakers could employ assistants with the monthly staffing stipend the parliament gave them -- which was 21,379 euros in 2024, he said.

Assistants could also engage in political activism, he added, but this was forbidden "during working hours".</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 18:43:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/d31dc68c-f628-11f0-884f-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26020371867428.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump considers role in Venezuela for Machado</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/trump-considers-role-venezuela-machado-2026-01-20/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 20 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Tuesday he was considering involving Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado in some capacity in her country, but did not say what role she could play.

Trump’s comments marked a tone change for the president, who previously questioned Machado's popularity and ability to lead in Venezuela after the United States captured President Nicolas Maduro in a raid earlier this month. In 2024, Machado's party said it had won 70% of the vote in the presidential election.

The United States has held talks with Russia, and separately with Kyiv and European leaders, on for ending the war in Ukraine , but no deal has yet been reached despite Trump's repeated promises to clinch one.

Ukraine's European allies, currently arguing in public about Trump's threats against Greenland, are concerned the United States could demand Ukrainian accept territorial concessions.

"Dialogue is constructive and more and more people understand the fairness of Russian position," Putin envoy Kirill Dmitriev said after talks with Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump's son in law Jared Kushner in the "USA House" at Davos.

Witkoff said: "We had a very positive meeting," Russia's RIA news agency reported.

The meeting lasted for two hours, a source who spoke on condition of anonymity said.

At stake is how to end the deadliest war in Europe since World War Two, the future of Ukraine, the extent to which European powers are sidelined and whether or not a peace deal brokered by the United States will endure.

Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022 after eight years of fighting in eastern Ukraine, triggering the biggest confrontation between Moscow and the West since the depths of the Cold War.

Russia controls about 19% of Ukraine, including the Crimea peninsula which it annexed in 2014, as well as most of the eastern Donbas region, much of the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions, and slivers of four other regions.

Russia says Crimea, Donbas, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia are now parts of Russia. Ukraine says it will never accept that, and almost all countries consider the regions to be part of Ukraine.

Ukraine and European leaders say that Russia cannot be allowed to achieve its aims after what they cast as an imperial-style land grab. If Russia wins, European powers say, then it will one day attack NATO. Moscow says such claims are ridiculous and that it has no intention of attacking a NATO member.

Russia says that European leaders are intent on scuttling the peace talks by introducing conditions that they know will be unacceptable to Russia, which took 12 to 17 square km (4.6-6.6 square miles) of Ukrainian territory per day in 2025.

Putin casts the war as a watershed moment in relations with the West, which he says humiliated Russia after the Soviet Union fell in 1991 by enlarging NATO and encroaching on what he considers Moscow's sphere of influence.

He has repeatedly said he is open to peace but one based on the realities of the battlefield.

The United States says a total of a million Russian and Ukrainian men have been killed or injured in the war. Russia and Ukraine do not publish losses.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 20:13:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KXAY5AGSHNLCPOFJJUQ5VCGTAU.jpg?auth=a4e70ec0d7262c880e63a06706ffe17ce759616ec6bec774e96f77dd84ef9393&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US will soon target drugs coming in by land, Trump says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-will-soon-target-drugs-coming-by-land-trump-says-2026-01-20/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 20 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday said his administration would "very shortly" start targeting drugs coming into the United States by land, after he claimed strikes by U.S. forces on suspected drug boats in the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean have reduced the amount of drugs coming into the U.S. by water.

The South American country recorded 9,216 murders last year, a sharp rise from 7,063 in 2024, ministry data showed. The increase reversed a positive trend from the previous year, when murders had fallen by 15%.

The government has attributed the spiraling violence to turf wars between splintered gangs vying for control following the capture or death of their leaders.

Police said they captured 20 "high-value" targets in 2025. The bulk of the violence was concentrated in the coastal province of Guayas, home to the major port city of Guayaquil.

Noboa, who has declared several states of emergency, recently mobilized over 10,000 soldiers to the country's three most violent provinces in response to the crisis.

Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Tuesday, Noboa told attendees that Ecuador was fighting a "complete war against evil and narco-terrorism."</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 20:16:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>EU vows 'unflinching' response to Trump's Greenland gambit</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/eu-vows-unflinching-response-to-trump-s-greenland-gambit</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 20:16:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/013b9692-f639-11f0-9625-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260120-203249-203437-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Almost half of Kyiv without heat, power, after Russian attack</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/almost-half-of-kyiv-without-heat-power-after-russian-attack</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 20:16:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/54cc4bf4-f638-11f0-8228-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260120-203452-203642-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>After Trump salvo, Macron says: we don't give in to bullies</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/after-trump-salvo-macron-says-we-don-t-give-in-to-bullies</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 20:16:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/f8a678d2-f636-11f0-9bd8-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260120-202619-202806-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>State Department approves potential sale of aircraft, torpedoes to Singapore for $2.3 billion, Pentagon says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/state-department-approves-potential-sale-aircraft-torpedoes-singapore-23-billion-2026-01-20/</link><description>Jan 20 (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department has approved the potential sale of maritime patrol and reconnaissance aircraft and lightweight torpedoes and related equipment to Singapore in a deal valued at an estimated $2.3 billion, the Pentagon said on Tuesday.

The players and coaches brandished their trophy from an open-top bus which inched its way through immense crowds across the capital, winding towards the country's presidential palace.

As the players travelled the final stretch of their journey along the city's oceanside highway, the Corniche, fans walked and sometimes ran alongside the bus, with throngs of people lining the sidewalks.

Downtown was overcome by a fever pitch of almost deafening noise -- revving engines, horns, vuvuzelas and shouting -- as the players neared the palace, where they will be officially received.

In the morning, thousands had gathered at the parade's starting point in Patte d'Oie, a working-class neighbourhood across town, wearing team jerseys, chanting, whistling and blowing vuvuzelas.

All along the route old and young, men and women turned out decked in the country's green, yellow and red colours, sometimes watching on from buildings and bridges, or even climbing on top of cars and billboards.

Security forces were also present in large numbers, including anti-riot police.

The Senegal team made its way across the capital after arriving on a special flight from Morocco shortly before midnight on Monday, where they were greeted by President Bassirou Diomaye Faye , Prime Minister Ousmane Sonko and other members of the government.Senegal won the Africa Cup of Nations when they beat hosts Morocco 1-0 in a chaotic final in Rabat on Sunday that saw the eventual champions storm off the pitch late in the game.

"I wouldn't have missed this moment for the world," 26-year-old fan Doudou Thiam told AFP from the parade's sidelines in the Bourguiba neighbourhood, wearing a Senegal jersey.

"The Lions are our pride and they deserve all the honours. Even if it meant staying here all day, I would have done it", he said.

A ruckus of whistles and horns has been almost constant since Senegal's victory on Sunday night, when fans flooded the streets, filling the air with honking, fireworks and the deafening roar of vuvuzelas.

The win marked Senegal's second title, after their 2022 victory over Egypt in Cameroon . It was the team's third final in just the last four editions.

Hortense Kenny brought her five-year-old child to Patte d'Oie to watch the parade.

"The Lions made an entire nation proud, beating the host country in those circumstances," she told AFP, referring to the end of the match.

"Now, all that's left is to win the World Cup. With Sadio Mane, anything is possible," she said, referencing the team's biggest star.

His role as peacemaker during the final -- he was the one who stayed on the pitch and persuaded his teammates to return -- has been widely praised.

Nearby Abdulai Sy, a 49-year-old, told AFP he felt personally touched by the victory which gave him a "big sense of pride to also be Senegalese".

Tuesday's crowd seemed unphased by a cloud of controversy surrounding their team's decision to storm off the pitch late in normal time in protest at a penalty awarded to Morocco.

Prompted by Mane, they returned to the pitch and an attempted 'Panenka' penalty from Morocco's Brahim Diaz was easily saved by Senegal's goalkeeper before Pape Gueye won the game with a superb shot in extra time that stunned the Moroccan crowd.

The Moroccan FA said it had referred the incidents, including protests from Senegal players and fans, to the Confederation of African Football and FIFA .

Far from Morocco, football's lucrative business side had trickled down even to the streets of Dakar on Tuesday.

Amath Ndiaye, a 36-year-old street vendor who usually sells tissues, told AFP he has switched to hawking jerseys, flags, vuvuzelas and whistles for the duration of AFCON and the celebratory aftermath.

On Tuesday, he was basking in the wisdom of his decision.

"I'm doing well," he told AFP from Patte d'Oie, near the joyous crowd decked out in patriotic Senegalese gear and waving flags.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 20:55:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/f1055096-f620-11f0-a539-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-20T163356Z-1425771790-UP1EM1K1A0IXA-RTRMADP-3-SOCCER-NATIONS-SEN-MAR-PARADE.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>How has Trump's one year in office weighed on the war in Ukraine?</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/how-has-trump-s-one-year-in-office-weighed-on-the-war-in-ukraine</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 20:55:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/9a061e5e-f63b-11f0-a67c-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260120-203845-204040-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Standoff with Iran over inspections cannot go on forever, IAEA chief says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/standoff-with-iran-over-inspections-cannot-go-forever-iaea-chief-says-2026-01-20/</link><description>DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 20 (Reuters) - The standoff with Iran over accounting for its stock of highly enriched uranium and inspecting nuclear facilities bombed by the United States and Israel cannot go on forever, U.N. nuclear watchdog chief Rafael Grossi said on Tuesday.

The International Atomic Energy Agency has inspected all 13 declared nuclear facilities in Iran that were not bombed, but has been unable to inspect any of the three key sites that were bombed in June - Natanz, Fordow or Isfahan - Grossi told Reuters in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos.

Iran must first file a report to the IAEA on what happened to those sites and material, including an estimated 440.9 kg of uranium enriched to up to 60% purity, close to the roughly 90% weapons-grade level. That is enough material, if enriched further, for 10 nuclear bombs, according to an IAEA yardstick.

Iran has not submitted that special report to the IAEA.

"This cannot go on forever because at some point, I will have to say, 'Well, I don't have any idea where this material is,'" which would mean there was no guarantee the material had not been diverted or hidden, Grossi said.

"I do not have that conviction or conclusion at the moment, but what we are saying to Iran is that they need to engage."

Iran says it is fully cooperating with the IAEA. Its government could not immediately be reached for comment.

It is now at least seven months since the IAEA last verified Iran's stock of highly enriched uranium. Its own guidance is that it should be done monthly.

Grossi said he was exercising "diplomatic prudence," but that Iran had to meet its obligations as a party to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.

"This cannot go on like this for a long time without me, unfortunately, having to declare them in non-compliance," he said, noting that parties to the NPT do not have an "a la carte" option where they can pick and choose what to comply with.

Asked if the issue could be resolved this spring, he said: "That is a reasonable time frame."

One of the "real world" realities Grossi said he must face is the influence of diplomatic efforts aimed at reaching a broader agreement between Iran and the United States that have been spearheaded by U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff.

"I cannot ignore it, and I wish it well so that there can be an understanding without the looming threat of new military activity over there or something of the sort," he said.

The IAEA said in November it had inspected most of Iran's nuclear facilities that were not struck in the U.S. and Israeli attacks. It has since carried out further inspections until late December, Grossi said.

It was not possible, however, to carry out inspections during civil unrest, he said, referring to recent protests that prompted a severe crackdown by the Islamic Republic. Iranian officials have indicated the unrest has stopped, he said.

"They said that things are calm and they are in control, etc.," Grossi said. "If this is the situation, shouldn't we resume (inspections)?"

Grossi said he would meet Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi in "a matter of days, weeks."</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 21:21:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/FOYYCWIJ2JLDZDLJL6YNE25GVI.jpg?auth=d1fc1a25c77395ff400f33e85718307c027cd305df93252ec659d70cb3628f2f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump on Greenland: we'll work out something to make US and NATO 'very happy'</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-greenland-well-work-out-something-make-us-nato-very-happy-2026-01-20/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 20 (Reuters) - The United States and NATO will come to an agreement on the future of Greenland that will satisfy both sides, U.S. President Donald Trump told a press conference on Tuesday.

Governments around the world have reacted cautiously to Trump's invitation to join that initiative that the U.S. president says aims to resolve conflicts globally, a plan that diplomats said could harm the work of the United Nations.

"Might," Trump said when asked by a reporter if he wanted the "Board of Peace to replace the U.N."

"The U.N. just hasn't been very helpful. I am a big fan of the U.N. potential but it has never lived up to its potential," Trump said in a briefing.

"I believe you got to let the U.N. continue because the potential is so great," he added.

The White House on Friday named some individuals who will sit on the board, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff, former British prime minister Tony Blair and Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner.

A U.N. Security Council resolution , adopted in mid-November, authorized the so-called "Board of Peace" and countries working with it to establish an international stabilization force in Gaza, where a fragile ceasefire began in October under a Trump plan on which Israel and Palestinian militant group Hamas had signed off.

Under Trump's Gaza plan, the board was meant to supervise Gaza's temporary governance. Trump thereafter said the board would be expanded to tackle conflicts around the world.

Observers say such a board could undermine the United Nations. Many rights experts and advocates have also said that Trump overseeing a board to supervise a foreign territory's affairs resembled a colonial structure, while Blair's involvement has been criticized due to his role in the Iraq war and the history of British imperialism in the Middle East.

The ceasefire in Gaza reached under Trump's plan has also been fragile. Over 460 Palestinians, including more than 100 children, and three Israeli soldiers have been reported killed since the truce began in October.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 21:45:10 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/DM24MFBS6RIHTACGKYFGKIXFKQ.jpg?auth=47d55ff1369bc8e5a515ad46e04478ad7c06d89bb4aa112f8ae37a4a81b65020&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuela has received $300 mln in funds from oil sales, acting president says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/venezuelas-top-lawmaker-says-oil-reform-will-add-partnership-model-2026-01-20/</link><description>Jan 20 (Reuters) - Venezuela's interim president Delcy Rodriguez said on Tuesday that the country has received $300 million from oil sales, the first proceeds from U.S. President Donald Trump's announced 50-million-barrel oil supply deal with Caracas, following the capture of President Nicolas Maduro earlier this month.

Trump said separately on Tuesday his country had taken the 50 million barrels out of Venezuela, and was selling some of it in the open market, though shipping records show that volume has not yet been exported.

Reuters reported last week that four Venezuelan banks had been notified by the country's government that they would split $300 million of oil revenues deposited in an account in Qatar, enabling them to sell dollars to Venezuelan companies that need foreign exchange to pay for materials.

"We should inform you that we have gotten funds, from the sale of oil, and we have gotten, of the first $500 million, $300 million," Rodriguez said at an event in Caracas. "These first funds will be used through the exchange market in Venezuela, by national banks and the central bank, to consolidate and stabilize the market and protect the incomes and purchasing power of our workers."

Elsewhere on Tuesday, Rodriguez's brother, lawmaker Jorge Rodriguez, said a reform of the country's main oil law expected to be debated for the first time this week will be based on a partnership structure first introduced during President Nicolas Maduro's administration, though he provided no details.

Interim president Rodriguez told lawmakers last week that the government supported changes to the hydrocarbons law to boost foreign investment. The law has a single contract model of joint ventures controlled by state company PDVSA, but the country has been introducing so-called 'productive participation contracts' for new partnerships in recent years, whose terms have not been fully disclosed.

Those contracts are "a fundamental element to be expressed in the law's reform," Jorge Rodriguez told journalists.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 21:45:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/3J5QIJA4TVNQHHWTPTALVVAGRE.jpg?auth=3e0cc6398f3b967a12178a3a8eb8c0132a330c05b5af45d6422d8dc0f80fcba1&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US subpoenas Minnesota leaders in criminal grand jury probe over opposition to immigration crackdown</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-subpoenas-minnesota-leaders-criminal-grand-jury-probe-over-opposition-2026-01-20/</link><description>Jan 20 (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Justice served grand jury subpoenas to the offices of Minnesota's governor and attorney general, and the mayor of Minneapolis, as it weighs whether their public opposition to President Donald Trump's surge in immigration enforcement amounts to a crime.

One of the subpoenas, shared by Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, orders his office's custodian of records to produce documents since the beginning of 2025 related to "cooperation or lack of cooperation with federal immigration authorities." Six offices were served with subpoenas, according to a Justice Department official, including those of Governor Tim Walz and Attorney General Keith Ellison.

Trump, a Republican, has sent thousands of immigration agents into the Minneapolis area in recent weeks in a highly visible, sometimes violent surge that has little modern precedent. The agents have carried guns through the city's snowy streets, dressed in military-style camouflage gear and masks, drawing loud protests from residents. Trump administration officials have blamed Walz and Frey for the protests, accusations they deny.

The hostility by many residents has only deepened after one agent fatally shot an American woman, Renee Good, in her car nearly two weeks ago. Federal agents have used tear gas and other chemical irritants on protesters, and have drawn outrage for questioning or arresting Black, Latino or Asian U.S. citizens, including a man who was wrongly arrested and pulled out of his home on Sunday dressed in underpants and sandals.

The subpoenas arrived a few days after it became public that the U.S. Justice Department was investigating Walz, Frey and other Democrats and outspoken critics of Trump.

Democratic politicians in Minnesota have called for calm, but have also been sharply critical of what they see as a politically motivated crackdown by Trump, and have sued his administration, asking a judge last week to order an end to what they call the unconstitutional excesses of his enforcement surge.

Walz called the federal investigation "a partisan distraction" that "does not seek justice."

"Minnesotans are more concerned with safety and peace rather than with baseless legal tactics aimed at intimidating public servants standing shoulder to shoulder with their community," his statement said.

Frey said in a statement that the federal government was trying "to intimidate local leaders for doing their jobs" and that "every American should be concerned."
"We shouldn't live in a country where federal law enforcement is used to play politics or crack down on local voices they disagree with," he said.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 21:45:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/3GJDFWQTCBJLRC5CZT7HXF42NA.jpg?auth=2a2a7dc66bf3325f621193e797c9f7f19f21888156e5f6b9b3395ad7d01694d0&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Japan court to rule in trial of man charged with killing ex-PM Abe</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/japan-court-rule-trial-man-charged-with-killing-ex-pm-abe-2026-01-20/</link><description>TOKYO, Jan 21 (Reuters) - A Japanese court will on Wednesday deliver its verdict on a man accused of fatally shooting former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, three and a half years after the assassination of the country's longest-serving premier stunned the nation.

Tetsuya Yamagami, now 45, was arrested on the spot in July 2022 after fatally firing at Abe with a homemade gun while the former prime minister was delivering a campaign speech in the western city of Nara. Abe was 67.

Although he was no longer Japan's leader at the time, Abe remained a powerful and binding force within the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. His absence has left a vacuum within the party, which has since seen two leadership races and by extension, a revolving door of prime ministers.

Abe himself served as prime minister for a total of 3,188 days over two separate terms, stepping down in September 2020 citing health reasons.

His protegee Sanae Takaichi now leads Japan and the LDP, but the party's grip on power has considerably diminished.

Abe's killing also brought to light a deep link between his party and the Unification Church, an organisation many consider a cult. An in-party investigation found that more than a hundred lawmakers had dealings with the group, leading many voters to shun the LDP, which has ruled Japan for most of the post-war period.

Media have quoted Yamagami as telling the court that he held a grudge against the Unification Church after his mother's large donation to it caused financial hardship for their family, and that he took out his anger on Abe because the former prime minister had once sent a video message to an event held by a group affiliated with the church.

Founded in South Korea in 1954, the Unification Church is famous for its mass weddings and counts Japanese followers as a key source of income.

A guilty verdict is all but certain after Yamagami admitted to killing Abe in the first court hearing at the Nara District Court in October, and attention is on the severity of the sentence.

Prosecutors sought a life sentence last month, calling the act an "extremely grave incident that is unprecedented in post-war history".

Yamagami's lawyers, meanwhile, argued that the family's misfortune caused by the donation to the Unification Church should be taken into consideration and limit his prison term to 20 years at most.

While Abe was a divisive figure domestically, he was among the few global leaders to have a strong rapport with U.S. President Donald Trump.

As part of the move, which the Trump administration has communicated to some European capitals, the U.S. will eliminate roughly 200 positions from the NATO entities that oversee and plan the alliance's military and intelligence operations, said the sources, who requested anonymity to discuss private diplomatic conversations.

Among the bodies that will be affected, said the sources, are the UK-based NATO Intelligence Fusion Centre and the Allied Special Operations Forces Command in Brussels. Portugal-based STRIKFORNATO, which oversees some maritime operations, will also be cut, as will several other similar NATO entities, the sources said.

The sources did not specify why the U.S. had decided to cut the number of staff dedicated to the NATO roles, but the moves broadly align with the Trump administration's stated intention to shift more resources toward the Western Hemisphere.

The Washington Post first reported the decision.

The changes are small relative to the size of the U.S. military force stationed in Europe and do not necessarily signal a broader U.S. shift away from the continent. Around 80,000 military personnel are stationed in Europe, almost half of them in Germany.

But the moves are nonetheless likely to stoke European anxiety about the future of the alliance, which is already running high given U.S. President Donald Trump's stepped-up campaign to wrest Greenland away from Denmark, raising the unprecedented prospect of territorial aggression within NATO.

On Tuesday morning, the U.S. president, who is scheduled to fly to the World Economic Forum in Switzerland in the evening, shared another user's post on social media that identified NATO as a threat to the United States. The post described China and Russia as merely "boogeymen."

Asked for comment, a NATO official said changes to U.S. staffing are not unusual and that the U.S. presence in Europe is larger than it has been in years.

"NATO and U.S. authorities are in close contact about our overall posture – to ensure NATO retains our robust capacity to deter and defend," the NATO official said.

The White House and the Pentagon did not respond to requests for comment.

Reuters could not obtain a full list of NATO entities that will be affected by the new policy. About 400 U.S. personnel are stationed within the entities that will see cuts, one of the sources said, meaning the total number of Americans at the affected NATO bodies will be reduced by roughly half.

Rather than recalling servicemembers from their current posts, the U.S. will for the most part decline to backfill them as they move on from their positions, the sources said.

The drawdown comes as the alliance traverses one of the most diplomatically fraught moments in its 77-year history.

Trump famously threatened to withdraw from NATO during his first presidential term and said on the campaign trail that he would encourage Russian President Vladimir Putin to attack NATO members that did not pay their fair share on defense.

But he appeared to warm to NATO over the first half of 2025, effusively praising NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte and other European leaders after they agreed to boost defense spending at a June summit.

In recent weeks, however, his administration has again provoked alarm across Europe.

In early December, Pentagon officials told diplomats that the U.S. wants Europe to take over the majority of NATO's conventional defense capabilities, from intelligence to missiles, by 2027, a deadline that struck European officials as unrealistic.

A key U.S. national security document released shortly after called for the U.S. to dedicate more of its military resources to the Western Hemisphere, calling into question whether Europe will continue to be a priority theater for the U.S.

In the first weeks of 2026, Trump has revived his longstanding campaign to acquire Greenland, an overseas territory of Denmark, enraging officials in Copenhagen and throughout Europe, many of whom believe any territorial aggression within the alliance would mark the end of NATO.

Over the weekend, Trump said he would slap several NATO countries with tariffs starting February 1 due to their support for Denmark's sovereignty over the island. That has caused European Union officials to mull retaliatory tariffs of their own.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 22:25:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HS2QET6Y6JNCRDHJOGC2WDFL44.jpg?auth=d9fe88693e715a4f63c1d3504eb8f8daab7c382ec2a87c438692ca4bb6ecd1c9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump has a 'unique, sometimes strange affinity' with Vladimir Putin</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/trump-has-a-unique-sometimes-strange-affinity-with-vladimir-putin</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 22:26:39 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/eb8e9b02-f64a-11f0-a200-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260120-223119-224318-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Spain’s train crash death toll rises to 42, casts a shadow on world-class rail system</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260120-spain-s-train-crash-death-toll-rises-to-42-casts-a-shadow-on-world-class-rail-system</link><description>The deadly train wreck in southern Spain has cast a pall over one of the nation’s symbols of success.

Sunday's collision killed at least 42 people and injured dozens more, according to officials on Tuesday.

“It is undoubtably a hard blow, and I have to work so it doesn’t affect the credibility and strength of the network,” Spanish Transport Minister Oscar Puente told Spanish national radio RNE when asked about the knock to the reputation of the rail system.

On Tuesday night, a Barcelona commuter train crashed after a retaining wall fell onto the tracks, Spanish emergency services reported. Officials said 15 people were affected, but did not specify if they were injured. The incident happened just two days after the deadly collision in southern Spain.

Here's a look at the history of a rail network that became a crown jewel of contemporary Spain, by the numbers.

The time since Spain inaugurated its first high-speed AVE, which means “bird” in Spanish.

Both before and after that milestone, successive Spanish governments devoted tax revenues and European Union development aid to its high-speed rail network that quickly caught up with and surpassed high-speed pioneers Japan and France .

The first high-speed train to speed across Spain preceded the opening of the 1992 Summer Olympic Games in Barcelona by two months.

Both marked high points in Spain’s recent history after it emerged from the economic doldrums and cultural and political isolation of the 20th-century dictatorship of Gen. Francisco Franco .

The length, equal to 2,400 miles, of high-speed rail that Spain has laid over the past three-plus decades for its 49 million residents.

Only China — with 45,000 kilometers (28,000 miles) for its 1.4 billion people — has more high-speed track, according to the International Union of Railways.

Spain's commitment to high-speed rail, which the railway union defines as rails for trains going 250 kph (155 mph), has helped Spain shed its reputation of often being behind the industrial curve compared to other leading economies.

Spain’s train builders have been able to capitalize on its domestic expansion. A Spanish consortium built Saudi Arabia’s high-speed line connecting the holy cities of Mecca and Medina that opened service in 2018.

The approximate time a train trip took between Madrid and Barcelona before and after the 2008 adoption of high-speed rail.

On an old, slow train, the 600-kilometer (385-mile) journey between Spain’s biggest cities used to take around seven hours, meaning many business travelers opted to take a plane.

Now that trip can be done in 2½ hours, and Spain announced plans in November to modernize the Madrid-Barcelona line to allow trains to reach 350 kph (218 mph), matching the fastest Chinese trains. That would bring the transit time down to less than two hours.

The AVE has helped unite a country whose main population centers other than Madrid are located on its coasts, separated by some of the most sparsely populated areas in Europe.

Every region and provincial capital has pushed hard for its own high-speed line. Some critics say the administrations may have spent too much on questionable lines to the detriment of investing in local commuter lines, which suffer many more delays than high-speed rail does.

Missing out on an AVE line and stop has become synonymous with economic decline for a provincial city.

“The high-speed train has proven to be a catalyst for the nation’s society and economy,” Zacarias Grande, professor of civil engineering of the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya told The Associated Press.

“It has tightened links between Spain’s different regions over its three decades, significantly boosting business relations and their cultural, technological and professional development.”

The move away from air travel to rail also remains a key plank of Spain’s green energy and electrification plan to fight climate change .

The number of deadly crashes on a stretch of high-speed rail tracks in Spain’s history. One official described Sunday’s collision as transforming a train into a “mass of twisted metal.”

Spanish officials say they are still at a loss to understand what went wrong Sunday night when one high-speed train jumped the track and collided with another fast train going in the other direction.

Álvaro Fernández, the president of public train company Renfe, told Spanish public radio station RNE that both trains were traveling well under the speed limit and “human error could be ruled out.”

One of the two trains was operated by Renfe and another by a private company.

Spain’s worst train crash this century occurred in 2013, when 80 people died after a train derailed in the country’s northwest on a track that wasn't designed for high speeds. While the train itself was capable of high-speed travel, an investigation concluded that it was going 179 kph (111 mph) on a stretch with an 80 kph (50 mph) speed limit when it left the tracks.

The number of operators with high-speed trains in Spain.

Only recently did Spain open its rail network to private companies to compete against Renfe.

The first private company to get into Spain's high-speed rail market was the French-owned Ouigo in 2021. The Italian-owned Iryo followed in 2022.

It was an Iryo train that first derailed on Sunday, knocking the Renfe train off its track. Iryo has said that it's working with officials to determine the causes of the crash.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 22:26:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/f3b3b384-f646-11f0-b309-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26020623207379.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>How has Trump reshaped the White House?</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/how-has-trump-reshaped-the-white-house</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 22:26:44 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/d73e55ec-f641-11f0-8494-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260120-210313-211456-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'A lot of rosy rhetoric, but the jobs numbers are just not there for Trump'</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/a-lot-of-rosy-rhetoric-but-the-jobs-numbers-are-just-not-there-for-trump</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 22:26:47 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/bb6dd3c6-f63f-11f0-93c6-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260120-211851-212652-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Thousands protest against Trump immigration policies</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/thousands-protest-against-trump-immigration-policies-2026-01-20/</link><description>Jan 20 (Reuters) - Thousands of U.S. workers and students marched through cities and university campuses on Tuesday in opposition to the immigration policies of President Donald Trump.

On the first anniversary of Trump's second term, protests sprang up across the country against his aggressive immigration crackdown that prompted outrage after federal agents dragged a U.S. citizen from her car and shot dead activist Renee Good in Minneapolis in past weeks.

Hundreds of protesters gathered in Washington and smaller cities like Asheville, North Carolina, where demonstrators marched through the downtown shouting "No ICE, no KKK, no fascist USA," according to online videos.

The Trump administration says it has a mandate from voters to deport millions of immigrants in the country illegally. Recent polls show most Americans disapprove of the use of force by officers with Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other federal agencies.

University students demonstrated in Cleveland, Ohio, chanting "No hate, no fear, refugees are welcome here" while high schoolers in Santa Fe, New Mexico, left class to attend a "Stop ICE Terror" rally at the state capitol, according to protest organizers and school officials.

The actions were organized by left-leaning groups such as Indivisible and 50501, as well as labor unions and grassroots organizations opposed to immigrant detention camps, like one in El Paso, Texas, where three detainees have died in the last six weeks, according to federal authorities.

The demonstrations were set to roll west to cities such as San Francisco and Seattle, where afternoon and evening protests were planned.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 22:46:58 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/DD6WW5YG6ZIWLL4KIY3APILJ5Y.jpg?auth=6d6cbb910a2b326c2444c9e22c4de0e7d3745be4188ab18e8f8967ac68fdb32e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Severe weather in New Zealand's North Island prompts evacuations</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/severe-weather-new-zealands-north-island-prompts-evacuations-2026-01-20/</link><description>WELLINGTON, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Authorities urged evacuations in some low-lying areas of New Zealand's North Island on Wednesday and police searched for a missing man who was swept away in a river after continued heavy rain and strong winds triggered flooding, swollen rivers and landslides.

Local councils across the north asked residents in flood-prone areas to move to higher ground and others to prepare to evacuate if needed. Several roads were closed because of slips and flooding, the New Zealand Transport Agency said.

Images shared on news sites showed flooded farmland and surface water across roads.

Police said a man was missing after he was washed away with his vehicle during a river crossing near Warkworth earlier on Wednesday.

Emergency Management and Recovery Minister Mark Mitchell told Radio New Zealand he was most concerned about the Northland region, including the town of Oakura and surrounding areas.

"They're basically fully saturated in terms of the ground ... and we've got more coming," Mitchell said.

National forecaster MetService issued warnings for much of the top half of the North Island, saying there was a threat to life from dangerous river conditions, significant flooding and landslides, with travel disruption likely and some communities potentially isolated.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 23:23:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US military seizes seventh Venezuela-linked tanker amid Trump oil crackdown</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260120-us-military-venezuela-trump-oil</link><description>US military forces boarded and took control of a seventh oil tanker connected with Venezuela on Tuesday as part of the Trump administration's broader efforts to take control of the South American country's oil.

US Southern Command said in a social media post that US forces apprehended the Motor Vessel Sagitta “without incident” and that the tanker was operating in defiance of President Donald Trump ’s "established quarantine of sanctioned vessels in the Caribbean.”

The military command did not say whether the US Coast Guard took control of the tanker as has been the case in prior seizures. The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for more details. Southern Command said it had nothing to add to its post.

The Sagitta is a Liberian-flagged tanker and its registration says it is owned and managed by a company in Hong Kong. The ship last transmitted its location more than two months ago when exiting the Baltic Sea in northern Europe.

The tanker was sanctioned by the US Treasury Department under an executive order related to Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

The post from US Southern Command indicated the ship had taken oil from Venezuela. It said the capture of the tanker “demonstrates our resolve to ensure that the only oil leaving Venezuela will be oil that is coordinated properly and lawfully.”

The military command posted what appeared to be aerial footage of the Sagitta sailing on the ocean, but unlike in prior videos the clip did not show US forces flying toward it in helicopters or landing on the deck of the ship.

Since the US ouster of Venezuela President Nicolás Maduro in a surprise nighttime raid on Jan. 3, the Trump administration has set out to control the production, refining and global distribution of Venezuela’s oil products.

Officials in Trump’s Republican administration have made it clear they see seizing the tankers as a way to generate cash as they seek to rebuild Venezuela’s battered oil industry and restore its economy.

Trump met with executives from oil companies nearly two weeks ago to discuss his goal of investing $100 billion in Venezuela to repair and upgrade its oil production and distribution. He said at the time that the US expected to sell at least 30 million to 50 million barrels of Venezuelan oil.

Trump told reporters on Tuesday that the US already has taken 50 million barrels of oil out of Venezuela.

“We’ve got millions of barrels of oil left,” he said at the White House. “We’re selling it on the open market. We’re bringing down oil prices incredibly.”

The first tanker was seized off the coast of Venezuela on Dec. 10. Most of the other tankers also have been captured in the waters near Venezuela, with the exception of the Bella 1, which was captured in the North Atlantic.

The Bella 1 had been cruising across the Atlantic and nearing the Caribbean when on Dec. 15 it abruptly turned and headed north, toward Europe. The ship was ultimately captured on Jan. 8.

Speaking at the White House briefing room podium, Trump repeatedly veered off message. He mused about the Nile River being in Egypt, joked about renaming the Gulf of Mexico the Gulf of Trump, made demeaning comments about Somali Americans, complained about not getting enough credit for his record and professed admiration for the controversial Hells Angels motorcycle club. "They voted for me," Trump said.

The surprise appearance shortly before he was due to fly to Switzerland to join other world leaders at the World Economic Forum was meant to focus on Trump's achievements during his first year back in office.

But in an 81-minute opening monologue full of superlatives, he veered between self-congratulatory and defensive, and his core message was often lost. He then took questions from reporters for 24 minutes, for a total time behind the podium of one hour and 45 minutes.

Immigration and crime dominated Trump's remarks. He described U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, especially those currently involved in an immigration crackdown in Minnesota, as patriots and decried people protesting against them as paid agitators. A federal agent shot and killed a U.S. citizen there this month.

Trump this year has deployed the National Guard to Democratic-run cities, and he has threatened to deploy the regular military to Minnesota, moves that have drawn opposition from local officials. "To me a town, it looks better when you have military people," Trump said.

Without providing data, he also said Washington had less crime since National Guard troops arrived in the U.S. capital last summer. "Your lover's not going to be killed" walking through the city, Trump said.

In remarks that echoed a 2024 campaign speech, Trump repeated many talking points from the last election. He castigated his predecessor, Democrat Joe Biden, and again falsely claimed the 2020 presidential election was stolen from him.

Trump paged through a thick wad of printouts entitled "365 Wins in 365 Days," a compilation of what the administration cited as daily achievements since his second inauguration on January 20, 2025.

It pointed to accomplishments from drastically reducing the number of immigrants entering the country illegally to improving consumer choice for shower heads and toilets.

At one point, Trump took a large binder clip off the sheaf of papers and joked it could have taken his finger off, saying it had probably been meant to hurt him. "I wouldn't have shown the pain," he said.

He spent the first 15 minutes displaying mugshots of Minnesota residents who he said were in the country illegally and had been arrested for serious crimes. After he finished, he tossed the pictures onto the floor next to him.

Trump demonized Somali immigrants, calling them "very low IQ people" and repeated his false assertion that Somalia was not even a country. Trump has justified his Minnesota immigration crackdown partly as a response to fraud involving federal hunger programs by charities and organizations linked to the Somali community there.

Trump also reiterated his exaggerated claim that he has helped end eight foreign wars. He has repeatedly said that he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize, which he did not win in December, and has cited that omission as one reason for his push to acquire the Danish territory of Greenland.

He added on Tuesday he did not believe the Norwegian government's statement that it does not control the Nobel Foundation, which awards the prize.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 23:45:03 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4AG5SJULMJJHZF7BGVC2ZTKL5M.jpg?auth=f3b12cdfe5a775ce4c6f325af497a41521f6810a6e11b2fe3eb72bd7c353514b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Mexico sends 37 more cartel suspects to US amid rising tensions</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/mexico-sends-37-more-cartel-suspects-us-amid-rising-tensions-2026-01-20/</link><description>MEXICO CITY, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Mexico has sent another 37 alleged members of criminal organizations to the United States, Mexico's security minister said on Tuesday.

The handover of alleged cartel members is the third major transfer in the past year and brings the total number of transferred inmates to 92.

The latest swap occurred amid growing tension with Washington over cartel activity and repeated threats by U.S. President Donald Trump to attack cartels with or without Mexican involvement.

The recent set of prisoners was sought by the U.S. for their links with criminal organizations and because they presented public safety risks, Mexico's military authorities said in a statement.

"With this transfer, 92 high-impact criminals have now been sent to the U.S. during this administration, preventing them from generating violence in our country," Mexican Security Minister Omar Garcia Harfuch said on social media.

The inmates were flown to Washington, Houston, New York, Pennsylvania, San Antonio, and San Diego aboard seven Mexican Armed Forces aircraft.

Among them was Pedro Inzunza Noriega, the father of the second-in-command of the powerful Beltran Leyva cartel, who was arrested in December 2025 after the U.S. named him in its first terrorism indictment against a Mexican drug trafficker.

Mexican lawmakers and legal experts have disputed the political and legal grounds for the prisoner transfers.

They are occurring as Trump has increased pressure on Mexico over the cartels and the violence they cause, including his demands to deploy U.S. military forces against cartels within Mexican territory.

Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has ruled out U.S. military intervention to combat drug cartels, following what she called a good conversation with Trump on January 12.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio also spoke with Mexican Foreign Minister Juan Ramon de la Fuente in early January about the need for stronger cooperation to dismantle Mexico's violent narco-terrorist networks and stop fentanyl and weapons trafficking.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 23:46:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Chile’s Kast names future cabinet, taps Jorge Quiroz as finance minister</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/chiles-kast-names-future-cabinet-taps-jorge-quiroz-finance-minister-2026-01-21/</link><description>SANTIAGO, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Chile's President-elect Jose Antonio Kast on Tuesday appointed Jorge Quiroz as Finance Minister and named other members of his cabinet ahead of taking office on March 11.

Kast also named Daniel Mas as head of the mining ministry. Chile is the world's largest copper producer and second-largest lithium producer.

The incoming president had previously informed business leaders of his plans to appoint Quiroz.

Quiroz, who holds a doctorate from Duke University in the United States, was the principal advisor for Kast's economic program. Quiroz has said Chile's economy is facing a "decline" from which it can recover by addressing issues such as security, deregulation, reducing the corporate tax rate, and implementing fiscal adjustments—the latter being a point of contention during the presidential campaign.

Mas, a businessman and current vice president of the country's Confederation of Production and Commerce, has had a long career in the private sector, working in construction, real estate, and the financial services industries. He will simultaneously serve as Chile's minister of economic development.

Kast also appointed two attorneys who had previously defended Augusto Pinochet, the dictator who ruled Chile with an iron fist from 1973 to 1990.

Human rights groups and family members of people killed during the dictatorship criticized the nomination of Fernando Rabat when rumors of his appointment leaked. Rabat, who defended Pinochet in an illicit funds case, will now lead the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights, which is still overseeing cases linked to the dictatorship.

Defense minister Fernando Barros was also a vocal defender of Pinochet after he was detained in London in 1998, working to free the former dictator.

Kast also appointed Francisco Perez Mackenna as Minister of Foreign Affairs. For nearly three decades, Perez Mackenna led the business holdings of the billionaire Luksic family, one of Chile's richest families. Daniel Mas was named as head of the ministry responsible for economic development.

Trinidad Steinert, a chief prosecutor in the northern region of Tarapaca, will lead the Ministry of Public Security, a central role in fulfilling Kast's campaign promise to crack down on crime.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 01:50:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WU44OHJFCJKY7GAF34KN6LFH6Y.jpg?auth=9aa576d2a0ea9ebc5c68e22f917df9c032883032a78f38525907e57840f20435&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US troops could disobey questionable orders, Catholic archbishop says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us-troops-could-disobey-questionable-orders-catholic-archbishop-says-2026-01-20/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 20 (Reuters) - The Catholic archbishop overseeing the church's work with members of the U.S. military said it would be "morally acceptable" for troops to disobey orders that went against their consciences.

Archbishop Timothy Broglio said he was worried some members of the military could be put into situations where they are ordered to do something considered "morally questionable."

Broglio, who also heads the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, told BBC News on Sunday that "it would be morally acceptable to disobey that order but that's perhaps putting that individual in an untenable situation and that's my concern."

Broglio did not indicate what he considered a morally questionable order.

His comments come as President Donald Trump has sought to deploy troops onto the streets of U.S. cities and threatens possible military action to take control of Greenland.

The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Earlier this month, Trump told The New York Times he is constrained only by his "own morality."

The archbishop expressed concern over Trump's comments, suggesting that international law and one's own moral principles should go hand in hand.

He said it does not seem reasonable for the U.S. to attack and occupy Greenland, which is governed by Denmark, a NATO ally.

"It'd be one thing if the people of Greenland wanted to, wanted to be annexed, that would be one situation," Broglio said. "But taking it by force when we already have treaties there that allow for a military installation in Greenland? It doesn't seem necessary."

Broglio is the latest leader of the Catholic Church to raise concerns about Trump's demands. On Monday, three fellow archbishops decried the direction of U.S. foreign policy. Church leaders have also pushed back on the Trump administration's immigration agenda .

Six Democratic members of the U.S. Congress in a video last year reminded members of the military that it was their duty to reject unlawful orders, drawing reproach from the Trump administration, including a Pentagon decision to demote Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona from his rank of retired Navy captain.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 01:50:33 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4YYF2OEDLNLPFO3TRZRDHJUDRQ.jpg?auth=0a0059a15eb4f718e1f646eac530076279e56cb0efce2bfadef1fea4ecce2c61&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>New Zealand to hold general election on November 7</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/new-zealand-hold-general-election-november-7-2026-01-20/</link><description>WELLINGTON, Jan 21 (Reuters) - New Zealand’s prime minister Christopher Luxon said on Wednesday the country’s parliamentary elections will be held on Saturday November 7.

The conservative government, a coalition between the major centre-right National party and minority parties New Zealand First and ACT, has been in power since the 2023 election.

"Kiwis will have to weigh up who is best placed to provide stable and strong government in a very volatile and uncertain world, a strong economy with responsible spending, lower taxes and more opportunity for you and your family," Luxon told a press conference announcing the date.

Luxon, a former airline executive turned prime minister, has seen his popularity fall over the past year amid a weakening economy.

Current opinion polls indicate a tight contest with neither the ruling coalition nor the centre-left Labour Party led by former prime minister Chris Hipkins appearing to command majority support.

New Zealand has used a mixed-member proportional (MMP) system since 1996, and this has made coalitions the norm.

New Zealand's parliament has a three-year term and the last legal date that the next general election can be held is 19 December 2026.

For many voters, the economy remains their key concern with growth over the past two years soft, houses prices remaining well below their 2021 peak and unemployment sitting above 5%. The government will be banking on the economy continuing to improved this year following on from a 1.1% rise in the third quarter to reassure voters.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 01:50:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/2JHCCI5NLJIEXI3QTOKX7RRFDY.jpg?auth=719cc6fb97b3dc2441f64f6ea4b0c449aff4c435ae843242fd91395b4254532a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>South Korea's Lee plays down proposed US chip tariffs, warns of higher prices</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/south-koreas-lee-plays-down-proposed-us-chip-tariffs-warns-higher-prices-2026-01-21/</link><description>SEOUL, Jan 21 (Reuters) - South Korean President Lee Jae Myung said on Wednesday if Washington introduced higher U.S. tariffs on semiconductor imports, it would likely boost U.S. prices, playing down concerns about the proposed 100% duty.

U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has said that South Korean and Taiwanese chipmakers may face tariffs of up to 100% unless they commit to increased production on American soil.

Lee said that given South Korean and Taiwanese chipmakers' dominance of the market, a 100% U.S. import duty would likely sharply raise prices for chip products in the United States.

"They have a monopoly of 80 to 90% ... so most of it is likely to be passed on to U.S. prices," Lee told a news conference.

South Korea already has safeguards in place under a trade agreement with the U.S. to ensure its chipmakers would not be left at a disadvantage to Taiwanese or any other global competitors, Lee said.

South Korea’s exports hit a record high of $709.4 billion in 2025, up 3.8% from a year earlier, as semiconductor shipments jumped 22% on strong demand for artificial intelligence investments.

Chip exports to the U.S. accounted for 8% of the total $173.4 billion semiconductor exports, while China remained the biggest market, followed by Taiwan and Vietnam.

Lee also touched on the slumping won in his remarks, citing expectations by South Korean authorities that the currency would strengthen to around the 1,400 per dollar level in a month or two.

The president noted, however, that domestic policies alone would not be sufficient to stabilise foreign exchange markets, as it was somewhat correlated with weakness in the Japanese yen , adding that the won was faring comparably better.

Lee said he was pursuing diplomatic efforts to enable North Korea and the U.S. to resume dialogue and that a pragmatic approach was needed to deal with Pyongyang, which was continuing to stockpile nuclear arms.

"There is a benefit to making the North stop making nuclear materials and not export nukes and stop developing ICBMs," he said, referring to intercontinental ballistic missiles, adding it would be hard to imagine the North would actually give up its nuclear weapons programme.

North Korea has so far snubbed outreach by Lee and U.S. President Donald Trump to resume dialogue. The talks have stalled since Trump met the North's leader Kim Jong Un in 2019, amid disagreement over lifting sanctions against Pyongyang and nuclear dismantlement.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 03:44:43 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CP63YJFHCVMPVDD4JCWHVNOJWQ.jpg?auth=0870d2be13c0ad3e1d3acacfc5e72f98ba783f46920c4f0347ef7343f58ebdd7&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump says he had a 'very good call' with Turkish President Erdogan</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-says-he-had-very-good-call-with-turkish-president-erdogan-2026-01-21/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 20 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday he had a "very good call" with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, without elaborating.

On the first anniversary of Trump's second term, protests sprang up across the country against his aggressive immigration crackdown that prompted outrage after federal agents dragged a US citizen from her car and shot dead 37-year-old mother Renee Good in Minneapolis in past weeks.

Hundreds of New Yorkers braved the numbing cold and gathered outside Trump Tower in Manhattan shouting slogans like “We won’t stand for fascism” and singing the Woody Guthrie ballad “This Land Is Your Land.”

There were also protests in Washington and smaller cities like Asheville, North Carolina, where demonstrators marched through the downtown shouting "No ICE, no KKK, no fascist USA," according to online videos.

The Trump administration says it has a mandate from voters to deport millions of immigrants in the country illegally.

Recent polls show most Americans disapprove of the use of force by officers with Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other federal agencies.

University students demonstrated in Cleveland, Ohio, chanting "No hate, no fear, refugees are welcome here" while high schoolers in Santa Fe, New Mexico, left class to attend a "Stop ICE Terror" rally at the state capitol, according to protest organisers and school officials.

The actions were organized by left-leaning groups such as Indivisible and 50501, as well as labor unions and grassroots organisations opposed to immigrant detention camps, like one in El Paso, Texas, where three detainees have died in the last six weeks, according to federal authorities.

The demonstrations were set to roll west to cities such as San Francisco and Seattle, where afternoon and evening protests were planned.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 03:45:12 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/f8e33916-f672-11f0-b67c-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26020831615203.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuela to use US-brokered oil sale to boost battered currency</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260121-venezuela-us-oil-sale-currency</link><description>Venezuela said Tuesday it would start using revenues from a US-brokered oil sale to shore up its battered currency, as families waited in anguish for more prisoners to be released.

Interim president Delcy Rodriguez confirmed that her country had received $300 million from Washington's sale of Venezuelan crude and said she would use it to prop up the bolivar against the dollar.

The dollar is Venezuela's de facto currency, legalised by ousted leader Nicolas Maduro in 2019 to fight hyper inflation .

A six-year-old US embargo on Venezuelan oil has led to a shortage of greenbacks, however, causing the dollar's value to rocket.

On the black market, dollars have traded recently for up to 100 percent more than the official rate.

Rodriguez, who succeeded Maduro after his capture by US forces in a bombing raid on Caracas on January 3, said the new oil revenues would be used to "stabilise" the foreign exchange market.

She added that doing so would help "protect the income and purchasing power of our workers."

US President Donald Trump backed Maduro's former deputy Rodriguez to lead the country, provided she gives US oil majors access to Venezuela's rich oil reserves.

Rodriguez has been trying to appease him without alienating pro-Maduro hardliners in her administration.

On Monday, parliament, which is controlled by her brother Jorge Rodriguez, announced plans to reform 29 laws, including on foreign investment in the oil sector.

Currently, foreign companies are only allowed to operate in joint ventures with state-owned oil firm PDVSA, which insists on holding a majority.

"Foreign investment needs to be protected and profitable," Jorge Rodriguez argued.

In a signal of the government's intent to work with US oil companies, Delcy Rodriguez on Monday appointed a US-educated banker to head the country's main investment agency.

Calixto Ortega, a former head of the country's central bank, was previously posted as a diplomat to Houston, the city at the center of the US oil refining industry.

Ortega replaced Alex Saab , a Colombian-born Venezuelan seen as a frontman for Maduro, who was sacked as industry minister last week.

Trump claims that Washington effectively runs Venezuela since Maduro was snatched from his hideout on a Caracas military base and whisked to a New York jail.

He picked Rodriguez over popular opposition leader, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Maria Corina Machado, to lead the country's transition.

On Tuesday, the Republican leader said he was still in talks with Machado, who presented him with her Nobel medal -- which he openly coveted -- at the White House last week.

"Maybe we can get her involved in some way. I'd love to be able to do that," he told reporters in Washington.

Machado, who is still touring the US capital, insisted Tuesday there could be no real change in Venezuela until all political prisoners are released.

Rodriguez has begun to slowly release some of the estimated 800 political prisoners languishing in the country's penitentiaries.

Several key Maduro opponents still remain behind bars, however.

On Tuesday, the families of 200 prisoners demonstrated outside the prosecutor's office in Caracas to demand proof of life of their loved ones.

Nancy Quinones told AFP she had gone without news of her son, serving a 24-year sentence for his alleged role in a coup attempt, for five months and 18 days.

"Where are they?" one of the placards waved by the demonstrators read.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 03:45:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/77e71f94-ed6c-11f0-9830-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26008705848391.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Live: Trump heads for Davos maelstrom over Greenland</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260121-live-trump-heads-for-davos-maelstrom-over-greenland</link><description>US President Donald Trump descends on Davos for a showdown with European leaders Wednesday as his bid to seize Greenland threatens to tear the transatlantic alliance apart.

Abe, one of Japan’s most influential politicians, was serving as a regular lawmaker after leaving the prime minister's job when he was killed in 2022 while campaigning in the western city of Nara. It shocked a nation with strict gun control.

Tetsuya Yamagami, 45, pleaded guilty to murder in the trial that started in October, and Wednesday’s ruling will determine how long he'll spend in prison.

Yamagami said he killed Abe after seeing a video message the former leader sent to a group affiliated with the Unification Church. He added that his goal was to hurt the church, which he hated, and expose its ties with Abe.

Prosecutors have demanded life imprisonment for Yamagami, while his lawyers have sought a sentence of no more than 20 years, speaking of his troubles as the child of a church adherent.

The revelation of close ties between the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and the church caused the party to pull back from the church. It also prompted investigations that ended with the church's Japanese branch being stripped of its tax-exempt religious status and ordered dissolved.

The killing has also led to officials working to increase police protection of dignitaries.

Abe was shot on July 8, 2022, while giving a speech outside a train station in Nara. In footage captured by television cameras, two gunshots ring out as the politician raises his fist. He collapses holding his chest, his shirt smeared with blood. Officials say Abe died almost instantly.

Yamagami was captured on the spot. He said he initially planned to kill the leader of the Unification Church, but switched targets to Abe because of the difficulty of getting close to the leader.

Yamagami’s case has also brought attention to the children of Unification Church adherents in Japan, and influenced a law meant to restrict malicious donation solicitations by religious and other groups.

Thousands of people have signed a petition requesting leniency for Yamagami, and others have sent care packages to his relatives and the detention center where he's being housed.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 04:48:42 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/b62f178c-9399-11ed-8787-005056a90321/w:1280/p:16x9/AP23013080896870.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>How an Islamist party is gaining ground in Bangladesh, worrying moderates</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/how-an-islamist-party-is-gaining-ground-bangladesh-worrying-moderates-2026-01-21/</link><description>DHAKA, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Long vilified for opposing independence and barred from electoral politics for over a decade, Bangladesh's biggest Islamist party is reinventing itself and attracting new support ahead of parliamentary polls next month, unsettling moderates and minority communities.

Jamaat-e-Islami began its overhaul soon after a youth-led uprising in the Muslim-majority nation of 175 million people toppled Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in August 2024. With Hasina’s Awami League banned , Jamaat is betting on its anti-corruption image, welfare outreach, and what analysts describe as a more inclusive public stance to deliver the party's best-ever performance.

A December opinion poll by the U.S.-based International Republican Institute ranked Jamaat as the most "liked" party and projected a tight race with the Bangladesh Nationalist Party for the top spot in the February 12 election.

"We started welfare politics, not reactionary politics," Jamaat chief Shafiqur Rahman told Reuters, citing its medical camp initiatives, flood relief and aid for families of those killed in the uprising. The UN says as many as 1,400 people lost their lives in the protests.

"The constructive politics, which Jamaat and its associates ... are doing now, people will put their trust and belief in Jamaat-e-Islami," Rahman said.

The party has its origins in the pan-Islamist Jamaat-e-Islami movement, which emerged in India in the early 1940s and called for a society governed by Islamic principles. Jamaat opposed Bangladesh's independence, and during Hasina's rule many of its leaders were executed or jailed in a war crimes tribunal that was criticised by international human rights groups. In 2013, it was barred from elections after a court ruled its charter was in conflict with Bangladesh's secular constitution.

The electoral ban was lifted last year and Jamaat's student wing swept the Dhaka University polls, beating the Gen-Z National Citizen Party formed by leaders of the anti-Hasina movement.

Months later it formed an electoral alliance with the NCP, which some analysts say could help soften Jamaat’s image.

"We want something new and the new option is Jamaat," said Mohammad Jalal, 40, who sells coconut water from a mobile van in a crowded Dhaka market. "They have a clean image and work for the country."

Political analyst and theologian Shafi Md. Mostafa said the party’s shift from a “stigmatised force with limited space” to a “rehabilitated, pragmatic contender” had been helped by public anger over abuses during Hasina's rule.

"The authoritarian tendencies of the Awami League have created widespread frustration, allowing Jamaat to revive its rallying cry of ‘Islam as a solution’ and present itself as a moral alternative,” Mostafa said.

For the first time, Jamaat has nominated a Hindu candidate, and spoken out against recent attacks on minorities. On its website, the party says it wants Bangladesh to be a democracy guided by Islamic principles.

Party leaders have also publicly assured women of equal rights though Jamaat has not named any women as candidates for the 300 parliamentary seats. Rahman said women could gain representation through the 50 seats to be allocated by proportional representation after the election.

Shireen Huq of women's activist organisation Naripokkho said the promises were “an electoral ploy.”

“No matter what they say now, they will return to their dogma, which includes restrictions on women in every sphere,” she said.

Umama Fatema, a 26-year-old student activist who was at the forefront of the uprising, is also sceptical.

“One day they talk about women empowerment, but the next the party will talk about five-hour workdays for women,” she said, referring to the Jamaat chief's suggestion that women work only five hours a day so they can look after their families.

Since Hasina’s exit, Islamist groups have become increasingly emboldened. Hindu and Sufi shrines have been attacked , while events deemed un-Islamic have been targeted, from performances by spiritual folk musicians to women’s football matches.

The interim government has condemned the incidents, pledging “zero tolerance” from law enforcement and promising to protect minorities.

Hindus are the largest minority in Bangladesh, making up about 8% of the population, followed by much smaller numbers of Buddhists and Christians.

"Minorities have never had real protection under any government, but the fear and insecurity we now face is unprecedented," said a minority community leader, requesting anonymity for fear of reprisals.

"If a Jamaat-led coalition comes to power, there is a real risk that Bangladesh will move towards a full-fledged Islamic republic. Today, I fear for my life, and I fear that minorities in Bangladesh may not have a secure future," he added.

Jamaat spokesperson Ahsanul Mahboob Zubair said the party had "never been involved in, nor has it ever supported, any acts of violence or intolerance in the name of religion", and called for an investigation.

Jamaat, which was a junior coalition partner in the BNP-led government from 2001 to 2006, has formed electoral alliances with most of the country’s other Islamist parties, some more conservative.

It began shortlisting election candidates early last year, hiring an international agency to assess voter sentiment.

Last week, Jamaat said it would contest 179 seats, with 74 distributed among the NCP and other allies. A further 47 seats are still to be shared after one party pulled out of the alliance.

"Jamaat approached me in April,” said Mir Ahmad bin Quasem, the son of a Jamaat leader who was hanged for war crimes during Hasina's rule and who spent eight years in secret detention before his release in August 2024.

“They showed me data suggesting people across the country were fed up with the old parties and wanted change. They believed there was a real opportunity — and I joined."

Some say a Jamaat government might also move closer to Pakistan, marking a departure from Hasina’s era when India was the country’s most important bilateral partner. Rahman said that the party was not inclined towards any country.

“We maintain relations in a balanced way with all. We are never interested in leaning towards any one country. Rather, we respect all and want balanced relations among nations," he said.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:54:22 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LLTTBAPX5ZPW7JS6VPDG66OY4E.jpg?auth=1b7e31b43f5b3e0db356f5180c52cc4c96037a9da68b6afd2dd0e34a8aa509b2&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Surging in polls, Thailand's reformist opposition tests new election playbook</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/surging-polls-thailands-reformist-opposition-tests-new-election-playbook-2026-01-21/</link><description>BANGKOK, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Three years ago, a party of reform-minded progressives swept Thailand's election in the wake of mass anti-establishment protests only to be blocked from taking power and forced to disband.

Now reborn as the People's Party, Thai voters are once again backing the progressives' promises of change, making the party the clear frontrunner for the February 8 polls , ahead of rivals that joined forces against its predecessor after the last election in 2023.

Two surveys released in mid-January showed the People's Party and its prime ministerial candidate as the overwhelming favourites, trouncing the ruling Bhumjaithai party and the populist Pheu Thai, which led a previous ruling coalition.

"We are at the best position we've ever been in," Deputy Leader Rangsiman Rome told Reuters, saying its detailed policy proposals were pulling in support alongside efforts to woo the undecided.

"For those that accused us of not being ready to run the country, we are showing them the opposite: that we have the team."

The People's Party will need to win at least 250 of the 500 seats in parliament in order to secure a clear majority.

It is currently at 30% to 34% in most opinion polls, so even if the momentum carries the party to victory, its ability to govern may still be stymied by its rivals.

A surge in nationalism following a fierce border conflict with Cambodia is providing ammunition to the campaigns of Thailand's conservatives, who are using the dispute to attack the People's Party agenda.

The party also faces potential legal action from an anti-graft agency that could suspend dozens of its members and ban them from politics for attempting to amend Thailand's royal insult law in 2021.

The groundwork for the People's Party popularity has been carefully engineered, particularly after the progressives' anti-establishment stance left its forerunner unable to form a government despite winning the last general election .

Move Forward picked up 151 seats in parliament in 2023 on a platform that included reforming the royalist military and breaking up business monopolies.

But a military-appointed Senate blocked its prime ministerial candidate in a parliamentary vote, opening the way for Pheu Thai to govern Southeast Asia's second-largest economy.

It was another round in the decades-long tussle between popular political movements and Thailand's conservative establishment, backed by the military, that has triggered bouts of instability, including violent protests and coups.

Around a year after the election, a Thai court ordered the dissolution of Move Forward, ruling that its campaign to amend a law that protects the monarchy from criticism risked undermining the democratic system.

Within hours of the ruling, its leaders announced they had formed the People's Party.

This time around the progressives appear to be moderating their position, including dropping their call to amend the royal insult law and softening their stance on the military.

Four People's Party members told Reuters that its campaign would double down on promoting detailed governance plans and a new team of experienced professionals.

"We think that it could help restore people's faith and trust in the People's Party," one of them said.

But the strategy of bringing in outside talent has caused upset within the grouping.

Kalyapat Rachitroj, a former lawmaker, resigned from the party earlier this month, arguing that the appointment of outsiders meant long-term members were overlooked.

"You can bring in hundreds more technocrats, professors, PhDs, and elites, but none of them are worth as much as a single idealist who has to leave," she wrote on social media.

The People's Party unveiled its team of experts on January 11, presenting them as potential cabinet ministers, alongside their slate of prime ministerial candidates including leader Natthaphong Ruengpanyawut and key economic strategist Sirikanya Tansakun.

Among the new inductees were former Thai envoy to the U.S. Pisan Manawapat, former law dean at Bangkok's Thammasat University Munin Pongsapan and Peangpanor Boonklum, a veteran corporate lawyer and former PTT (PTT.BK) , opens new tab executive.

"The move allows the party to present their own alternative to Bhumjaithai's team of technocrats, which could help the party pull wavering voters, especially middle-class urbanites," said independent analyst Mathis Lohatepanont.

Bhumjaithai, led by Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul, has named career diplomat and current Foreign Minister Sihasak Phuangketkeow as one of its prime ministerial candidates.

If it returns to power, the ruling party has said business executive Suphajee Suthumpun and former bureaucrat Ekniti Nitithanprapas will continue as commerce and finance ministers.

Although it is still too early to gauge the overall impact of the People's Party's new strategy, the softening of its position on contentious issues gives it more elbow room after the votes are counted, said Lohatepanont.

"This could be seen as both an election strategy to broaden the base and also as a way to ensure that their options are kept as open as possible in forming a government," he said.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:54:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/RCH3BDQD2FIHTHAA4HYJ2KMZGE.jpg?auth=30689fe55d212b51a387d635fc5c967af4418c15162c75c28a52b177843f0e75&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>South Korea court finds ex-PM Han Duck-soo guilty of key action of insurrection over martial law</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/south-korea-court-finds-ex-pm-han-duck-soo-guilty-key-action-insurrection-over-2026-01-21/</link><description>SEOUL, Jan 21 (Reuters) - A South Korean court on Wednesday found former Prime Minister Han Duck-soo guilty of engaging in a key action of insurrection concerning ex-President Yoon Suk Yeol's short-lived declaration of martial law in December 2024.

Campaigning begins on Thursday for Bangladesh's election, which has sparked protests and counter-protests . Ties between the South Asian neighbours soured after former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fled to India in 2024, following deadly protests.

India's withdrawal move was part of "internal readjustments", the official said, without elaborating. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, pointed to Indian media reports of New Delhi's decision.

It was not immediately clear when the families would return.

The foreign ministries of India and Bangladesh did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

In December, India summoned Bangladesh's high commissioner, or ambassador to voice its concern over what it called a deteriorating security situation there, particularly threats targeting the Indian mission in the capital, Dhaka.

The interim government led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus has repeatedly sought Hasina's extradition to Bangladesh, while rejecting New Delhi's concerns over violence targeting members of the minority Hindu community .</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:55:43 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/U7DJCAQO4BJTZLTI7PWC4RAFKE.jpg?auth=da6e3a3cfb88e4cba9df248517cd28f556f931c0ad67f672352ce4809aae84eb&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Thailand's election in numbers</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/thailands-election-numbers-2026-01-21/</link><description>BANGKOK, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Thailand will hold a general election on February 8 in a showdown between three big parties that could lead to its fourth prime minister in less than three years.

Trump, who marked the end of his turbulent first year in office on Tuesday, is expected to overshadow the annual gathering that global elites use to discuss economic trends in the snowy Alpine resort of Davos.

Trump told a news conference on Tuesday that he would have meetings about the Danish territory of Greenland in Davos and was optimistic that an agreement could eventually be made.

"I think we will work something out where NATO is going to be very happy and where we're going to be very happy. But we need it for security purposes. We need it for national security," he said.

Asked how far he is willing to go to acquire Greenland, Trump offered a cryptic response. "You'll find out," he said.

In the days leading up to his visit to Davos, Trump has been unrelenting in making his case that "we need Greenland" as an Arctic security guardpost against Russia and China, and he has threatened a trade war with Europeans who oppose him.

Emboldened by his ousting of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and seizing control of that country's oil, Trump has talked of acting against Cuba and Colombia as well as Iran. He has not ruled out the use of the U.S. military to snatch Greenland, which has an American military base.

Sources familiar with the situation have previously told Reuters that Trump's push on Greenland is related to a legacy-building desire to expand the territory of the United States in the biggest way since 1959. That was when two U.S. territories - Alaska and Hawaii - became the 49th and 50th U.S. states under Republican President Dwight Eisenhower.

NATO leaders have warned that Trump's Greenland strategy could upend the alliance. Trump has linked Greenland to his anger at not receiving a Nobel Peace Prize.

In a breach of diplomatic protocol, Trump released the text of a private message he received from French President Emmanuel Macron in which Macron urged Trump to join him and other G7 leaders in Paris after Davos, an idea Trump dismissed. "I do not understand what you are doing on Greenland," wrote Macron.

Leaders of Denmark and Greenland have offered a wide array of ways for a greater U.S. presence on the strategic island but this has not placated Trump, who posted on social media on Tuesday a doctored image showing him planting an American flag on the territory of 57,000 people.

Trump's original purpose for going to Davos was to talk up the strength of the U.S. economy.

He is giving a keynote address on Wednesday that he said he would use to discuss economic successes at home, despite opinion polls showing Americans are broadly unhappy with his handling of the economy. The White House said he would address the rising cost of housing with a plan to let Americans use money in their 401(k) retirement savings plans for down payments on homes.

"President Trump will unveil initiatives to drive down housing costs, tout his economic agenda that has propelled the United States to lead the world in economic growth, and emphasize that the United States and Europe must leave behind economic stagnation and the policies that caused it," a White House official said.

During his stay, Trump plans to have separate meetings with the leaders of Switzerland, Poland and Egypt, the White House said.

On Thursday, Trump is due to preside over a ceremony celebrating the Board of Peace, a group he formed that is aimed at redeveloping Gaza amid a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.

Trump has drawn some worries by saying the Board of Peace may work on global crises beyond Gaza, a role traditionally performed by the United Nations.

Trump told a news conference on Tuesday he likes the United Nations but it has "never lived up to its potential."

He returns to Washington late on Thursday.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 06:37:48 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/3F6HLJ6NFNL7VN6FRO636N5X2I.jpg?auth=2e9ee1995f2d438ba84efe502dfc99fcfb9ba6700a8b5d24ea99b57abd26d1dd&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Azerbaijan says it agreed to join Trump's 'Board of Peace'</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/azerbaijan-says-it-agreed-join-trumps-board-peace-2026-01-21/</link><description>MOSCOW, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Azerbaijan said on on Wednesday that it had accepted an invitation from U.S. President Donald Trump to join his "Board of Peace".

He also offered a solution: himself.

"Our democracy will not survive if we leave it to corrupt officials, conspirators and extremists," he said in a televised speech. "Your trust obliges me to protect the state, the institutions and our future."

Radev, a former air force commander, has waited years for this moment. Since a political crisis erupted in 2020, he has sat above the parliamentary mess, appointing caretaker governments when needed, and gradually amassing influence as the Balkan country's ceremonial head of state.

Now, with polls showing him to be Bulgaria's most popular politician, he is widely expected to form a new party and run in parliamentary elections this spring.

Radev has not announced his intention to run yet, but the timing appears to be in his favour.

Popular protests against corruption and a budget that proposed higher taxes ousted the last government in December, and voters are increasingly sick of a small elite of politicians who have dominated for years. These include former Prime Minister Boyko Borissov, who runs the leading GERB party, and oligarch Delyan Peevski, who is under U.S. and UK sanctions for corruption.

Still, he faces a massive challenge to turn around the fortunes of one of the European Union's poorest and most corrupt members, where prosecutors allege that hundreds of millions of euros in European funds have been diverted into the pockets of businessmen and officials, public tenders have been fixed, and people have become so disillusioned that most don't bother to vote.

Turnout dropped from nearly 50% in April 2021 to below 35% in a snap election in June 2024.

The challenge extends to Radev's own personal image. He will face questions about his pro-Kremlin stance on the war in Ukraine , his scepticism on the euro, and even an allegedly damaging energy deal signed by a government he appointed.

"Radev offers the possibility of change to Bulgarian society, but also predictability – this is a perfect recipe," said Parvan Simeonov, the founder of Myara, a Bulgarian polling agency. "However, there are issues and questions that should be answered."

Radev was voted in as president in 2016 after a military career and training in the United States. In his first term, he became a critic of then Prime Minister Borissov, who was under pressure from corruption allegations.

When police raided Radev's offices in 2020, Bulgarians saw the move as a hit job and it triggered the largest demonstrations since Bulgaria joined the EU in 2007. Months-long protests called for an end to graft, more accountability, and for the government to step down. Radev, meanwhile, was reelected for a second term in 2021.

The protests saw an end to Borissov's tenure, but what followed was a political crisis in which weak coalitions struggled to last just a few months. The elections this spring will be the eighth in four years.

Graft continues: last year alone, the European Public Prosecutor’s Office said it opened 97 investigations in Bulgaria with damages totalling nearly 500 million euros.

Critics say Radev is partly to blame for questionable dealings done by interim governments that he appointed. This includes a 2023 gas deal between Turkish state gas company Botas and Bulgaria's Bulgargaz that led to losses and an investigation .

Radev is popular but not enough to win an outright majority, analysts said.

Many point to a possible marriage with the reformist PP-DB party which has also been outspoken against corruption. Still, the party does not agree with Radev's soft stance towards Russia, or on his reluctance to join the eurozone, which Bulgaria did on January 1.

Radev will also have to clarify his stance on Ukraine after a series of Kremlin-friendly statements in recent years. He clashed with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy during a meeting in 2023 when he said that military aid to Kyiv would only prolong the conflict.

"God forbid such a tragedy happens (here) and you are in my place," Zelenskiy said on live TV. "Are you going to say "Putin, take over Bulgarian territories?""</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 07:30:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/RKH4X7OLEVLSBMYCA7473G5LRY.jpg?auth=9a08db481989bc5499214420cc06b3dbc3e746e84278e4f0e999a4f28d71031b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia says fire put out at Afipsky oil refinery after Ukrainian drone attack</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/russia-says-fire-put-out-afipsky-oil-refinery-after-ukrainian-drone-attack-2026-01-21/</link><description>MOSCOW, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Ukrainian drone fragments ignited a fire at the Afipsky oil refinery in Russia's southern Krasnodar region, but nobody was hurt, there was no damage, and the fire is now out, a local emergencies centre said early on Wednesday.

The refinery, which has been frequently attacked by Ukrainian drones in recent months as part of Kyiv's campaign to degrade Russia's vast energy infrastructure, is mostly focused on exports. It processed 7.2 million metric tons of crude oil (144,000 barrels per day) in 2024.

Moscow has stepped up its own winter campaign against Ukraine's battered energy system while continuing to grind forward on the battlefield.

Separately, Ukrainian drones struck various towns in southern Russia, injuring 11 people and prompting the evacuation of several residents, local officials said on Wednesday.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 07:30:39 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China says it has handled UK embassy planning in line with laws</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-says-it-has-handled-uk-embassy-planning-line-with-laws-2026-01-21/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 07:55:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>EU lawmakers to vote on whether to launch legal challenge to Mercosur trade deal</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/eu-lawmakers-vote-whether-launch-legal-challenge-mercosur-trade-deal-2026-01-21/</link><description>BRUSSELS, Jan 21 (Reuters) - EU lawmakers will vote on Wednesday on whether to challenge the European Union's contentious free trade agreement with South America in the bloc's top court, a move that could delay the deal by two years and potentially derail it.

The European Union signed its largest-ever trade pact with Mercosur members Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay on Saturday. The agreement now requires approval before it can take effect.

Opponents, led by France - the EU's largest agricultural producer - say the deal will sharply increase imports of cheap beef, sugar and poultry, undercutting domestic farmers who have staged repeated protests .

A group of 144 lawmakers has lodged a legal challenge asking the EU Court of Justice to rule on whether the agreement can be applied before full ratification by all member states and whether its provisions restrict the EU's ability to set environmental and consumer health policies. The court typically takes around two years to deliver such opinions.

If referred to the court, the EU could still apply the pact provisionally pending the ruling and parliamentary approval. But doing so could prove politically difficult given the likely backlash, and the European Parliament would retain the power to annul it later.

The vote in parliament is due to take place at 1130 GMT.

Supporters including Germany and Spain point to U.S. President Donald Trump's disruption of global trade. They argue the deal is essential to offset business lost to U.S. tariffs and to reduce reliance on China by securing access to critical minerals. They also warn that Mercosur governments are losing patience with the EU after years of negotiations.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 09:35:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WVA3FOZJIBLW3L44S3OQNOXK4Y.jpg?auth=35ddf49f15298f28a07f6d8e6781b6c2cc362ec2ccad44c5c55b66731d4112fc&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Hungary's Orban throws restaurants $304 mln lifeline ahead of election</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/hungarys-orban-throws-restaurants-304-mln-lifeline-ahead-election-2026-01-21/</link><description>BUDAPEST, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government announced on Wednesday a 100 billion forint ($304.42 million) package to shore up the restaurant industry as the veteran leader faces an uphill battle to revive the economy ahead of an April election.

Orban, whose right-wing Fidesz trails opposition challenger Tisza based on most fresh surveys, has also flagged a possible extension of energy price subsidies to help Hungarians cope with rising heating bills amid freezing temperatures.

An autumn Eurobarometer survey showed the rising cost of living topped Hungarians' domestic concerns - despite inflation retreating from highs above 25% in early 2023 to the central bank's 2% to 4% tolerance band in November.

Orban's government will provide liquidity support to restaurants, halve a tourism tax and waive a levy on entertainment spending for companies worth up to 1% of their annual turnover, financial news website portfolio.hu reported, citing Economy Minister Marton Nagy at a briefing.

Nearly 10,000 restaurants will also be allowed to treat up to a fifth of their revenue as a service fee, reducing their tax bill. The government hopes the measure will shore up the finances of restaurants, a sector strongly exposed to hikes in the minimum wage, which rose by 11% at the start of 2026.

Some analysts have warned that after strong wage growth in recent years, a weak economy and surging energy costs could make it harder for companies to finance the rise in the minimum wage.

Orban has also announced large-scale tax cuts for families, wage hikes, food vouchers for pensioners, a pension top-up to be paid in February and a subsidised housing loan programme to shore up his support.

His government is expected to decide on changes to energy price subsidies at a meeting later on Wednesday.

Fitch Ratings late last year cut Hungary's outlook to negative on Orban's pre-election spending initiatives.

U.S. President Donald Trump 's ambition to wrest sovereignty over Greenland from Denmark has rattled NATO members and prompted a rethink of Europe's traditional security dependence on the United States.

Asked if Beijing welcomed the "chaos" over Greenland, Guo Jiakun, a spokesperson of the Chinese foreign ministry, told a regular news briefing, "We have no intention of competing for influence with any country, nor would we ever do so."

Trump has also threatened to rain trade tariffs on Europe if it resists his demand to acquire the Arctic island.

The EU's foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, cautioned that transatlantic tariffs would play into the hands of China and Russia, both of which would benefit from "divisions among allies".

"We engage in friendly exchanges with all nations on the basis of mutual respect and equality, and remain committed to being a positive, stabilising and constructive force," Guo said.

Yet Chinese state media did not hold back comments this week, urging Europe to reassess its dependence on the United States for security.

Europe has grown excessively dependent on the United States while sidelining cooperation with partners such as China and Russia, the Global Times tabloid backed by the ruling Communist Party said in an editorial.

"The situation underscores the necessity for Europe to review the nature of transatlantic relations and reduce its reliance on the United States as a pillar of support for its security," an editorial in the state-run China Daily added.

The Greenland crisis is a call for Europe to bolster strategic autonomy and diversify partnerships, it said.

"By doing so, Europe can ensure that its future is not dictated by the diktats of a bully, but is instead shaped by its collective interests."</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 09:35:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7UJFVO6VCNPO3CVMNUCNIY7SX4.jpg?auth=1cad24c143ee683e80e640893c21e142e20dd2131ca838cac95ddaa93f8b7ad5&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>EU is at a crossroads towards more independence, von der Leyen says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/eu-is-crossroads-towards-more-independence-von-der-leyen-says-2026-01-21/</link><description>STRASBOURG, France, Jan 21 (Reuters) - The EU needs to speed up its push for independence to defend itself in a fast-changing world, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Wednesday.

"We are at a crossroads. Europe prefers dialogue and solutions – but we are fully prepared to act, if necessary, with unity, urgency and determination," von der Leyen said in a speech in European Parliament.

"In this increasingly lawless world, Europe needs its own levers of power," she said.

"We know them: A strong economy, a thriving single market and industrial base, a strong innovation and technology capacity, united societies and above a real capacity to defend ourselves."

Von der Leyen said it was "more important than ever" to keep focusing on Ukraine, while the EU would work with the US and other partners to strengthen security in the Arctic region.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 09:35:44 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LCQPRDCNFJP65EAVEQXL4IYHFI.jpg?auth=38351d3bf75f9768ae9acf0b0e268102d3acb2469f523739bccdc3851d4d4645&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Singapore's opposition will not nominate replacement for Leader of the Opposition role</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/singapores-workers-party-will-not-nominate-another-mp-be-leader-opposition-2026-01-21/</link><description>SINGAPORE, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Singapore's Workers' Party said on Wednesday it will not nominate another of its lawmakers to be Leader of the Opposition.

In a press statement, the opposition party said its view was that the leader of the opposition should be the leader of the largest opposition party in parliament.

Singapore Prime Minister Lawrence Wong last week stripped Workers' Party secretary-general Pritam Singh of the post, saying his position had become untenable after his lying conviction .

Wong asked the opposition party, which has 10 of the 97 seats , to nominate another lawmaker to take Singh's place.

The Worker's Party statement said: "In other Westminster systems, the title of the Leader of the Opposition is established by law and is not the prerogative or choice of the Government of the day or the Prime Minister. This approach expresses the authority and sanctity of the people’s vote."

In Singapore, the Leader of the Opposition role is designated by the head of government and not provided for in the constitution or parliament's standing orders.

The post comes with certain privileges and duties, such as staff support and an additional allowance, as well as access to confidential government briefings, especially in the event of a national crisis or emergency.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 09:35:52 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/J4P6SC5VQFKPDNXT6ELMMRILAM.jpg?auth=8f40725d099ac86e6b95a15bc26d0db05beffcf83941c1914c73acb4bf2578b0&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>EU stands ready to defend itself against coercion, Costa says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/eu-stands-ready-defend-itself-against-coercion-costa-says-2026-01-21/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 09:35:53 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Kosovo accepts invitation to join Trump's Board of Peace</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/kosovo-accepts-invitation-join-trumps-board-peace-2026-01-21/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 09:36:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>China distances itself from Greenland issue but warns against US dependence</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-distances-itself-greenland-issue-warns-against-us-dependence-2026-01-21/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 09:36:02 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>EU is at a crossroads towards more independence, von der Leyen says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/eu-is-crossroads-towards-more-independence-von-der-leyen-says-2026-01-21/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 09:36:03 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Singapore's opposition will not nominate replacement for Leader of the Opposition role</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/singapores-workers-party-will-not-nominate-another-mp-be-leader-opposition-2026-01-21/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 09:36:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>EU stands ready to defend itself against coercion, Costa says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/eu-stands-ready-defend-itself-against-coercion-costa-says-2026-01-21/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 09:36:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Syrian army takes control of Al-Hol camp housing IS group families</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260121-syria-army-enters-al-hol-camp-housing-islamic-state-group-is-isis-families-relatives-fighters</link><description>Syria’s army on Wednesday entered the country’s vast Al-Hol detention camp that houses relatives of suspected Islamic State ( IS ) group members, from which Kurdish forces withdrew the day before, according to an AFP journalist at the scene.

The correspondent saw a large number of soldiers open the camp’s metal gate and enter, while others guarded the entrance.

Al-Hol, located in a desert region of Hasakeh province, holds around 24,000 people, including 15,000 Syrians and about 6,300 foreign women and children of 42 nationalities.

Watch Life after al-Hol camp: Women of IS group try to reintegrate into Syrian society

Kurdish forces announced on Tuesday that they had been “compelled to withdraw” from the camp to defend cities in Syria’s north threatened by the army, before a ceasefire was announced.

The camp is the largest for suspected jihadists established by Kurdish forces, who spearheaded the fight against the IS group with help from an international coalition over the past decade before the group was defeated in Syria in 2019.

The Syrian defence ministry said Tuesday it was ready to take responsibility for Al-Hol camp “and all IS (group) prisoners”.

The announcement came as US envoy to Syria Tom Barrack said “the original purpose” of Kurdish forces as the primary anti-IS group force had “largely expired”.

The Syrian army deployed on Monday across vast parts of northern and northeastern Syria from which Kurdish forces had withdrawn.

An agreement between the two sides stipulates that the Syrian state becomes responsible for IS group prisoners and that the Kurdish administration be integrated into Syrian state institutions.

Syria’s interior ministry said it was taking necessary measures to maintain the security of Al-Hol.

Thousands of former jihadists, including many Westerners, are held in seven prisons, while tens of thousands of their family members live in two camps established by Kurdish forces in northern Syria, Al-Hol and Al-Roj.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 09:36:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/723fdaac-f6a6-11f0-afaf-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/000-93G38CY.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukraine endures its bitterest winter as Russia targets heating and power</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/ukraine-endures-its-bitterest-winter-russia-targets-heating-power-2026-01-21/</link><description>KYIV, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Collecting snow for water at home; sleeping in gloves, coats and hats; heating bricks on gas stoves for warmth; erecting tents indoors - Kyiv residents are doing everything they can to survive the coldest, darkest winter of the war.

"When there is no electricity, there is no heating: it means the apartment freezes," said Anton Rybikov, father of three-year-old David and two-year-old Matvii, speaking to Reuters in their home, where he and his wife Marina have stocked up on backup batteries and sleeping bags.

The 39-year-old military chaplain said one of his sons recently contracted pneumonia after temperatures in the apartment fell to 9 degrees Celsius (48 Fahrenheit) during a power blackout of more than 19 hours following Russian airstrikes.

"It's emotionally very difficult. There is constant worry," Rybikov added, as he prepared to heat water in a metal milk churn. "This winter is the hardest."

Russia has intensified its attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure in recent months, concentrating missile and drone strikes on the cities of Kyiv, Kharkiv and Dnipro.

British military intelligence estimated that Russia launched 55,000 unmanned aerial systems at Ukraine last year, around five times the number in 2024, according to one of its regular reports on the war posted on X.

Ukraine has called for more Western air defences to cope with the drone and missile barrages.

With temperatures plunging to minus 18 degrees Celsius across snow-covered Kyiv, the attacks mean hundreds of thousands of the capital's three million residents are struggling with lengthy interruptions to power and water supplies.

On Tuesday, after a major Russian strike overnight, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said more than a million households in the city had no power.

Simple routines like showering and cooking are now a challenge. For the first time since the full-scale Russian invasion nearly four years ago, the government last week declared a state of emergency related to the energy crisis.

Russia says its attacks on Ukraine are designed to degrade its military and denies targeting civilians.

Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko told Reuters that the strikes on the capital were meant to "break resistance, break the Ukrainians' spirit, to do everything for people to become depressed and pack their bags and vacate the territory."

"Kyiv has always been and remains the target for the aggressor," he said in an interview in his office.

Across the city, thousands of people now gather in schools and at makeshift street "invincibility points" where generators allow them to warm up, charge their phones and connect to the internet.

At a food distribution point in Kyiv run by World Central Kitchen, 66-year-old pensioner Valentyna Kiriiakova queued for hot food along with her granddaughter, Yeva Teplova.

"We don't complain," said Kiriiakova, whose high-rise apartment had no power, leaving her unable to cook. "We understand that there is a war going on and we have to endure. We have to survive."

Russia's onslaught on Ukraine's energy system has led to power and water outages in Kyiv that typically last three to four times longer than previous winters.

Economy Minister Oleksii Sobolev said that since October, Russia had damaged 8.5 gigawatts of Ukraine's generation capacity — nearly half of typical power consumption — forcing record electricity imports.

Russia has also struck Ukrainian gas production facilities, said energy company Naftogaz. The central bank governor said late last year that Ukraine lost about a half of its gas output, forcing it to spend more on imports.

"Ukraine's energy system is not broken, but it is operating in a mode of constant degradation," said Olena Lapenko, general director for safety and resilience at energy think-tank Dixi Group.

Schools and universities have extended their winter holidays, and many companies have moved to remote work or reduced their operating hours.

Dozens of repair teams hurry across Kyiv from site-to-site to patch up the damage caused by Russian strikes.

"There is a lot of work. The grids cannot withstand such pressure all at once," said Hennadii Barulin, 55, a digger operator, as his team worked to restore power to residents.

"This is a real winter. It is very difficult to break through the ground, through the asphalt, through everything."

Sobolev said Ukraine's stocks of energy equipment had been depleted and that urgent financial support of about $1 billion was required to deal with the current emergency.

Ukraine's Western partners rushed in hundreds of generators, powerful batteries and industrial boilers to help cover some gaps, according to the foreign ministry.

Newly appointed Energy Minister Denys Shmyhal said Ukraine has made some progress installing small, independent generation capacity to reduce reliance on the heavily centralised, Soviet-era system. He said 762 megawatts were installed in 2025, compared with 225 megawatts in 2024.

"Given the critical state of the energy sector, such pace is clearly insufficient."

Shmyhal also said Kyiv lagged behind other Ukrainian cities in installing independent generation capacity - criticism the mayor rejected.

With freezing temperatures forecast for several more weeks and further Russian strikes expected, energy experts say the situation is unlikely to improve soon.

Rybikov said he would consider sending his sons out of Kyiv if the blackouts worsen.

"We need the warmth so that the children do not freeze. The rest we will get through," he said. "If there is a blackout, I will send the children away."</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 10:30:07 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/P62RPLJPBFP5RAOGYT2TASNFWU.jpg?auth=8730c7dad92e8167b5127e098192c4341b63f1ea21a15e0d971d4dcec90a1c9e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>At appeal trial, France's Le Pen denies EU embezzlement charges</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/appeal-trial-frances-le-pen-denies-eu-embezzlement-charges-2026-01-21/</link><description>PARIS, Jan 21 (Reuters) - French far-right leader Marine Le Pen softened her tone while answering judges' questions during her appeal trial in Paris on Tuesday and Wednesday , but denied wrongdoing, after being barred from public office over a conviction for misusing EU funds.

Le Pen, the longtime leader of the far-right National Rally (RN), is facing a crucial appeal trial that will determine whether she can run in the 2027 presidential election, after she was given last year a five-year ban from running for public office, effective immediately.

Le Pen and others were found guilty of misappropriating more than 4 million euros ($4.7 million) of EU funds. Judges said that between 2004 and 2016, they had used funds earmarked for work at the European Parliament to pay staff who were actually working for the party.

Answering judge Michele Agi's questions, Le Pen stuck to addressing legal arguments, in contrast with her previous approach of challenging the legitimacy of the charges . But in substance, her defence appeared to remain the same, as she denied the existence of a system within the RN to misuse EU funds.

"I formally contest the idea that there was a kind of system," Le Pen told the court on Tuesday.

She also partly put the blame on her father, the late Jean-Marie Le Pen, saying that until 2014 he was the one really in charge. Known for his xenophobic, antisemitic and racist stance, the founder of the RN, formerly the Front National, died last year at 96.

"The way things were functioning wasn’t ideal -- I’m aware of that," she said. "But all those people were working."

The trial is expected to last until February 12.

A ruling is expected before the summer, meaning Le Pen's hopes of running in 2027 remain alive if her five-year ban is revoked or drastically curtailed.

If she cannot run, her protege, 30-year-old RN party president Jordan Bardella , is expected to step in.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 10:30:17 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/Q2QH24DSGRMNPJNUW4BTRLNM7Q.jpg?auth=764a701b286f4875f49c68a2c0919a70fcfb41450ff965f87bc0c30d40edf552&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>What are the military assets in the Arctic?</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/what-are-military-assets-arctic-2026-01-21/</link><description>OSLO, Jan 21 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump wants to buy Greenland as he says it is the only way for the United States to secure its defence. Denmark and Greenland, an autonomous territory, refuse and say any concerns Washington has can be addressed via their existing defence agreement.

Eight nations have territory in the Arctic: Russia, the United States, Canada, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland and Iceland. Here is an overview of their military assets:

Half of the landmass in the Arctic is Russian territory. Since 2005 Moscow has re-opened and modernised tens of Soviet-era military bases, both on its Arctic mainland and on the islands off its northern coast.

Russia maintains a high state of readiness at its nuclear testing site on Novaya Zemlya, an Arctic archipelago, although it has not conducted a test involving a nuclear explosion since 1990. Last October , it carried out a test launch of its nuclear-powered Burevestnik cruise missile from Novaya Zemlya.

In the European Arctic, the Kola Peninsula hosts about two-thirds of Russia's second-strike nuclear capabilities - its ability to answer a nuclear attack with its own - according to Mathieu Boulegue , opens new tab , a fellow at the Polar Institute at the Washington-based Wilson Center.

The area is also home to Russia's Northern Fleet, headquartered in Severomorsk, which operates six of the country's 12 nuclear-armed submarines, according to data from the International Institute for Strategic Studies. The other six are operated by the Pacific Fleet based in Vladivostok.

The only way for the Northern Fleet to access the North Atlantic is via the Barents Sea, between the Norwegian Svalbard archipelago and the northern coast of Europe. Keeping that access free is therefore essential to Moscow.

Since 1957, the U.S. and Canada have jointly defended against threats to their homeland, including from nuclear missiles, via the North American Aerospace Defense Command, known as NORAD.

They are modernising NORAD, according to the IISS: Canada is procuring two over-the-horizon radar systems covering the Arctic and polar approaches, with the first due to reach initial operating capability by 2028.

President Trump is keen to develop a new missile defence system, called Golden Dome, for which he says Greenland is crucial.

Washington has the Pituffik Space Base in northern Greenland under a defence agreement with Denmark. Otherwise, most of its Arctic forces are located across eight bases in Alaska and count approximately 22,000 military personnel, according to IISS and the U.S. Northern Command.

Canada has five Arctic bases, including Alert, a signals intelligence station on Ellesmere Island that is the world's northernmost permanently inhabited settlement.

South of the Arctic Circle, Canada operates a base at Yellowknife in the Northwest Territories, which hosts a ranger patrol group and an air base.

Canada is building a facility on Baffin Island to refuel offshore patrol ships - though the project has sustained numerous delays. The U.S., meanwhile, is expanding existing port facilities at Nome, Alaska, according to IISS.

Denmark's Joint Arctic Command , headquartered in Greenland's capital, Nuuk, counts around 150 military and civilian personnel.

JAC is also present at the Kangerlussuaq air base as well as four smaller military stations in eastern and north-eastern Greenland. JAC has one liaison officer at Pituffik.

Its Sirius dog sled patrol - derided by Trump - is a military unit that conducts long-range reconnaissance in the extreme conditions of northeastern Greenland.

Sweden has no bases north of the Arctic Circle, but has an air force base at Lulea, on the northern coast of the Gulf of Bothnia, and an army base with two regiments in Boden, some 40 km (25 miles) inland.

Finland has an air base in Rovaniemi, on the Arctic Circle, and a Jaeger Brigade base further north in Finnish Lapland.

Since joining NATO, the two countries have been integrating their militaries with the rest of the alliance.

Norway is NATO's monitor for a vast maritime area of some 2 million sq km (770,000 sq mi) of the North Atlantic, including the Arctic.

Many of its military installations are above the Arctic Circle. It has four air bases, including one for its new F-35 fighter jets, two navy bases, a string of army bases and a reception centre for NATO allies coming for reinforcement in case of attack.

There are no military installations on Svalbard, Norway's Arctic archipelago.

The North Atlantic island is a NATO member but has no military, only a coastguard service.

It hosts U.S. Navy P-8A Poseidon maritime-patrol aircraft in a rotational deployment, based at Keflavik air base, near Reykjavik.

NATO fighter jets periodically rotate at Keflavik to keep Icelandic airspace secure. The deployment usually lasts two to three weeks, three times a year.

Former army chief Muhammad Hafizuddiean Jantan will be charged under money laundering laws while former armed forces chief Mohd Nizam Jaafar will face charges related to abuse of power, criminal breach of trust, and for illegally accepting gifts, it said in a statement.

Hafizuddiean's wife will also be charged with money laundering, it said.

Muhammad Hafizuddiean and Mohd Nizam could not be immediately reached for comment.

The MACC has been investigating allegations of bribery linked to army procurement projects, raiding several firms and seizing bank accounts linked to a suspect and their family members.

Muhammad Hafizuddeain has been placed on leave since late December pending the investigation, while Mohd Nizam officially retired earlier this month.

The MACC said it was also completing a probe into two other senior military officers, with the investigation papers to be submitted to prosecutors soon for further action.

Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim last week announced that all procurement decisions by the Malaysian armed forces and the police that are linked to the corruption probe would be temporarily frozen until they fully comply with related rules.

Anwar said on Wednesday that the government would also review all other procurement decisions that have been approved or have not yet been concluded.

"They must undergo a more transparent process," he said at a defence ministry event.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 10:31:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LGUHF2TRFFNIBAX2I4RYTXBTAM.jpg?auth=afec7be4d5111e67284bf8d7ef3453c13047b7173152cf69ab3614e7eb2e24e2&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Europol breaks up Europe-wide drugs network based in Poland running 20 illegal labs</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/europol-breaks-up-europe-wide-drugs-network-based-poland-running-20-illegal-labs-2026-01-21/</link><description>WARSAW, Jan 21 (Reuters) - European investigators uncovered an international synthetic drugs network run from Poland and have seized more than 9.3 tonnes of narcotics and arrested over 100 suspects, Polish prosecutors said on Wednesday.

The operation targeted a criminal group accused of importing chemical precursors from China and India and manufacturing synthetic drugs in more than 20 illegal laboratories for distribution across the European Union.

Prosecutors said the group operated a complex international supply chain, legally importing large quantities of chemicals which were then repackaged and channelled to illegal drug laboratories in Poland and Western Europe. Poland served as the logistical hub.

Video released by Polish police showed raids on suspects' homes by armed officers and huge stockpiles of chemicals in plastic containers and distillation equipment.

Launched in 2022 by Polish anti-narcotics officers, the investigation expanded into a multi-country operation.

Authorities dismantled over 20 illegal laboratories and drug production lines in Poland, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and the Czech Republic and seized more than 9.3 tonnes of narcotics, vast quantities of chemical precursors and assets.

The prosecutor's office did not provide an estimate of the value of the seized drugs.

Europol, the EU's agency for fighting international and organised crime, enabled intelligence-sharing and synchronised police actions across borders, prosecutors said.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 10:32:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Italy won't take part in Trump's "Board of Peace", Corriere says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/italy-wont-take-part-trumps-board-peace-corriere-says-2026-01-21/</link><description>ROME, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Italy won't take part in U.S. President Donald Trump's "Board of Peace" initiative, daily Corriere della Sera reported on Wednesday, citing concern that joining such a group led by a single country's leader would violate Italy's constitution.

Trump's plan has so far drawn cautious reactions from Western allies, as diplomats say it could undermine the work of the United Nations.

On Thursday, Trump is due to preside over a ceremony celebrating the new group in Davos, Switzerland, site of the World Economic Forum.

A source told Reuters that Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, a rightwing leader who has had warm relations with Trump, was unlikely to go to Davos. The Italian government did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The proposed board would be chaired for life by Trump and start by addressing the Gaza conflict before expanding to other wars. Member countries would be required to pay a $1 billion fee each to earn permanent membership.

According to Italy's constitution, Italy may join international organisations that ensure "peace and justice among nations" only "on equal terms with other states", a condition incompatible with U.S. primacy on the new board, Corriere said.

The newspaper did not cite a source for its report.

Invitations to join the board have been addressed to some 60 nations but just a few, including Hungary and Israel , have so far accepted without reservations. Adding to concern among Western allies, the Kremlin said this week that Russian President Vladimir Putin had also been invited.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 10:32:52 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/3EYEM5EHFNNCPNO6CLSN4OL7Z4.jpg?auth=8243452ba4c73dddd483e1a4156525163e1ab8019efc685efca811e99def3417&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Rifaat al-Assad, uncle of ousted Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, dies, sources say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/rifaat-al-assad-uncle-ousted-syrian-president-bashar-al-assad-dies-sources-say-2026-01-21/</link><description>Jan 21 (Reuters) - Rifaat al-Assad, the uncle of deposed Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad accused of orchestrating mass killings during a 1982 uprising in Syria, has died, according to two people with direct knowledge of the matter.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 10:59:04 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/J2OT46IMSVO2LHG3HHCW3T5WGM.jpg?auth=1bb42dc711388997fd45b2f1aac58ca16ebd233c55b315fd77faa5f6343d7aff&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Nigerian troops free 62 hostages, kill two militants in northwest operations</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/nigerian-troops-free-62-hostages-kill-two-militants-northwest-operations-2026-01-21/</link><description>MADUGURI, Nigeria, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Nigerian troops have rescued 62 hostages and killed two militants in separate operations across Kebbi and Zamfara states as part of an ongoing offensive against armed groups in the northwest, the army said on Wednesday.

The northwest has been hit by a surge in mass kidnappings carried out by armed gangs operating from forest hideouts. These groups have attacked villages, schools and places of worship, including the January 18 abduction of more than 160 worshippers from two churches in Kaduna.

Army spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Olaniyi Osoba said troops stormed a known bandit hideout in Zamfara after receiving reports that captives were being held there.

The army said all 62 hostages were rescued and are in safe custody, with efforts underway to reunite them with their families.

In a separate operation, troops ambushed Lakurawa militants near the border between Kebbi’s Augie district and neighbouring Sokoto after receiving intelligence on the group’s movements, Osoba said.

Nigeria has come under scrutiny from U.S. President Donald Trump, who accused the country of failing to protect Christians from Islamist militants operating in the northwest.

U.S. forces launched strikes against Islamic State targets in northwest Nigeria on Christmas Day. The Nigerian government denies any systematic persecution of Christians, saying it is targeting Islamist fighters and other armed groups that attack both Christian and Muslim civilians.

The army added that the operations form part of broader efforts to dismantle armed networks responsible for widespread kidnappings and insecurity across the region.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan

visit</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/britain-china-revive-golden-era-business-dialogue-during-starmer-visit-2026-01-21/</link><description>BEIJING, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Britain and China will aim to revive a "golden era" business dialogue when Prime Minister Keir Starmer visits Beijing next week, three sources familiar with the initiative said, with top company executives from both sides invited to participate.

AstraZeneca (AZN.L) , opens new tab , BP (BP.L) , opens new tab , HSBC (HSBA.L) , opens new tab , Intercontinental Hotels Group (IHG.L) , opens new tab , Jaguar Land Rover, Rolls Royce (RR.L) , opens new tab , Schroders (SDR.L) , opens new tab and Standard Chartered (STAN.L) , opens new tab , are among the British firms set to join a revamped "UK-China CEO Council," said the sources, who are both Chinese and British.

The council was originally conceived by then-Prime Minister Theresa May and then-Premier Li Keqiang in 2018, during a period of ties both sides dubbed "a golden era".

The Chinese side should be represented by Bank of China (601988.SS) , opens new tab , China Construction Bank (601939.SS) , opens new tab , China Mobile (600941.SS) , opens new tab , Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (601398.SS) , opens new tab , China Railway Rolling Stock Corporation, China National Pharmaceutical Group and BYD (002594.SZ) , opens new tab , among other companies, the sources - a mixture of officials and businesspeople - added.

Negotiations have been under way for some time. But with Starmer's visit largely contingent on approval for China to build its largest embassy in Europe in London - a green light it received on Tuesday - talks have only just begun in earnest, they said.

Details such as the group's official English-language name still need to be settled, one person said, with the British government reluctant to include "CEO" in the title, while the Chinese side plans to keep the same Chinese translation used in 2018.

Premier Li Qiang, China's second-ranking official, should be Beijing's representative, if the talks go ahead, they added. The British side could announce the visit and Starmer's schedule as soon as Friday, that same person said.

All of the sources cautioned, however, that U.S. President Donald Trump's threats to acquire Greenland could derail Starmer's trip, adding that, with the embassy decision still so recent, other elements of the visit were still being finalised.

None of the people could confirm which CEOs would attend, with one businessperson noting their company's chief executive had declined, unable to be sure the visit would proceed.

Reuters contacted all of the companies expected to attend for comment, but none immediately responded.

A visit by Starmer would be the first by a British leader since 2018, with his administration aiming to reset ties with the world's second‑largest economy after successive Conservative governments shifted the UK from being one of Beijing's strongest backers in Europe to one of its fiercest critics.

In a speech late last year, the Labour prime minister accused previous Conservative governments of a "dereliction of duty" by allowing ties with Beijing to deteriorate, noting French President Emmanuel Macron had visited China twice since 2018 and German leaders four times.

Neither China nor Britain has officially announced Starmer's visit. The British embassy in Beijing said the prime minister's travel would be announced in the usual way. China's foreign ministry did not respond to a request for comment.

Commercial ties soured after the UK banned China's Huawei from its 5G networks in 2020, and in 2022 British lawmakers led a taxpayer-funded buyout of China General Nuclear Power Corporation's (CGN) stake in a nuclear plant being developed by France's EDF.

CGN was part of the original CEO council, but along with Huawei, is unlikely to join the revamped group, one of the sources said, citing political sensitivities in the UK over Chinese firms' role in the country's critical infrastructure.

At the council's first meeting in 2018, China's Li said its aim was to "fast-track two-way investment and expand bilateral trade in a healthier, more balanced direction," according to a readout published by the China International Contractors Association, one of the initiative's organisers.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 11:30:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5UX6443CTZPNBJCGPCLRNAAJTA.jpg?auth=1a10473bc6c1a8e995f2666dfb8a4bd2beadd269b1d66ce07af1bc6bc3bc620f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Targeted by Trump, Fed's Cook is a fighter with the scars to prove it</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/targeted-by-trump-feds-cook-is-fighter-with-scars-prove-it-2026-01-21/</link><description>Jan 21 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's contested firing of Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook has become a test case in his ​bid to assert control over the U.S. central bank and his ongoing efforts to push the limits of presidential power.

As the first sitting Fed policymaker ‌to be the target of an attempted presidential ouster, Cook is no stranger either to being first, or to being targeted.

The daughter of a nursing professor and hospital chaplain, Cook was among the initial Black students to desegregate the schools that she and her sisters attended in rural Milledgeville, Georgia. She has told interviewers she still has scars above her right eye and on her leg from beatings during that time.

After studying philosophy at Spelman College, Cook became the first graduate of that historically Black women's institution in Atlanta, Georgia, to ‌win a Marshall Scholarship, which funded a year's study at Oxford University.

Later, as she has recounted in many speeches, a British economist ​whose name she no longer recalls convinced her during a hiking trip up a Tanzanian mountain that she should become an economist. No record exists to verify whether she is the first to be converted by Kilimanjaro to the discipline of economics.

Cook received her PhD in economics from the University of California, Berkeley, where Barry ‍Eichengreen - who has written extensively about what is at stake when political leaders drive a central bank's policy decisions - was one of her dissertation advisers.

"I know Lisa to be careful and ethical," Eichengreen told fellow economist Paul Krugman in an interview last August, days after Trump said in a social media post that he was firing Cook for what he said were ⁠false statements on her mortgage application, or at the least "gross negligence" for faulty paperwork.

Cook has called the allegations baseless and sued to stop the dismissal. It ‍is Trump's effort to reverse a lower court's decision to block her removal that is currently under consideration by the U.S. Supreme Court . A hearing is scheduled for Wednesday.

"She's also one ‌of the ‌strongest people I know," Eichengreen told Krugman. "This is not someone that we should be making predictions about, but I think we have a very strong individual on the other side of this controversy."

Cook taught at Harvard University and was a research fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution before she was hired as an economics professor at Michigan State University in 2005. She wrote extensively about racial disparities, documenting the negative impact of anti-Black violence and ⁠gender inequality on innovation and economic growth.

She ⁠was an adviser on the transition ​teams for the Obama-Biden and Biden-Harris administrations, and a senior economist for the White House's Council of Economic Advisers from 2011 to 2012.

Nominated in 2022 to the Fed's Board of Governors by then-President Joe Biden, Cook's Senate confirmation was a drawn-out and contentious process that included her being subjected to what she called "anonymous and untrue attacks" on her work and accusations ‍from Republican lawmakers that she would be soft on inflation.

She became the first Black female U.S. central banker only after Vice President Kamala Harris cast a tie-breaking 51st vote in an evenly divided U.S. Senate.

Cook voted with her Fed colleagues to raise interest rates in 2022 and 2023 to fight a surge in inflation, but supported the central bank's three rate cuts last year to protect against a ​softening labor market . Trump has excoriated the Fed for not delivering the big rate cuts he seeks.

As a ‍Fed policymaker, Cook has focused many of her public remarks on the impact of artificial intelligence, which the Trump administration sees as key to economic prosperity.

She argues that AI could boost productivity and ease ​inflation, though the timing of those changes is uncertain, and the benefits could be unevenly distributed across the nation's workforce.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 11:30:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/E6NYDFPBJFNMXGY7OKUTDHIQ7I.jpg?auth=598e97ce616a7d6667ed03355815c1e56847423be743566985e08561e4b439d4&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US Supreme Court considers Trump's bid to fire Fed's Cook</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-supreme-court-considers-trumps-bid-fire-feds-lisa-cook-2026-01-21/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 21 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court is set on Wednesday to consider President Donald Trump 's unprecedented attempt to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook in a case that tests how far the justices may be willing to ​go to preserve the central bank's independence.

The case represents the latest dispute to come to the top U.S. judicial body involving Trump's expansive view ‌of presidential powers since returning to office 12 months ago. The arguments are scheduled for 10 a.m. (1500 GMT).

Trump's administration has asked the Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, to lift a judge's decision barring ​the Republican president from firing Cook while her legal challenge plays out. When the justices in October , opens new tab agreed to hear the case, they left Cook in her job for the time being.

In creating the Fed, Congress passed a law called the Federal Reserve Act that included provisions meant to insulate the central bank from political interference, requiring governors to be removed by a ‌president only "for cause," though the law does not define the term nor establish procedures for removal.

Trump's move against Cook is seen as ​the most consequential challenge to the Fed's independence since it was formed in 1913. Until now, no president had sought to oust a Fed official.

U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb in September ruled that Trump's attempt to remove Cook without notice or a hearing likely violated her right to due process under the U.S. Constitution's Fifth Amendment. Cobb also found that unproven ‍mortgage fraud allegations that Trump cited to fire Cook - which she has denied - likely were not a legally sufficient cause to remove a Fed governor under the law, noting that the alleged conduct occurred before she served in the Fed post.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit declined Trump's request to put Cobb's order on hold.

Cook has called the allegations against her a pretext to ⁠fire her over monetary policy differences as Trump heaps pressure on the central bank to cut interest rates and lashes out at Fed Chair Jerome Powell for not doing so more quickly.

As a Fed governor, Cook helps set U.S. monetary policy with the rest of the central bank's seven-member board and the heads of the 12 regional Fed banks. Her term in the job runs to ‌2038. Cook ‌was appointed in 2022 by Democratic former President Joe Biden as the first Black woman to serve in the post.

In prior cases, the Supreme Court chipped away at the independence of various federal agencies from presidential control, and could soon overrule a key precedent that has shielded the heads of independent agencies from removal since 1935.

But the court last year signaled it may view the central bank as an exception, noting in a May ruling that let Trump remove two Democratic members of federal labor boards that the Fed possesses a unique structure and ⁠historical tradition.

The Supreme Court has backed Trump ⁠in a series of emergency rulings since ​he returned to the presidency on immigration, mass federal layoffs, cutting foreign aid, dismantling the Education Department and other matters.

The Cook case has ramifications for the Fed's ability to set interest rates without regard to the wishes of politicians, widely seen as critical to any central bank's ability to carry out tasks such as keeping inflation under control.

The president sought to fire Cook on August 25 by ‍posting a termination letter on social media citing the mortgage fraud allegations disclosed by Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte, a Trump appointee.

The administration ‍this month opened a criminal investigation into Powell over remarks he made to Congress last year about a Fed building project, a move he similarly called a pretext aimed at gaining influence over monetary policy.

Powell plans to attend Wednesday's arguments, a source familiar with the situation told Reuters.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 11:31:02 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ICIM3JZT7ZNVTB4VG2EO6CWZQY.jpg?auth=9db72181976f27160843737b5f856074a41bbb21d2edc94efc89c1d973b680e5&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Spanish train drivers call for strike after deadly derailments</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/spanish-train-drivers-call-strike-after-deadly-derailments-2026-01-21/</link><description>MADRID, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Spain's biggest train drivers' union on Wednesday called for a nationwide strike to demand assurances for the profession's safety after one of Europe's biggest train crashes left at least 42 dead and a second derailment killed a driver.

A commuter train derailed on Tuesday after a retaining wall collapsed onto the track during heavy rains near Barcelona, killing the driver and seriously injuring four passengers. A third derailment of a train on Barcelona's regional network, which left no injuries, was caused by a rock falling on the line during the same storm, rail network operator Adif said.

"We are going to demand criminal liability from those responsible for ensuring safety in the railway infrastructure," the train drivers union SEMAF said in a statement.

Those accidents occurred just two days after the derailment of a high-speed train on Sunday near Adamuz in Cordoba province, about 360 km (223 miles) south of Madrid, which caused a collision with another train that killed 42, including the driver of the oncoming train.

SEMAF had warned Adif in a letter last August of severe wear and tear to the railway track where the two trains collided, according to a copy of the letter seen by Reuters, saying potholes, bumps, and imbalances in overhead power lines were causing frequent breakdowns and damaging the trains on several of the network's high-speed lines.

Rescuers at the site of the Adamuz crash were prising apart the second carriage of the train belonging to state operator Renfe, which contained its cafeteria, to see if any more bodies could be found, the Andalusian regional government said in a statement.

Overnight they had used cranes to remove one of the final carriages of the derailed train run by private consortium Iryo from the scene.

Adif said on Wednesday it had introduced a further speed limit on the Madrid-Barcelona line after a driver had reported poor conditions on the track in a 78-kilometre stretch.

On Tuesday, it had ordered drivers to limit their speed because of concerns about the state of the track. Its maintenance team had worked overnight to inspect the line and found four points that needed to be repaired, Adif said in a statement.

The accidents are causing chaos for commuters and travellers, who were scrambling for alternatives. Regional trains across Catalonia were suspended on Wednesday to allow for track inspections after the recent storms.

Renfe posted a photo of its President Alvaro Fernandez Heredia using a replacement bus service as he travelled back to Madrid from Adamuz.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 11:31:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/X6CJPD5V2JIOJKOMXZMWDZK56A.jpg?auth=808cf3b99de4862c3807208390c62ebd92dd2015d22e9c423d3c62614b952409&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Turkey's Erdogan says Kurdish forces in Syria must lay down arms and disband now</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/turkeys-erdogan-says-kurdish-forces-syria-must-lay-down-arms-disband-now-2026-01-21/</link><description>ANKARA, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said on Wednesday that Kurdish forces in northern Syria must lay down weapons and disband now to avoid further bloodshed, after Damascus struck a ceasefire with the group and gave them four days to agree on integrating into the central state.

Syria's Turkey-backed government forces seized swathes of territory from the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in northeast Syria this week, as part of President Ahmed al-Sharaa's efforts to bring all the country under central government authority.

The United States, the SDF's main ally, said its partnership with the group had changed in nature since the emergence of the new government in Damascus, and urged Kurdish fighters to integrate into Syria's state apparatus.

Turkey views the SDF as a terrorist organisation linked to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militant group. It has been engaged in a peace process with the PKK for months and says the group - and its extensions - must disband and disarm .

Speaking to members of his AK Party in parliament, Erdogan said Turkey welcomed Tuesday's ceasefire agreement between the SDF and Damascus, adding he hoped the group's "full integration" would herald a new era in Syria.

"Our hope is for this issue to be solved permanently without any more bloodshed, for the terrorist organisation, which is now stuck in some areas in northern Syria, to lay down its weapons, disband, and for there to be no more conflict," he said.

Laying down weapons is the only way out, he added, and any provocation would be a "suicide attempt."

Earlier, Erdogan's office said he discussed developments in Syria with U.S. President Donald Trump in a phone call . He said on Wednesday that their call was "fruitful" and that they spoke about the joint battle against Islamic State in Syria.

He also urged Kurds in Turkey not to fall for " provocations " by militants and said his government would continue to carry out the peace process with the PKK.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 11:31:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/IQMBMPRWWBLQHJBCIS6XBUADMM.jpg?auth=f8d7def88acd78b5333e641beeb9946ed7454272f6ceb3f486052819fd4f62aa&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US envoy Witkoff says he will meet with Putin on Thursday</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us-envoy-witkoff-says-he-will-meet-with-putin-thursday-2026-01-21/</link><description>Jan 21 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff said he would be traveling with Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner to Moscow on Thursday and that they would meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

"Well, look, we have to go meet him on Thursday," Witkoff told CNBC in an interview, referring to Putin.

"But it's the Russians who are asking for that meeting. I think that's a significant statement on their part," he said.

The Kremlin said last week it was preparing to welcome Witkoff and Jared Kushner to Moscow for peace talks on Ukraine, but that no dates had been set.

Asked if Putin was joining Trump's Board of Peace, Witkoff said "I think so," and reiterated that an invitation to do so had been extended to Putin.

Ukraine's top negotiator Rustem Umerov said last week that talks with U.S. officials on a resolution of the nearly four-year-old war with Russia would continue at the World Economic Forum this week in the Swiss resort of Davos.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 11:31:56 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/YGJM673HHRMUREN5ECHVKXY5PI.jpg?auth=271a3021cfd0b1d6dcfa1a3e3f22683925c351edb898e38a7c29d92843ecf39c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Germany arrests two on suspicion of supporting pro-Russian Donetsk, Luhansk groups</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/germany-arrests-two-suspicion-supporting-pro-russian-donetsk-luhansk-groups-2026-01-21/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 11:33:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Syria: Did Washington "abandon" the Kurds?</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/syria-did-washington-abandon-the-kurds</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 11:33:12 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/fa298212-f6ae-11f0-8184-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26021288902083.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukraine anti-corruption body investigates former senior presidential aide</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/ukraine-anti-corruption-body-investigates-former-senior-presidential-aide-2026-01-21/</link><description>KYIV, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Ukraine's anti-corruption bureau said on Wednesday it was investigating an unnamed former senior official from the president's office and a former board member of state oil and gas major Naftogaz for involvement in an alleged green energy embezzlement scheme.

He was 88. He died in the United Arab Emirates , ⁠two sources with knowledge of his passing said.

A former army officer who helped Hafez al-Assad seize power in a 1970 coup and establish his iron rule, Rifaat continued to harbour presidential ambitions during years of exile spent mostly in France. He returned to Syria in 2021, before fleeing again in 2024 following the ouster of his nephew, President Bashar al-Assad .

When Hafez died in 2000, Rifaat objected to ​the power transfer to Bashar and declared himself the legitimate successor in what proved to be an ultimately toothless leadership challenge.

He weighed in from abroad again in 2011 as rebellion swept ‍Syria, urging his nephew to step down quickly to prevent civil war . But he also deflected blame away from Bashar, attributing the revolt against his rule to an accumulation of errors.

More than a decade later, Bashar - still in power at the time - allowed his uncle to ​return home, helping him escape jail in France where he was found guilty of acquiring millions of euros of property using funds diverted from the ​Syrian state.

When Bashar fell, Rifaat had tried to escape via a Russian airbase but was denied entry and eventually crossed to Lebanon, carried over a river on the back of a close associate, according to one of the sources, who had direct knowledge of the incident.

Rifaat al-Assad, a younger brother to Hafez, was born in the village of Qardaha in a mountainous area near the Mediterranean coast which forms the heartland of the minority Alawite community to which the family belongs.

Rifaat became a powerful figure in the Assad regime after the 1970 coup. He commanded the loyalty of elite forces that crushed the 1982 Muslim Brotherhood uprising in Hama, one of the biggest threats to Hafez al-Assad during his 30-year rule.

The devastating three-week assault, which killed more than 10,000 people, has often been described as a model for how Bashar would deal with the rebellion against his rule some three decades later.

In 2022 ‍the independent Syrian Network for Human Rights (SNHR) monitoring group, citing informed estimates, alleged that between 30,000 and 40,000 civilians were killed in Hama.

In March 2024, the Attorney General’s Office of Switzerland said that it would put Rifaat al-Assad on trial for war crimes and crimes ​against humanity for his actions in Hama.

According to the Swiss prosecutors’ indictment, between 3,000 and 60,000 people, the majority civilians, died in the Hama assault. In response Rifaat’s lawyers said in a statement that he had always denied any involvement in the alleged acts.

His role in crushing the Hama insurrection further elevated his standing in that administration.

In his book - “Asad: The ‌Struggle for the Middle East” - journalist Patrick Seale listed victory over the Brotherhood as one of the factors that led senior regime figures to turn to Rifaat when Hafez fell ill in 1983 and they feared he would not recover.

He was appointed vice president the following year.

While Hafez was still unwell, Rifaat started ‍pressing for changes in government, and posters of him in uniform appeared in Damascus . When Assad recovered, he was “extremely displeased”, Seale wrote.

Their rivalry culminated in 1984 when Rifaat ordered his forces to seize control of key points in Damascus, threatening all-out conflict. But Hafez talked his younger brother down from confrontation.

Rifaat left Syria after the failed coup.

Establishing himself as a rich businessman in Europe, he initially settled in Geneva, later moving to France and Spain.

In his later years, he could be seen walking with an entourage of bodyguards in southern Spain’s Puerto Banus in Marbella, where he also had seaside property.

But his wealth increasingly became the focus of corruption investigations.

In 2020, a French court found him guilty of acquiring millions of euros’ worth of French property using funds diverted from the Syrian state and sentenced him to four years in jail.

All of his property in France, estimated to ‍be worth €100 million at the time, was ordered seized, as well as a property worth €29 million in London.

Rifaat repeatedly denied the accusations.

His return to Syria in 2021 was not the first time he had gone ‌home since the failed coup: in ​1992, he attended his mother’s funeral.

A pro-government newspaper reported he had returned in 2021 “in order to prevent his imprisonment in France” and would play no political or social role.

A photo posted on social media in April 2023 showed him among a group of people, including a smiling Bashar.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 11:51:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/43b45818-f6bd-11f0-9a32-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/AP19343359919982-1.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Turkey's foreign minister to represent Erdogan on 'Board of Peace', source says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/turkeys-foreign-minister-represent-erdogan-board-peace-source-says-2026-01-21/</link><description>ANKARA, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan will represent Turkey's president on U.S. President Donald Trump's international " Board of Peace " initiative, a Turkish source told Reuters on Wednesday.

Trump had sent an invitation to President Tayyip Erdogan to become a member of the board, an initiative that initially aimed to end the conflict in Gaza but that Trump has said will resolve conflicts globally.

Trump is due to preside over a ceremony marking the "Board of Peace" on Thursday at the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.

"Hakan (Fidan) will join," Erdogan told reporters in parliament on Wednesday when asked whether he accepted Trump's invitation.

The White House had earlier announced that Fidan was a member of a separate "Gaza Executive Board", along with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff, former British prime minister Tony Blair and Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner.

The Turkish source with knowledge of the matter, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Fidan would also represent Erdogan at the leaders-level "Board of Peace".

The Turkish Foreign Ministry said in a statement that Fidan would attend the signing ceremony on Thursday.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 12:51:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/XSKIDK3U3BJF3HB6YLZUAPFBLE.jpg?auth=7ab0404c755cbcd9068c77a6d0a0d9bb6f508d2355dfa650db17ca39a31cb0de&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Prince Harry appears in witness box to start evidence against Daily Mail publisher</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/prince-harry-give-evidence-again-latest-privacy-lawsuit-against-mail-publisher-2026-01-21/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Prince Harry appeared in the witness box at London's High Court to start giving evidence in his privacy lawsuit against the Daily Mail's publisher, the royal's second such appearance in three years.

The Duke of Sussex, 41, and six other claimants including singer Elton John are suing the Mail's publisher Associated Newspapers for violations of their privacy from the early 1990s until the 2010s.

Associated has called the allegations "preposterous smears", saying their journalists had legitimate sources for information, including from the celebrities' friends and acquaintances.

Having become in 2023 the first royal in 130 years to give evidence in court during another of his lawsuits against the press, the younger son of King Charles appeared as the claimants' initial witness in the case against Associated.

Asked how he wished to be addressed during the hearing, Harry said "same as last time", a reference to his previous appearance at the High Court in 2023. However, his evidence was then delayed as the court dealt with a technical issue.

The prince's case centres on 14 articles his legal team say were the product of unlawful information gathering, including by hacking voicemail messages, bugging landlines and obtaining private information by deception, known as "blagging".

Associated, however, says Harry's social circle was known to be "leaky" and that some articles were based on public statements issued by royal press officers.

Harry was originally due to give evidence on Thursday but this was brought forward after Associated concluded their opening argument much faster than expected.

"They have had to resort to game playing and dirty tricks," a source close to the prince's team said.

"They think that by pulling the schedule forward 24 hours they are giving Prince Harry less time to prepare - he’s been preparing for this moment for the last three years. Safe to say, he’s ready."</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 12:52:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5CUSCFF2WRMSJIOFLOPEVCZABY.jpg?auth=1e1041bf649810b1bcaf4b9bb09e1728a1fad677f626b7113cf20623eeb301aa&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israeli fire kills five Palestinians as Trump seeks to advance Gaza peace deal</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-fire-kills-five-palestinians-trump-seeks-advance-gaza-peace-deal-2026-01-21/</link><description>CAIRO, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Israeli fire killed five Palestinians, including two boys, in central and southern Gaza, local health authorities said, and the Israeli military said it had "eliminated" a Palestinian militant who posed a threat to soldiers.

Israel and Hamas have traded blame for many breaches of the October ceasefire after two years of war that devastated Gaza and caused a humanitarian disaster, and remain at odds over the next steps in U.S. President Donald Trump's 20-point peace plan.

Palestinian medics said three people, including a 10-year-old boy, were killed as a result of Israeli tank shelling east of Deir Al-Balah in the central Gaza Strip. Two others, a boy, 13, and a woman, were killed in two separate Israeli shooting incidents in eastern Khan Younis in Gaza's south, they said.

Residents said the two incidents occurred in Palestinian-controlled areas. The ceasefire led to a partial Israeli military withdrawal, leaving Israeli forces holding about 53% of the enclave, but they have been gradually expanding their presence in recent weeks, leading to further displacement of Palestinian families, residents told Reuters.

The Israeli military did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the two incidents.

Earlier on Wednesday, it said in a statement that Israeli forces killed a "terrorist" who crossed into an area under their control, posing an imminent threat to soldiers operating there.

The U.S.-brokered October deal has not progressed beyond the first-phase ceasefire, under which major fighting stopped, some Israeli forces pulled back, and Hamas freed hostages in return for Palestinian detainees and convicted prisoners.

Under future phases whose details have yet to be hammered out, Hamas is supposed to disarm, Israeli forces withdraw further and an internationally backed administration installed to rebuild the ruined, densely populated territory.

But no timetable has been set to implement the plan.

Trump was due on Thursday to preside over a ceremony celebrating the Board of Peace, a group he formed with the stated goal of redeveloping the coastal enclave.

Israel says it can only move into the second phase after Hamas hands over the remains of the last Israeli hostage.

On Wednesday, Hamas Gaza spokesperson Hazem Qassem said the Islamist group had shared all information it had on the body of the last hostage and searched for it but in vain, blaming what it called Israeli military obstruction.

More than 460 Palestinians and three Israeli soldiers have been reported killed in clashes since the ceasefire took effect.

Israel launched its air and ground war in Gaza after a Hamas-led cross-border attack on October 7, 2023 that killed 1,200 people, according to Israeli tallies. Israel's assault has killed 71,000 Palestinians, Gaza's health authorities say.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 12:53:21 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/GTBTRMCEDNOC3CS3JJLK2CTZTI.jpg?auth=a19fd308d84ccf3f705e7449d15ae88720f51f56dda0dc4199af2108b5a88910&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Davos-Citadel CEO Griffin says US has 'frayed' relationship with European allies</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/davos-citadel-ceo-griffin-says-us-has-frayed-relationship-with-european-allies-2026-01-21/</link><description>Jan 21 (Reuters) - Ken Griffin, the CEO of Citadel, said on Wednesday that the United States ​had "frayed its relationship" with its European allies in ‌a way that the billionaire said he did not "understand or appreciate".

Griffin's comments, made at the World Economic Forum in Davos, come after President Donald Trump vowed over the weekend to ‌implement a wave of increasing tariffs on European allies ​until the United States was allowed to buy Greenland, escalating a row over the future of Denmark's ‍vast Arctic island.

Griffin, a Republican supporter who has said he voted for Trump in the 2024 election, also said that the U.S. ⁠had seen higher inflation due to Trump's tariffs.

"We have disrupted ‍long-standing trading relationships because of the tariffs," he said.

Griffin also reiterated his concerns ‌about ‌the Trump administration's criticism of the U.S. Federal Reserve. Trump has repeatedly demanded large interest rate cuts, accusing the Fed of being too slow to lower borrowing ⁠costs and threatening to ⁠indict its ​chair, Jerome Powell, over comments he made.

"The easy money policies that Trump is trying to encourage the Fed to pursue increase ‍the risk of inflation, and I think puts both him and his party in a more precarious position," Griffin added.

Griffin has previously spoken ​of the need to maintain the ‍Fed's independence.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 12:53:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/GTNX27GTF5PMNF2TDGQVRIWCWE.jpg?auth=b169912660f9469e3d8d75167b46e0170450f397cc80ed1cc87059e9a60eaf66&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>NATO situation difficult but must focus on Russia, says Norway's defence minister</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/nato-situation-difficult-must-focus-russia-says-norways-defence-minister-2026-01-21/</link><description>OSLO, Jan 21 (Reuters) - The situation in NATO is difficult due to the crisis over Greenland, but western allies must remember their common adversary is Russia, which is increasing its military presence in the Arctic, Norway's defence minister said on Wednesday.

"These are demanding times. The situation in NATO is difficult," Tore Sandvik told a meeting with foreign correspondents in Oslo.

"The dimensional threat for the West, for NATO, (for) all members of NATO, still is Russia," he said.

Sandvik was speaking as the Western military alliance is fraying under the pressure of U.S. President Donald Trump's relentless push to acquire Greenland from fellow NATO ally Denmark.

Trump will later on Wednesday attend the World Economic Forum (WEF) meeting in Davos, Switzerland, where he is expected to renew his demands.

NATO-member Norway and Russia share a border in the Arctic.

On land, Norway spies on military installations on the Kola Peninsula, which hosts about two-thirds of Russia's second-strike nuclear capabilities - its ability to answer a nuclear attack with its own.

The area is also home to Russia's Northern Fleet, headquartered in Severomorsk, which operates six of the country's 12 nuclear-armed submarines.

The only way for the Northern Fleet to access the North Atlantic is via the shallow waters of the Barents Sea, between the Norwegian Svalbard archipelago and the northern coast of Europe.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 12:53:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HZOC676QCFLWTAORDTX5NPY6ZU.jpg?auth=497110c72b35a8165d475378cd02c965c2175190a7822bfeb5c7717533d7856b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>EU lawmakers refer EU-Mercosur trade agreement to top EU court</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/eu-lawmakers-refer-eu-mercosur-trade-agreement-top-eu-court-2026-01-21/</link><description>BRUSSELS, Jan 21 (Reuters) - The European Parliament voted on Wednesday to refer the European Union's contentious free trade agreement with South America to the bloc's top court, a move that could delay the deal by two years and potentially derail it.

The European ​Union signed its largest-ever trade pact with Mercosur members Argentina , Brazil , ​Paraguay and Uruguay on Saturday. The agreement still requires approval before it can take effect.

Opponents, led by France , the EU’s largest agricultural producer, say the deal will sharply increase imports of cheap beef, sugar and poultry, undercutting domestic farmers who have staged repeated protests.

A group of 144 lawmakers put forward a parliamentary motion to ask the EU Court of ‍Justice to rule on whether the agreement can be applied before full ratification by all member states ​and whether its provisions restrict the EU’s ability to set environmental and consumer health policies. The court typically takes around two years to deliver such opinions.

The ‌European Parliament backed the motion with 334 votes in favour to 324 against, with 11 abstentions.

If referred to the court, ‍the EU could still apply the pact provisionally pending the ruling and parliamentary approval. But doing so could prove politically difficult given the likely backlash, and the European Parliament would retain the power to annul it later.

Supporters including Germany and Spain point to US President Donald Trump’s disruption of global trade. They argue the deal is essential to ‍offset business lost to US tariffs and to reduce reliance on China by securing access to ‌critical minerals . They ​also warn that Mercosur governments are losing patience with the EU after years of negotiations.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 12:55:07 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/b24ac2a2-f6c3-11f0-b3d9-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-21T121332Z-317230047-RC2N5JAG10MW-RTRMADP-3-EU-MERCOSUR.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Europe's far right and populists distance themselves from Trump over Greenland</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europes-far-right-populists-distance-themselves-trump-over-greenland-2026-01-21/</link><description>BERLIN/PARIS/, Jan 21 (Reuters) - European far-right and populist parties that once cheered on Donald Trump and gained in standing through his praise are now distancing themselves from the U.S. president over his military incursion into Venezuela and bid for Greenland .

The Trump administration has repeatedly backed far-right European parties that share a similar stance on issues from immigration to climate change, helping legitimize movements that have long faced stigma at home but are now on the rise.

The new U.S. National Security Strategy issued last month said "the growing influence of patriotic European parties indeed gives cause for great optimism."

But those parties now face a dilemma as disapproval of Trump rises across the continent over his increasingly aggressive foreign policy moves and in particular his efforts to acquire Greenland from Denmark.

"Donald Trump has violated a fundamental campaign promise — namely, not to interfere in other countries," Alice Weidel of the far-right Alternative for Germany said, while party co-leader Tino Chrupalla rejected "Wild West methods".

The AfD has been cultivating ties with Trump's administration - but polls suggest this may no longer be beneficial. A survey by pollster Forsa released on Tuesday showed 71% of Germans see Trump more as an opponent than an ally.

Wariness of Trump has grown since he vowed on Saturday to slap tariffs on a raft of EU countries including Germany, France, Sweden and Britain, until the U.S. is allowed to buy Greenland.

Those countries had last week sent military personnel to the vast Arctic island at Denmark's request.

National Rally leader Jordan Bardella said on Tuesday Europe must react, referring to "anti-coercion measures" and the suspension of the economic agreement signed last year between the EU and the United States.

British populist party Reform UK, whose leader Nigel Farage has long feted his close ties with Trump, said it was hard to tell if the president was bluffing.

"But to use economic threats against the country that's been considered to be your closest ally for over a hundred years is not the kind of thing we would expect," Reform said in a statement published on Jan. 19.

Blunter still was Mattias Karlsson, often cited as chief ideologist of the far-right Sweden Democrats.

"Trump is increasingly resembling a reversed King Midas," he wrote on X. "Everything he touches turns to shit."

Political scientist Johannes Hillje said it would always be hard for nationalists to forge a common foreign policy "because the national interests do not always converge."

Not all European far-right and populist parties have been so critical. Some, like the far-right Dutch Party for Freedom and Spanish Vox, praised Trump for removing Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro yet kept silent on his Greenland threats.

Others, such as Polish President Karol Nawrocki and the nationalist government of Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban have called for the issue of Greenland to be settled bilaterally between the United States and Denmark.

Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis posted a video on social networks on Tuesday in which he brandished a map and a globe to show how big Greenland was and how close it was to Russia if it were to send a missile.

"The U.S. has a long-term interest in Greenland, it is not just an initiative of Donald Trump now," he said, calling for a diplomatic resolution.

Italy's right-wing Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who is seen as one of the closest European leaders to Trump, said his decision to slap tariffs on European allies was a "mistake".

"I spoke to Donald Trump a few hours ago and told him what I think," she said on Sunday, adding that she thought there was "a problem of understanding and communication" between Washington and Europe. She has not said anything since, but Italian media have said she is against slapping tariffs on the U.S. in response and is instead seeking to defuse the crisis with talks.

However, Italy's Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini, the leader of the far-right League party, blamed the renewed trade tensions on the European nations who dispatched soldiers to Greenland.

"The eagerness to announce the dispatch of troops here and there is now bearing its bitter fruit," he wrote on X.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 13:46:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KBUGWXOZ2FKSDLY3LLDBTW3GBY.jpg?auth=b363b2733b36947c32ef5ec432bfd5c610f613232f24a0b901349e56d5252085&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Britain will not yield to pressure from Trump on Greenland, Starmer says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/britain-will-not-yield-pressure-trump-greenland-starmer-says-2026-01-21/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 21 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he would not yield to Donald Trump on his opposition to U.S. demands to acquire Greenland, adding that the U.S. president had reversed his prior support for a Chagos Islands deal to put pressure on Britain.

Starmer has called for "calm discussion" on Greenland and indicated on Monday he did not wish to escalate a trade war, after Trump threatened tariffs on Britain and other European countries unless he was allowed to buy Greenland .

The next day Trump said Britain had been stupid and weak to agree a deal to cede sovereignty of the Chagos Islands in the Indian Ocean in order to secure the future of a U.S.-UK air base there. When the deal was announced, Trump's administration expressed support for it.

Starmer has sought close ties with Trump in order to preserve trade and security ties, but in some of his sharpest criticism of Trump, Starmer said he would not be bullied into changing his view that the future of Greenland should be decided by its people and by Denmark.

'FOOLHARDY' TO RIP UP RELATIONSHIP WITH U.S.

"I will not yield, Britain will not yield, on our principles and values about the future of Greenland under threats of tariffs, and that is my clear position," Starmer told lawmakers, adding the Danish prime minister would visit London on Thursday.

Starmer said that Trump's criticism of the Chagos Islands deal with Mauritius was because "he wants me to yield on my position, and I'm not going to do so".

"President Trump deployed words on Chagos yesterday that were different from his previous words of welcome and support," Starmer said.

"He deployed those words yesterday for the express purpose of putting pressure on me and Britain in relation to my values and principles on the future of Greenland."

In response to questions from lawmakers urging Starmer to go further in standing against Trump, Starmer said it was still important to work with the U.S. on issues such as Ukraine.

"That does not mean we agree with the U.S. on everything," he said. "But it is foolhardy to think that we should rip up our relationship with the U.S., abandon Ukraine and so many other things that are important to our defence, security and intelligence."</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 13:47:16 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/EPXQKTUNXVPSTHINGX2PF7NAGE.jpg?auth=d4fa8de874c005d62b2020be7f52897f70b68925848546e5e2a1af01ec7b5812&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Drone attacks shock city in central Sudan as war inches closer</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/drone-attacks-shock-city-central-sudan-war-inches-closer-2026-01-21/</link><description>EL OBEID, Sudan, Jan 21 - Drone strikes have intensified in and around al-Obeid in central Sudan as the country's devastating civil war closes in on the army-controlled city, causing significant civilian deaths in at least two cases, residents say.

The city is one of Sudan's most important and the capital of North Kordofan state, part of the wider Kordofan region that stands between the RSF's Darfur stronghold and the army-controlled eastern half of the country.

After the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) tightened their grip on the westernmost Darfur region in late October, they shifted their focus to Kordofan and drones have struck weekly in and around al-Obeid, residents say.

At around the same time, the paramilitary's ground forces began taking over towns and villages across the Kordofan region, while also besieging cities in South Kordofan state, according to residents.

The force has not yet approached al-Obeid, where daily life has continued despite the looming threat and an exodus late last year as the war intensified.

The army and allied forces have positioned themselves on the outskirts of the city.

Sudan's war erupted in April 2023 after the army and RSF clashed over their roles in a planned political transition. It has driven half the population into hunger and famine and decimated the country's economy. Drones have come to play an increasingly dominant role, with the RSF in particular using them to usurp the army's early air dominance .

Overall deaths from the conflict are hard to estimate, though researchers say at least tens of thousands have been killed.

More than 100 civilians were killed in the first half of December across the Kordofan region, according to the U.N. human rights office.

In al-Obeid, satellite imagery from the Yale Humanitarian Research Lab shows the appearance of about 100 new burial mounds in two cemeteries in the two weeks between January 2 and 14.

The imagery also shows evidence of bombardment of the city's power station, as well as the construction of berms around the city, a possible defense against future RSF encirclement.

In the al-Obeid area, residents say the worst of the incidents happened on November 5 in al-Luweib village.

Dozens had gathered from afar for a funeral when an ambulance belonging to the army-aligned Joint Forces drove past, and soon after a drone followed.

The drone, which residents assumed was directed by the RSF, fired on the funeral gathering, killing 65 people, all of them women and children, according to four al-Luweib residents who spoke to Reuters.

The incident echoes frequent attacks documented by Reuters in al-Fashir, Darfur, near or against ambulances and clinics alleged by the RSF to be harbouring enemy forces.

"We were sitting, and all of sudden the drone hit us. I went outside and felt something hitting me and I didn't know what it was. They told me it was a drone," said one of the witnesses, Safaa Hassan, who had burn marks on her arms and a shrapnel injury on her leg. "The yard was full of women," she said.

Victims' bodies, some of them torn apart by the impact, were later buried in a mass grave, the residents told Reuters.

Reuters could not independently verify the accounts. The RSF did not respond to a request for comment.

More recently, in early January, a drone strike killed Abdallah Mohamed Ahmed's wife, seven of his grandsons, and two other female relatives when it hit the home in al-Obeid they had rented after fleeing their village following an RSF attack.

They are among about 43,000 who fled their homes in North Kordofan and about 65,000 who have fled the region as a whole between late October and December 31, according to the U.N.'s International Organization for Migration.

"We found the children under the rubble, under the iron, under the beds. Only God knows the state of the children," said Moussa Adam, a neighbour present at the time of the attack.

"[They] could not achieve their goals they are looking for, so they started killing the citizens and terrorising the citizens," Ahmed said of the RSF.

Imagery obtained by Yale researchers corroborated the targeting of the home.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 13:47:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BDJ2SMMGVJKNZLZSTJZ273GMIM.jpg?auth=b770b5ccb7f3eb7031634e563da121ab9694324f8f5cc26713d0c9053540070b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Part found near Spain train crash site may be missing undercarriage, experts say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/part-found-near-spain-train-crash-site-may-be-missing-undercarriage-experts-say-2026-01-21/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 13:48:07 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Pakistan to join Trump's 'Board of Peace' on Gaza</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/pakistan-join-trumps-board-peace-gaza-2026-01-21/</link><description>ISLAMABAD, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Pakistan will join U.S. President Donald Trump's "Board of Peace" to help achieve lasting peace in Gaza, its foreign ministry said on Wednesday.

Pakistan hoped "concrete steps will be taken towards the implementation of a permanent ceasefire" as well as to boost aid and Gaza's reconstruction, the ministry said in a statement.

The announcement came after Pakistani army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir flew to Davos, three Pakistani officials told Reuters.

Munir, along with Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, is likely to see Trump, they said.

They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to disclose the information to the media.

Pakistan army's public relations wing did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.

The board, set up late last year under Trump's Gaza plan, is aimed at resolving global conflicts.

Some countries have reacted with caution to the initiative, although the U.S. has said that over 20 countries have agreed to join so far.

Pakistan was invited by Trump to join the board, the ministry said.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 13:48:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/SUUFVXA37NJQHMJIYSP62VUVXM.jpg?auth=670b8e62025758b28cc9819a28cfbe54045f2bc973006b75401441de43e861ef&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Macron's 'Top Gun' shades win the internet</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/davos/macrons-top-gun-shades-win-internet-leaders-wrangle-over-greenland-2026-01-21/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 13:49:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Syria says seven soldiers killed in a drone attack by Kurdish forces</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/syria-says-seven-soldiers-killed-drone-attack-by-kurdish-forces-2026-01-21/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 13:49:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Costa Rica's ruling party heads for victory in February elections, poll shows</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/costa-ricas-ruling-party-heads-victory-february-elections-poll-shows-2026-01-21/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 13:50:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Drone attacks shock city in central Sudan as war inches closer</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/drone-attacks-shock-city-central-sudan-war-inches-closer-2026-01-21/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 13:50:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Costa Rica's ruling party heads for victory in February elections, poll shows</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/costa-ricas-ruling-party-heads-victory-february-elections-poll-shows-2026-01-21/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 13:50:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Denied mourning: The ordeal of the family of Robina Aminian, killed in Iran</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260121-denied-mourning-the-ordeal-of-the-family-of-robina-aminian-killed-in-iran</link><description>Robina Aminian, 23, was a textile design student at a prestigious Tehran university, passionate about her field and the opportunity it provided to inject beauty into her world. “Robina was full of life, she made us very happy, she was unique,” recounted her aunt, Hali Noori.

From Norway, where she currently lives, Noori agreed to talk about her niece, who was killed on Thursday, January 8, in the Iranian capital by security forces. "What is happening in Iran is a crime against humanity. To remain silent is to be complicit in it. Close the Iranian embassies, stand with the Iranian people, not with the Islamic Republic," she said, addressing the international community.

Aminian, a student at Tehran’s Shariati Technical and Vocational College, talked a lot about the future, explained her aunt. “She was determined and creative, she dreamed of living in Milan.”

On January 8, the young Iranian woman was working on her fabrics, along with other students, in a university studio when an anti-regime demonstration erupted. She joined the crowd gathered on the outskirts of the campus. That evening, her family received a call from her friends to tell them that Aminian had been shot.

Her parents, who live in Kermanshah, a predominantly Kurdish city in northwestern Iran, immediately got in their car in the middle of the night and drove to Tehran, nearly 300 miles away. Unfortunately, they arrived too late. The body of their daughter, who had been shot in the back of the head, had already been taken to a large morgue.

“The officers who were there did not allow my sister to see Robina. She begged them, ‘I just want to find my child, please, I want to see my child.’ To put an end to the commotion, they let her in,” Noori recounted.

Aminian’s mother searched for her daughter among hundreds of “beautiful faces” wrapped in black plastic body bags.

“The family told me that the bodies were piled on top of each other, that the smell of blood was everywhere, and that when she recognised the face of her sweet Robina, she took her in her arms and could not let go,” said Noori.

“She held her so tightly that the officers couldn't tear her away from her [daughter’s body]. They tried many times to separate them, but no one could.” The distraught mother then asked to be allowed to show the body to the family waiting outside. “She took her, put her child in the car, and they fled,” Noori explained.

“I can't imagine what my sister was going through at that moment,” said the aunt, her voice trembling. "She drove hundreds of miles to Kermanshah, sitting in the back seat with her child's body on her lap. My family says Robina's blood was everywhere: on her clothes and on her mother. My family said she [the mother] didn't want to take off her clothes; she wanted to keep her daughter’s blood on her."

After a long journey, the family arrived in Kermanshah, where the authorities refused permission to bury the young student, to prevent any protest gatherings at her funeral. The family then traveled to several towns in the region, but local authorities also refused to allow a burial.

The parents finally found “a little place” to bury their daughter, after digging a grave themselves, in a location unknown to the aunt in Norway. “They just wanted to bury their child so that no one would take her away from them,” Noori explained.

The family was denied an opportunity to even mourn the deceased. None of the mosques in Kermanshah or Marivan, the family hometown near the border with Iraqi Kurdistan , would give them permission to hold a memorial service.

The young woman’s family was then ensnared in a security-surveillance trap. In Kermanshah, the entrance to the family home was under surveillance. “An officer was stationed at their door and wouldn't let anyone in,” recounted Noori.

In Marivan, around 200 km north of Kermanshah, where Noori's mother – the deceased’s grandmother – lives, agents were also stationed outside the family home. They prevented relatives from offering their condolences. “They said they had orders to shoot and didn't even let my cousin in. I've never seen such cruelty,” said Noori, her voice breaking with grief and anxiety.

Since then, Noori has been plunged into total darkness. From Norway, she’s had no news from her family in Iran. The widespread shutdown of the internet and international communications has prevented any information from leaving the country, especially in the country’s Kurdish regions. Noori is very worried, particularly about her mother's health, as the ageing woman has a heart condition and recently suffered two strokes.

"The authorities want us to remain silent. But I have decided to be the voice of Robina and the thousands of young people we have lost. I grieve for them, for all those precious lives, those dreams and hopes that have been thrown into black bags in Kahrizak," she said, referring to a morgue near Tehran that was overwhelmed with bodies after several days of protests – and has become a symbol of the regime’s brutality.

He had not shouted slogans, joined protesters or raised a fist.

A friend, speaking by telephone from the Iranian capital, described the moment in a voice cracking with grief: Arash fell instantly, lifeless on the pavement. He was 22.

The friend, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to fear for his security, said they had paused on the sidewalk to watch a protest in nearby Vanak Square when security forces in black uniforms arrived and began firing randomly towards the demonstrators .

Arash’s death on January 8 is an example of what witnesses say has been a reality of the country's latest anti-government protests -- bystanders uninvolved in the unrest caught in gunfire, or killed as they tried to flee the chaos.

Reuters was unable to independently verify this account or similar witness reports of deaths during the state’s crackdown on the unrest, and could not determine how many of the thousands killed were bystanders or people merely near the protests when they were shot.

But accounts from families and witnesses suggest that indiscriminate force used by security forces to crush the unrest killed many civilians who were not participating, leaving relatives to scour hospitals, morgues and detention centres for answers.

Officials in Iran could not be reached for comment about the deaths described in this story as authorities began blocking telephone lines and internet connections from January 8, when protests spread nationwide. From January 13, Iranians have been able to make outgoing international phone calls, while calls into the country remain blocked.

There was no immediate response to requests for comment sent to the Iranian U.N. missions in Geneva and New York.

Authorities have blamed the unrest and deaths on “terrorists and rioters” backed by exiled opponents and foreign adversaries , the United States and Israel. State TV aired footage of burned police and government buildings, mosques and smashed banks it said had been attacked by "terrorists and rioters"

The U.S.-based HRANA rights group said it has so far verified 4,519 unrest-linked deaths, including 4,251 protesters, 197 security personnel, 35 people aged under 18 and 38 bystanders who it says were neither protesters nor security personnel.

HRANA has 9,049 additional deaths under review. An Iranian official told Reuters the confirmed death toll until Sunday was more than 5,000 , including 500 members of the security forces.

The protests began on December 28 as modest demonstrations in Tehran’s Grand Bazaar over economic hardship and quickly spread nationwide.

Within days crowds in cities and towns were calling for an end to clerical rule, and state TV showed footage of what it called "rioters" burning images of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .

Amnesty International said in a report it had documented security forces positioned on streets, rooftops — including those of residential buildings, mosques and police stations — repeatedly firing rifles and shotguns loaded with metal pellets, often aiming at unarmed individuals’ heads and torsos.

It said the evidence points to a coordinated nationwide escalation in the security forces’unlawful use of lethal force against mostly peaceful protesters and bystanders since the evening of January 8.

The unrest has posed one of the gravest threats to Iran’s clerical establishment in years, with U.S. President Donald Trump repeatedly threatening to intervene if protesters continued to be killed on the streets or were executed.

Iran's judiciary has indicated that execution of those detained during protests may go ahead.

Numerous accounts from inside Iran, including from people who have since left the country, said security forces fired live ammunition indiscriminately, turning streets — particularly on January 8 and 9 — into what witnesses likened to war zones.

Among the victims was Fariba, a 16-year-old girl described by her mother, Manijeh, as curious and full of life.

On a night when she went with her mother to a nearby square simply to observe, security forces on motorcycles attacked the protesters.

Manijeh clutched her daughter’s hand and sought shelter behind a parked car amid the gunfire. In the ensuing panic, she lost her grip and mother and daughter became separated.

"I searched street after street, screaming her name,” Manijeh recounted, sobbing over the phone. “She was gone.”

That night, the family scoured police stations and hospitals. They found Fariba two days later in a black body bag inside the Kahrizak Forensic Medical Centre in south Tehran, shot in the heart, her body cold.

Officials told the family that "terrorists" had killed her.

“No,” her mother said. “I was there that night. The security forces opened fire on people. They killed my child.”

Videos on social media showed footage of families searching for their relatives among hundreds of body bags in morgues and the Kahrizak Centre. Reuters verified the location of the videos as Kahrizak Centre, although the identity of the people and the date when the videos were filmed could not be verified.

A physician who left Iran on January 14 said hospitals were overwhelmed with gunshot victims. In Karaj, west of Tehran, a resident described security forces deploying automatic rifles against protesters and bystanders on January 8.

Similar accounts emerged from the western city of Kermanshah, where Revolutionary Guards used armoured vehicles and tanks to contain demonstrations.

In Isfahan, the brother of a 43-year-old man recounted holding his sibling’s blood-soaked body after security forces shot him. "His only act was sheltering teenage protesters fleeing into his shop," said Masoud, 38, by telephone.

Like other Iranians interviewed for this story, Masoud asked for his full name to be withheld for fear of reprisals.

In another case, the family of Nastaran, a 28-year-old elementary school teacher in Tehran, spent days searching for her after she visited a cousin on January 9 and never returned.

They found her body in a warehouse near Tehran. She had been shot by security forces, said Nastaran's father.

Authorities allowed retrieval only on condition of burial in the family’s hometown in central Iran and pressured them to blame “terrorists” — a claim the relatives rejected, he said.

Another family in the northern city of Rasht said security forces stormed their apartment after spotting their 33-year-old daughter, Sepideh, watching protests from a window.

"They smashed doors, cursing and yelling. They detained her. We don't know where she is," said Morteza, her brother.

"My sister’s two young children cry for her; her husband has been warned of arrest if he keeps searching for her."</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 15:34:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CZQVKUVJ75LXPJFQKXPUXO5NDI.jpg?auth=fbcaf6a293a4fa1d5e083ed523d9a5d16e38c8d1ad480e485d7af84089692b51&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>How Syria's government has redrawn map with advances against the Kurds</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/how-syrias-government-has-redrawn-map-with-advances-against-kurds-2026-01-21/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 15:34:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Hopeful yet wary, Venezuelans across Latin America mull going home</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/hopeful-yet-wary-venezuelans-across-latin-america-mull-going-home-2026-01-21/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 15:35:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Almost 60% of Kyiv without power as Russian strikes shatter grid</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/almost-60-kyiv-without-power-russian-strikes-shatter-grid-2026-01-21/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 15:36:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Trump: We're reasonably close to a deal to end Ukraine war</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/davos/trump-were-reasonably-close-deal-end-ukraine-war-2026-01-21/</link><description>DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 21 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday said he thought "we're reasonably close" to a deal to end the war between Russia and Ukraine, adding he would meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy later in the day.

Plumes of smoke still lingered, and the current death toll of 20 is expected to rise as police and the state coroner searched for bodies in apartment blocks destroyed by the fires.

As searches continued, residents began clearing debris and rebuilding with aid mostly from neighbors and volunteers.

Carlos Lopez, a city councillor from nearby Cobquecura, gathered money, nails, wood, cement and other construction materials with help from local businesses and delivered them by truck to Punta de Parra, one of the hardest-hit areas that saw dozens of homes destroyed.

"We saw the desperation and the need and put our hand on our heart," Lopez said.

The truck ran out of wood before local resident Doralisa Silva, 34, could get any, but she received toys and jackets for her two-year-old daughter, Celeste. They were sheltering beneath metal sheets propped against a surviving cement wall.

"It was chaotic and painful, seeing all your dreams disappear overnight," Silva said.

When the fire broke out, Silva tried to flee the town with her daughter but exits were engulfed, forcing her to take refuge in a dirt field by their home.

Silva and other affected residents praised community help but criticized what they described as a lack of national government support.

"All the help we have right now has been from people who’ve delivered meals, food, everything," said neighbor Nancy Barrientos, 44, who called for tents, bathrooms or clear information from authorities.

The mayor of nearby Penco, Rodrigo Vera, said local governments were restoring basic services such as electricity but echoed criticism of a slow national response.

"It took 12 hours to declare an emergency," Vera said, adding the delay had hindered deployment of military and firefighting resources. "Everything has been slow. People's pain isn't tomorrow, it was yesterday."

Outgoing President Gabriel Boric visited Concepcion on Sunday but not the destroyed communities, citing security concerns.

In Temuco on Tuesday, Boric said reconstruction would begin once searches for victims were complete and that emergency housing and financial aid were starting.

"We are working at maximum speed, but there are processes that must be respected," Boric said.

His office did not immediately reply to a request for comment.

Boric's government was criticized for a slow reconstruction following deadly fires in Valparaiso in 2024 . President-elect Jose Antonio Kast, who takes office on March 11, has vowed to prioritize reconstruction in fire-hit communities.

Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov, who was chief of Russia's Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Protection Troops, and his assistant, Ilya Polikarpov, were killed outside an apartment building in Moscow after a bomb hidden in an electric scooter was remotely detonated in December 2024.

Ukraine's SBU intelligence service said it was behind the high-profile hit, one of a string of targeted killings it has organised inside Russia to punish people it deems responsible for Moscow's war in Ukraine. Russia says the killings amount to acts of state terrorism.

Uzbek national Akhmadzhon Kurbonov and three accomplices were found guilty of various crimes related to the Kirillov killing, including terrorism and the illegal trafficking of explosives, Russian investigators said on Wednesday.

The three accomplices were given jail sentences in maximum security correctional prison camps ranging from 18 to 25 years, the Investigative Committee, which handles serious crimes, said in a statement.

Kurbonov, who is now due to spend the rest of his life in a special regime correctional prison camp, pleaded guilty to the charges, while the others did not, Russian media reported. Reuters was not able to contact lawyers for the men.

The Investigative Committee said Kirillov's murder had been planned in Ukraine.

The perpetrators had smuggled the explosives into Russia from Poland, and one of the four men, Robert Safaryan, had stored the components at his home in Russia, it said.

Kurbonov had then assembled the bomb, planted it and remotely detonated it as Kirillov and Polikarpov stepped out of the building.

A string of senior Russian military figures have been killed since the start of the war in Ukraine nearly four years ago.

The latest was Lieutenant General Fanil Sarvarov , head of the Russian General Staff's army operational training directorate, who died after a bomb planted under his car went off last month.

Ukraine has not claimed responsibility for Sarvarov's death.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 15:36:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/C5WKOOQZAVIFNCBKBTHXEZ7UCU.jpg?auth=44902cbe463d4e448f2a7408ac09467e1a2879ad486bf26461154f36a8bc4a41&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump says he wants immediate negotiations to purchase Greenland</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/davos/trump-says-he-wants-immediate-negotiations-purchase-greenland-2026-01-21/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 15:36:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>France puts G7 finance ministers' meeting off to next week</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/france-puts-g7-finance-ministers-meeting-off-next-week-2026-01-21/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 15:36:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Number of jailed journalists fell from record high in 2025, CPJ report says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/number-jailed-journalists-fell-record-high-2025-cpj-report-says-2026-01-21/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 15:36:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Israel issues evacuation warning to residents of three Lebanese villages ahead of strikes</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-issues-evacuation-warning-residents-three-lebanese-villages-ahead-strikes-2026-01-21/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 15:36:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Chile’s fire-ravaged communities pull together as frustrations mount over state response</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/chiles-fire-ravaged-communities-pull-together-frustrations-mount-over-state-2026-01-21/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 15:36:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Court jails man who killed Russian chemical weapons chief at Ukraine's behest for life</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/court-jails-man-who-killed-russian-chemical-weapons-chief-ukraines-behest-life-2026-01-21/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 15:36:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Trump says he wants immediate negotiations to purchase Greenland</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/davos/trump-says-he-wants-immediate-negotiations-purchase-greenland-2026-01-21/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 15:36:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>France puts G7 finance ministers' meeting off to next week</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/france-puts-g7-finance-ministers-meeting-off-next-week-2026-01-21/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 15:37:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Number of jailed journalists fell from record high in 2025, CPJ report says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/number-jailed-journalists-fell-record-high-2025-cpj-report-says-2026-01-21/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 15:37:02 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Israel issues evacuation warning to residents of three Lebanese villages ahead of strikes</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-issues-evacuation-warning-residents-three-lebanese-villages-ahead-strikes-2026-01-21/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 15:37:03 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>No formal communication yet with Trump on LA 2028 Games, says IOC</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/no-formal-communication-yet-with-trump-la-2028-games-says-ioc-2026-01-21/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 15:37:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Israeli strike kills three journalists in Gaza, civil defence agency says</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260121-israeli-strike-kills-three-journalists-gaza-civil-defence-agency-says</link><description>An Israeli strike in the centre of Gaza killed three journalists on Wednesday, including a freelancer who regularly contributed for AFP, the Palestinian territory's civil defence agency said, despite the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas .

In a statement, the civil defence said "the bodies of the three journalists killed in an Israeli air strike in the Al-Zahra area southwest of Gaza City were transported to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah".

It named the dead as Mohammed Salah Qashta, Abdul Raouf Shaat and Anas Ghneim.

Since October 10, a fragile US-sponsored truce in Gaza has halted the large-scale fighting between Israeli forces and Hamas, but both sides have alleged frequent violations.

Israeli forces have killed at least 466 Palestinians in Gaza since the ceasefire took effect, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory, with the Israeli military saying that militants have killed three of its soldiers during the same period.

Shaat had contributed regularly to AFP as a photo and video journalist, but at the time of the strike he was not on assignment for the agency.

The Israeli military said it was checking the reports.

The civil defence, which operates as a rescue force under Hamas authority, said in an earlier statement that an Israeli drone strike had targeted "a civilian vehicle" near Al-Zahra.

Media watchdog Reporters Without Borders said that Israeli forces killed at least 29 Palestinian journalists in Gaza between December 2024 and December 2025.

The most deadly single attack was a "double-tap" strike on a hospital in south Gaza on August 25, which killed five journalists, including two contributors to international news agencies Reuters and the Associated Press.

In total, nearly 220 journalists have died since the start of the Gaza war in October 2023, making Israel the biggest killer of journalists worldwide for three years running, RSF data shows.

Last week, US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff announced the start of phase two of the Gaza ceasefire, saying it aimed to pave the way for reconstruction and the demilitarisation of all armed factions in the territory.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 15:37:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/eb2d00a0-f6d5-11f0-8cb9-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26021519159970.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US and Europe "need each other" says NATO chief at Davos</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/us-and-europe-need-each-other-says-nato-chief-at-davos</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 15:37:22 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/7c684aba-f6d2-11f0-ac0c-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260121-140051-140900-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Mercosur delayed by two years as MEPs refer it to top EU court</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/mercosur-delayed-by-two-years-as-meps-refer-it-to-top-eu-court</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 15:37:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/cc29d898-f6d2-11f0-8a31-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260121-133342-133745-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>What is Trump's 'Board of Peace' and who has joined so far?</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/what-is-trumps-board-peace-who-has-joined-so-far-2026-01-21/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 16:50:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Trump says he will meet with Ukraine's Zelenskiy, deal 'reasonably close'</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-says-he-will-meet-with-ukraines-zelenskiy-deal-reasonably-close-2026-01-21/</link><description>DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 21 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he would meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Switzerland, adding that he felt Zelenskiy and Russian President Vladimir Putin were now at a point where they could reach a deal to end the war.

Trump said he was dealing with Putin, who he said wanted to make a deal to end the nearly four-year-old war, adding that he thought Zelenskiy was also ready to reach an agreement.

Both leaders had backed away from an agreement before, but a deal was now "reasonably close," Trump said in a discussion after his prepared remarks to world leaders and business executives in Davos, Switzerland.

Trump twice said he would meet with Zelenskiy later on Wednesday, a fact disputed by a source familiar with Zelenskiy's schedule, but later said the meeting was planned for Thursday.

Ukraine will mark the fourth anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion on February 24.

Trump said he had expected to negotiate a deal to end the war sooner, but there was "abnormal hatred" between the two leaders. Last week, Trump told Reuters that Zelenskiy was the main impediment to reaching an agreement.

On Wednesday, he said Washington was getting closer to brokering a ceasefire agreement.

"I think I can say that we're reasonably close," he said. "We have to get it stopped ... I believe they're at a point now where they can come together and get a deal done. And if they don't, they're stupid."</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 16:50:44 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/RTDGZ6P2RJOBDBSAP4MOJSRT3A.jpg?auth=4b85abb8b8b73a6b653f04afa88413f8c22438fa08465e7e52bdadf0b3452c97&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Syria accuses Kurds of breaking truce in threat to chances of deal</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/syria-accuses-kurds-breaking-truce-threat-chances-deal-2026-01-21/</link><description>DAMASCUS, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Syria's government said a drone strike by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces killed seven of its soldiers on Wednesday, though the SDF denied this, in an incident that threatens to derail a ceasefire after days of fighting in the northeast.

The Syrian army called the attack, which it said took place as soldiers were securing a captured military base containing explosives, a dangerous escalation.

The SDF, previously the main U.S. ally in Syria, said it had not carried out a strike and that the blast had occurred when Syrian soldiers were moving explosives. It accused the Syrian army of violating the truce with attacks in several locations.

After days of rapid gains, the government on Tuesday said it had reached an understanding with the SDF for it to agree a plan over a four-day ceasefire to integrate into the central state, and that otherwise the SDF would face an assault on the two last main cities it holds.

The government advance against the SDF has put into doubt years of Kurdish de facto autonomy in the northeast and is significant for Syria's ties with the United States and Turkey, and for the fate of thousands of detained Islamist militants .

Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, a main ally of Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa, said on Wednesday that the SDF, which it regards as a terrorist group, must lay down arms and disband now to avoid further bloodshed.

The U.S., which backed the SDF as its main ally in driving Islamic State militants from swathes of Syria in bloody fighting a decade ago, on Tuesday urged the group to accept the government's offer.

The U.S. said the reasons for its partnership with the SDF had expired, but that it was still concerned about the fate of thousands of detained Islamic State militants and civilians associated with them in facilities guarded by the SDF.

The SDF said on Tuesday it accepted the ceasefire and that it would not engage in any military action unless attacked. SDF leader Mazloum Abdi had earlier said it regarded the protection of Kurdish majority areas as a "red line".

Wedged into a triangle between the Turkish and Iraqi borders, northeast Syria has areas with both Arab and Kurdish majorities and contains most of Syria's energy reserves.

Syrian troops were still positioned outside the last main Kurdish-held cities in the northeast, Hasakah and Qamishli, on Wednesday, Reuters reporters in the area said.

They had brought significant reinforcements the previous evening, with convoys of tanks and other military vehicles, as well as buses packed with fighters, arriving late into the night.

The troops had frozen their advance after Sharaa's new ceasefire announcement the previous evening, and were waiting for further orders that would be shaped by the SDF's reply to Sharaa's proposal.

RELATIONS WITH TURKEY, U.S.

The strategic picture in Syria has changed entirely over the past 13 months since rebels under former al Qaeda commander Sharaa ousted Iran-backed president Bashar al-Assad in a lightning advance that stunned the region.

The SDF, which had at times fought Sharaa's rebels during Syria's civil war, had controlled around a quarter of Syria where it maintained autonomous rule from Assad in Damascus.

The U.S. maintained a small military presence in the area and helped the SDF fend off attacks by Assad and allied forces. However, Sharaa has developed good ties with Washington, changing its relationship with the Damascus authorities.

Turkey, which regards the SDF as affiliated with the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) that has waged a decades-long insurgency inside Turkey, had a military presence in other parts of northern Syria in support of rebel groups there.

Ankara and the PKK are now engaged in a peace process and Turkey regards the end of SDF control in Syria as a vital part of that.

Speaking to parliament on Wednesday, Erdogan welcomed the declared ceasefire in Syria, saying he hoped the group's "full integration" into the Syrian state would herald a new era in Syria.

Erdogan and Trump discussed Syria in a phone call overnight, touching on the situation of prisoners in Syrian jails and the continued fight against Islamic State.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 16:52:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BNSGAE6FEVOW5DWBKMJO2VTCJ4.jpg?auth=fb53682faff02d9b0c4ae8be1934a83400361f5a93b8e024d405b0f6763005ea&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Davos participants react to Trump's Greenland speech</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/davos/davos-participants-react-trumps-greenland-speech-2026-01-21/</link><description>DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 21 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump ruled out the use of force in his bid to control Greenland on Wednesday but said in a speech in Davos that no other country can secure the autonomous Danish territory.

Here are comments from some of the people who listened to the speech at the World Economic Forum.

“It was a very insignificant speech."

"He wanted Greenland last week. He wanted Greenland two weeks ago, and he said we should negotiate. And the European Union said, 'We are happy to negotiate, and we never kicked you out. You kind of walked out. You can still put your bases there.'”

“This thing has unnerved many people, as seen from the stock market reaction.”

“I'm worried about NATO. I'm worried about truth and trust.”

CONRADIN CRAMER, HEAD OF THE CANTONAL GOVERNMENT OF THE CITY OF BASEL, SWITZERLAND

"We live in such crazy times that it is kind of a relief to hear that."

"If the president of the leading NATO country has to say he will not use force against another NATO country, and the world is relieved about that, that shows how crazy things are going now."

Gordon said the big takeaway was Trump ruling out use of force on Greenland: “There was a big sigh of relief in the room over that.”

However, he said the overall world view outlined by Trump in the speech would be deeply troubling to other nations: “We are entering a new world where middle powers have to figure out how to survive in a world where they can no longer count on U.S. protection.”

AL GORE, FORMER US VICE PRESIDENT

“To try and take a wrecking ball to these alliances the way he took a wrecking ball to the East Wing is literally insane.”

Asked if Trump’s actions were making NATO more secure, he said: “Of course not - it’s ridiculous.”

ALASTAIR CAMPBELL, BRITISH POLITICAL STRATEGIST

Asked what he saw as the main takeaway of the speech, Campbell said, “How embarrassing it all was.”</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 16:52:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/JQJZQLP3S5NOLDTRNSYN3OFHHY.jpg?auth=283596262bc6059a54d7271644ce89dd6acd3feb9d3528e6a2f167dfc8d93bf2&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump chides Carney at Davos, says Canada should be 'grateful'</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-chides-carney-davos-says-canada-should-be-grateful-2026-01-21/</link><description>DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 21 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump chided Mark Carney in a speech in Davos on Wednesday after the Canadian prime minister delivered a rousing address on a "rupture" in the international rules-based order.

In a wide-ranging speech at the World Economic Forum annual meeting in Switzerland, Trump touched on everything from his aim to acquire Greenland to his plans for Venezuela and the next chairman of the Federal Reserve .

But he reserved strong words for Carney, who received a standing ovation for his remarks at the forum on Tuesday.

"They should be grateful to us, Canada. Canada lives because of the United States. Remember that, Mark, the next time you make your statements," Trump said.

In his special address , Carney expressed Canada's desire to forge new alliances with like-minded countries as he navigates a tricky relationship with the Trump administration in Washington.

"We are in the midst of a rupture, not a transition," Carney said, pointing to how "great powers" were using economic integration as weapons and tariffs as leverage. He did not directly name Trump or the United States.

"We know the old order is not coming back. We shouldn't mourn it. Nostalgia is not a strategy," he said.

Trump has previously threatened to annex Canada, and on Tuesday shared an AI image of a map showing Canada and Greenland as part of the United States.

Carney's office declined to comment on Trump's speech.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 16:52:48 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/FD2ZGAGTMFPFJAJ4MMOKEQKQMU.jpg?auth=e60d9c4ba376840db545d0c81ed17dd126bf45a6b59f795569543604bfbc4739&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ecuador to impose 30% tariff on Colombian goods from February</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/ecuador-impose-30-tariff-colombian-goods-february-2026-01-21/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 16:53:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Pope Leo invited to join Trump's 'Board of Peace', cardinal says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/pope-leo-invited-join-trumps-board-peace-cardinal-says-2026-01-21/</link><description>VATICAN CITY, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Pope Leo is among world leaders invited to join U.S. President Donald Trump's "Board of Peace" , Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican's top diplomatic official, said on Wednesday.

Leo, the first U.S. pope and a critic of some of Trump's policies, is evaluating the invitation, he said.

"The pope has received an invitation and we are considering what to do," Parolin told journalists. "I believe it will be something that requires a bit of time for consideration before giving a response."

The board was initially aimed at ending the conflict in Gaza, however Trump has said it will have a much broader remit and resolve conflicts globally.

While some countries, such as Israel and Egypt, have accepted the invitation, a number of others have expressed caution with diplomats warning it could harm the work of the United Nations.

The Vatican press office did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Parolin's remarks.

Leo, who has shown a robust but quiet diplomatic style since being elected pope last May, has decried conditions for Palestinians living in Gaza several times, including in a forceful sermon on Christmas Eve.

The pope, leader of the world's 1.4 billion Catholics, rarely joins international boards. The Vatican has an extensive diplomatic service and is a permanent observer at the United Nations, often taking part in debates.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 16:54:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/U4DJSIUROZJA5GKYJT3T7IK5OQ.jpg?auth=a8a0dbb32c395ac8050649bb69fb43383ffb3de7554112df30909929b197d793&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Romania's far-right opposition dominates in latest opinion poll</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/romanias-far-right-opposition-dominates-latest-opinion-poll-2026-01-21/</link><description>BUCHAREST, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Romania's hard-right opposition party the Alliance for Uniting Romanians is towering over the four parties of the pro-European coalition government in popular support, an opinion poll showed on Wednesday, although no election is due until 2028.

AUR, the second-largest party in the country, led surveys throughout 2025 despite its leader George Simion ultimately losing a presidential election re-run last May.

The party opposes extending military aid to neighbouring Ukraine, is critical of the European Union's leadership and supportive of U.S. President Donald Trump's policies including on energy and immigration. Romania is a member of both the EU and NATO.

The latest survey, conducted by pollster INSCOP, showed that 40.9% of Romanians would vote for AUR, the highest level of support for a hard-right party in more than three decades.

The leftist Social Democrats (PSD), currently parliament's biggest party and a member of the ruling coalition, ranked a distant second with 18.2%.

The Liberal Party of Prime Minister Ilie Bolojan had 13.5% support. The other two ruling parties - the centre-right Save Romania Union (USR) and the ethnic Hungarian party UDMR - polled at 11.7% and 4.9%, respectively.

Romania's next general election is due in 2028.

The survey was conducted from January 12 to 15 and has a margin of error of 3.0%.

Romania re-ran a presidential election last year after it cancelled the original ballot in December 2024 on suspicion of Russian interference in favour of far-right frontrunner Calin Georgescu.

The cancelled vote plunged the country into its worst political crisis in decades, exposing its deep vulnerability to hybrid attacks and disinformation, dividing voters, crashing markets and threatening the country's investment-grade rating.

The broad coalition government which came to power after the subsequent ballot raised taxes and cut some state spending to help narrow the widest budget deficit gap in the EU.

While the measures helped keep Romania on the last rung of investment grade and unlocked EU funds, with the budget deficit expected to narrow to around 6% of economic output this year from more than 9% in 2024, they have also triggered protests and fuelled support for the opposition.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 16:54:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/YCYDTCJW7JLCHKVOSY4XSMBB5E.jpg?auth=0bbb54e78c5ea10568a38ae2a31c0321c15f02f1158b69de08a55786147fe389&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukrainian power grid executive dies while supervising repairs at damaged facility</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/ukrainian-power-grid-executive-dies-while-supervising-repairs-damaged-facility-2026-01-21/</link><description>KYIV, Jan 21 (Reuters) - A senior executive from Ukraine's state grid operator Ukrenergo died while supervising repairs at a power facility damaged by a Russian strike, the company said on Wednesday.

The company did not say how Oleksiy Brekht died, only describing it as "a tragic death". Evropeiska Pravda, a local media outlet, reported, citing unnamed sources, that Brekht had died from an electric shock at one of the company's substations.

"Death caught up with him where he felt it was necessary to be in order to restore light to people as quickly as possible," the company said in its statement on social media.

Ukrenergo did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the cause of Brekht's death.

Brekht, an executive who temporarily served as the head of the company last year, was 47, Ukrenergo said.

"I watched him yesterday, with those beautiful sunglasses. What the hell happened?" Trump said, speaking to global elites at the annual World Economic Forum in the Swiss mountain resort .

Macron's office has said the choice to wear the dark, reflective sunglasses during his speech, which took place indoors, was to protect his eyes because of a burst blood vessel.

Memes flourished across the internet after Macron's speech, some praising him for sporting a "Top Gun" look as he criticised Trump over Greenland, some criticising him.

During his speech on Tuesday, Macron described as "fundamentally unacceptable" Washington's threat to impose new tariffs, including on French wine and champagne, to bend Europe's resolve and allow it to buy Greenland.

Macron promised France will stand up to "bullies" .

On Wednesday, Trump harshly criticised Europe and its leaders.

And, while ruling out the use of force in his bid to control Greenland, he made clear he wanted to own the Arctic island.

NATO leaders have warned that Trump's Greenland strategy could upend the alliance, while the leaders of Denmark and Greenland have offered a wide array of ways for a greater U.S. presence on the strategic island territory of 57,000 people.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 16:54:32 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/Z422PV6AQBMXRHIQFF5CZDELKU.jpg?auth=00b609a4eddcea96814ef2a89bd163ea616dd615ab4bf6e09503a6200343bc4f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump chides Carney at Davos, says Canada should be 'grateful'</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-chides-carney-davos-says-canada-should-be-grateful-2026-01-21/</link><description>DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 21 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump chided Mark Carney in a speech in Davos on Wednesday after the Canadian prime minister delivered a rousing address on a "rupture" in the international rules-based order.

In a wide-ranging speech at the World Economic Forum annual meeting in Switzerland, Trump touched on everything from his aim to acquire Greenland to his plans for Venezuela and the next chairman of the Federal Reserve .

But he reserved strong words for Carney, who received a standing ovation for his remarks at the forum on Tuesday.

"They should be grateful to us, Canada. Canada lives because of the United States. Remember that, Mark, the next time you make your statements," Trump said.

In his special address , Carney expressed Canada's desire to forge new alliances with like-minded countries as he navigates a tricky relationship with the Trump administration in Washington.

"We are in the midst of a rupture, not a transition," Carney said, pointing to how "great powers" were using economic integration as weapons and tariffs as leverage. He did not directly name Trump or the United States.

"We know the old order is not coming back. We shouldn't mourn it. Nostalgia is not a strategy," he said.

Trump has previously threatened to annex Canada, and on Tuesday shared an AI image of a map showing Canada and Greenland as part of the United States.

Carney's office declined to comment on Trump's speech.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 16:55:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/FD2ZGAGTMFPFJAJ4MMOKEQKQMU.jpg?auth=e60d9c4ba376840db545d0c81ed17dd126bf45a6b59f795569543604bfbc4739&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ecuador to impose 30% tariff on Colombian goods from February</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/ecuador-impose-30-tariff-colombian-goods-february-2026-01-21/</link><description>BOGOTA, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Ecuador will impose a 30% tariff on goods from Colombia starting from February 1, President Daniel Noboa said on Wednesday, citing a trade deficit and lack of cooperation on fighting drug trafficking at their shared border.

"This measure will remain in place until there is a real commitment to jointly tackle drug trafficking and illegal mining on the border, with the same seriousness and determination that Ecuador is currently demonstrating," Noboa said on X.

Colombia's president's office, trade and foreign ministries told Reuters they were examining the measure.

Noboa has declared several states of emergency and recently mobilized over 10,000 soldiers to the country's three most violent provinces in a push to tackle organized crime in the Andean nation, which has sent murder rates soaring .

Noboa said Ecuador had not received "any cooperation" and cited an annual trade deficit exceeding $1 billion.

AUR, the second-largest party in the country, led surveys throughout 2025 despite its leader George Simion ultimately losing a presidential election re-run last May.

The party opposes extending military aid to neighbouring Ukraine, is critical of the European Union's leadership and supportive of U.S. President Donald Trump's policies including on energy and immigration. Romania is a member of both the EU and NATO.

The latest survey, conducted by pollster INSCOP, showed that 40.9% of Romanians would vote for AUR, the highest level of support for a hard-right party in more than three decades.

The leftist Social Democrats (PSD), currently parliament's biggest party and a member of the ruling coalition, ranked a distant second with 18.2%.

The Liberal Party of Prime Minister Ilie Bolojan had 13.5% support. The other two ruling parties - the centre-right Save Romania Union (USR) and the ethnic Hungarian party UDMR - polled at 11.7% and 4.9%, respectively.

Romania's next general election is due in 2028.

The survey was conducted from January 12 to 15 and has a margin of error of 3.0%.

Romania re-ran a presidential election last year after it cancelled the original ballot in December 2024 on suspicion of Russian interference in favour of far-right frontrunner Calin Georgescu.

The cancelled vote plunged the country into its worst political crisis in decades, exposing its deep vulnerability to hybrid attacks and disinformation, dividing voters, crashing markets and threatening the country's investment-grade rating.

The broad coalition government which came to power after the subsequent ballot raised taxes and cut some state spending to help narrow the widest budget deficit gap in the EU.

While the measures helped keep Romania on the last rung of investment grade and unlocked EU funds, with the budget deficit expected to narrow to around 6% of economic output this year from more than 9% in 2024, they have also triggered protests and fuelled support for the opposition.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 16:56:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/YCYDTCJW7JLCHKVOSY4XSMBB5E.jpg?auth=0bbb54e78c5ea10568a38ae2a31c0321c15f02f1158b69de08a55786147fe389&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukrainian power grid executive dies while supervising repairs at damaged facility</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/ukrainian-power-grid-executive-dies-while-supervising-repairs-damaged-facility-2026-01-21/</link><description>KYIV, Jan 21 (Reuters) - A senior executive from Ukraine's state grid operator Ukrenergo died while supervising repairs at a power facility damaged by a Russian strike, the company said on Wednesday.

Here is an overview of some of the most important prisons and camps holding IS-linked people in northeast Syria:

The two main prisons in Hasakah province are the Ghwayran and Panorama prisons, where thousands of battle-hardened IS fighters are held. Ghwayran, which was a school before being refurbished into a jail, holds around 4,000 inmates. Other prisons hold adolescent and juvenile boys, some of whom were born in Syria to parents who travelled to join IS.

Military personnel from a U.S.-led coalition secure the prison's outer perimeters and Kurdish forces maintain control inside the prison.

Reuters was granted rare access to one of those prisons in 2025 and spoke to detainees from Britain, Russia and Germany.

Other detention centres are located in the cities of Qamishli and Malikiyah, which - like Hasakah city - remain under Kurdish control.

The U.S. military said on Wednesday that it had transferred 150 IS fighters from a facility in Hasakah to "a secure location in Iraq." It said up to 7,000 IS detainees could ultimately be transferred from Syria to Iraqi facilities.

The Syrian government has taken over some of the other prisons holding IS detainees.

One of them is Shaddadi, which is in the Hasakah countryside. The SDF said it lost control of the prison as Syrian troops approached and that inmates escaped. Syria's government said the SDF abandoned its posts and released some 200 IS inmates, saying Syrian troops subsequently recaptured most of them.

A U.S. official confirmed that Syrian troops recaptured many of the 200 escapees, describing them as low-level IS members.

Another facility that came under Syrian government control is Al-Aqtan, in the neighbouring province of Raqqa.

Tens of thousands of civilians who fled IS's last strongholds as the group lost territory over the last decade were also rounded up by Kurdish security forces and held in two main camps, known as the al-Hol and Roj camps.

As of 2024, al-Hol held 44,000 people, virtually all of them women and children. Most of them are Syrians or Iraqis, but Westerners also live there in a separate annex.

Those held at the Roj camp also include some Westerners such as Shamima Begum, a British-born woman who joined IS. A resident of Roj told Reuters in 2025 that women from Tanzania and Trinidad also lived in the camp.

Kurdish forces said they were forced to pull out of al-Hol as government troops approached. On Wednesday, Reuters reporters saw dozens of children and women in black pressing up against the camp fence as Syrian government forces looked on.

It was not immediately clear what the status of the Roj camp was.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 16:57:32 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7V7BXYQQMRMUXNTYFVVCJ5EIME.jpg?auth=2d6c7c82e858e2be03949ee2240977a9deb7df2508ab730ed4b94943e801e1bd&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Britain's Prince William to visit Saudi Arabia in February</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/britains-prince-william-visit-saudi-arabia-february-2026-01-21/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Britain's Prince William will visit Saudi Arabia in February, Kensington Palace said in a statement on Wednesday.

Trump on Saturday vowed to slap tariffs of up to 25 percent on eight European nations opposed to US ambitions to annex the Danish autonomous territory.

The ‍EU assembly has been debating legislative proposals to remove many EU import duties on US ​goods, a key part of the agreement struck in Turnberry, ​Scotland, at the end of July, as well as to continue zero duties for US lobsters, initially agreed with Trump in 2020. The proposals require approval by the parliament and EU governments.

Many lawmakers have complained that the trade deal is lopsided, with the EU required to cut most import duties while ‍the US sticks to a broad rate of 15 percent. However, they had previously appeared willing to ​accept it, albeit with conditions, such as an 18-month sunset clause and measures to respond to possible surges of US imports.

The trade ‌committee of the European Parliament was due to set its position in votes on January 26-27. This ‍has now been postponed.

The chair of the committee Bernd Lange told a news conference on Wednesday that the new tariff threats had broken the Turnberry deal, saying it would now be put on hold until further notice.

However, freezing the deal risks angering Trump, which could lead to higher US tariffs. ‍The Trump administration has also ruled out any concessions, such as cutting tariffs on ‌spirits or steel, ​until the deal is in place.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 17:00:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/781164b6-d51b-11f0-b770-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25246511311278.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Replay: US President Donald Trump gives speech at Davos forum</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/replay-us-president-donald-trump-gives-speech-at-davos-forum</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 17:00:26 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/903e5b2c-f6de-11f0-ae45-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260121-143839-155036-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Le Pen admits "negligence" in EU fund embezzlement appeal trial</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/le-pen-admits-negligence-in-eu-fund-embezzlement-appeal-trial</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 17:00:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/f628d96e-f6e1-11f0-85cc-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260121-163941-164133-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>How many people have been killed during the crackdown on Iranian protesters?</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260121-how-many-people-killed-crackdown-iranian-protesters</link><description>Weeks after protests in Iran began on December 28 – and with a near-total Internet blackout since January 8 – it is still impossible for activists and observers to establish the exact number of people killed in the government crackdown on protesters. A provisional count puts the death toll at more than 4,500, with a possibility of "up to 20,000 dead".

Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei publicly acknowledged the deaths of "thousands” on January 17. The next day, Iranian authorities, including an anonymous official who spoke to the Reuters press agency, said that at least 5,000 people had been killed during these protests.

"The final toll is not expected to increase sharply," the official added. He blamed the deaths on “terrorists and armed rioters”.

Despite statements by the regime, the real toll could be much higher. Numbers calculated by observers and activists are a testament to the extent of the crackdown on protesters carried out by Iranian security forces.

Estimates of the death toll published by several media outlets were four times the number given by Iranian authorities. US media outlet CBS reported on January 13, for example, that between 12,000 and 20,000 people were feared to have been killed in these protests, based on information gathered by Iran -based activists working to compile a death toll from reports from medical officials across the country.

Iran International , a media outlet based in London, reported on January 12 that the death toll was 12,000. The report cited high-ranking government and security sources. The death toll was estimated even higher - between 16,500 and 18,000 people - in a January 18 article by the Sunday Times , which based its reporting on a database of information gathered by sources in 24 hospitals and emergency services across Iran.

Despite these varying estimates, most international agencies and media outlets, including FRANCE 24, relied on data gathered by two NGOs dedicated to human rights in Iran: the Norway-based Iran Human Rights and Human Rights Activists in Iran (HRANA), which is based in the United States.

HRANA reported on January 20 that there had been 4,519 "verified” deaths, including 197 members of military and government forces. The NGO added that there were a further 9,049 deaths “still under investigation”. These numbers, based on information communicated by families and medical sources, are the result of a process of victim identification carried out by sources on the ground.

Iran Human Rights reported on January 14 that they had verified 3,428 deaths (see the chart below). The organisation noted that the majority of victims were killed during protests held between January 8 and 12, the period when the crackdown was the most violent. While the internet blackout slowed down the process of verifying the death toll during these protests, these two organisations continue to update their numbers as information comes in.

Some social media users have criticised these death tolls, which remain lower even than those given by Iranian authorities. This conservative estimate is linked to the verification process used by these two NGOs.

"It should be noted that the total figure is an absolute minimum,” clarified Iran Human Rights in their latest report from January 14 , which contains data from only 15 of Iran’s 31 provinces.

Jennifer Connet, a Senior Legal Advisor with HRANA, explained how they gathered their numbers:

The figures we post should be understood as minimums, not estimates of the full scale of harm. These figures only reflect cases that have been independently verified through primary sources, which is a process that takes additional time, particularly given the extent of cases to verify in this situation and the internet blackout that is compromising information flow.

[We confirm] that each of the [...] confirmed deaths is individually identified and verified through primary sources inside Iran. The '[...] under investigation' refers to cases that are in the process of being independently verified.

In its latest report, published on January 20, HRANA specified that 9,049 additional deaths were currently under investigation. If verified, the death toll would increase significantly.

Aside from being provisional, the death toll is also incomplete because of the difficulty of accessing information on the ground due to the regime’s internet shutdown. For nearly two weeks, Iranian authorities have been blocking internet access in a large swathe of the country, preventing people from using messaging services or calls using the internet. Connet explained:

In response to the information vacuum, HRANA issued a public call via telegram urging citizens, eyewitnesses, and individuals with access to reliable documents, images and videos to participate in the independent documentation of the protests.

The internet shutdown poses serious obstacles to documentation and verification. HRA maintains deep concern regarding the internet blackout, which not only violates the right of Iranians to access information but cuts 90 million plus people off from the outside world and facilitates impunity for the continued excessive use of force against protesters, by enabling the concealment of violence and repression.

"We’ve noticed a significant decline in contact in recent days, which corresponds with the severity of communications restrictions,” she added. “However, even during this same period, we have been able to maintain limited contact thanks to more stable but less sophisticated forms of communication, like phone calls with our established contacts.”

Whatever the final death toll, the crackdown on this opposition movement has been historic in comparison to previous protests against the regime.

Around 500 protesters were killed in the 2022 protests in support of Mahsa Amini , who was killed by the morality police after being arrested for “wearing inappropriate clothing”.

Trump said the tariffs would start at 10 percent in February and climb to 25 percent in June, rates that would be high enough to increase costs and slow growth, potentially hurting Trump’s efforts to tamp down the high cost of living in the US.

The president in a text message that circulated among European officials this week linked his aggressive stance on Greenland to last year’s decision not to award him the Nobel Peace Prize. In the message, he told Norway’s Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store that he no longer felt “an obligation to think purely of Peace”.

As Trump’s motorcade headed down a narrow road to the speech site, Onlookers, including some skiers, lined the route as Trump’s motorcade arrived in the Swiss mountain town. Some made obscene gestures, and one held up a paper cursing the president.

Billionaires and business leaders nonetheless sought seats inside the forum’s Congress Hall, which had a capacity of around 1,000, to hear Trump. By the time he began, it was standing room only.

​​​​​Trump is expected to have around five bilateral meetings with foreign leaders while at the forum, where more than 60 other heads of state are in attendance, though further details weren't provided.

Here are the highlights of Trump's speech:

Trump insisted he wants to “get Greenland, including right, title and ownership”, but he said he wouldn’t employ force to achieve that.

“What I’m asking for is a piece of ice, cold and poorly located,” Trump said, declaring of NATO : “It’s a very small ask compared to what we have given them for many, many decades.”

He urged NATO to allow the US to take Greenland from Denmark and added an extraordinary warning, saying alliance members can say yes “and we’ll be very appreciative. Or you can say, ‘No,’ and we will remember.”

“This enormous unsecured island is actually part of North America,” Trump said. “That’s our territory.”

On several occasions during a speech which lasted ‌more than an hour, Trump mistakenly referred to Greenland as Iceland .

Trump said that the US is booming but Europe is “not heading in the right direction" which he blamed on European leaders' policy missteps in areas ranging from wind power and the environment to immigration and geopolitics.

“I love Europe and I want to see Europe go good, but it’s not heading in the right direction,” Trump said. He added, “We want strong allies, not seriously weakened ones."

Trump also proclaimed that, “When America booms the whole world booms,” and, “You all follow us down and you follow us up.”

Trump took a hectoring ​tone, chastising the United States' European allies for their insolence and disloyalty to the US.

He singled out French President Emmanuel Macron, taking aim at sunglasses his French counterpart wore a day earlier for health issues and accusing him of playing tough over pharmaceutical price negotiations.

"I watched him yesterday with those beautiful sunglasses – what the hell happened? But I watched him sort of be tough" over his hesitation to raise drug prices to be more in line with US rates, Trump said in an address to the economic forum.

"I said, 'Emmanuel you've been taking advantage of the United States for 30 years with prescription drugs. You really should do it, and you will do it,'" Trump said.

Trump also targeted Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney saying he "should be grateful" to Washington, a day after Carney warned of a rupture to the US-led global system.

" Canada lives because of the United States. Remember that, Mark, the next time you make your statements," Trump added.

Trump planned to use his Davos appearance to talk about making housing more attainable and other affordability issues that are top priorities for Americans, but his appearance at the gathering of global elites focused more on his gripes with other countries.

When he finally did mention housing, meanwhile, Trump suggested he didn't support a measure to encourage affordability. He said bringing down rising home prices hurts property values and makes homeowners who once felt wealthy because of the equity in their houses feel poorer.

White House officials had promoted the speech as a moment for Trump to try to rekindle populist support back in the US, where many voters who backed him in 2024 view affordability as a major problem.

About six in 10 US adults now say that Trump has hurt the cost of living, according to the latest survey by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.

US home sales are at a 30-year low with rising prices and elevated mortgage rates keeping many prospective buyers out of the market. So far, Trump has announced plans to buy $200 billion in mortgage securities to help lower interest rates on home loans, and has called for a ban on large financial companies buying houses.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 17:00:39 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/d2b9ff36-f6d6-11f0-afc7-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-21T143004Z-821579615-RC2Q5JAGQVIO-RTRMADP-3-DAVOS-MEETING-TRUMP.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump "does not appear to give regard to US softpower" as he addresses economic leaders</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/trump-does-not-appear-to-give-regard-to-us-softpower-as-he-addresses-economic-leaders</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 17:00:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/0507f130-f6de-11f0-9f7c-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/capture-21088938886970f0eb261638-87149254.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump addresses World Economic Forum in Davos, making many "false statements"</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/trump-addresses-world-economic-forum-in-davos-making-many-false-statements</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 17:00:43 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/d33c705a-f6dc-11f0-a962-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260121-155057-155513-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'I am not a criminal': Uganda opposition leader Bobi Wine hits back from hiding</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/africa/20260121-i-am-not-criminal-uganda-opposition-leader-bobi-wine-hits-back-from-hiding</link><description>Uganda 's opposition leader Bobi Wine said on Wednesday he was "not a criminal" after going into hiding following last week's election in which President Yoweri Museveni won a seventh term.

Wine, 43, a former singer turned politician who was arrested ahead of Uganda's last election in 2021, said on Saturday that he had escaped a police raid on his home . His whereabouts have been unknown since then.

He had denounced last Thursday's presidential election as "blatant theft".

In a phone interview, Wine said he was constantly on the move but was being "housed and protected by the common people".

Responding to a threat by Uganda's army chief and Museveni's son Muhoozi Kainerugaba, he said: "I'm not a criminal."

"I'm a presidential candidate and it's not a crime to run against his father," Wine – whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi – said.

On Tuesday, Kainerugaba, 51, who has made no secret of his desire to succeed his father, threatened in a post on X to hunt down and kill Wine.

"We have killed 22 NUP terrorists since last week," Kainerugaba wrote, referring to the opposition National Unity Platform led by Wine, who came second in the ballot.

"I'm praying the 23rd is Kabobi," he added, using his nickname for the opposition leader.

In a separate post, Kainerugaba called on Wine to give himself up.

"I am giving him exactly 48 hours to surrender himself to the Police," Kainerugaba wrote. "If he doesn't we will treat him as an outlaw/rebel and handle him accordingly."

Police spokesperson Kituma Rusoke said on ​Monday night that Wine was not being sought.

Asked about the future for his party, Wine said he did not have a firm plan.

"In a dictatorship, you don't draw a strategy, but you respond to the kind of oppression," he said.

Last week's ballot was marred by violence and an internet shutdown, while African observers said arrests and abductions had "instilled fear".

Museveni, 81, who won a landslide with 72 percent of the vote, has said the opposition are "terrorists" who had tried to use violence to overturn results.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 17:55:08 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/9432e6a4-f6ec-11f0-b854-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-15T110250Z-972052072-RC2L1JAZMMBF-RTRMADP-3-UGANDA-ELECTION.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump in Davos: 'He's just like Putin, something European leaders never fully understood'</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/trump-in-davos-he-s-just-like-putin-something-european-leaders-never-fully-understood</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 17:55:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/d4638cac-f6d2-11f0-9647-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260121-131540-132146-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>What is Donald Trump's Board of Peace?</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/what-is-donald-trump-s-board-of-peace</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 17:55:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/a3db763c-f626-11f0-a975-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-16T205052Z-356949125-RC2K2JAYBNZ7-RTRMADP-3-USA-TRUMP.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US military starts transferring Islamic State detainees from Syria to Iraq</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-military-starts-transferring-islamic-state-detainees-syria-iraq-2026-01-21/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 18:44:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>At least 8 Nigerian soldiers killed in Boko Haram attack in Borno</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/least-8-nigerian-soldiers-killed-boko-haram-attack-borno-2026-01-21/</link><description>MAIDUGURI, Nigeria, Jan 21 (Reuters) - At least eight Nigerian soldiers were killed and 50 wounded on when Islamist Boko Haram insurgents attacked a military formation in Borno State, security sources said on Wednesday.

The militants arrived by motorcycle and in armoured vehicles in the incident on Monday, the sources said.

A military source said the military formation was part of an offensive to flush out insurgents from the Timbuktu Triangle, a longstanding militant stronghold in northeastern Nigeria.

The insurgents engaged the troops in a heavy gun battle, according to the sources.

In a statement on Wednesday, the military said troops had cleared several Islamist strongholds in the Timbuktu Triangle and disrupted planned attacks with vehicle‑borne improvised explosive device (VBIED).

The military said troops neutralised one explosive‑laden vehicle but a second breached defensive positions, killing several soldiers and members of the Civilian Joint Task Force, a civilian militia that supports the military.

A CJTF member confirmed the attack and said government forces had been outnumbered during the assault.

The Timbuktu Triangle, a vast and difficult‑to‑access area spanning parts of Borno State, has for more than a decade served as a base for Boko Haram fighters launching coordinated attacks on military positions and civilian communities.

Boko Haram, a jihadist group that emerged in northeastern Nigeria in 2009, has killed tens of thousands of people and displaced millions across Nigeria and neighbouring countries.

The group has since split, with one faction aligning with Islamic State to form Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP), which has increasingly targeted military bases in recent years.

Despite repeated military offensives, Boko Haram and its splinter groups have continued to mount large‑scale attacks, exploiting difficult terrain, porous regional borders and a limited state presence in parts of the arid northeast.

The Nigerian military has since withdrawn its forces from the triangle to a base in Damboa, according to the sources. The bodies of those killed and the wounded were being transported to the military hospital at Maimalari Barracks in Maiduguri.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 18:45:31 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Death toll in Karachi mall fire climbs to around 50, official says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/death-toll-karachi-mall-fire-climbs-around-50-official-says-2026-01-21/</link><description>KARACHI, Pakistan, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Pakistani firefighters on Wednesday retrieved the bodies of up to 25 people from the debris of a shopping mall fire in Karachi , taking the death toll to around 50.

The port city's largest fire in more than a decade broke out late on Saturday and quickly spread through the sprawling Gul Plaza shopping complex, famous for its 1,200 family-owned stores selling wedding clothes, toys, crockery and other goods.

"We have found 20 to 25 dead bodies, or you call them remains," Deputy Commissioner Javed Nabi Khoso told reporters. He said the remains had been taken to a hospital for DNA matching.

Due to the difficulties in identification, he said it was difficult to give a precise update on the death toll, which stood at 29 on Tuesday.

A small crowd paying tribute to the victims lit candles near the site, with some holding images of those presumed killed.

Firefighters had been battling the inferno inside the mall until Tuesday. By the time it was brought under control, Gul Plaza was reduced to a pile of ash and debris.

A total of 84 people had been registered missing, according to a state-run rescue service. Police have said most of the missing are feared dead, meaning the toll could rise still further.

"It is a doomsday scenario," said shopkeeper Rehmat Khan after seeing inside what was left of the plaza. He said around 18 to 20 people had been in the shop, including six staff, when the fire erupted in the mall. All of them were missing, he said.

The blaze was Karachi's most deadly since an industrial site went up in flames in 2012, killing more than 260 people.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 18:45:42 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7ZSX67OIDFNE3HBX5QJEL4KBWU.jpg?auth=ae4523aa23423a47771c2f395a172b2e39da700b56f0e8f78f8cc002db8e76bd&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Slovenia will not join Trump's 'Board of Peace', prime minister says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/slovenia-will-not-join-trumps-board-peace-prime-minister-says-2026-01-21/</link><description>BELGRADE, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Slovenia's Prime Minister Robert Golob said on Wednesday his country will not accept an invitation from U.S. President Donald Trump to join his so-called "Board of Peace" .

Trump has invited dozens of world leaders to join the U.S.-led initiative, which he would chair and would initially aim to end the conflict in Gaza but then be expanded to tackle wars elsewhere.

"The main concern is that the committee's mandate is too broad and that it could dangerously undermine the international order based on the United Nations Charter," the N1 news web portal quoted Golob as saying.

"Although we find any initiative that can calm the situation in the Middle East to be commendable, this invitation dangerously encroaches on the broader international order and not just on pacification in Gaza," he said.

While some traditional U.S. allies have responded cautiously - and in a few cases have rejected Trump's offer over concerns it could harm the work of the United Nations - other countries, including some with strained ties with Washington, have accepted.

N1 cited Golob as saying he will not attend the signing of the initiative's founding charter at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on Thursday, but will instead attend the meeting of the European Council leaders in Brussels.

The speech in Iowa will focus on the economy and energy, Wiles told reporters on the way to Davos, Switzerland. Cabinet officials will also increase their domestic travel in the coming months, she said.

The domestic travel comes as frustration has grown among senior White House aides and Republican lawmakers over Trump’s emphasis on foreign ‌policy, rather than the economic and healthcare concerns dominating the election year.

Opinion polls show Americans ​are broadly unhappy with Trump's handling of the economy, and Trump conceded in an interview with Reuters last week that his Republican Party could struggle to retain its tenuous grip of Congress because the party of the president historically suffers ‍losses during midterm elections.

Trump's attention on foreign policy has included a military operation that led to the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro , escalating rhetoric about seizing Greenland, negotiating an end to Russia's war in Ukraine, and pushing an ambitious international Board of Peace , that aims to resolve conflicts ⁠globally.

On Wednesday, Trump ruled out the use of force , opens new tab in his bid to control Greenland, but said in a speech to ‍world leaders in Davos that no other country can secure the Danish territory. His comments overshadowed a speech that was intended to ‌focus primarily ‌on the U.S. economy.

Trump has struggled to convey a message on affordability , opens new tab that resonates with voters, and the president's aides and allies fear blowback in November since foreign policy is rarely a winning issue in U.S. congressional elections. While Trump is not on the ballot in November, Republicans view him as their best messenger on the economy and plan to use him ⁠to win over skeptical voters.

Some ⁠36% of Americans approve of ​Trump's overall handling of the economy, according to a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll. That is well below his initial 42% rating on the issue when he first took office last year, but up from a low of 33% in a December poll.

In recent days, the White ‍House has scrambled to offer Americans a slew of populist economic proposals to ease cost-of-living concerns.

Trump has proposed a cap on credit card interest rates at 10%, a ban on large investors buying up family housing and a directive to government-controlled mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to buy $200 ​billion in mortgage bonds to lower mortgage interest rates.

Half a dozen economists and ‍lenders who spoke to Reuters expressed skepticism that Trump's recent economic proposals will have any meaningful impact on the cost of living between now and ​November's congressional elections and some could even backfire.

The accounts, not previously reported and shared on condition of anonymity, showed that the U.S. did not stand in the way of an operation that has radically altered Syria's balance of power, at the expense of a one-time ally.

The meetings paved the way for Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa to score two major wins: advance his vow to unite all Syrian territory under one leadership and become the favored Syrian partner for the U.S. administration under President Donald Trump, the sources said.

His offensive effectively wiped out the autonomous zone that Kurdish authorities had hoped to maintain in Syria's northeast and tested the boundaries of Washington's support for Sharaa, who once led al Qaeda's local affiliate.

But the Syrian rebel-turned-president came out on top, with U.S. envoy Tom Barrack saying Washington could now partner with the Syrian state and had no interest in maintaining a separate role for the SDF.

"It seems Sharaa is a master strategist," said a U.S. source briefed on Washington's position on Syria.

The U.S. had been a backer of the SDF since 2015, when the force was conceived to expel the Islamic State group from Syria's northeast.

The SDF later used that territory to establish an autonomous enclave, with separate civilian and military institutions.

But in late 2024, Sharaa's rebel forces ousted longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad and pledged to bring all of Syria under the new government's control, including SDF-run areas.

After months of talks in 2025, a year-end deadline for the SDF to integrate with Damascus passed with little progress.

That's when momentum for an offensive began to build.

On January 4, a Damascus meeting between Syrian officials and the SDF on integration was abruptly shut down by a Syrian minister, according to three Kurdish officials.

The following day, a Syrian delegation traveled to Paris for U.S.-brokered talks with Israel on a security pact. Syrian officials have accused Israel of backing the SDF and in Paris, they urged Israeli officials to stop encouraging Kurds to delay integrating, two Syrian sources briefed on the meeting said.

While there, Syrian officials suggested a limited operation to recapture some SDF-held territory and received no objections, another Syrian source briefed on the matter said.

Syria's information and foreign ministries and the Israeli prime minister's office did not immediately respond to Reuters questions about the Paris meeting. The U.S. State Department referred Reuters to a statement by Barrack issued on Tuesday that urged the SDF to integrate and said the U.S. had no interest in a long-term military presence in Syria.

The Syrian government received a separate message from Turkey that Washington would approve an operation against the SDF if Kurdish civilians were protected, a Syrian official said.

Turkey has repeatedly intervened in Syria against the SDF, accusing it of ties to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party, which fought a decades-long insurgency in Turkey.

"The agreement in Paris gave the green light for this war," said Kurdish political official Hadiya Youssef.

Two weeks later, the offensive was underway and Washington began signaling to the SDF that it was retracting its longstanding support, a U.S. diplomat, one of the Syrian sources and another Syrian interlocutor briefed on the issue said.

On January 17, Barrack met with SDF commander Mazloum Abdi in the Kurdistan region of Iraq and told him that U.S. interests lie with Sharaa, not the SDF, the three sources said. An SDF official denied the account.

A U.S. military official and two Kurdish officials said the U.S. had given the SDF assurances of protection if Sharaa's offensive harmed Kurdish civilians or destabilized detention centers holding Islamic State detainees .

As Syrian troops pushed past the zone they originally proposed to capture, the U.S. military urged them to halt their advances and coalition aircraft fired warning flares over some flashpoint areas. But those actions fell far short of Kurdish expectations.

"What the coalition forces and American officials are doing is not acceptable," said Youssef, the Kurdish political official. "Are you truly lacking in principles? Are you so willing to betray your allies?"

Asked about U.S. assurances, the U.S. State Department referred Reuters to Barrack's statement on SDF integration.

Sharaa nearly overplayed his hand in the offensive's final stage, the U.S. source briefed on Washington's position and two other U.S. sources familiar with its policy said.

His forces had swiftly recaptured Arab-majority provinces from the SDF and kept advancing. By January 19, they were encircling the final Kurdish-held cities in Syria's northeast, despite a ceasefire announced the previous day.

But the U.S. administration was angry that Syrian troops had ignored the truce and feared mass violence against Kurdish civilians, the three U.S. sources said. Two of the sources said U.S. lawmakers were considering reimposing sanctions on Syria if fighting continued.

A White House official told Reuters the U.S. was monitoring developments in Syria "with grave concern" and urged all parties to "prioritize the protection of civilians across all minority groups."

With his forces approaching the Kurds' last strongholds, Sharaa suddenly announced a new ceasefire on Tuesday. He said his troops would not proceed if the SDF proposed an integration plan by the end of the week.

The three U.S. sources said Sharaa's abrupt announcement had satisfied Washington and that he was now "in the clear."

Minutes later, Barrack issued his statement.

The original purpose of the SDF as a combat force against the Islamic State had "largely expired", he said, and the greatest opportunity for Kurds was under Sharaa's new government.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 18:46:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5BW622DSWRMQNCLOI5G7FTRTGM.jpg?auth=4e4425a6b93e90a6b008ef2480ea3aa8126ca384a163deacee93c267761c298c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump says he wants leaders of Egypt, Ethiopia to resolve Nile dam dispute</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/davos/trump-says-he-wants-leaders-egypt-ethiopia-resolve-nile-dam-dispute-2026-01-21/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 18:46:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Egypt, Jordan, Indonesia, Pakistan, Qatar, UAE join Trump's 'Board of Peace'</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/saudi-arabia-turkey-egypt-jordan-indonesia-pakistan-qatar-uae-join-trumps-board-2026-01-21/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 18:46:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Chile's miners flag risks in dual oversight of mining, economy ministries</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/chiles-miners-flag-risks-dual-oversight-mining-economy-ministries-2026-01-21/</link><description>SANTIAGO, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Chile's mining industry expressed concerns on Wednesday after President-elect Jose Antonio Kast named one minister to oversee both mining and the economy, warning that the economically critical sector needs dedicated oversight.

Kast on Tuesday appointed businessman Daniel Mas to lead the Ministry of Mining and the Ministry of Economy, Development and Tourism. Mas is vice president of the powerful Confederation of Production and Commerce and brings private-sector experience in construction, real estate and financial services, but lacks a mining background.

The mining sector is the backbone of Chile's economy and a major driver of fiscal revenue and exports.

Kast had been expected to appoint Santiago Montt, the CEO of Los Andes Copper and a former senior executive at global miner BHP, to the mining post.

Mining groups in Chile, the world's largest copper producer and second-largest lithium producer, questioned the decision to combine the two ministries' leadership.

Chile's National Mining Society, known as SONAMI, said it "did not agree" with the move given the scale of the sector's unresolved challenges, though it expressed hope the incoming administration would ensure effective management of the portfolio.

Manuel Viera, president of the Chilean Mining Chamber, said the appointment signaled a lack of prioritization.

"This was an opportunity to appoint a professional linked to mining to lead the portfolio," Viera said. "Today mining, despite being our national emblem and the activity that contributes the most resources to the public purse, is treated as second‑rate."

Previous administrations have combined ministerial roles, including under former President Sebastian Pinera, who paired the mining and energy posts.

The surprise appointment of Mas followed a statement by Los Andes Copper earlier on Tuesday welcoming what it said was Montt's imminent nomination, a move observers said may have triggered a last‑minute change.

Arturo Squella, president of Kast's Republican Party, told a local radio station that the company's statement was "imprudent" and likely influenced events.

Chile's copper industry faces declining ore grades and investment delays driven by a complex permitting process, while debate continues over private investment in lithium and the future of state‑owned mining firms.

Andres Gonzalez, an analyst at consultancy Plusmining, said Mas was likely to focus on accelerating permits and improving investment conditions.

"Mas has no direct mining experience," Gonzalez said. "But given his business background and his dual role, his priority will likely be speeding up project approvals, which the new government sees as critical."</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 19:28:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/6YYWUQDMTFPENAIY5S2ZDOZ6XE.jpg?auth=7bd099da83d75d58f3279708d742395c90d96692709438c19dab242916176dd7&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'Who can say no?' Trump's Board of Peace tests doubters' resolve in Davos</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/davos/who-can-say-no-trumps-board-peace-tests-doubters-resolve-davos-2026-01-21/</link><description>DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Donald Trump's Board of Peace , seen by some as a rival to the United Nations, has caught officials at some of the countries invited off guard, with several saying they felt compelled to sign up rather than risk the U.S. president's wrath.

Reuters canvassed 16 world leaders, including politicians and delegates from Arab nations, Latin American countries and Europe at the World Economic Forum annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, with the response fairly consistent.

Officials from several regions said privately that joining Trump's proposed board felt less like a choice and more an inevitability, as governments weighed the risks of staying out against the uncertainty of signing on.

One Western delegate pointed to flashpoints involving Trump -- tariffs, Iran, Venezuela, Gaza and Greenland -- as examples of how difficult it can be to resist U.S. demands.

"Who can say no to Trump?" one Arab official said.

A senior White House official said about 35 world leaders have committed so far to the board, which was unveiled last week when the White House sent invitations to about 60 governments, including Britain, Russia and China.

The board, which would be chaired by Trump, would aim to be "a more nimble and effective international peace-building body", a draft charter seen by Reuters showed.

Trump is expected to sign up members as soon as Thursday during a ceremony at the Swiss mountain resort meeting.

Originally conceived as a post‑war Gaza plan to administer and rebuild the devastated enclave, the Board's mandate has widened, with Trump saying it may work on global crises, a role traditionally performed by the United Nations.

He told a news conference on Tuesday that he likes the UN, but it has "never lived up to its potential".

Trump has also put a $1 billion price tag for countries to secure a seat at the table, according to the board's charter.

Some European leaders said they were uneasy about elements of the board's draft charter, particularly provisions that appear to concentrate decision-making power with Trump.

One European diplomat said although EU member states would consult one another, any final decision would ultimately be taken individually, based on each country's national interests.

He said Trump's initiative was still riddled with unanswered questions, including the location of its headquarters and what legal status it would hold.

Describing the process as "a nightmare" mired in bureaucracy, the diplomat said the charter's tightly drawn rules for removing the Board of Peace chairman appeared designed to position Trump in the role for life.

The chair can resign only voluntarily or be ousted unanimously by the executive board on grounds of incapacity.

Several European states have declined to sign up.

France said President Emmanuel Macron intends to turn down the invitation. Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said the board's charter was incompatible with France’s international commitments, particularly its membership of the UN.

Norway and Sweden also declined, while Italy and Germany said they were still assessing. EU officials said discussions are ongoing among member states, with no decision yet announced.

Britain has adopted a more cautious approach.

Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Britain was discussing the proposal with allies, but stopped short of endorsing it.

Foreign policy watchers said the initiative was an attempt by the U.S. president to cement his influence.

"In Trump's mind, he's the boss -- whether it's Gaza, Venezuela or anywhere else," said Paul Salem at the Middle East Institute, adding: "This Board of Peace may be his way of managing an American sphere of influence."

He said the ambiguity around the board's mandate was consistent with Trump's approach to power, namely keeping details fluid and intentions opaque to maximise leverage.

"It's not just his style; it's his strategy. He doesn't want people to know in advance what he intends to do as a superpower," Salem said.

Trump allies, including some Latin American and Arab countries, argue the initiative fits within his broader strategy of projecting U.S. strength and leveraging American power to shape outcomes abroad.

Turkey, which has joined along with Saudi Arabia, said it regards the board as a valuable development despite any potential "shortcomings".

"If it provides Gaza with a gram of benefit, if it will save the life of one person in Africa, our president (Tayyip Erdogan) looks at this very positively," Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan told Turkish media.

Critics say it has left governments wary of punishment.

Trump hit back at Macron for refusing to join and threatened punitive trade measures, saying: "I'll put a 200% tariff on his wines and champagnes, and he'll join -- but he (Macron) doesn't have to join."

The former billionaire investor, who was sentenced to 18 years in prison in 2024, applied last year for a pardon after completion of sentence with the U.S. Justice Department, according to the agency's website.

Archegos, a family office that once managed $36 billion, collapsed in 2021 when Hwang failed to meet margin calls on bank loans he had obtained to make large bets on media and technology stocks.

A jury in 2024 convicted Hwang on multiple criminal charges including wire fraud, securities fraud and market manipulation after prosecutors accused him of lying to banks about Archegos' portfolio so he could borrow money aggressively.

The Justice Department's Office of the Pardon Attorney makes recommendations to the President on pardon applications, which can take months or years to be processed, according to the agency.

A White House official did not comment on the clemency request but said the President is the final decider on all pardons or commutations.

The Justice Department did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for a comment.

Since returning to office last year, President Donald Trump has granted a flurry of pardons, many of which were for white-collar criminals and political allies.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 19:29:07 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/DPTCNN2EWRP5RBFRC72XV2ORUA.jpg?auth=ea3b643035c20283acf210a890818a9254c2ce671f694bc74fc8bcb9422d041e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Syrian defence ministry says 11 soldiers killed, 25 wounded in attacks by Kurdish-led SDF after ceasefire</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/syrian-defence-ministry-says-11-soldiers-killed-25-wounded-attacks-by-kurdish-2026-01-21/</link><description>CAIRO, Jan 21 (Reuters) - The Syrian defence ministry said on Wednesday that 11 soldiers were killed and more than 25 wounded in attacks by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) after an announced ceasefire, state media reported.

"Defence Ministry explosives experts are at the site. Residents of nearby houses must be evacuated to a safe location," Regional Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov wrote on Telegram.

"City services are going from apartment to apartment and organising evacuations."

Belgorod is about 40 km (25 miles) from the Ukrainian border. The region around the city has been the focal point of numerous Ukrainian strikes in the nearly four-year-old war pitting Russia against its smaller neighbour.

Photos posted on unofficial Telegram channels showed a large crater. It was not immediately clear what sort of ammunition was at issue and where it had come from.

Belgorod Mayor Valentin Demidov said on Telegram that buses had been parked near the site to enable residents to move.

"It is important to wait for the explosives experts to complete their work," Demidov said. "We need to be 100% certain that nothing poses a threat to residents' lives."</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 20:34:33 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/TPCL2D2KZFIEVNNX5K52STHUDY.jpg?auth=c9aea158a20fa558543331041cfe25657a6b6781e4ba4e0e00ada2776321f3f7&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'We need a stabilised, democratic Syria: Economic recovery without freedom is meaningless'</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/we-need-a-stabilised-democratic-syria-economic-recovery-without-freedom-is-meaningless</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 20:35:22 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/b4a3e5ee-f702-11f0-8cf5-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260121-181956-182547-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump says agreed 'framework' for US deal over Greenland</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/trump-says-agreed-framework-for-us-deal-over-greenland</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 20:35:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/1466332c-f705-11f0-ade3-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260121-210116-210447-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Former Sudanese PM Hamdok speaks on FRANCE 24</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/former-sudanese-pm-hamdok-speaks-on-france-24</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 20:35:26 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/c2e0af42-f703-11f0-97a9-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260121-203110-204731-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Victim of Iranian crackdown buried in hidden grave, family says</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/victim-of-iranian-crackdown-buried-in-hidden-grave-family-says</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 20:35:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/3943e086-f700-11f0-ba90-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260121-200928-201129-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump tells Davos he won’t use force to take Greenland</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/trump-tells-davos-he-won-t-use-force-to-take-greenland</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 20:35:32 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/4984c486-f6fd-11f0-b31f-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260121-200203-200401-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Heavy rains wreak havoc in New Zealand's North Island</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/heavy-rains-wreak-havoc-new-zealands-north-island-2026-01-21/</link><description>WELLINGTON, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Further heavy rains across the north of New Zealand’s North Island overnight have caused widespread damage, with homes being evacuated, thousands without power, roads closed and two people missing after a landslide hit a house.

Emergency Management and Recovery Minister Mark Mitchell said on Radio NZ that the heavy rains hit almost the entire eastern seaboard of the North Island.

“The good news is everyone responded very quickly. There was time to get prepared, and that helps to mitigate and create a strong response,” he said.

Mitchell said emergency services were looking for two people after a landslide hit their home and that seven people had to be rescued off the roof of their house after water rushed through. A third man remains missing after he was washed away in his vehicle on Wednesday.

New Zealand Transport Authority reported a number of main road closures in Northland, Bay of Plenty and Waikato. Local authorities said some small communities remain cut off due to damage to the roads.

New Zealand forecaster MetService has lifted all weather warnings in the North Island as the tropical low moves east. Some warnings remain in place for the South Island, but they are expected to ease today, it added.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 21:28:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Two dead as rainstorm pound Greece</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/two-dead-rainstorm-pound-greece-2026-01-21/</link><description>ATHENS, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Two people died on Wednesday in Greece after torrential rain flooded homes and businesses in Athens and other parts of the country, authorities said.

A French court last year barred Le Pen, a three-time presidential candidate from the far-right National Rally (RN) , from running for office for five years over a fake jobs scam at the European institution.

It found her, along with 24 former European Parliament lawmakers, assistants and accountants as well as the party itself, guilty of operating a "system" from 2004 to 2016 using European Parliament funds to employ party staff in France.

Le Pen and others ​were found guilty of misappropriating more than €4 million of EU funds.

Le Pen – who on Tuesday rejected the idea of an organised scheme – said on her second day of questioning that even if her party broke the law, it was unintentional.

"We were acting in complete good faith," she said in the dock on Wednesday.

"We can undoubtedly be criticised," the 57-year-old said, shifting instead the blame to the legislature's alleged lack of information and oversight.

"The European Parliament's administration was much more lenient than it is today," she said.

Le Pen also argued that the passage of time made it "extremely difficult" for her to prove her innocence.

"I don't know how to prove to you what I can't prove to you, what I have to prove to you," she told the court.

Asked about the hiring of her longtime personal assistant Catherine Griset under a Brussels contract despite working in Paris , Le Pen replied: "It's not because she's in Paris that she isn't doing her job as a parliamentary assistant."

She however went on to admit "the mistake" of having "hired people who worked at party headquarters".

On Tuesday, Le Pen was also asked about Julien Odoul, who was listed as her "special adviser" on the party's website in 2015 despite being contracted as a MEP's assistant.

She claimed he just contributed notes as her adviser, and did so little work for her she assumed he had "another job". She said she did not know he was supposed to be working for an MEP.

Eleven others and the party are also appealing in a trial to last until mid-February, with a decision expected this summer.

Le Pen was also handed a four-year prison sentence, with two years suspended, and fined €100,000 in the initial trial.

She now again risks the maximum sentence of 10 years in prison and a one-million-euro fine if the appeal fails.

Le Pen is hoping to be acquitted – or at least for a shorter election ban and no time under house arrest.

On Tuesday, Le Pen pushed back against the argument that there was an organised operation to funnel EU funds to the far-right party.

"The term 'system' bothers me because it gives the impression of manipulation," she said.

EU Parliament official Didier Klethi last week said that the legislature's rules were "clear".

EU lawmakers could employ assistants, who were allowed to engage in political activism, but this was forbidden "during working hours", he said.

If the court upholds the first ruling, Le Pen will be prevented from running in the 2027 election, widely seen as her best chance to win the country's top job.

She made it to the second round in the 2017 and 2022 presidential polls, before losing to Emmanuel Macron . But he cannot run this time after two consecutive terms in office.

If she cannot run, her protégé, 30-year-old RN party president Jordan Bardella , is expected to step in.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 21:32:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/1e9ad952-f6c3-11f0-89b2-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/cef7db4f1c438f7fa280f8fccd10cc3f02b56822.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Peru president says backlash over Chinese businessman meetings aims to derail elections</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/peru-president-says-backlash-over-chinese-businessman-meetings-aims-derail-2026-01-21/</link><description>LIMA, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Peruvian President Jose Jeri told lawmakers on Wednesday that calls for his removal over undisclosed meetings with a Chinese businessman are an attempt to destabilize his government and disrupt upcoming elections.

Jeri, who took office in October after the expulsion of former President Dina Boluarte, addressed a congressional oversight committee that is investigating him for meetings with businessman Zhihua Yang on December 26 and January 6.

"There is an intention, which investigations will surely determine who is behind it, to cause harm beyond just the person, to generate instability and to alter an ongoing electoral process," the president told the committee, emphasizing the need for transparency and responsibility in clarifying matters of public interest.

Jeri's failure to publicly disclose the meetings as part of his official agenda sparked criticism over a lack of transparency and potential corruption.

Opposition legislators are trying to advance motions to impeach or censure Jeri, 39, who is carrying out the current government's term until July. The meetings are also being investigated by the public prosecutor's office.

In his defense before Congress, Jeri apologized for his off-agenda meetings with the Chinese businessman, stating that they discussed the upcoming celebration of an anniversary of Peruvian-Chinese ties. He admitted his mistake in holding the meeting in a "hidden" manner and denied receiving any "irregular" requests.

Regarding the second meeting at one of the businessman's stores selling household goods and food, Jeri said he went to buy "various products, candies, and things like paintings, normal occurrences that have been deliberately distorted."

Peru, which has had a revolving door of seven presidents since 2018 due to resignations or dismissals, is scheduled to hold elections on April 12 to choose a new president, 60 senators and 130 deputies.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 21:55:21 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/A2YKCHM33NLGRF3T7YTTOX7S24.jpg?auth=98bb6d4564b95df19a45e13f27ff2306f756312126f87ff977d96eb567e2cdcd&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump cancels tariff threat, says NATO's Rutte agreed to Greenland deal 'framework'</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260121-trump-cancels-tariff-threat-says-nato-rutte-agreed-greenland-deal-framework</link><description>US President Donald Trump abruptly stepped back on Wednesday from threats to impose tariffs as leverage to seize Greenland , ruled out the use of force and said a deal was in sight to end a dispute over the Danish territory that risked the deepest rupture in transatlantic relations in ​decades.

On a whirlwind trip to the World Economic Forum annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, Trump backed down from weeks of ‍rhetoric that shook the NATO alliance and risked a new global trade war .

Instead, Trump said, Western Arctic allies could forge a new deal that satisfies his desire for a "Golden Dome" missile-defence system and access ​to critical minerals while blocking Russia and China 's ambitions in the Arctic.

“It’s a deal that everybody’s very happy ​with," Trump told reporters after emerging from a meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte . “It’s a long-term deal. It’s the ultimate long-term deal. It puts everybody in a really good position, especially as it pertains to security and to minerals.”

He added: "It’s a deal that’s forever."

A NATO spokesperson said seven NATO allies in the Arctic would work together to ensure their collective security.

"Negotiations between Denmark , Greenland and the United States will go forward aimed at ensuring that Russia and China never gain a foothold – economically or militarily – in Greenland," the spokesperson said.

Trump said on his Truth Social platform that the US and NATO had "formed the framework ‍of a future deal with respect to Greenland and, in fact, the entire Arctic Region," and that "based upon this understanding, I will not be imposing the Tariffs that were scheduled to go ​into effect on February 1st."

Denmark said the issue should be handled through private diplomacy rather than on social media.

"What is crucial for us is that we get to end this with respect for the integrity and sovereignty of the kingdom (of Denmark) and the right of the ‌Greenlandic people to self-determination," Denmark's Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen told public broadcaster DR.

Rasmussen said he had spoken with Rutte but declined to provide details on what had been agreed.

Trump ‍said he had tasked Vice President JD Vance , Secretary of State Marco Rubio , and special envoy Steve Witkoff to take part in further discussions.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 22:29:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/40a55eb6-f702-11f0-8b28-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26021669748686-1.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>House panel advances contempt charges against Clintons over Epstein probe</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260121-house-panel-advances-contempt-charges-against-clintons-over-epstein-probe</link><description>A House committee advanced resolutions on Wednesday to hold former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in contempt of Congress over the Jeffrey Epstein investigation, opening the prospect of the House using one of its most powerful punishments against a former president for the first time.

In bipartisan votes, the Republican-controlled House Oversight Committee approved the contempt of Congress charges, setting up potential votes in the House early next month. In a rare departure from party lines, some Democrats supported the contempt measures against the Clintons, with several progressive lawmakers emphasising the need for full transparency in the Epstein investigation.

The votes were the latest turn in the Epstein saga as Congress investigates how the late financier was able to sexually abuse dozens of teenage girls for years.

“No witness, not a former president or a private citizen, may wilfully defy a congressional subpoena without consequence. But that is what the Clintons did and that is why we are here,” Rep. James Comer, the chairman, said at the session on Wednesday.

The repercussions of contempt charges loomed large, given the possibility of a substantial fine and even incarceration. Still, there were signs of a potential thaw as the Clintons appeared to be searching for an off-ramp to testify. In addition, passage of contempt charges through the full House was far from guaranteed, requiring a majority vote – something Republicans increasingly struggle to achieve.

The Clintons have said they had nothing to do with Epstein for decades and are seeking a resolution to the dispute. This week, they offered to have the committee leadership and staff interview Bill Clinton in New York.

Comer rejected that offer on Tuesday, insisting that any interview also have an official transcript.

The push in Washington for a reckoning over Epstein has shown details of the connections between the wealthy financier and both Bill Clinton and President Donald Trump, among many other high-powered men. Epstein killed himself in 2019 in a New York jail cell while awaiting trial.

Bill Clinton, Trump and many others connected to Epstein have not been accused of wrongdoing. Yet lawmakers are wrestling over who receives the most scrutiny.

A spokesman for the Clintons, Angel Ureña, said on social media that the Clintons are trying to help the Epstein investigation but that “both Clintons have been out of office for over a decade. Neither had anything to do with him for more than 20 years”.

Behind the scenes, longtime Clinton lawyer David Kendall has tried to negotiate an agreement with Comer for months. Kendall raised the prospect of having the Clintons testify on Christmas and Christmas Eve, according to the committee’s account of the negotiations.

The Clintons, who contend the subpoenas are invalid because they do not serve any legislative purpose, have also offered the committee written declarations about their interactions with Epstein.

Democrats have largely been focused on advancing the investigation into Epstein rather than mounting a defence of the Clintons, who led their party for decades. They agreed that Bill Clinton should inform the committee if he has any pertinent information about Epstein’s abuses .

A wealthy financier, Epstein donated to Bill Clinton’s 1992 presidential campaign and Hillary Clinton’s joint fundraising committee ahead of her 2000 Senate campaign in New York.

“No president or former president is above the law,” the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, Rep. Robert Garcia, said at the hearing.

On Wednesday, Democrats tried to advance several changes to the contempt of Congress charges. Several argued that Hillary Clinton should be exempted because she has said she had very little personal interaction with Epstein. Democratic lawmakers also tried to downgrade the contempt of Congress resolution to a civil rather than criminal offence.

Democrats spent the hearing criticising Comer for focusing on the Clintons when the Justice Department is running a month late on a congressionally mandated deadline to publicly release its case files on Epstein. Comer has also allowed several former attorneys general to provide the committee with written statements attesting to their limited knowledge of the case.

The committee had also subpoenaed Ghislaine Maxwell , Epstein’s longtime confidant, who is serving a lengthy prison sentence for a conviction on sex trafficking charges. But Comer declined to press for the interview after Maxwell’s attorney indicated she would invoke Fifth Amendment rights in any deposition.

“It’s interesting that it’s this subpoena only that Republicans and the chairman have been obsessed about putting all their energy behind,” Garcia said.

Comer said the committee will interview Maxwell next month. Attorney General Pam Bondi will also appear before the House Judiciary Committee in February.

In the end, nine Democrats voted with all Republicans on the committee to advance contempt against Bill Clinton, and three Democrats – Reps. Summer Lee of Pennsylvania, Melanie Stansbury of New Mexico and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan – joined in the vote to advance the contempt resolution for Hillary Clinton.

Democrats embraced the call for full transparency on Epstein after Trump’s return to the White House, particularly after Bondi stumbled on her promise to release the entirety of the unredacted Epstein files to the public. The backlash scrambled traditional ideological lines, leading Republicans to side with Democrats demanding further investigation.

The pressure eventually resulted in a bipartisan subpoena from the committee that ordered the Justice Department and Epstein’s estate to release files related to Epstein. Republicans quickly moved to include the Clintons in the subpoena.

Comer has indicated that he will insist that the subpoena be fulfilled by nothing less than a transcribed deposition of Bill Clinton.

“They’re going to have two weeks until this bill is on the floor,” he said on Wednesday.

Contempt of Congress proceedings are rare, used historically as a last resort when lawmakers are trying to force testimony for high-profile investigations, such as the infamous inquiry during the 1940s into alleged Communist sympathisers in Hollywood or the impeachment proceedings of President Richard Nixon .

Most recently, Trump’s advisers Peter Navarro and Steve Bannon were convicted of contempt charges for defying subpoenas from a House panel investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, riot by a mob of the Republican president’s supporters at the Capitol. Both Navarro and Bannon spent months in prison.

The Jan. 6 committee also subpoenaed Trump in its inquiry. Trump’s lawyers resisted the subpoena, citing decades of legal precedent they said shielded ex-presidents from being ordered to appear before Congress. The committee ultimately withdrew its subpoena.

No former president has ever been successfully forced to appear before Congress, although some have voluntarily appeared.

But some Republicans said the Clintons should face the same consequences for refusing to testify as Bannon and Navarro.

Rep. Andy Biggs, an Arizona Republican, said on social media that if the Clintons “aren’t perp walked, we will have failed the American people”.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 22:56:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/02c685c6-d848-11f0-bf21-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25346574786901.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Hong Kong's squeeze on Tiananmen crackdown commemorations</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/hong-kongs-squeeze-tiananmen-crackdown-commemorations-2026-01-21/</link><description>HONG KONG, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Hong Kong's High Court will begin on Thursday a landmark subversion trial of the leaders of a group that once organised annual commemorations of Beijing's Tiananmen Square crackdown on student-led pro-democracy protests in 1989.

The vigil has been blocked since 2020, first because of COVID-19 curbs and then a national security law imposed that year following pro-democracy protests in 2019.

Chow Hang-tung , 40, the former vice-chair of the now-disbanded Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China, and two other former Alliance leaders, Lee Cheuk-yan and Albert Ho, face up to 10 years in jail for "inciting subversion of state power" under the security law.

Following is a timeline of key events:

* May 21, 1989 - The Alliance is set up by activists including Szeto Wah following a May 20 protest, when tens of thousands marched to oppose martial law in Beijing.

* June 4-5 - People's Liberation Army troops fire on protesters and citizens in and around Beijing's Tiananmen Square.

* A lone protester stands in front of a convoy of tanks on the Avenue of Eternal Peace close to the square, an iconic image beamed across the world.

* June 4, 1989 - The Alliance helps organise a mass "sit-in" protest at Hong Kong's Happy Valley racecourse that draws about 200,000 people who condemned the bloody crackdown.

* June 4, 1990 - The Alliance organises its first annual candlelight vigil in the Asian financial hub's Victoria Park, an event that drew thousands yearly for nearly three decades.

* July 1997 - Hong Kong, a British colony for more than 150 years, returns to Chinese sovereignty.

* 2019 - Millions turn out at mass pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, angered by Beijing's tightening grip on the city's freedoms.

* June 4, 2020 - Thousands defy a police ban on COVID-19 curbs to gather with candles in Victoria Park for the anniversary, resulting in more than two dozen charged.

* June 30 - China's parliament imposes a national security law on Hong Kong, drawing condemnation from the United States amid concerns it will be used to crack down on dissent.

* June 3, 2021 - Chow arrested on suspicion of promoting an unauthorised assembly to mark June 4.

* June 4, 2021 - Police block off Victoria Park to prevent gatherings.

* Sept 8-9, 2021 - Chow, Lee, Ho and four other Alliance members are arrested under the national security law.

* Sept 9, 2021 - Police raided and shut down a June 4 museum during an investigation into the Alliance.

* Sept 10, 2021 - The trio are charged with inciting subversion and remanded in custody . Chow is denied bail.

* Sept 25, 2021 - The Alliance members vote to disband .

* Dec 13, 2021 - Eight activists including Chow are jailed for up to 14 months for organising, taking part in and inciting participation in a banned June 4 vigil.

* March 11, 2023 - Chow and two former Alliance members are jailed for four and a half months for not complying with a national security police request for information.

* June 4, 2023 - Hong Kong police detain 23 people for "breaching public peace" on the Tiananmen anniversary.

* October 28, 2024 - The High Court bars Chow from calling overseas witnesses to testify virtually in the trial.

* March 6, 2025 - Hong Kong's top court unanimously overturns the convictions of Chow and two other Alliance members in the information request case, calling it a miscarriage of justice.

* Nov 3, 2025 - The High Court rejects Chow's application to terminate the trial, on grounds of prosecution accusations she called vague and insubstantial.

* Jan 22, 2026 - The trial opens after several delays, and is expected to run to 75 days.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 23:26:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Hong Kong begins national security trial of Tiananmen vigil group</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/hong-kong-begins-national-security-trial-tiananmen-vigil-group-2026-01-21/</link><description>HONG KONG, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Hong Kong's High Court is set to start on Thursday the landmark national security trial of three former leaders of a now disbanded group that organised annual vigils marking Beijing's 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown on pro-democracy protesters.

Once legal in China-ruled Hong Kong, such public commemorations were hailed as a symbol of the city's relative freedom compared to mainland China.

The events on June 4, 1989, when Chinese troops opened fire to end the student-led protests, are not publicly discussed in China, which treats the date as taboo and allows no public remembrance.

Several June 4 monuments, such as the "pillar of shame" , a memorial for those killed in the crackdown that depicted dozens of torn and twisted bodies were also removed from three Hong Kong universities.

Blocked in 2020 over COVID-19 curbs, the commemorations have never resumed since China imposed a tough national security law that year.

Under that law, Lee Cheuk-yan, 68, Albert Ho , 74, and Chow Hang-tung, 40, the three former leaders of the now-disbanded group, now face charges of "inciting subversion of state power" that carry punishments of up to 10 years in jail.

The trial is among the last of several such major cases, with Chow , the former vice chair of the group, the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China, held on remand for more than 1,500 days after being denied bail.

In an opening statement, prosecutors said the case centred on whether the Alliance's publicly stated goal of "ending one‑party rule" constituted illegally inciting others to carry out acts aimed at subverting state power.

The other key focus of the case was whether such acts amounted to "overthrowing or undermining" China's system of government, they added.

Rights groups and some foreign governments have criticised such national security cases against prominent democrats as a weaponisation of the rule of law to silence dissent.

Beijing, however, says the security law was necessary to restore order after sometimes violent protests rocked the Asian financial hub for months in 2019.

Detained since September 2021, Chow , a Cambridge-educated barrister, is one of the few democratic campaigners still speaking out against the Chinese Communist Party's crackdown.

She has represented herself in court and challenged prison rules, such as one barring female inmates from wearing shorts in summer.

"The state can lock up people but not their thinking, just as it can lock up facts but not alter truth," she told Reuters in an interview.

Last November, the High Court rejected Chow's bid to terminate the trial, and barred her from calling overseas witnesses to testify virtually in 2024.

It cited an amendment to the Criminal Procedure Ordinance that prohibits remote testimony in trials involving national security. "Both sides are subject to the same restrictions ... Nothing unfair is done to the defence," the judges held.

In another judgment on Wednesday, the judges said the court would adjudicate on the basis of evidence and legal principles and "will not allow trials to become a tool for political repression ... or an abuse of judicial procedures", as Chow claimed.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 23:28:42 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/RICV3JRHABI2JJTWSZOIOUABAQ.jpg?auth=8b83afae4d141a247646a621da1fdd3183d12f6931af20de9f05043a5818d055&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Vietnam's Lam edges closer to new leadership term after decisive congress cut short</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/vietnams-lam-edges-closer-new-leadership-term-after-decisive-congress-cut-short-2026-01-22/</link><description>HANOI, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Vietnam Communist Party delegates begin voting on Thursday in a process that will end with the selection of its general secretary, officials said, as the party shortened its congress in a sign of broad consensus for the reappointment of current leader To Lam.

The congress of the ruling Communist Party, held once every five years to select leaders and set political and economic priorities, was initially planned to last until Sunday. Delegates voted on Wednesday, however, to wrap up the meeting as early as Friday, the government said on its news portal.

No official explanation was provided, but the shortened schedule likely indicates no divisions have emerged within the party about leadership positions and a probable smooth reappointment of Lam, who is seeking to extend his tenure as general secretary, Vietnam's most powerful post.

Some congresses in the past required longer debates to decide leadership positions, warranting the initial week-long schedule for this year's congress.

The 1,600 delegates that began meeting on Monday are expected to elect 200 members of the party's central committee on Thursday, multiple officials said. The committee will then elect the party chief and up to 17 to 19 members of the Politburo from a pre-arranged shortlist.

No schedule has been given for the final voting session. Officials said it could happen as early as Thursday.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 01:51:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/NDU6WCGXUFNAVMN5NG3Q6UHT3U.jpg?auth=733518ec1e0c1ded91cdb08520d5878fe2a5e7fea7e4d2a89709fbf93e605c0d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Putin says he will meet US envoys Witkoff, Kushner on Thursday</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/putin-says-he-will-meet-us-envoys-witkoff-kushner-thursday-2026-01-22/</link><description>Jan 21 (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday he would meet on Thursday with U.S. envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, who have been tasked with finding a solution to Russia's nearly four-year-old war with Ukraine.

Putin, quoted by Russian news agencies, said during a meeting of Russia's Security Council that he would discuss the possible use of frozen Russian assets with the U.S. envoys in connection with recovery work in regions affected by the war.

"This possibility is also under discussion with representatives of the U.S. administration," Russian news agencies quoted him as saying.

Putin said he would also discuss use of the assets with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, scheduled to meet with the Russian leader on Thursday.

Putin said as well that Russia's Foreign Ministry had been instructed to study U.S. President Donald Trump 's invitation to join his proposed Board of Peace and would reply in due course.

Putin said he saw the proposal mainly as part of efforts to deal with a Middle East peace settlement.

Even before any decision on joining the Board, Putin said Moscow was ready to provide $1 billion - as required by Trump for long-term membership - from the frozen assets "in view of Russia's special relations with the Palestinian people".</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 01:53:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/GAQWSP6CPJKYLIXWK7QWKOIDKU.jpg?auth=0667c2f9fe1f1520959fd51755d35576d755999f22f2c835a7422d3264c873bb&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Australia begins day of mourning for victims of Bondi Beach attack</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/australia-begins-day-mourning-victims-bondi-beach-attack-2026-01-22/</link><description>SYDNEY, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Australia began a national day of mourning on Thursday for the victims of the Bondi Beach mass shooting, with flags across the country flown at half mast ahead of a commemoration event at Sydney's iconic Opera House.

A father and son allegedly opened fire at an event celebrating the Jewish festival of Hanukkah on December 14, killing 15 people in Australia's worst mass shooting in decades.

Police claim the men were inspired by Islamic State to carry out the attack, that the government has called an act of terrorism against Jewish people.

"Today is an opportunity for us to remember and pay respect to the 15 lives," Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told reporters on Thursday.

"It's an opportunity for us as a nation to wrap our arms around the Jewish community because people were targeted because they were Jewish Australians."

A minute's silence, including on the country's main television channels, will be held across the nation just after 7 p.m. local time in Sydney (0800 GMT) when the memorial event begins.

"This will be an opportunity to just take that minute to really think about what's happened and to pay respects, and I invite all Australians to participate in observing that minute of silence," Albanese said.

Event attendees, including relatives of the victims, will light candles and hear speeches from lawmakers, as well as Jewish prayers and video tributes.

Buildings across the country, including cricket stadiums in Melbourne and Perth, will also be illuminated.

The Bondi attack shocked the nation and led to calls for tougher action on antisemitism and gun control, with Albanese pledging to tackle both.

Australia’s lower house of parliament on Tuesday passed laws to enable a national gun buyback and tightened background checks for gun licences, despite opposition from the conservative opposition.

Lawmakers are also debating separate legislation that would lower the threshold for prosecuting hate speech offences.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 01:53:44 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/QSWUITMAWVPBVFPDB3SW6NMH2I.jpg?auth=66610d6c4b36d68e4707a5d7e0c307c6cf178de075fc9eae8df148c61e511900&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>NATO chief: Issue of whether Greenland stays with Denmark did not come up with Trump</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/davos/nato-chief-issue-whether-greenland-stays-with-denmark-did-not-come-up-with-trump-2026-01-22/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 21 (Reuters) - NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said on Wednesday the issue of whether Greenland will remain with Denmark did not come up in his talks with Donald Trump , as the U.S. president stepped back from threats of tariffs and ruled out the use of military force to take control of Greenland.

Rutte made his comments in an interview on Fox News' "Special Report with Bret Baier" show.

Earlier in the day, Trump abruptly stepped back from threats to impose tariffs as leverage to seize Greenland, ruled out the use of force, and said a deal was in sight to end a dispute over the Danish territory.

After meeting Rutte, Trump said on Wednesday that Western Arctic allies could forge a new deal over the strategic island territory of 57,000 people that satisfies his desire for a "Golden Dome" missile‑defense system and access to critical minerals, while blocking Russia and China's ambitions in the Arctic.

Trump had previously repeatedly said Washington must own Greenland, an autonomous part of the kingdom of Denmark that houses a U.S. airbase, to prevent Russia or China from occupying the strategically located and minerals-rich Arctic territory.

Rutte was asked if Greenland will still be "under the Kingdom of Denmark in this framework deal" that Trump mentioned.

"That issue did not come up anymore in my conversations tonight with the president," Rutte said in response.

"He (Trump) is very much focused on what do we need to do to make sure that that huge Arctic region - where change is taking place at the moment, where the Chinese and the Russians are more and more active - how we can protect it."

Greenland and Denmark have said Greenland is not for sale . Denmark and the U.S are NATO members.

The region should focus first on bringing together its tangible assets to properly integrate its defence industry, and then mobilising a coalition of the willing, the foreign minister said.

The concern over whether European citizens would be willing to assemble militarily is a “legitimate debate”, but the chance of assembling a critical mass was higher as a bloc than on a national level, Albares said, adding: “A joint effort would be more efficient than 27 separate national armies.”

The comments come ahead of an emergency meeting between EU leaders later on Thursday in Brussels to coordinate a joint response to U.S. President Trump’s threats to buy or annex Greenland. A Council spokesperson confirmed late on Wednesday the meeting will still take place despite Trump's announcement on social media that he and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte had “formed the framework of a deal”.

Albares, speaking after a meeting in Delhi on Wednesday with his Indian counterpart Subrahmanyam Jaishankar which included talks on deeper defence ties, stressed that the intention of such an army was not to replace NATO, underscoring the importance of the transatlantic alliance.

“But we need to demonstrate that Europe is not a place that will let itself be coerced militarily or economically,” Albares said.

His position remained unchanged despite Trump rowing back on his Greenland threats after speaking to Rutte, a senior foreign official said, adding that Spain was "glad a pathway for dialogue had been opened within the NATO framework, if that pathway is confirmed."

The concept of integrating national military forces into a supranational European army was first proposed in 1951 to counter the Soviet Union and ensure German rearmament did not threaten its neighbours, but was voted down by France's parliament in 1954.

“The idea of European defence was part of the origin of the EU. It is up to my generation to finish this task,” Albares said.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 01:56:32 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/UWFV7QVM3FID3LY45JMHYPBYJM.jpg?auth=6b3514204552252384815032ecb282ee2f450d60eebf12c4e527d501580ef595&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Australia's conservative opposition coalition splits again over hate speech laws</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/australias-conservative-opposition-coalition-splits-again-over-hate-speech-laws-2026-01-21/</link><description>SYDNEY, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Australia's conservative coalition split on Thursday for the second time in less than a year after the junior partner National Party severed ties with the Liberal Party, citing the Liberals' decision to back the government's hate speech laws.

Australia's parliament this week passed the centre-left Labor government's new anti-hate laws in the wake of the Bondi Beach mass shooting last month, with backing from the Liberals. Three National senators voted against the bill, saying it was rushed through parliament and could undermine freedom of speech.

In a show of solidarity, all National members quit the opposition's shadow cabinet late on Wednesday after three of their senators had earlier resigned for breaching coalition rules by voting against the Liberals' position.

National leader David Littleproud said the split was triggered by opposition leader Sussan Ley's decision to accept the senators' resignations.

"She has forced the coalition into an untenable position that can no longer continue," Littleproud said at a press conference.

"We made it very clear that there would be a consequence and that if Sussan accepted those resignations, then that consequence is that the coalition would be untenable. It would be forced into a position that could not continue. She was aware of that."

Littleproud said his party had not breached coalition rules and that it should not be forced into supporting a position.

Under the long-standing partnership in state and federal politics, the coalition had shared power in governments, with the Nationals broadly representing the interests of rural communities and the Liberals contesting city seats.

The two parties split briefly in May 2025 over policy differences, including renewable energy, following a resounding loss at a national election, before reuniting a week later.

The latest split comes after recent polls showed rising support for populist Senator Pauline Hanson's anti-immigration One Nation party.

A closely watched poll by The Australian newspaper released this week showed One Nation's primary vote had overtaken that of the coalition, with some analysts suggesting many Liberal voters are drifting toward One Nation.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 01:56:42 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ZOHR6HLNUJOXRPITQFJFPWOM7Q.jpg?auth=3c2166f6b382536c67d30de1acc4ec322127e5be2c06931852474db4269e47fe&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes asks Trump for early release from prison</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260122-theranos-founder-elizabeth-holmes-asks-trump-for-pardon</link><description>Elizabeth Holmes, the founder of now-defunct blood-testing startup Theranos, has asked US President Donald Trump to release her from prison with nearly six years left before she is eligible for release.

Holmes sought to commute her 11¼-year sentence last year, and her request remains pending, according to the US Department of Justice’s Office of the Pardon Attorney.

Now 41, Holmes was convicted in 2022 on four counts of wire fraud and conspiracy for cheating investors and was ordered to pay $452 million in restitution. A federal appeals court upheld her conviction and sentence last February.

Prosecutors said Holmes lied to investors from 2010 to 2015 by promising Theranos’ technology could run many medical tests on one blood drop from a finger prick.

Theranos was once valued at $9 billion, and Forbes estimated Holmes’ net worth at $4.5 billion in 2015.

Holmes would still owe restitution if Trump released her from prison , but she would not owe it if he pardoned her.

She is housed at a minimum-security federal prison camp in Bryan, Texas, and is eligible for release in December 2031.

The White House declined to comment on Holmes’ request. Lawyers for Holmes did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 01:57:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/1be11f2a-76cc-11ed-b300-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/Part-GTY-1442569992-1-1-2.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuela’s interim president to visit US amid deepening oil ties</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260122-venezuela-interim-president-to-visit-usa</link><description>Venezuela's interim president will soon visit the United States, a senior US official said Wednesday, further signalling President Donald Trump ’s willingness to embrace the oil-rich country’s new leader.

Delcy Rodriguez would be the first sitting Venezuelan president to visit the United States in more than a quarter century – aside from presidents attending United Nations meetings in New York.

She said Wednesday that she approached any dialogue with the United States “without fear”.

“We are in a process of dialogue, of working with the United States, without any fear, to confront our differences and difficulties… and to address them through diplomacy,” Rodriguez said.

The invitation reflects a head-snapping shift in relations between Washington and Caracas since US Delta Force operatives swooped into Caracas, seized President Nicolas Maduro and spirited him to a US jail to face narcotrafficking charges.

Rodriguez was a former vice-president and long-time insider in Venezuela’s authoritarian and anti-American government, before changing tack as interim president.

She is still the subject of US sanctions, including an asset freeze.

But with a flotilla of US warships still amassed off the Venezuelan coast, she has allowed the United States to broker the sale of Venezuelan oil , facilitated foreign investment and released dozens of political prisoners.

A senior White House official said Rodriguez would visit soon, but no date has been set.

The last bilateral visit by a sitting Venezuelan president came in the 1990s – before populist leader Hugo Chavez took power.

Since then, successive Venezuelan governments have made a point of thumbing their noses at Washington and building close ties with US foes in China , Cuba, Iran and Russia.

The US trip, which has yet to be confirmed by Venezuelan authorities, could pose problems for Rodriguez inside the government – where some hardliners still detest what they see as Washington’s hemispheric imperialism.

Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello and Defence Minister Vladimir Padrino Lopez remain powerful forces in the country, and analysts say their support for Rodriguez is not a given.

Trump has so far appeared happy to allow Rodriguez and much of the repressive government to remain in power, so long as the United States has access to Venezuelan oil – the largest proven reserves in the world.

Trump hosted Venezuela’s exiled opposition leader and Nobel peace laureate Maria Corina Machado at the White House earlier this month .

After initially dismissing Machado and her ability to control the country’s powerful armed forces and intelligence services, he said Tuesday that he would “love” to have her “involved in some way.”

Machado’s party is widely considered to have won the 2024 elections that Washington said were stolen by Maduro.

Analysts say Trump’s embrace of Rodriguez and avoidance of wholesale regime change can be explained by an unwillingness to repeat mistakes made in the overthrow of Saddam Hussein in Iraq.

“Those kinds of intervention operations – and the deployment of troops for stabilisation – have always ended very badly,” said Benigno Alarcon, a politics expert at the Andres Bello Catholic University in Caracas.

Trump’s stance has, however, angered democracy activists who argue that all political prisoners must be freed and granted amnesty, and Venezuela must hold fresh elections.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 01:57:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/6ef4955e-f3c7-11f0-9cab-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-17T070132Z-1638755467-RC2V1JAQYSGE-RTRMADP-3-USA-VENEZUELA-POLITICS-RODRIGUEZ.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Reversal on Greenland followed push by aides against military option, sources say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/trump-reversal-greenland-followed-push-by-aides-against-military-option-sources-2026-01-22/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 21 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's retreat from threats of force as an option for acquiring Greenland capped weeks of policy chaos, as top aides scrambled both to accommodate the president's demands and ease the panic they caused among U.S. allies, according to two sources with knowledge of the conversations.

In remarks on Wednesday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Trump ruled out using military force after weeks of refusing to do so, and in a social media post said he would no longer be imposing tariffs that he had threatened to put into effect on February 1.

White House officials had pushed a less provocative approach, with several key members of the president's team unenthusiastic about possibly using military force to seize the Danish territory, the two White House sources said. They spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.

After saying on Wednesday that tariffs are off the table, Trump said he and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte had "formed the framework of a future deal with respect to Greenland and, in fact, the entire Arctic Region" during talks in Davos. He tasked top officials with negotiating a potential deal.

The episode underscored how Trump's long-running fascination with acquiring Greenland keeps crashing into diplomatic and political reality, emblematic of a second term defined by abrupt policy shifts and rapid reversals. Again and again, the Republican president has changed course on tariffs and other issues under economic, political or market pressure.

Asked about Trump's aides not pursuing military options seriously on Greenland, White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly said: "The White House does not rule out options for President Trump unless he does so himself."

"He announced today that he will not use force to take Greenland, and the entire administration will follow his lead," Kelly said, adding that if a deal is reached, the United States would achieve its goals in Greenland at minimal long-term cost.

In recent weeks, Trump has revived his long-standing ambition to acquire the Arctic island, arguing that it is vital to U.S. national security as great-power competition intensifies in the Arctic.

The leaders of Greenland and Denmark, which oversees the territory, have rejected Trump's overtures, stressing that the island's future is for its people to decide and accusing the United States of bullying tactics.

In a social media post on Saturday, Trump said he would implement a wave of increasing tariffs on European allies until the U.S. was allowed to buy Greenland, which major EU states decried as blackmail .

The idea to use tariffs came from Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and other cabinet members, the White House sources said.

Lutnick did not respond to a request for comment.

The threats in Trump's post came after some European countries sent small numbers of military personnel to Greenland, ostensibly to show that they took U.S. warnings about the island's security seriously.

Ahead of the Davos summit, European leaders stepped up their pushback against the U.S. acquiring Greenland.

"He doesn't like being cornered," said one of the White House sources, explaining Trump's tariff threat.

That announcement set off a scramble in the White House to develop a tariff plan and understand how it would play out. Different agencies are still working out the "cycle of retaliation and counter-retaliation with tariffs" on EU members, the White House source said.

A spokesperson for the Danish embassy did not comment for this story.

Trump first floated the idea of taking over Greenland in 2019 but ramped up rhetoric after returning to power a year ago. In meetings last year, U.S. officials assured their Danish counterparts that relations were stabilizing, leaving them with the impression that any military takeover of the Arctic territory was no longer top of mind for the administration, according to two separate sources familiar with those discussions.

That changed in December, when Trump abruptly announced that Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry would serve as special envoy to Greenland and renewed his push to acquire the territory, seemingly emboldened by the successful January 3 operation to capture Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro.

While aides were broadly aligned on the goal of taking over Greenland, they were split over the president's aggressive approach, the two White House sources said.

In most White House meetings, more officials have urged caution than those pushing for the United States to take the island by force, said the sources, who were unaware of serious discussions on military options to seize Greenland.

Tom Dans, appointed by Trump to lead the U.S. Arctic Research Commission, along with Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, had been "pushing for a middle ground" on Greenland, while White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller showed a willingness to keep annexation and the potential use of military force on the table, the sources said.

Dans and Miller did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokeswoman for Vance declined comment.

A State Department official said: "President Trump's team, including Secretary Rubio, routinely present him with a suite of options on issues of national concern."

Trump himself has been driving the issue, the sources said. One of them, speaking before Trump's turnaround on tariffs and the use of force, said the president had wanted to retain the option of a military move.

U.S. officials have not said what a military operation in Greenland would entail. As a Danish territory, the island is already a member of NATO and the United States maintains a military base there.

A 1951 agreement between Denmark and the United States allows the U.S. military free access to the territory to defend Greenland or other NATO territories — something experts say already gives Washington the ability to send additional troops to Greenland.

Vance and Rubio last week hosted Danish and Greenlandic foreign ministers at the White House for talks characterized by Denmark's Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen as "frank but constructive."

Military action was not considered seriously at that meeting, where Vance discussed how a solution should be found despite seemingly incompatible positions, one of the White House sources said.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 03:48:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KZDYGUJP6BOHPBS3HUL6DLWFCA.jpg?auth=102aa7e7478a256906f2a86f457c673fde0fa9c0456d3cb4914d33bca885d5c5&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>After vanishing from view, two US-seized Venezuela oil tankers reappear near Puerto Rico</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/after-vanishing-view-two-us-seized-venezuela-oil-tankers-reappear-near-puerto-2026-01-22/</link><description>PONCE, Puerto Rico/HOUSTON, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Two oil tankers seized this month by the U.S. in its campaign against Venezuela were near Puerto Rico on Wednesday, a Reuters witness and Tankertrackers.com data said, the first sightings almost since their capture and a possible hint at their destination.

The ships are supertanker M Sophia, seized by the U.S. on January 7 carrying Venezuelan oil, and the smaller tanker Galileo, formerly called Veronica and taken last week empty, although it has previously carried Venezuelan oil.

The M Sophia and Galileo are among seven vessels linked to Venezuelan oil exports captured by the U.S. military and Coast Guard in recent weeks, mostly in the Caribbean Sea.

U.S. officials have not disclosed destinations or plans for the seized vessels. The U.S. Coast Guard declined to comment, directing inquiries to the White House. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for a comment.

Because the vessels' geolocating beacons have not been turned on, the locations of M Sophia and Galileo were unknown until the Tankertrackers.com and witness confirmation on Wednesday.

The vessels could remain in Puerto Rico or be moved to another U.S. port. The other five captured tankers are near the U.S. Gulf Coast, in Venezuelan waters and near Scotland, shipping data showed.

U.S. President Donald Trump has said the U.S. intervention — including the capture of President Nicolás Maduro on January 3 — is aimed at stopping drug trafficking.

Washington intends to direct Venezuela’s government and revive the country’s crippled oil sector by bringing major U.S. oil companies in to rebuild it.

Trump has imposed a blockade to prevent sanctioned tankers from shipping Venezuelan oil, which in December brought exports close to a standstill. Shipments have accelerated in January under U.S. supervision, but millions of barrels remain in onshore and floating storage.

The U.S. government has filed for court warrants to seize dozens more tankers linked to the Venezuelan oil trade, sources told Reuters last week. This week, vessel Sagitta was intercepted.

Along with most tankers under Western sanctions or part of the so-called shadow fleet, many of the Venezuela-linked tankers were built over 20 years ago and pose hazards to shipping because they lack safety certification and adequate insurance, experts said.

That means that if they have a collision or oil spill, establishing insurance claims or liability is very difficult to impossible, shipping and insurance industry sources said.

The age of these tankers, which exceeds the industry standard of 15 years, also raises concern about potential environmental damage, the sources said.

U.S. government civil forfeiture claims related to the ship seizures can take months or years to resolve, meaning there may be no immediate solutions to the challenges.

"These 'dark fleet' tankers can be incredibly unsafe. They are elderly, their crew work in unsafe conditions, lack the appropriate classification surveys, and they are often backed by fake insurance or no insurance at all," said David Tannenbaum, a director at consulting firm Blackstone Compliance Services.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 03:48:52 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/OOJGUHFC2ZJ3VH764G4RHAHOJ4.jpg?auth=f2505290f6ce7c61a7646b7c4651c5ae14278c5a9593660656ec9de1c1fc6140&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Philippines hosts Myanmar political, ethnic groups for 'stakeholder meeting'</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/philippines-hosts-myanmar-political-ethnic-groups-stakeholder-meeting-2026-01-22/</link><description>MANILA, Jan 22 (Reuters) - ASEAN chair the Philippines has welcomed various political and ethnic groups from army-ruled Myanmar to a "stakeholders' meeting", Manila's foreign minister said on Thursday, in a bid to advance the regional bloc's stalled peace plan.

Philippine Foreign Affairs Secretary Ma. Theresa Lazaro, who took over this year as the ASEAN special envoy on the crisis in war-torn Myanmar, did not name the groups represented or say when the meeting took place.

"I encouraged their active, constructive and meaningful sharing of perspectives on the implementation of the ASEAN Five-Point Consensus," she said on X, referring to the peace plan agreed between the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and Myanmar in 2021.

Lazaro said discussions included advancing deescalation, facilitating aid delivery, addressing transnational crime and fostering political dialogue.

Myanmar has been ravaged by conflict since a 2021 coup triggered a protest movement that has evolved into a civil war between the military on one side and a loose alliance of rebel groups on the other.

The military is currently holding a general election , with two of its three phases of voting completed and results showing low turnout and a party allied with the military winning the majority of seats so far.

Critics have dismissed the vote as a sham to prepetuate army rule through civilian proxies and ASEAN has not sent observers.

Aside from some improvements in humanitarian access, ASEAN's peace plan has largely been a failure, with fighting raging in swathes of the country and the junta refusing to engage in dialogue with opponents it calls "terrorists".

A spokesperson for Myanmar's military government did not answer calls seeking comment. Myanmar's shadow National Unity Government, which is allied with rebel groups, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Philippines is the 2026 ASEAN Chair and the political dialogue comes a week before the regional bloc's foreign ministers head to the central island of Cebu for a retreat.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 03:50:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/2Z4SN54JR5MODGDEG34XU2J4AM.jpg?auth=5105330a080c2fd97c616227bed4391714bc725158607f131c6b7088b1756179&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Former Texas police officer acquitted in Uvalde school shooting trial</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/uvalde-police-officer-acquitted-child-endangerment-deadly-texas-school-shooting-2026-01-22/</link><description>Jan 21 (Reuters) - A Texas jury acquitted a former police officer of criminal child-endangerment charges on Wednesday stemming from his role in the botched law enforcement response to the 2022 Uvalde school shooting that killed 19 elementary students and two teachers.

Adrian Gonzales, 52, who belonged to the Uvalde school district police force, faced 29 counts of felony child endangerment for what prosecutors said was his failure to stop the gunman in the first minutes of one of the deadliest school shootings in U.S. history.

Gonzales buried his head in his hands after the verdict was read, with his lawyers clapping him on the back. Parents and siblings of the victims appeared stunned by the decision, some wiping away tears, while others stared ahead with blank expressions.

The Corpus Christi jury deliberated for over seven hours before reaching its not guilty verdict on all 29 counts, each of which carried up to two years in prison.

The trial was a rare case of a U.S. police officer being charged with endangering lives by failing to halt a crime.

Defense lawyer Jason Goss told jurors that prosecutors wanted to scapegoat Gonzales for the mistakes of all police officers at the shooting.

"They have decided he has to pay for the pain of that day and it's not right," Goss said in closing arguments.

Gonzales was among the first of more than 400 law enforcement officers to arrive at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde on May 24, 2022. Police waited 77 minutes before entering a classroom where the gunman was holed up.

The gunman, a former student at the school, was ultimately shot dead by other officers.

Gonzales was accused of failing to confront the shooter after he arrived at Robb Elementary in his patrol car in response to a report of an active shooter.

"You can't stand by and allow it to happen," Special Prosecutor Bill Turner told the jury during closing arguments.

Gonzales said he could not see the shooter and denied that he froze during the first chaotic minutes of the incident when the gunman was outside the school.

The nearly three-week trial was held in Corpus Christi, about 175 miles (282 km) southeast of Uvalde, after the defense argued Gonzales could not get a fair trial in the town of around 16,000 in Texas' Hill Country.

State and federal investigations into the shooting found that officers left the 18-year-old gunman alone inside the classroom with children while weighing how to confront him.

By the time a tactical team led by Border Patrol officers stormed in, the death toll had reached among the worst ever in a country known for high-profile school shootings.

While debate has raged between proponents of gun control measures and those who say such controls violate the constitutional right to bear arms, there remain few restrictions on firearms in the U.S. compared with other industrialized nations.

Former U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland, in remarks made while presenting the federal report on Uvalde in 2024, said lives would have been saved had the police immediately confronted the gunman.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 03:51:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/INYX23VA4NKX3CAD35KMDKFJQU.jpg?auth=d5c3dc5eb77f0adf430ca6cf4e5979adecd96541d64e8453db7bc0ccee63d135&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>South Korea prosecutor appeals court ruling on ex-President Yoon's obstruction charges</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/south-korea-prosecutor-appeals-court-ruling-ex-president-yoons-obstruction-2026-01-22/</link><description>SEOUL, Jan 22 (Reuters) - South Korea's special prosecution team said on Thursday it has filed an appeal after a court sentenced former President Yoon Suk Yeol on charges including obstructing attempts to arrest him following his failed bid to impose martial law.

The Washington Post, citing an autopsy report by deputy medical examiner Adam C. Gonzalez, reported that the cause of death was "asphyxia due to neck and torso compression."

Reuters could not immediately verify the reports and the El Paso County Office of the Medical Examiner did not immediately provide comment.

The detainee, Geraldo Lunas Campos , 55, died in the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody on Jan. 3 at Camp East Montana after experiencing "medical distress," ICE said earlier this month.

When reached for comment on Tuesday, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security - under which ICE falls - said Campos attempted to take his own life while in federal custody.

"The security staff immediately intervened to save his life. Campos violently resisted the security staff and continued to attempt to take his life," the spokesperson said, adding that he stopped breathing and lost consciousness during the struggle.

DHS said the incident remains under active investigation.

At least 30 people died in ICE custody last year, the highest level in two decades, agency figures show. In the first 10 days of 2026, four immigrants, including Campos, died while in federal immigration custody.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:33:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Putin to discuss Ukraine peace with U.S. envoys after Trump says a deal is reasonably close</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/putin-discuss-ukraine-peace-with-us-envoys-after-trump-says-deal-is-reasonably-2026-01-22/</link><description>MOSCOW, Jan 22 - Russian President Vladimir Putin will on Thursday discuss a possible peace plan for Ukraine with U.S. envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner in Moscow after President Donald Trump said a deal to end the war was "reasonably close".

The United States has held talks with Russia, and separately with Kyiv and European leaders, on various different drafts of a plan for ending the war in Ukraine , but no deal has yet been reached despite Trump's repeated promises to clinch one.

Putin, speaking at a Russian Security Council meeting late on Wednesday, said that he would meet Trump special envoy Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law Kushner in Moscow to "continue dialogue on the Ukrainian settlement" as well as Trump's "Board of Peace" idea and the possibility of using frozen Russian assets.

At stake is how to end the deadliest war in Europe since World War Two, the future of Ukraine, the extent to which European powers are sidelined and whether or not a peace deal brokered by the United States will endure.

"I think I can say that we're reasonably close," Trump said . "We have to get it stopped ... I believe they're at a point now where they can come together and get a deal done.

"And if they don't, they're stupid," Trump said, referring to Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Last week, Trump told Reuters that Zelenskiy was the main impediment to reaching an agreement.

Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022 after eight years of fighting in eastern Ukraine, triggering the biggest confrontation between Moscow and the West since the depths of the Cold War.

Ukraine and European leaders say that Russia cannot be allowed to achieve its aims after what they cast as an imperial-style land grab. If Russia wins, European powers say, then it will one day attack NATO. Moscow says such claims are ridiculous and that it has no intention of attacking a NATO member.

Russia says that European leaders are intent on scuttling the peace talks by introducing conditions that they know will be unacceptable to Russia, which took 12 to 17 square km (4.6-6.6 square miles) of Ukrainian territory per day in 2025.

Putin, who has repeatedly said he is open to discussing peace, casts the war as a watershed moment in relations with the West, which he says humiliated Russia after the Soviet Union fell in 1991 by enlarging NATO and encroaching on what he considers Moscow's sphere of influence.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 06:39:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/AMF2KD55YZMUXFQ6PTQI46NQ6A.jpg?auth=675f7d0d75922598741a8233bba61a36966e8b2d69ff47f8ee0ed45ac5437a78&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Live: Trump pushes to expand 'Board of Peace', challenging UN Security Council</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260122-trump-pushes-to-expand-board-of-peace-challenging-un-security-council</link><description>US President Donald Trump is expected to spotlight his proposed “Board of Peace” at the World Economic Forum, with the White House saying a “charter announcement" will be presented on the sidelines of the conference.

Some 35 countries – including Egypt, UAE and Israel – of the 60 nations that have been invited to join have agreed to sign on to the project. But some, like Norway, Sweden and France, have declined.

The main concern is that the board’s mandate may be too broad and could undermine international order based on the UN Charter.

When asked by a reporter earlier this week if the board should replace the UN, Trump replied that “it might.” He asserted that the world body “hasn’t been very helpful” and “has never lived up to its potential” but also said the UN should continue ”because the potential is so great”.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday he would meet on Thursday with US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner.

Putin said during a meeting of Russia’s Security Council that he would discuss the possible use of frozen Russian assets with the US envoys in connection with recovery work in regions affected by the war, and that he would discuss use of the assets with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, who is scheduled to meet the Russian leader on Thursday.

Putin said as well that Russia’s foreign ministry had been instructed to study US President Donald Trump’s invitation to join his proposed Board of Peace and would reply in due course.

Even before any decision on joining the board, Putin said Moscow was ready to provide $1 billion – as required by Trump for long-term membership – from the frozen assets “in view of Russia’s special relations with the Palestinian people”.

Eight Muslim countries – including Qatar, Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates – accepted the invitation on Wednesday to join the Board of Peace, but reaffirmed their commitment in a joint statement to support its original mission aimed at advancing peace and reconstruction in Gaza and the Palestinians’ right to statehood.

France, a veto-wielding member of the Security Council, has said it will not accept Trump’s invitation, while the three other members with vetoes – Russia, China and Britain – are still assessing it.

As of Wednesday, Norway, Sweden and Slovenia had also declined. Slovenia’s main concern was that the board’s mandate is too broad and it could seriously undermine the international order based on the UN Charter.

The UN Security Council in November authorised the Board of Peace to serve as a transitional body to oversee a US-brokered ceasefire in the Israel–Hamas war in Gaza, as US President Donald Trump proposed. But in forming the board, he has described its role as a mediator for other global conflicts, a potential rival to the UN Security Council.

Retired US ambassador Robert Wood, who served at the US mission to the United Nations under Republican and Democratic leaders, said if Trump is trying to replace the Security Council with a Board of Peace dealing with issues beyond Gaza, “I don’t think there’s going to be a lot of interest”.

Welcome to today's liveblog, where we will be following US President Donald Trump's remarks at the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland.

Denmark's foreign minister said that US President Donald Trump has sent "positive messages" by saying that he would not use military force to seize Greenland.

US President Donald Trump met with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, who said sovereignty over Greenland "did not come up".

President Donald Trump gave notice that the U.S. would quit the organization on the first day of his presidency in 2025, via an executive order. Under U.S. law, it has to give one-year notice and pay all outstanding fees before departure.

On Thursday, a U.S. State Department spokesperson said the WHO's failure to contain, manage and share information had cost the U.S. trillions of dollars and the president had exercised his authority to pause the future transfer of any U.S. government funds, support, or resources to the WHO.

"The American people have paid more than enough to this organization and this economic hit is beyond a down payment on any financial obligations to the organization," the spokesperson said by email.

Over the last year, many global health experts have urged a rethink, including most recently WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.

“I hope the U.S. will reconsider and rejoin WHO,” he told reporters at a press conference earlier this month. “Withdrawing from the WHO is a lose for the United States, and it’s a lose for the rest of the world.”

The WHO also said that the U.S. has not yet paid the fees it owes for 2024 and 2025. Member states are set to discuss the U.S. departure and how it will be handled at the WHO’s executive board in February, a WHO spokesperson told Reuters by email.

“This is a clear violation of U.S. law,” said Lawrence Gostin, founding director of the O’Neill Institute for Global Health Law at Georgetown University in Washington, a close observer of the WHO. “But Trump is highly likely to get away with it.”

Speaking to Reuters at Davos, Bill Gates – chair of the Gates Foundation, a major funder of global health initiatives and some of the WHO’s work – said he did not expect the U.S. to reconsider in the short-term.

“I don’t think the U.S. will be coming back to WHO in the near future,” he said, adding that when he had an opportunity to advocate for it, he would. “The world needs the World Health Organization.”

WHAT THE DEPARTURE MEANS

For the WHO, the departure of the U.S. has sparked a budgetary crisis that has seen it cut its management team in half and scale back work, cutting budgets across the agency. Washington has traditionally been by far the U.N. health agency's biggest financial backer, contributing around 18% of its overall funding. The WHO will also shed around a quarter of its staff by the middle of this year.

The agency said it has been working with the U.S. and sharing information in the last year. It was unclear how the collaboration will work going forward.

Global health experts said this posed risks for the U.S., the WHO and the world.

“The U.S. withdrawal from WHO could weaken the systems and collaborations the world relies on to detect, prevent, and respond to health threats,” said Kelly Henning, public health program lead at Bloomberg Philanthropies, a U.S.-based non-profit.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 07:29:21 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4L6XPSF7I5IUNHEVTY2VBKVNFU.jpg?auth=e5c0772b16cc5f63a02462c633deab70c5f04945d6c71959e1caa97527da6626&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Denmark to discuss Arctic security, seeks respect for territorial integrity</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/denmark-discuss-arctic-security-seeks-respect-territorial-integrity-2026-01-22/</link><description>COPENHAGEN, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said on Thursday that Denmark and Greenland will continue to engage in a constructive dialogue on security in the Arctic, provided that this is done with respect for her country's territorial integrity.

U.S. President Donald Trump abruptly stepped back on Wednesday from threats to impose tariffs as leverage to seize Greenland, ruled out the use of force and suggested a deal was in sight to end a dispute over the Danish territory.

After meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, Trump said Western Arctic allies could forge agreement that satisfies his desire for a "Golden Dome" missile‑defence system and access to minerals while blocking Russia and China's ambitions.

Frederiksen said NATO was fully aware of Denmark's position, and that she had been informed that Rutte's talks did not involve her country's sovereignty.

""Security in the Arctic is a matter for the entire NATO alliance. Therefore, it is good and natural that it is also discussed between NATO's secretary general and the president of the United States," Frederiksen said in a statement.

"The Kingdom of Denmark wishes to continue to engage in a constructive dialogue with allies on how we can strengthen security in the Arctic, including the United States' Golden Dome, provided that this is done with respect for our territorial integrity," she said.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 07:29:43 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/NDQNIWK76ZJ67PO5IDF5OMMJ3Y.jpg?auth=cdf308384220b3055f168e4c1ee24a19f21dc7b29d2d6291d5d621884b24ac5f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia likely to keep trying to damage Baltic Sea infrastructure, Finland says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/russia-likely-keep-trying-damage-baltic-sea-infrastructure-finland-says-2026-01-22/</link><description>HELSINKI, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Russia will "likely persist in its ambitions to damage the undersea infrastructure of the Baltic Sea", Finland's Defence Command said in its annual military intelligence review published on Thursday.

The Baltic Sea region has been on high alert after a string of power cable, telecom link and gas pipeline outages since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. The most recent related incident occurred on New Year's Eve when Finnish authorities seized a cargo vessel en route from Russia to Israel on suspicion of sabotaging an undersea telecoms cable.

NATO has boosted its military presence in the region over the last year with frigates, aircraft and naval drones.

In an interview, Finland's Chief of Intelligence Major General Pekka Turunen said it was clear that Russia had the ability to destroy underwater infrastructure if it wanted, but added that no "smoking gun" had been found to prove Russia or another state actor was behind the recent incidents.

"It is unusual that this (so many incidents) occurs," Turunen said, adding their number had increased significantly since 2023, in comparison with past times.

"The change is real," he said.

Russia has repeatedly denied any involvement in the incidents, and last year conducted its own drills to defend against "underwater saboteurs" in the Baltic Sea.

The number of suspicious security-related incidents have also increased around military personnel and exercises on land in Finland, the Finnish Defence Command said in the review.

"The phenomenon is most likely related to increased vigilance and a lower threshold of reporting, but there is also genuine intelligence-gathering relating to military national defence in these numbers," it said.

Turunen said the incidents had involved drones and some people around military facilities or exercises, but he declined to give further details.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 07:30:31 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ADCOVQDFD5ML3EOBJWHEARRYS4.jpg?auth=fe25263e7e83a937acd158860566de01b1dd38f350b4daaf66d5f02b83684d6a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Poland summons Belarusian diplomat over balloon incursion, report says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/poland-summons-belarusian-diplomat-over-balloon-incursion-report-says-2026-01-22/</link><description>WARSAW, Jan 22 (Reuters) - The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs summoned the Belarusian charge d'affaires regarding last week's airspace breech by objects identified as smuggling balloons, national news agency PAP said on Wednesday evening, citing a ministry spokesman.

Polish police said on Saturday it was informed by the army that unidentified flying objects, most likely smuggling balloons, had entered Polish airspace from the territory of Belarus overnight and that police had retrieved the remains of balloons along with illegal cigarettes in north-eastern Poland.

"The Charge d'Affaires could not answer us regarding the Belarusian side's role in this (procedure), but we question the fact that the Belarusian side has no knowledge of or influence over such a number of these actions," the ministry spokesman was quoted by PAP as saying.

"He was also reminded that continuing such behaviour will have consequences, but we do not discuss the details of this matter publicly."

In Lithuania , smuggling balloons drifting over the Belarusian border have forced repeated shutdowns at the airport in the capital Vilnius, in what authorities call a "hybrid attack" by Belarus, a Kremlin ally. In December Lithuania declared a state of emergency due to the incursions.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 07:30:52 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item></channel></rss>
